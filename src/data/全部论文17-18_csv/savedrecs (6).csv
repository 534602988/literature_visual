We contribute to this literature by considering the dual roles of confidence in one's abilities and noncognitive skills and characteristics in predicting several subsequent MBA program and employment outcomes among a sample of GMAT test takers, with a focus on identifying possible gender differences in these relationships. Self-reported noncognitive skills correlate similarly for men's and women's managerial, earnings and employment satisfaction outcomes. In contrast, though, distinct gender differences emerge regarding perceptions of one's mathematical and verbal ability with confidence in quantitative ability especially associated with men's and confidence in verbal ability mainly associated with women's outcomes. Non-linearity analysis reveals that lower earnings are correlated with men who have low confidence in their quantitative ability and with women who have high confidence in their verbal ability.

We provide sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of equilibria with a given set of active players with any strictly increasing utility functions and characterize the players' equilibrium mixed strategies. Assuming that players can be ordered by their risk aversion (player a is more risk-averse than player b, if whenever player b prefers a certain payment over a given lottery, so does player a), we find that in equilibrium, the more risk-averse players either bid higher than the less risk-averse players and win with higher ex-ante probability - or they drop out. Furthermore, while each player's expected bid decreases with the other players' risk aversion, her expected bid increases with her own risk aversion. Thus, increasing a player's risk aversion creates two opposing effects on total expected bid. A sufficient condition for the total expected bid to decrease with a player's risk aversion is that this player is relatively more risk-averse compared to the rest of the players. Our findings have important implications for the literature on gender differences in competitiveness and for gender diversity in firms that use personnel contests for promotions.

We apply model-based clustering to detect major energy profiles and their compositional dynamics. The seven identified clusters show typical combinations of energy carriers dominating the primary energy consumption of a country. We find that countries tend to take a path towards higher quality energy mixes over time, however path inertia and dependencies arise from both infrastructure and resource endowments. Higher energy quality profiles are usually associated with higher national income and energy use per capita, providing some evidence of the existence of a national-level energy ladder. We also find convergence in energy intensity over time, and a relationship between a country's own resources and import dependency. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We do not ask how the burden was actually split in each country examined but how the burden should have been shared among different income groups of society. In order to answer this question, a questionnaire-experimental investigation was run among students from Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain. Our study offered the students seven different schemes of taxation amongst which we had specified a proportional rule and two progressive schemes of differing severity. A key result within our investigation is the finding that a large majority of students in all countries involved rarely opted for a proportional rule of burden sharing but picked one of the two progressive schemes instead. However, there were differences between countries with respect to the frequencies of these three rules, whereby Greece and Ireland were polar cases. The other rules received only minor support.","[Gaertner, Wulf] Univ Osnabruck, Dept Econ, Rolandstr 8, D-49069 Osnabruck, Germany; [Gaertner, Wulf] London Sch Econ, CPNSS, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Schwettmann, Lars] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen GmbH, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Postfach 1129, D-85758 Neuherberg, Germany; [Schwettmann, Lars] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Dept Econ, Univ Ring 3, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany",University Osnabruck; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Schwettmann, L (通讯作者)，Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen GmbH, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Postfach 1129, D-85758 Neuherberg, Germany.;Schwettmann, L (通讯作者)，Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Dept Econ, Univ Ring 3, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany.",lars.schwettmann@helmholtz-muenchen.de,,"Schwettmann, Lars/0000-0003-0935-6989",,,,,25,7,7,0,2,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

A symmetric equilibrium exists with the different firms sharing the market. I show that this does not hold if we preserve the symmetry between firms but introduce moral hazard with a customer-sensitive probability of exposure; competition necessarily results in a natural monopoly with only one active firm.

(2007, Econometrica, vol. 75, pp. 781-836). We first apply business cycle accounting with two labor types of supply to the Japanese economy and find that the difference between the male and female labor wedges has been decreasing. We then prove that our prototype model comprising male and female labor supply concurs with other detailed models that include frictions on female labor supply and that decompose the labor wedges by gender into these frictions. Based on the data, the frictions from the difference in labor productivity, home production, and discrimination are consistent with the female labor wedge from the prototype model. Moreover, we conduct a counterfactual experiment in which the female labor wedge is equal to the male wedge to estimate the welfare gains. The result shows that the welfare gains are approximately equal to a 1.44% increase in consumption. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

To address this issue, a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model that features agents' infrequent information updating as well as nominal rigidities is fit to U.S. data. We find that the survey disagreement shares two pivotal characteristics with its model-based counterparts: (i) disagreement can be predicted by agents' average forecast revisions reflecting the arrival of shocks; and (ii) disagreement exhibits a U-shaped relationship against the deviation of output growth from its steady state. These features arise because the arrival of new information elevates disagreement among informed and uninformed agents. Our findings indicate a substantial degree of infrequent information updating in the survey disagreement. The existing literature often uses survey disagreement as a proxy for macroeconomic uncertainty, but our finding suggests that it is unlikely to be an appropriate measure.","[Hur, Joonyoung] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Div Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Insu] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Hankuk University Foreign Studies; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Kim, I (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",joonyhur@gmail.com; insu.kim@skku.edu,,,Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund; National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A5B8060964],Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund; National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),"Earlier versions were circulated under the title Sticky Information and Disagreement about Economic Activity.

We manipulate the pairs' gender compositions to analyze whether an individual's performance and sanctioning behavior depend on his or her gender and the gender of his or her partner, which is revealed to the subjects at the beginning of the experiment. The data show that, conditional on under performance, women are sanctioned more often and more heavily than men; however, if they are sanctioned, men tend to improve their performances, while women's performances do not change.","[Jung, SeEun] Inha Univ, Dept Econ, Incheon, South Korea; [Vranceanu, Radu] ESSEC Business Sch, Econ Dept, PB 50105, F-95021 Cergy, France; [Vranceanu, Radu] THEMA, PB 50105, F-95021 Cergy, France",Inha University; ESSEC Business School; Universite de Bourgogne,"Vranceanu, R (通讯作者)，ESSEC Business Sch, Econ Dept, PB 50105, F-95021 Cergy, France.;Vranceanu, R (通讯作者)，THEMA, PB 50105, F-95021 Cergy, France.",jse@inha.ac.kr; vranceanu@essec.fr,,"Vranceanu, Radu/0000-0003-2050-8269",ESSEC Research Center; ESSEC Alumni Foundation,ESSEC Research Center; ESSEC Alumni Foundation,"This project was carried out within the research framework of the Labex MME-DII (http://labex-mme-dii.u-cergy.fr).

We investigate how pension eligibility affects labor supply in couples. Inspired by a theoretical framework, we measure how the sharp change in the pension eligibility of both partners affects labor force participation. We find that both partners leave the labor force as they become eligible for a pension. The effect of their own pension eligibility is 12 percentage points for women and 28 percentage points for men. Women also reduce their labor force participation by 2 to 3 percentage points as their partner reaches pension eligibility. For men, the effect of their partner's eligibility is smaller and not significantly different from zero. For women and men with low education, the effect of their own eligibility is strong. Regardless of education level, the partner eligibility effect is strong in homogamous couples. Studying joint labor supply, we find that pension eligibility reduces labor supply in couples by 44 percentage points, approximately 4 percentage points more than in a model that ignores partner eligibility effects.","[Lalive, Rafael] Univ Lausanne, Dept Econ, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Lalive, Rafael] CEPR, London, England; [Lalive, Rafael] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Lalive, Rafael; Parrotta, Pierpaolo] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Parrotta, Pierpaolo] ICN Business Sch, Dept Human Resource Management & Org Behav, 13 Rue Michel Ney, F-54000 Nancy, France; [Parrotta, Pierpaolo] BETA, Aubagne, France; [Parrotta, Pierpaolo] ROA, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Lausanne; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Ifo Institut; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Lalive, R (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, Dept Econ, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.;Lalive, R (通讯作者)，CEPR, London, England.;Lalive, R (通讯作者)，CESifo, Munich, Germany.;Lalive, R (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.",Rafael.Lalive@unil.ch; pierpaolo.parrotta@icn-groupe.fr,"Parrotta, Pierpaolo/AAI-1412-2021","Lalive, Rafael/0000-0003-1938-692X",Swiss NCCR LIVES; Carlsberg Foundation [2010-01-0111],Swiss NCCR LIVES; Carlsberg Foundation(Carlsberg Foundation),"We appreciate helpful comments by two referees and the Associate Editor, Andrea Weber.

Increasing search makes consumers reject offers for the manufacturer's and competitors' products more often, and I show that both consumers and the manufacturer prefer more search when the production cost is low and less search when it is high.

In new institutional economics, the concept of 'voids' is suggested to describe the absence of market-based institutions. In reality, however, 'institutional fabrics' are always and necessarily complex and rich in institutions. No societal sphere is institutionally void. In this article, we contribute to existing literature on entrepreneurship and institutional economics by presenting a framework for studying the richness and complexities of institutional fabrics, as well as ways in which entrepreneurs respond to institutions. Distinguishing four types of institutions relevant for entrepreneurs, we analyze case study data from Ethiopia, and discuss how 'tensions' between potentially incompatible institutions result in behavioral frictions. Some entrepreneurs play the complex institutional environment and benefit from the tensions in it, whereas others may drown into the institutional 'swamp' they face. Policy makers should acknowledge that institutions not only result from formal policy making and that in many cases a diverse set of institutions is needed to facilitate market exchange and solve constraining tensions. The diversity that results from initiatives of institutional entrepreneurs may create a more effective institutional environment for development.","[Olthaar, Matthias] Stenden Univ Appl Sci, Van Schaikweg 94, NL-7811 KL Emmen, Netherlands; [Dolfsma, Wilfred] Loughborough Univ London, Waterden Rd, London E20 3BS, England; [Lutz, Clemens; Noseleit, Florian] Univ Groningen, Sch Econ & Business, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands",Loughborough University; University of Groningen,"Olthaar, M (通讯作者)，Stenden Univ Appl Sci, Van Schaikweg 94, NL-7811 KL Emmen, Netherlands.",matthias.olthaar@stenden.com; w.a.dolfsma@lboro.ac.uk; c.h.m.lutz@rug.nl; f.noseleit@rug.nl,"Noseleit, Florian/AAX-7933-2020","Noseleit, Florian/0000-0002-9881-9334",,,,,58,18,18,2,26,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

We show that market completeness allows agents to smooth consumption across states of nature, but not across time; as a result initial differences in beliefs induce persistent consumption imbalances that are not grounded in fundamentals. In some cases, these imbalances are not sustainable forever: the debt of one agent would grow unboundedly, and binding borrowing limits are necessary to prevent Ponzi schemes. Finally, we find that if a rational social planner attaches fixed Pareto weights to different individuals, financial autarky might be welfare superior to complete markets.

Still little evidence has been presented for emerging, small open economies facing persistently low inflation. In this paper I address this issue through rigorous estimation of a substantial number of stylized, open-economy hybrid new Keynesian Phillips curves for Poland. I find robust evidence of the flattening of the Phillips curve and the rising impact of external factors for both headline and core inflation. I conclude that during excessive disinflation in Poland the flattening of the Phillips curve can be partly explained by the underutilization of labour, whereas the stronger impact of global factors on core inflation suggests strengthening indirect effects. The changes in the estimated parameters indicate that the macroeconomic cost of bringing inflation back to the desired target has increased. Further identification of the reasons behind the flattening of the Phillips curve in an emerging, small open economy should provide useful insights for monetary policy.","[Szafranek, Karol] Narodowy Bank Polski, Warsaw Sch Econ, Swietokrzyska St 11-21, PL-00919 Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics; Narodowy Bank Polski,"Szafranek, K (通讯作者)，Narodowy Bank Polski, Warsaw Sch Econ, Swietokrzyska St 11-21, PL-00919 Warsaw, Poland.",Karol.Szafranek@nbp.pl,,"Szafranek, Karol/0000-0003-4565-4529",,,,,72,16,16,2,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

In the metric of subjective well-being, research has shown that green behavior and sustainable consumption are positively related to life satisfaction. We extend this research analyzing UKHLS household panel data for Great Britain, showing that this boost in life satisfaction is mostly due to self-image (i.e. one's own assessment of how environmentally-friendly one's behavior is) but not due to concrete pro-environmental behaviors such as conserving water, recycling and so on. We further show that green self-image increases the extent and intensity of green behavior yet even the greenest (self-identified) individuals do not consistently exhibit all pro-environmental behaviors.

A borrower has private information about her endowment, and a lender uses random contracts to screen different types of borrowers. In equilibrium, some borrowers choose not to repay and thus become delinquent. The lender renegotiates with some delinquent borrowers. In the absence of renegotiation, delinquency leads to bankruptcy. Applied to mortgage restructuring, our mechanism generates amplification of house-price shocks through foreclosure spillovers.

It considers a game between two political parties that have to bargain over which policy to implement. While bargaining, the parties' popularity varies over time. Changes in popularity are partly exogenous and partly driven by the parties' actions. There is an election scheduled at a future date and the party with more popularity at the election date wins the vote. Electoral incentives can have substantial effects on bargaining outcomes.

This paper studies optimal self-protection in a two-period model with endogenous saving. In a setting with a binary loss we show that prudence is negatively associated with the optimal level of self-protection, consistent with results obtained in single-period models. We provide intuition for this finding with the help of a recent approach based on stochastic dominance. Furthermore, we determine the effect of interest rate risk on optimal self-protection and study a model in which a decision-maker engages in advance effort to increase the probability of facing a better risky situation. All our results suggest that the understanding of advance self-protection crucially hinges on whether the decision-maker also uses saving to optimize intertemporal consumption utility. If so, the fact that self-protection expenditures are upfront turns out to be irrelevant. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A transmission system planner, who is in charge of making TEP decisions, requires considering the future generation investment actions. However, in such an oligopolistic market, each producer makes its own strategic generation investment decisions. This motivates the transmission system planner to consider the generation investment decision-making problem of all producers within its TEP model. The strategic generation investment problem of each producer can be represented by a complementarity bi-level model. The joint consideration of all bi-level models, one per producer, characterizes the generation investment equilibrium that identifies the future evolution of generation investment in the market. This paper proposes a tri-level TEP decision-making model to be solved by the transmission system planner, whose objective is to maximize the social welfare of the market minus the expansion costs, and whose constraints are the transmission expansion limits as well as the generation investment equilibrium problem. This model is then recast as a mixed-integer linear programming problem and solved. Numerical results from an illustrative example and a case study based on the IEEE 14-bus test system demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Firms choose research effort and whether to patent innovations or to use an Open Source license like the General Public License. We show that (i) patents generate a larger stationary reward but foreclose research within a sector, and that (ii) Open Source generates a smaller stationary reward but allows everyone to use the technology, and therefore, by attracting firms to the sector, it induces a faster pace of innovation. We characterize all the equilibria of the model and show that in equilibrium an Open Source sector appears only after a proprietary sector. We also find conditions under which the model has a unique equilibrium, in which a proprietary and an Open Source sector coexist and compete in the short run, but the Open Source sector dominates the industry in the long run. We use our model to study whether patents are inefficient, and to explain firms' behavior in the software and the biomedical industry. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The autocrat's decisions consist of two measures both capable of antagonizing religious clerics: adopting secular reforms and unduly appropriating part of the national wealth, which generally are complements. Compared to centralized religions, decentralized religions, such as Islam, tend to discourage secular reforms and corruption but those effects are not guaranteed if the autocrat accepts political instability.

Candidates choose ideological positions so as to maximize their support in society. Convergent Nash equilibria in which all candidates adopt the same policy were characterized by Cox (1987). Here, we investigate nonconvergent equilibria, where candidates adopt divergent policies. We identify a number of classes of scoring rules exhibiting a range of different equilibrium properties. For some of these, nonconvergent equilibria do not exist. For others, nonconvergent equilibria in which candidates cluster at positions spread across the issue space are observed. In particular, we prove that the class of convex rules does not have Nash equilibria (convergent or nonconvergent) with the exception of some derivatives of Borda rule. We also look at two-party equilibria.

Here Keynes raised an important question: will consumption always continue to expand in the same manner as it has in the previous two centuries? If so, how? This paper critically reviews a body of work that has adopted the Learning To Consume (LTC) approach to study the long run growth of consumption (Witt 2001). By borrowing certain established insights from psychology and biology about how consumers learn and what motivates them to consume, it highlights how rising income, new technologies and market competition have combined to trigger important changes in both the underlying set of needs possessed by consumers and how they learn to satisfy these needs.

Prior research has found significant effects of tax rates in affiliate and parent countries on the profit shifting behavior of multinational entities, with semi-elasticities ranging from close to zero to well above one. We build on this prior work by allowing more heterogeneity in response across the distribution of tax rates and by including affiliates located in tax havens around the world. Our findings suggest that elasticities based on a log-linear specification may severely understate the sensitivity of profits to tax in low-tax jurisdictions while simultaneously overstating this elasticity in high-tax jurisdictions. Accounting for this type of nonlinearity appears crucial in considering how the global allocation of firm profits might change in response to tax rate changes.

Although misconduct comprises all actions that are contrary to the interest of the organizer, it is not necessarily the case that it is optimal to prohibit all such behavior. In this paper, we determine the equilibrium level of misconduct chosen by players in a symmetric rank-order tournament between two competitors in which the organizer tolerates some level of misconduct. In addition to showing that zero tolerance may not minimize the level of misconduct in equilibrium, we show that there exists a range of tolerated misconduct where a symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium exists with players cheating (i.e., misconduct above the tolerated level) with some probability. When the gain from misconduct is uncertain and unknown the contest organizer faces a tradeoff: tolerating more misconduct will reduce such behavior when the state of temptation is high, but increase it when temptation is low.

Based on a panel dataset of Chinese firms, we find the effects of the Innovation Fund for Small and Medium Technology Based Firms (Innofund) are dynamic over time and are heterogeneous depending on funding forms and the level of marketization and economic development across regions. In general, Innfound has significant and positive effects on firm productivity in both the short and long run. However, the short-term effects of Innofund are stronger than the long-term ones. Additionally, the positive effects of Innofund are stronger for firms backed by interest-free bank loans than those supported by appropriation. Meanwhile, Innofund has stronger positive effects in provinces that are less market-oriented or less developed economically. Finally, the short-term effects of Innofund stay stronger than the long-term ones even after we control the funding forms and the market conditions across regions. Identification and selection concerns are addressed through the propensity score matching approach and two-stage estimation.

The model is estimated with likelihood methods on a U.S. data set that includes the Survey of Professional Forecasters as a measure of price setters' inflation expectations. This model improves upon existing perfect information models in explaining why, in the data, inflation expectations respond with delays to monetary impulses and remain disanchored for years. In the 1970s, U.S. monetary policy is found to signal-persistent inflationary shocks, explaining why inflation and inflation expectations were so persistently heightened. The signalling effects of monetary policy also explain why inflation expectations adjusted more sluggishly than inflation after the robust monetary tightening of the 1980s.","[Melosi, Leonardo] Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Chicago, IL 60604 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Chicago,"Melosi, L (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.",,,,,,,,76,94,110,3,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

This study explores Amazon's dynamic pricing strategy by comparing its contemporary pricing on e-books, a relatively new product with complementary hardware and switching costs, with its pricing on physical books, a now-mature product without complementary hardware or switching costs. Using over 150,000 hourly observations on prices and sales ranks for electronic and physical bestseller books between 2012 and 2013, in conjunction with actual quantity data, we estimate the price elasticities of demand for books at Amazon. Despite inherent challenges in data availability and measurement, we find it surprising that both electronic and physical book prices fall substantially short of the static profit maximizing level two decades after Amazon's launch. These findings raise questions for both policymakers and shareholders.","[Reimers, Imke] Northeastern Univ, Dept Econ, 304 Lake Hall,360 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Waldfogel, Joel] Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, 321 19th Ave South, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",Northeastern University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Reimers, I (通讯作者)，Northeastern Univ, Dept Econ, 304 Lake Hall,360 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",i.reimers@northeastern.edu; jwaldfog@umn.edu,"Reimers, Imke/JVD-5330-2023; Waldfogel, Joel/A-4916-2015","Waldfogel, Joel/0000-0002-8040-7227",,,,,10,10,13,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

By adopting a historical perspective, I show that Scitovsky and Frey's works were rather the result of two specific episodes in economics : the revived interest in actual needs and desires for the first and the expansionist ambitions of economists for the second. The behaviors they considered and the interpretations they respectively proposed for intrinsic motivation illustrate the influence of these two episodes.

At the global level, the effectiveness of the Montreal Protocol on reducing ozone depleters is contrasted with the ineffectiveness of the Kyoto Protocol on curbing greenhouse gases (GHGs). Even though curbing ozone shield depletion and reducing GHGs are quintessential global public goods, the outcomes of these treaties are drastically different. This paper explores why. At the regional level, the success of the Helsinki Protocol on reducing sulfur emissions is contrasted with the slower and less profound success of the Sofia Protocol on limiting nitrogen oxides. These paired comparisons demonstrate how effective international cooperation transcends the properties of public goods, thereby encompassing other identified drivers. The paper also contrasts the regional and global paired treaties.

Our analysis reveals that the existence of a family business, which is highly labor-demanding, appears to be associated with parental decisions concerning the number of children. Since parental authority, in Roma families, holds sway over children even after their own marriage, the future labor contributions of children are particularly beneficial to the family business.","[Aisa, Rosa; Andaluz, Joaquin; Larramona, Gemma] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Anal Econ, Zaragoza, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Larramona, G (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Anal Econ, Zaragoza, Spain.",raisa@unizar.es; jandaluz@unizar.es; gemmalar@unizar.es,"Rived, Rosa María Aisa/H-2182-2015; Larramona, Gemma/D-8044-2014; Andaluz, Joaquín/ABI-6201-2020","Rived, Rosa María Aisa/0000-0003-4368-2294;",Spanish Ministry of Economics [ECO2012-34828],Spanish Ministry of Economics(Spanish Government),Fundacion Secretariado Gitano and financial support from Spanish Ministry of Economics (ECO2012-34828 project) are acknowledged.,,31,3,3,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

The Public Procurement Act mentions fair competition as one of the fundamental principles. Both contractors and contracting entities are subject to this principle. In practice, however, it is very often violated in connection with a number of phenomena resulting from imperfections of the aforementioned system. Purpose of the article: The purpose of this article is to identify the most important solutions to support the development of competition in the economy through the public procurement system, as well as to examine the obstacles and risks carried by the system itself. Another purpose is to present further action proposals based on research - actions affecting the development of competition and at the same time improving the efficiency of tenders. Methods: The article is based on the analysis of literature and on a questionnaire. The survey was conducted electronically (as contractors. Purposeful sampling was implemented to ensure reliable and expert replies. The study was carried out in the first half of 2016. Findings & Value added: The results indicate the most important solutions supporting the development of competition. They include the following: facilitating access to information about orders, improving the efficiency of state authorities in detecting collusive tendering, reducing the possibility of using the potential of third parties, and increasing the availability of data on tender results. The solutions presented in this article are evolutionary rather than revolutionary, and point primarily to the ability to streamline existing procedures and regulations and not to replace them with new ones. They should also help to improve the functioning of public procurement system in Poland, which is of great importance for the development of competition in domestic economy.CAWI). The questionnaire was sent to 300 entities required to apply the provisions of the Public Procurement Law throughout the country.

The resource replenishes fully but collapses irreversibly if the total use exceeds a threshold. The threshold is assumed to be constant, but its location may be unknown. Consequently, an experiment to increase the level of safe resource use will only reveal whether the threshold has been crossed or not. If the consequence of crossing the threshold is disastrous (i.e., independent of how far the threshold has been exceeded), it is individually and socially optimal to update beliefs about the threshold's location at most once. The threat of a disastrous regime thereby facilitates coordination on a cautious equilibrium. If the initial safe level is sufficiently valuable, the equilibrium implies no experimentation and coincides with the first-best resource use. The less valuable the initial safe value, the more the agents will experiment. For sufficiently low initial values, immediate depletion of the resource is the only equilibrium. When the regime shift is not disastrous, but the damage depends on how far threshold has been exceeded, experimentation may be gradual.

This finding may be related to herding behavior of stock investors during periods of market stress.","[Ferrando, Laura; Ferrer, Roman] Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Financiera & Actuarial, Valencia, Spain; [Jareno, Francisco] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac CC Econ & Empresariales, Dept Anal Econ & Finanzas, Ciudad Real, Spain",University of Valencia; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Ferrando, L (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Financiera & Actuarial, Valencia, Spain.",,"Jareño, Francisco/AAO-8995-2020; Jareño, Francisco/L-7645-2014","Jareño, Francisco/0000-0001-9778-7345; Jareño, Francisco/0000-0001-9778-7345; Ferrer, Roman/0000-0003-0275-0596",Fundacion Ramon Areces,Fundacion Ramon Areces,"The authors would like to express their gratitude to Rafael Benitez, Alberto Diaz, J.

In a simple model of capital flows and controls, we show that inflow restrictions distort international capital flows to other countries and that, in turn, such capital flow deflection may lead to a policy response. We then test the theory using data on inflow restrictions and gross capital inflows for a large sample of developing countries between 1995 and 2009. Our estimation yields strong evidence that capital controls deflect capital flows to other countries with similar economic characteristics. Notwithstanding these strong cross-border spillover effects, we do not find evidence of a policy response. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Most existing derivative pricing approaches involve the selection of a suitable martingale measure or the optimisation of utility functions as well as risk measures from the perspective of a single trader. We propose a new and effective derivative pricing method, referred to as the equal risk pricing approach, for markets with convex trading constraints. The approach analyses the risk exposure of both the buyer and seller of the derivative, and seeks an equal risk price which evenly distributes the expected loss for both parties under optimal hedging. The existence and uniqueness of the equal risk price are established for both European and American options. Furthermore, if the trading constraints are removed, the equal risk price agrees with the standard arbitrage-free price. Finally, the equal risk pricing approach is applied to a constrained BlackScholes market model where short selling is banned. In particular, simple pricing formulas are derived for European calls, European puts and American puts. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Some of these are standard: assets and money are imperfect substitutes, asset demand curves slope down, and money is not always neutral.

This requires not only information relating to the costs of medical interventions, but also the benefits of such interventions on individual's overall well-being. In order to calculate the well-being losses associated with health conditions, this study uses the compensating income variation approach (CIV), to calculate the amount of extra equivalent household income to make someone who suffers from one of 15 health conditions, as well off in terms of life satisfaction as someone who does not have these health conditions. To help put these findings into perspective, this study also calculates CIVs for many other factors commonly found to be significantly associated with subjective well-being (e.g. unemployment, widowhood, separation and indicators of social capital). This paper builds on previous work using CIVs in health by addressing the issue of income endogeneity in life satisfaction and also testing how robust the derived CIVs are to the inclusion of personality measures, namely the Big Five personality traits. The analysis suggests that health conditions significantly affect individual's quality of life and that the amount needed to make someone with a health condition as well off as someone without those health conditions can be substantive, albeit less than is commonly reported in the literature using the CIV approach to date.

Although a vast literature has illustrated that open or more liberalised economies grow faster, the specific factors that promote this process have only recently begun to be investigated. We belive that there is a non-linear relationship between trade and growth, with the impact depending on a number of macroeconomic factors, i.e. the magnitude and even the direction of the effect of trade on economic performance might depend on other macroeconomic variables. Within this framework, our study aims to investigate the possible non-linearity in the trade-growth relationship, with a special focus on the financial deepening level for the selected Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. Unlike the existing empirical literature on trade-growth nexus for the CEE economies, we utilise threshold regression techniques, where we allow the size and direction of the impact of trade on growth to differ between regimes, conditioning on the financial deepening level of these countries. Regarding credit growth and investment/credit ratio as thresholds, the countries in the upper regime benefit significantly more from trade.","[Iyidogan, Pelin Varol; Dalgic, Basak; Akbulut, Hale] Hacettepe Univ, Dept Publ Finance, Beytepe Campus, Ankara, Turkey",Hacettepe University,"Iyidogan, PV (通讯作者)，Hacettepe Univ, Dept Publ Finance, Beytepe Campus, Ankara, Turkey.",pelinv@hacettepe.edu.tr; basakcakar@hacettepe.edu.tr; halepehlivan@hacettepe.edu.tr,"AKBULUT, HALE/J-1253-2013","AKBULUT, HALE/0000-0001-5768-6427",,,,,50,2,3,0,16,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

The analysis focuses on the WTO Customs Valuation Agreement (CVA) which limits the discretion of customs officials when it comes to assessing the price of imports. While prior to the WTO accession customs officials are free to use their own judgment or apply minimum or reference prices, after their country joined the WTO they are mandated to accept the invoice price issued by the exporter. If customs officials enjoy discretion with respect to assessing the import price, they may assist importers with tariff evasion in exchange for bribes. Removing such discretion limits their ability to facilitate misrepresentation of import prices. Using data on 15 countries which joined the WTO between 1996 and 2008, we find a positive relationship between underreporting of import prices and the tariff rate, which is expected as the incentive to evade increases with the tariff rate. Importantly, this relationship disappears after a country joins the WTO. This result is consistent with the CVA closing one channel for corrupt behavior. However, we also find that changes to customs valuation procedures induce importers to seek alternative ways of tariff evasion, such as underreporting of quantities and product misclassification. The overall level of evasion remains unchanged.","[Javorcik, Beata S.] Univ Oxford, CEPR, Manor Rd Bldg,Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [Javorcik, Beata S.] Univ Oxford, CESifo, Manor Rd Bldg,Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [Narciso, Gaia] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Arts Bldg, Dublin 2, Ireland",University of Oxford; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of Oxford; Trinity College Dublin,"Javorcik, BS (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, CEPR, Manor Rd Bldg,Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.;Javorcik, BS (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, CESifo, Manor Rd Bldg,Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",beata.javorcik@economics.ox.ac.uk; narcisog@tcd.ie,"Narciso, Gaia/AAB-2955-2022","Narciso, Gaia/0000-0003-3532-6337",,,,,32,18,18,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

Such a rapid surge in skill supply should suppress college wages and lower wage income inequality. Instead, wage inequality rose 7 percent since 1978. We show that the surge of weaker college graduates made them poor substitutes for better-trained college graduates and led to an increase in wage inequality within skill groups. Rising wage inequality due to increased variation in the quality of young college graduates added another source of inequality to the Taiwan labor market. The Taiwan case shows that increasing college access alone will not lower inequality.","[Keng, Shao-Hsun] Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Lin, Chun-Hung] Tamkang Univ, New Taipei, Taiwan; [Orazem, Peter F.] Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA USA",National University Kaohsiung; Tamkang University; Iowa State University,"Keng, SH (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",,"Keng, Shao-Hsun/W-6172-2019; Orazem, Peter/D-6525-2016","Keng, Shao-Hsun/0000-0002-7153-5892; Orazem, Peter/0000-0003-2092-5089",Ministry of Science and Technology [103-2410-H-001-MY2],Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government),We thank the Ministry of Science and Technology for its generous financial support (103-2410-H-001-MY2).

The progressive increase in market concentration, especially in the banking sector, is caused by various reasons. Purpose of the article: The purpose of this article is to compare the tendencies within market structures in few countries which origin from similar political systems and which have got experience in transformation of banking sectors. Methods: The research concerns the Baltic and the Western Balkan States. Concentration of the banking sectors, as measured by both HHI and CR5 indices changed during the quoted period, as a result of the consolidation of the sector. The study revealed a distinct change in the growth rate of market concentration and the number of banks, and is based on data provided by the local central banks and the European Central Bank. Findings & Value added: The situation in banking sectors in the Western Balkans differed significantly, which could be explained by strong economic ties, particularly with Germany and Austria. In this region, the raising concentration of the banking markets is related to the decreasing number of banks, while in the Sea Baltic States the increasing number of institutions is accomplished by the falling concentration ratio.

These empirical findings enable us to undertake a scenario analysis focusing on the renminbi's potential to become a global reserve currency. Based on this quantitative research, we then revisit China's policy initiatives designed to promote its currency overseas. In our view, the internationalization of the renminbi, along with financial deepening and liberalization, should be regarded as a means to achieve China's goal of reaching a more sustainable and balanced model of development.","[Li, Cheng] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiaojing] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Acad Div Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Li, C (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",licheng@cass.org.cn; xjzhang@neri.org.cn,,,China Scholarship Council [201404920002]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71603275],China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Cheng Li (corresponding author), Associate Professor, Institute of Economics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, China.

A key component of household liabilities is mortgage debt and with many countries experiencing persistent increases in house prices from the mid-1990s, a marked increase in this aspect of household leverage was observed. While aggregate statistics across countries confirm reductions in personal debt levels in recent years, relatively few sources of micro data are available to examine the nature of the deleveraging process at the household level. In this paper, using a unique dataset, we examine deleveraging amongst a representative sample of mortgaged Irish households. We identify the characteristics of households engaged in deleveraging and find that it is those households who can afford to deleverage who do. Furthermore we find some tentative evidence to suggest that the decision to deleverage has negative implications for household consumption.","[McCarthy, Yvonne] Cent Bank Ireland, POB 11517,North Wall Quay, Dublin 1, Ireland; [McQuinn, Kieran] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland",European Central Bank; Central Bank of Ireland; Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI),"McCarthy, Y (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Ireland, POB 11517,North Wall Quay, Dublin 1, Ireland.",yvonne.mccarthy@centralbank.ie,"McQuinn, Kieran/JCE-1122-2023","McQuinn, Kieran/0000-0003-0246-8179",,,,,19,7,8,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Simply offering a menu of contracts is, in general, not optimal. I characterize optimal mediated contracts, determine conditions for when auditing is profitable, and analyze contractual distortions.

Hodgson's comprehensive analysis of the intellectual history and practical development of the capitalist system in Western Europe and North America. Given the breadth and depth of Professor Hodgson's reading in political economy and his reflections on its implications for the present and future of global capitalism, his book deserves to be widely read. Labeling his approach legal institutionalism, he argues that a legal system that supports capitalism and the market is necessary but not sufficient to sustain a fair and efficient economic system. The state makes efficient markets possible, but it must also deal with the inevitable tensions and the fundamental asymmetry between labor and capital. Tensions arise because labor cannot be used as collateral for the loans that are needed for largescale capitalist enterprise. Hodgson has not developed the political implications of his conclusions in any detail, but his work ought to inspire research that explores the implications of his arguments for ongoing projects of nation building.","[Rose-Ackerman, Susan] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University,"Rose-Ackerman, S (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",,,,,,,,17,1,1,1,21,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

However, relative to their Catholic counterparts, Protestants do appear to work longer hours. The patterns in the data are difficult to reconcile with explanations based on institutional factors or religious differences in human capital acquisition. Religious differences in individuals' values, however, can account for most of the estimated effects. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Manipulating both the value of the outside option, and its relative distribution among the partners, we examine the behavior of human subjects in a repeated prisoners' dilemma. In particular, we examine the degree of cooperation and the form of punishments used. Our findings indicate that cooperation rates are broadly unaffected by the value of the common outside option, but that the selection of supporting punishments in-relationship defections or walking-away are dictated by individual rationality. In contrast to the symmetric results, when outside options for partners are asymmetric we find stark selection effects over cooperation, with the potential for very high and very low efficiency, dependent on the precise division rule.

Using the Medicare Part B Fee-for-Service (FFS) Physician Utilization and Payment Data in 2012 and 2013 released by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, we construct estimates for physicians' hours spent on Medicare beneficiaries. We find that about 2,300 physicians, representing about 3 percent of those with 20 or more hours of Medicare Part B FFS services, have billed Medicare over 100 hours per week.

Some empirical evidence,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS & CONTROL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Non-linearity; Fat tails; Bayesian VAR; Density forecasting,CREDIT REGIMES; TRANSMISSION,"A small-scale vector autoregression (VAR) is used to shed some light on the roles of extreme shocks and non-linearities during stress events observed in the economy. The model focuses on the link between credit/financial markets and the real economy and is estimated on US quarterly data for the period 1984-2013. Extreme shocks are accounted for by assuming t-distributed reduced-form shocks. Non-linearity is allowed by the possibility of regime switch in the shock propagation mechanism. Strong evidence for fat tails in error distributions is found. Moreover, the results suggest that accounting for extreme shocks rather than explicit modeling of non-linearity contributes to the explanatory power of the model. Finally, it is shown that the accuracy of density forecasts improves if non-linearities and shock distributions with fat tails are considered. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

By embedding the HP filter in an unobserved components model, we show that this difference arises due to differences in the way the stochastic trend is modeled. Moreover, the HP filter implies that the cyclical components are serially independent an assumption that is decidedly rejected by the data. By relaxing this restrictive assumption, the augmented HP filter provides comparable model fit relative to the standard correlated unobserved components model. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Our findings indicate that (i) across EU member states the impact of government spending on economic performance is larger in the accession than in core member states, (ii) since the onset of the economic/financial crisis the government spending multipliers have become larger in both core and accession EU member states, and (iii) a comparison with fiscal responses in the OECD countries shows robustness of our estimates. The conclusion implies that the austerity measures present a substantial drag for economic activity in accession EU countries. Thus, we may state that not considering the fiscal behaviour and state of the economy gives misleading fiscal multiplier effects, which in turn lead to the adoption of inappropriate fiscal measures that even worsen a country's economic situation.","[Mencinger, Jernej; Aristovnik, Aleksander; Verbic, Miroslav] Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Verbic, Miroslav] Inst Econ Res, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Verbic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Kardeljeva Ploscad 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",miroslav.verbic@ef.uni-li.si,"Aristovnik, Aleksander/B-4642-2010","Aristovnik, Aleksander/0000-0003-1345-9649",CERGE-EI Foundation under a program of the Global Development Network [RRC14+34],CERGE-EI Foundation under a program of the Global Development Network,We are most grateful to very helpful comments and suggestions from two anonymous referees and the editor.

Achieving the goal of the paper is based on the results of the authors' research focused on the development potential of Russian engineering companies with regard to political, economic, social, technical, legal and cultural factors. The results show that main obstacles to the development of high-tech engineering companies in Russia include high monopolization and specialization of production, ineffective state and regional support, low investment attractiveness of engineering or reduction of expenses on research and development. The results support the assumptions that main macroeconomic conditions for the development of high-tech engineering companies in Russia include increase in the number of industrial clusters and regional technology platforms that act as local regulators of production and consumption of high-tech products.

Nevertheless, it has been ranked over Pareto efficiency by many school districts, and thereof, they are using stable mechanisms.

Based on a comparison of mortality between the municipalities that recorded little or no loss of life due to the earthquake but experienced a sharp increase in the level of contributions, and the nearby municipalities that were not hit by the earthquake, I find that the voluntary provision of daily care to the elderly significantly reduced elderly mortality.

The debate focuses on the inclusion of profit margin in the investment function as a way to characterize the effective demand regime in the neoliberal era as a profit-led growth regime. Our argument is that this inclusion is not able to evaluate properly the countries' economic growth in terms of the consistency between its effective demand regimes and income distribution.,"[Arestis, Philip] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England; [Arestis, Philip] Univ Basque Country, Leioa, Spain; [Baiter, Carolina Troncoso] Univ Estadual Campinas, Campinas, SP, Brazil",University of Cambridge; University of Basque Country; Universidade Estadual de Campinas,"Arestis, P (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England.;Arestis, P (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country, Leioa, Spain.",pa267@cam.ac.uk; cbaltar@gmail.com,"Baltar, Carolina Troncoso/A-8890-2013","Baltar, Carolina Troncoso/0000-0002-3317-8169",,,,,26,10,11,0,7,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2017,64.0,2,,,SI,,125,138,,10.2298/PAN1702125A,0.0,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EX3IA,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000403124600002,0

We show that a well known result for tournaments, namely that the successive procedure is (weakly) more manipulable than the amendment procedure at any given preference profile, extends to arbitrary majority quotas. Moreover, our characterizations of the attainable outcomes for arbitrary quotas allow us to compare the possibilities for manipulation across different quotas. It turns out that the simple majority quota maximizes the domain of preference profiles for which neither procedure is manipulable, but at the same time neither the simple majority quota nor any other quota uniformly minimizes the scope of manipulation once this becomes possible. Hence, quite surprisingly, simple majority voting is not necessarily the optimal choice of a society that is concerned about agenda manipulation.","[Barbera, Salvador] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, MOVE, Barcelona, Spain; [Barbera, Salvador] Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain; [Gerber, Anke] Univ Hamburg, Dept Econ, Hamburg, Germany",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Barcelona School of Economics; University of Hamburg,"Barberà, S (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, MOVE, Barcelona, Spain.;Barberà, S (通讯作者)，Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain.",salvador.barbera@uab.cat; anke.gerber@wiso.uni-hamburg.de,"Barbera, Salvador/B-6042-2011","Barbera, Salvador/0000-0001-6586-2398","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Severo Ochoa Programme for Centers of Excellence in RD [SEV-2011-0075]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through Grants Consolidated Group-C [ECO2008-04756, ECO2014-53051-P]; Generalitat de Catalunya [SGR2009-0419, SGR2014-515]; MOVE",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Severo Ochoa Programme for Centers of Excellence in RD(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through Grants Consolidated Group-C; Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya); MOVE,"The authors thank two anonymous referees, John Duggan, Matthew Jackson, Ines Macho-Stadler, Herve Moulin, and seminar audiences at CORE, the 12th Meeting of the Society for Social Choice and Welfare, the 9th Tinbergen Institute Conference, the Workshop on Game Theory in Honor of Marilda Sotomayor, the SITE workshop on the Dynamics of Collective Decision Making, and the IDGP 2015 Workshop, in particular Antoine Loeper and Roger Myerson for valuable comments.

We do so in the context of a tractable new-Keynesian economy in which a fraction of government spending increases the stock of public capital subject to a time-to build constraint. Public investment projects typically entail significant time-to-build delays, which often span several years from approval to completion. We show that this feature implies that the spending multiplier associated with public investment can be substantially large nearly twice as large as the multiplier associated with public consumption in a liquidity trap. Intuitively, when the time to build is sufficiently long, and to the extent that public capital raises the marginal productivity of private inputs, the resulting disinflationary effect will occur after the economy has escaped from the liquidity trap. At the same time, the increase in households' expected wealth amplifies aggregate demand while the economy is still in the liquidity trap. Using a medium-scale model extended to allow for the accumulation of public capital, we quantify the multiplier associated with the spending component of the 2009's ARRA, which allocated roughly 40% of the authorized funds to public investment. We find a peak multiplier of 2.31. Our results also indicate that failing to account for the composition of the stimulus by overlooking its investment component would lead one to underestimate the spending multiplier by about 50%.

Some ER policies, such as broadly based profit-sharing plans, stock option plans, and stock ownership, create a direct link between a firm's performance and employee compensation and might therefore be expected to encourage successful innovation. In addition, some other aspects of ER, including good pension plans, good union relations, and a variety of specific benefits (such as flex time) might improve innovation performance through their effect on employee morale or institutional loyalty, or simply by creating incentives to stay with the firm. We find that both of these categories of ER - financial incentives and non-pecuniary motivations - have a positive effect on innovation as measured by patenting and patent citations.","[Brander, James A.] Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Zhang, Wei] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Shanghai, Peoples R China",University of British Columbia; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Brander, JA (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",james.brander@sauder.ubc.ca,"Zhang, Wei/P-3692-2016",,,,,,47,4,6,7,50,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

The study is based on a sample of IPOs on the Warsaw Stock Exchange from 1998 to 2011. We find that pre-IPO profitability is a strong and positive signal for investors that translates into a higher offer price and therefore determines the success of the issuance. However, companies with high IPO success do not provide investors with better performance after going public, nor do they provide protection before the common phenomenon of long-term underperformance. A large-scale value migration between shareholders occurs in companies that achieve IPO success. The investor belief that pre-IPO profitability is a signal of the future earnings potential of an IPO firm indicates that they probably use simple heuristics and have a representativeness bias.","[Brycz, Bogumila; Dudycz, Tadeusz; Kowalski, Michal J.] Wroclaw Univ Technol, Dept Management Syst, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Science & Technology,"Dudycz, T (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Technol, Fac Comp Sci & Management, Wyb Wyspianskiego 27, PL-50370 Wroclaw, Poland.",tadeusz.dudycz@pwr.edu.pl,,,,,,,57,8,9,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1406-099X,2334-4385,,BALT J ECON,Balt.

The Panel KSS Unit Root Test with a Fourier Function through the Sequential Panel Selection Method (SPSM) that allow us to control for structural breaks and nonlinearity as well as cross-section dependency and heterogeneity is applied to test whether suicide rates across 23 OECD countries for the period from 1961 to 2006 are stationary. The SPSM classifies the whole panel into a group of stationary series and a group of non-stationary series that is very suitable to identify how many and which series in the panel are stationary processes. The empirical results from several conventional unit root tests indicate that the suicide rates for the OECD countries are non-stationary. Nevertheless, when the proposed panel unit root test is used to test for the unit root hypothesis of suicide rates, we find that the suicide rates are stationary in 7 out of the 23 OECD countries. Our results thereby point out the importance of the proper modelling of both structural breaks and nonlinearities to test for the unit root hypothesis of suicide rates. These findings also imply that suicide rates in these OECD countries are overall not transitory and the government should progressively intervene into unexpected shocks that would increase suicide rates for suicide prevention.","[Chang, Tsangyao] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Fiance, Taichung, Taiwan; [Chang, Tsangyao] CTBC Financial Management Coll, Dept Business Adm, Tainan, Taiwan; [Cai, Yifei] Northeast Normal Univ, Sch Econ, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Chen, Wen-Yi] Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Senior Citizen Serv Management, Taichung, Taiwan",Feng Chia University; CTBC Financial Holding; Northeast Normal University - China; National Taichung University of Science & Technology,"Chen, WY (通讯作者)，Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Senior Citizen Serv Management, Taichung, Taiwan.",tychang@mail.fcu.edu.tw; caiyf736@nenu.edu.cn; chenwen@nutc.edu.tw,"Jiang, Yushi/GPL-6078-2022",,,,,,28,6,6,0,2,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

Using prefecture city-level panel data covering China's 262 prefecture cities for the period 2004-2013 and employing a dynamic panel system generalized method of moments model with instrumental variable regression techniques, our study finds that FDI and exports have, on average, played a significantly positive role in China's urbanization. However, the impacts of FDI and exports on urbanization vary across regions. FDI has a positive and significant impact on urbanization in the coastal region but has no impact on urbanization in the inland region. Exports have a positive and significant impact on urbanization in both the coastal and inland regions, but the effect is much larger in the coastal region than in the inland region. The results imply that further attracting FDI inflows and promoting exports will contribute to China's urbanization, especially for the inland region.","[Chen, Chunlai] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Wu, Yan] Beijing Technol & Business Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Australian National University; Beijing Technology & Business University,"Wu, Y (通讯作者)，Beijing Technol & Business Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",chunlai.chen@anu.edu.au; 18810561632@163.com,"Wu, Yan/AAS-4981-2020",,,,,,44,18,18,1,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JAN-FEB,2017,25.0,1,,,,,71,89,,10.1111/cwe.12187,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EK3QC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000393839900005,0

We propose a symbolic regression (SR) via genetic programming approach to derive mathematical functional forms that link survey-based expectations to GDP growth. By combining the main SR-generated indicators, we generate estimates of the evolution of GDP.

The first workplace flexibility considered is the ability to easily take time off for personal and family matters; the second is the option of a compressed work week. Our findings suggest that the first flexibility correlates with lower stress reports regardless of job control level. The second flexibility, however, correlates with lower stress levels only for workers with low levels of job control. This suggests that a compressed work week does not reduce stress for workers that already have high levels of job control. The more general conclusion is that some flexibilities are substitutes for job control whereas other are not, assuming the larger goal is the reduction of workplace stress and the various maladies exacerbated by stress.","[Cotti, Chad D.; Haley, M.

C. via Greece (Pythagoras, Aristotle, Euclid - the Ancient Greeks did not define infinity in precise formalism as does modern mathematics, and instead approached infinity as a philosophical concept) to the 19th century Prague (Bolzano), Braunschweig (Dedekind) and Halle (Georg Cantor formalized many ideas related to infinity and infinite sets during the late 19th and early 20th centuries). The article ends in 1900 Paris, at the Second International Congress of Mathematicians, where David Hilbert announced his famous list of 23 unsolved mathematical problems, now known as Hilbert's problems and in 1904 Heidelberg in the Third International Congress of Mathematicians, where Gyula Konig delivered a lecture where he claimed that Cantor's famous continuum hypothesis was false.

This paper presents a methodology to calculate the value of the real option to reduce the productive capacity of an investment project within one, two, and n periods. It is well known that the option to reduce quantifies the value of the operational flexibility available to protect a business against possible losses generated by the project; its common use in business practice explains the relevance of developing a clear and easy-to-use tool to assess its value. Thus, to derive its value, the procedure implemented here consists of obtaining a mathematical expression for each of the aforementioned periods, based on a detailed construction of every possible future scenario and its associated probability by the multiplicative binomial method. This is a useful contribution to business practice as it provides a well-defined model to assess the strategic value of an investment project including the option to reduce its productive capacity. Moreover, this real option increases the project value by improving its initial level of feasibility.","[Cruz Rambaud, Salvador; Sanchez Perez, Ana Maria] Univ Almeria, Ctra Sacramento,S-N, La Canada De San Urbano 04120, Almeria, Spain",Universidad de Almeria,"Rambaud, SC (通讯作者)，Univ Almeria, Ctra Sacramento,S-N, La Canada De San Urbano 04120, Almeria, Spain.",scruz@ual.es; amsanchez@ual.es,"Sanchez Perez, Ana Maria/H-8271-2015","Sanchez Perez, Ana Maria/0000-0001-5375-5376",,,,,34,2,2,0,9,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Relative to the number of elderly homeowners with limited financial resources, the take-up rates of reverse mortgages are low. To understand the low takeup rates we first survey U.S. homeowners aged 58 and older assessing their knowledge (literacy) about the most popular reverse mortgage product, the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM). Next, we study the relationship between knowledge and the intention to use a HECM. Awareness of reverse mortgages is high, but knowledge of contract terms is limited. More knowledgeable homeowners and those with peers who have a reverse mortgage express greater intentionto use such a product. Respondents who would benefit most from reverse mortgages (those with low incomes and limited savings) express greater intention to use reverse mortgages, but lack knowledge of the contract terms.

Instead, they obtain an immediate static premium and accumulate more valuable experience.

Using the World Bank's classification for income groups, we initially find that those countries that present the lowest public debt are characterized by the highest economic growth, while the smallest growth rates are associated with the highest public debt. Nevertheless, this conclusion is tempered when we analyse the countries by income level: low-income countries have a different behaviour with respect to lower-middle, upper-middle and high-income countries. When using the IMF's country classification, the results do not suggest a clear pattern in the public debt-economic growth nexus across different countries, but indicate a heterogeneous relationship between such key macroeconomic variables.","[del Carmen Ramos-Herrera, Maria] Univ Complutense Madrid, Colegio Univ Estudios Financieros, Madrid, Spain; [Sosvilla-Rivero, Simon] Univ Complutense Madrid, Complutense Inst Int Studies, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid; CUNEF Universidad; Complutense University of Madrid,"Sosvilla-Rivero, S (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Complutense Inst Int Studies, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain.",sosvilla@ccee.ucm.es,"Ramos-Herrera, Maria del Carmen/JXN-9501-2024; del Carmen Ramos-Herrera, Maria/ABF-2795-2020; Sosvilla-Rivero, Simon/H-4163-2015","Ramos-Herrera, Maria del Carmen/0000-0002-2903-5405; Sosvilla-Rivero, Simon/0000-0003-2084-0640","Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport through Subprograma Estatal de Movilidad del Plan Estatal de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnica y de Innovacion [PRX16/00261]","Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport through Subprograma Estatal de Movilidad del Plan Estatal de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnica y de Innovacion","This work is supported by the Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport, through the Subprograma Estatal de Movilidad del Plan Estatal de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnica y de Innovacion 2013-2016 [Grant PRX16/00261].",,50,6,6,2,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Insured depositors and run-prone uninsured depositors choose between differentiated banks. Banks compete for deposits and endogenously default. The estimated demand for uninsured deposits declines with banks' financial distress, which is not the case for insured deposits. We calibrate the supply side of the model. The calibrated model possesses multiple equilibria with bank-run features, suggesting that banks can be very fragile. We use our model to analyze proposed bank regulations. For example, our results suggest that a capital requirement below 18 percent can lead to significant instability in the banking system.","[Egan, Mark] Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, 321 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Hortacsu, Ali] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, 1126 E 59th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Matvos, Gregor] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, 5807 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Chicago; University of Chicago,"Egan, M (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, 321 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",eganx076@umn.edu; hortacsu@uchicago.edu; gregor.matvos@chicagobooth.edu,,,"NSF [SES 1426823]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1426823] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",Ali Hortacsu acknowledges financial support of the NSF (SES 1426823).,,58,82,109,7,44,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

We use a search-matching model with imperfect competition in the product market to derive an equation for total hiring in a local labour market, and estimate it on Swedish panel data. If product markets are imperfectly competitive, product demand shocks should have a direct effect on employment for given levels of prices and wages. Our main finding is that product demand has such a direct effect on hiring. This highlights the importance of taking imperfect competition in the product market into account in studies of employment dynamics and hiring. We also find that, for given levels of prices, wages, and product demand, the number of unemployed workers in a local labour market has a positive effect on hiring, suggesting that search frictions matter. Quantitatively, product demand shocks seem to be more important for understanding the variation in hiring than shocks to the number of unemployed workers.","[Eriksson, Stefan] Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, Uppsala, Sweden; [Stadin, Karolina] Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, Uppsala, Sweden; [Stadin, Karolina] Ratio Inst, Stockholm, Sweden",Uppsala University; Uppsala University,"Stadin, K (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, Uppsala, Sweden.;Stadin, K (通讯作者)，Ratio Inst, Stockholm, Sweden.",karolina.stadin@nek.uu.se,,,"Jan Wallanders och Tom Hedelius Stiftelse samt Tore Browaldhs Stiftelse [P2011-0169:1, P2014-0192:1]; Institute for Evaluation of Labour Market and Education Policy (IFAU) [100/2014]",Jan Wallanders och Tom Hedelius Stiftelse samt Tore Browaldhs Stiftelse; Institute for Evaluation of Labour Market and Education Policy (IFAU)(Institute for Evaluation of Labour Market and Education Policy (IFAU)),This work was supported by the Jan Wallanders och Tom Hedelius Stiftelse samt Tore Browaldhs Stiftelse [P2011-0169:1 & P2014-0192:1] and The Institute for Evaluation of Labour Market and Education Policy (IFAU) [100/2014].,,32,4,4,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Methods: This paper analyses the effects of this trade agreement on the exports of the Mexican manufacturing sectors through the application of a model of multiple gravity equations in two possible scenarios (ambitious and limited TTIP). Results: Findings show significant drops of Mexican manufacturing exports and a weakening of its role in the global value chains, especially in those sectors where the EU has significant competitive advantages in its trade with the US. Furthermore, the estimated impacts show that the trade diversion effects would be particularly relevant in those industries with high dependence on exports to the US market, such as machinery and transport equipments. Conclusions: The update of the trade agreements between Mexico and the US and the EU could mitigate the potential negative effects of TTIP, provided that this update leads to an approximation to the standards set for European exports in this new agreement.","[Exposito Garcia, Alfonso] Univ Seville, Dept Anal Econ, Seville, Spain",University of Sevilla,"Exposito García, A (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Dept Anal Econ, Seville, Spain.",aexposito@us.es,"Expósito, Alfonso/JTZ-5917-2023; Expósito, Alfonso/H-9841-2017","Expósito, Alfonso/0000-0002-9248-4879; Expósito, Alfonso/0000-0002-9248-4879",,,,,24,0,0,0,5,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

The data are based on two-digit industry-level information on seven European countries for the period 2001-2010. For manufacturing industries, static fixed-effects models show that the share of employees with internet broadband access, the diffusion of mobile internet access and the use of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems and automatic data exchange combined with electronic invoicing are all significantly and positively related to skill intensity in the industries observed. For service industries, only mobile internet usage intensity is significant. Specifically for manufacturing, a 10-point increase in the percentage of firms using ERP systems is associated with an increase in the share of highly skilled workers by 0.4 percentage points. These estimates indicate that the increase in ERP system usage during the period studied accounted for 30% of the increase in the share of workers with a tertiary degree across manufacturing industries and countries. The results are robust with respect to the estimation method and the potential endogeneity of ICT.","[Falk, Martin] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Vienna, Austria; [Biagi, Federico] JRC IPTS, Seville, Spain; [Biagi, Federico] Univ Padua, Padua, Italy",European Commission Joint Research Centre; University of Padua,"Falk, M (通讯作者)，Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Vienna, Austria.",Martin.Falk@wifo.ac.at,"Falk, Martin Thomas/T-8325-2019","Falk, Martin Thomas/0000-0003-0518-6513","Institute for Prospective Technological Studies, Joint Research Centre (JRC-IPTS), European Commission; Austrian National Bank [JF 16524]; Eurostat Esslait project [50721.2013]","Institute for Prospective Technological Studies, Joint Research Centre (JRC-IPTS), European Commission; Austrian National Bank; Eurostat Esslait project","This work was supported by the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies, Joint Research Centre (JRC-IPTS), European Commission.

Nevertheless, this critical view has not led to the formulation of an alternative conception of labor supply that is sufficiently coherent and structured to be generally accepted within these branches of the literature. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to contribute to the construction of such an alternative. To do so, the article starts by analyzing the relationship between the reasons that lead to individuals offering their labor and what that activity can bring to human beings in return. Secondly, the authors present an alternative concept of what workers contribute at work. They then analyze how the decision-making process regarding the labor supply actually takes place. Finally, the article concludes by briefly presenting certain additional points, in particular how differentiation is an inherent feature of the labor supply.","[Fernandez-Huerga, Eduardo; Garcia-Arias, Jorge; Salvador, Ana] Univ Leon, Dept Econ & Stat, Leon, Spain",Universidad de Leon,"Fernández-Huerga, E (通讯作者)，Univ Leon, Dept Econ & Stat, Leon, Spain.",,"Fernández-Huerga, Eduardo/AAC-5767-2019; Garcia-Arias, Jorge/AGF-8614-2022","Fernández-Huerga, Eduardo/0000-0001-8974-0440; Salvador Chamorro, Ana Isabel/0000-0002-7709-4645",,,,,105,6,6,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

We argue that, over time, the evaluation of a company may change as a result of variations in its market price, size or book price, and we are aware that the F&F model does not accurately reflect these dynamics. Our results show that the adapted model is able to capture the behaviour of a greater number of stocks than the original F&F model and risk factors are more significant when building them through our procedure.

A lagging performance of exports vis-a-vis imports in terms of magnitude, growth rate as well as price reductions has led to the current deficit. Domestic industrial output is a determining factor in the extent of foreign trade of capital goods. It exposes very large coefficients in the long term for exports (2.89), as well as for imports (4.34). Concerning the effective exchange rate, coefficients are systematically negative and elastic. Hence, a depreciation of the dollar could further deteriorate the external accounts of this sector. The United States trade deficit is expected to continue.

I discuss three arguments in favor of this hypothesis: (i) eminent institutional economists have examined the economy as what today could be considered a complex system; (ii) complexity economists lack meta-theoretical foundations which could be provided by institutionalist theory; and (iii) institutional economists could benefit from using methods of complexity economics. In this context, I argue that scholars considering the economy to be complex should seek to explain it by discovering social mechanisms instead of focusing on prediction. In order to distinguish between alternative explanations, scholars should refer to the deepness of an explanation, rather than to Occam's razor.","[Graebner, Claudius] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, ICAE, Linz, Austria",Johannes Kepler University Linz,"Gräbner, C (通讯作者)，Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, ICAE, Linz, Austria.",,,"Grabner-Radkowitsch, Claudius/0000-0003-4065-4722",,,,,29,6,6,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

To do so, and following the conventional methodology of indices, the article first identifies the dimensions underlying economic independence and then selects the various indicators that best reflect each dimension. It then normalizes each indicator by using its highest and lowest historic goalposts. Finally, it averages the composite index using specific weights assigned first to each indicator and second to each dimension. The economic independence index, which was constructed for 112 countries, provides a gauge to such countries on where they stand in terms of economic resilience and how much risk they face if they were to stand alone economically, or pursue policies that are undesirable from the perspective of more economically powerful countries. This index thus provides a tool for governments to measure the direction and magnitude of government action needed to improve their respective nations' level of economic independence.","[Helmy, Heba E.] Modern Sci & Arts Univ MSA, Fac Management Sci, Dept Econ, Econ, Cairo, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Modern Sciences & Arts University (MSA),"Helmy, HE (通讯作者)，Modern Sci & Arts Univ MSA, Fac Management Sci, Dept Econ, Econ, Cairo, Egypt.",,"Helmy, Heba Ezzeldin/I-7623-2019","Helmy, Heba Ezzeldin/0000-0003-4628-614X",,,,,21,2,3,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Issues of equipment maintenance planning and management are a typical example, where the best of several available variants are searched for the solution of optimising tasks. For instance, the selection of the best variant of determination of the preventive maintenance interval must take into account several factors, in relation to which, however, the completeness or certainty of necessary data cannot be always provided. The grey relational analysis is used in this paper on the grounds of multiple attribute decision making approaches for solving a specific maintenance task. The organization has due to the temporary reduction of orders the option to shut down a certain number of equipment. Thus, equipment on which the maintenance will be performed at the time of unused capacities can be selected out of the group of equipment with the determined preventive maintenance interval. The task of selecting the equipment for maintenance does have its limitations in form of determined group of equipment with their parameters and is also determined by a particular time window - the interval of temporary reduction of capacities. Not only the history of operation and maintenance of equipment, but also the need and efficiency of their further utilisation, are taken into account in the task solving process with real data. It concerns a combination of data of both certain and uncertain nature. Results obtained by means of the grey relational analysis are compared with conventional multicriteria analysis approach without taking uncertainties into account and both advantages and disadvantages of reached different solutions are discussed.","[Hrnciar, Miroslav] Univ Zilina, Univ 8215, Zilina 01026, Slovakia; [Budaj, Pavol] Catholic Univ Ruzomberok, Nabrezie Jana Pavla 2-15, Poprad 05801, Slovakia",University of Zilina; Catholic University Ruzomberok,"Hrnciar, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Univ 8215, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",miroslav.hrnciar@fri.uniza.sk; budajpavol@gmail.com,,,Projekt VEGA [1/0363/2014],Projekt VEGA,Projekt VEGA 1/0363/2014 Innovation Management.,,10,0,0,0,0,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-349-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,330,339,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6CS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426486500037,0

We find that firms pay higher compensation (or excess compensation) to executives and directors are associated with higher information asymmetry. The positive association is stronger where executives' and directors' shareholdings are higher. Shareholding appears to facilitate managerial entrenchment and gives highly paid executives/leadership stronger structural power which adversely affects information disclosure leading to larger forecast error and dispersion. These results are robust to different measures of compensation and alternative models controlling for the predictability of firm-level earnings. Our findings indicate that executive/director shareholding and compensation do not provide sufficient incentives for information disclosure by Chinese firms.,"[Huang, Wei] Univ Nottingham, Business Sch China, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Boateng, Agyenim] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Dept Law Econ Accountancy & Risk, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of Nottingham Ningbo China; Glasgow Caledonian University,"Huang, W (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Business Sch China, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",wei.huang@nottingham.edu.cn,,,,,,,44,15,15,4,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The authors' analyse the effect of management control on the economic efficiency of activities of state-owned enterprises by application of management audit. The paper seeks to highlight the higher utility of economic activity as well as return of capital which was used in the process of activities. The paper analyses the quality of management and economic activity in SOEs based on scientific literature as well as reports and decisions of the representative government institutions as well as the results of empirical research which was accomplished in Lithuania. The paper stresses that the state-owned commercial property in Lithuania has thus far been managed inefficiently. Unlike private companies, SOEs practically fail to render much use to the state.

In an industry subject to environmental regulation (such as emission taxes), such programs may allow firms to credibly disclose their progress in achieving compliance cost reduction through investments in internal R&D, innovation and learning (whose outcomes are uncertain and unlikely to be publicly observable). Specifically, I analyze a duopoly where firms are subject to an emission tax and invest in reducing the emission intensity of their production processes; the outcome of the investment is private information. I show that the ex ante incentive to invest is always higher in the presence of the voluntary disclosure program than without it; in particular, the opportunity to credibly disclose progress in cost reduction allows a successful firm to convey its true position of competitive advantage to the rival firm and realize higher market share and profit. Thus, voluntary disclosure programs increase the efficacy of traditional forms of environmental regulation in creating incentives for green technological change (even when buyers have no preference for greener technology). I show that such programs generally increase social welfare. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - This research explores key factors affecting the TTC through a comprehensive literature review in tandem with expert survey. Factor analysis, both exploratory and confirmatory, is employed to further investigate the underlying factors affecting more efficient development of a TTC. Findings - This research has drawn eight underlying factors affecting the design of a TTC: development and policy implications; safety, security and political concerns; environmental protection; financing and investment; soft infrastructure; hard infrastructure; geography and landscape; and corridor performance. Research limitations/implications - This paper has a limited geographical scope of the Northeast Asia. Therefore, more primary data collection would be useful in future work. Development of International trade corridor and TTC is critical in northeast Asia for moving goods through designated geographical paths. The key factors drawn in this paper contributes not only to promoting its related services and information (across borders) with the provision of policy support and related facilities for TTC but also to lowering logistics costs and improving trades in the northeast Asian region. As a result, the countries in the region will accelerate their regional economies in collaboration with international bodies and framework, such as UNDP, Greater Tumen Initiative and One Belt One Road Initiative. Practical implications - The eight underlying factors the authors identified in this research will be valuable for policy-makers to design TTCs and consequently the research will contribute to regional economies in northeast Asia by establishing efficient trade and transport routes among the countries in the region. Social implications - Developing TTCs is a kind of platform and infrastructure to accelerate cargo movements and people movements in the northeast Asia. Users of TTCs will benefit their businesses thanks to an efficient logistics system and lower logistics costs, which result in promoting international and regional trade in the region. Originality/value - There has not been any research done on factors to consider in developing TTCs in the world, whose consequence is no readily available reference that can support a systematic assessment and decision-making in development of TTCs. The findings of this research provide a helpful reference for policy-makers, potential users and developers of TTCs to refer in planning and developing them.","[Lim, Sang-Won; Suthiwartnarueput, Kamonchanok] Chulalongkorn Univ, Logist Management Program, Bangkok, Thailand; [Abareshi, Ahmad] RMIT Univ, Coll Business, Sch Business IT & Logist, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Lee, Paul Tae-Woo] Zhejiang Univ, Ocean Coll, Zhoushan, Peoples R China; [Duval, Yann] United Nations Econ & Social Commiss Asia & Pacif, ESCAP, Trade Policy & Facilitat Sect, Trade Investment & Innovat Div, Bangkok, Thailand",Chulalongkorn University; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Zhejiang University,"Lee, PTW (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Ocean Coll, Zhoushan, Peoples R China.",paultwlee2030@gmail.com,"Lee, Paul/AAM-2919-2021","Abareshi, Ahmad/0000-0003-3150-4933",,,,,48,12,12,5,59,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

At the same time, there was predicted that after Czexit the Czech koruna shall strengthen against euro by approximately 5% in one year. One group of economic entities that may benefit from this new situation are companies which plan or planned to obtain a loan for financing their business activities. Combination of loan denominated in euros and strengthening koruna may result in decreasing interest payments. The aim of this article was, based on the data from the Czech National Bank about corporate loans denominated in Czech koruna and euros, to reveal what strategy non-financial corporations chose before Czexit regarding their debt-loan policy. There was expected statistically significant negative correlation between the amount of loans denominated in koruna and loans in euros. In order to verify this hypothesis we tested these two time series by correlation analysis. From the conducted research we can state that in the whole observed period our assumption was not confirmed. Both time series developed in similar ways.

Some econometric implementations of the CDM approach have suggested that such data give useful but imprecise measures of the innovation output (share of innovative sales), and to a lesser degree of the innovation input (R&D). These 'measurement errors' may result in attenuation biases of the estimated R&D and innovation impact elasticities in the two basic CDM 'roots' relations of R&D to innovation and innovation to productivity, as well as in the extended production function a la Griliches linking directly R&D to productivity. Using a panel of three waves of the French Community Innovation Survey (CIS), we assess these biases and the magnitude of the underlying measurement errors, assuming mainly that they are 'white noise' errors. We do so by comparing two pairs of usual panel estimators (Total and Between) in both the cross-sectional and time dimensions of the data (Levels and Differences). We find large measurement errors on innovation output in the innovation-productivity equation, resulting in large attenuation biases in the related elasticity parameter. We also find smaller but sizeable measurement errors on R&D, with significant attenuation biases in the corresponding elasticity estimates, in the R&D-innovation equation and the extended production function.

In addition, the impact of these characteristics and others related to FF, such as family ownership and generation, on the perceived performance of their internationalization is analysed. Based on a sample of Spanish companies with direct investment in China, the results indicated that, from the managers' perspective, being an FF and having lower financial leverage exerted a positive effect on the performance of the internationalization process. Moreover, the study proved that this performance was strongly and positively related to the financial results of the company, and this positive effect was even stronger in the case of FF. Finally, the findings also showed that FF with a higher involvement of the family in their ownership recognized a better performance of their internationalization process. These results will be useful for companies that are considering the value of internationalization as a strategy to improve or maintain their financial results, and they also highlight certain differences between FF and non-FF.","[Marin, Q.; Hernandez-Lara, A.

All contemporary used models are built on households' utility maximization and firms' profit maximization. There is assumed that the households are owners of the firms and instruct managers to fulfil the maximum of profit. In our model there are two utility maximization problems, the first one is standard households' dynamic problem and the second one is static managers' utility maximization under constraint of exhausting the whole production by the owners of labour and capital, i.e. households. The arguments of managerial utility function are the amount of labour and capital hired. A new factor of production has to be included in the production function. It is the managers' effort as a specific factor of production but this effort is not awarded at all as in presented basic model or the award for managers could be negligible to their marginal product. The first order condition of this problem compares the marginal utility from hired factor with the cost for factor payment. The key feature of the model is then overpayment of factors of production above their marginal productivity. Model completely separates the decision making of households and firms while the profit maximization approach assumes the collaboration between them.","[Martincik, David] Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Univ 22, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Martincík, D (通讯作者)，Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Univ 22, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic.",martinci@kem.zcu.cz,,,UWB [SGS-2016-057],UWB,This article was supported by UWB grant SGS-2016-057 The Application of Quantitative Methods to Economy Problems.,,16,0,0,0,2,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-349-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,63,70,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6CS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426486500007,0

First, it is shown that the Jaffe metric can be displayed graphically using the biplot, a graphical display of a two-dimensional approximation to any multidimensional matrix. Second, it is illustrated that since the data used to produce the Jaffe metric are constrained within the simplex (i.e. shares add up to one), then a theoretically superior metric satisfying the basic axioms of technological proximity measures in this sample space is the Aitchison distance measure, a metric based on log-ratios of shares. The findings of the paper using agricultural research and development spillover potential for Southern African countries show that the Jaffe metric overestimates the technological proximity across countries as compared to the proposed Aitchison measure.","[Mkondiwa, Maxwell] Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Dept Appl Econ, 1994 Buford Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Mkondiwa, M (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Dept Appl Econ, 1994 Buford Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",mkond001@umn.edu,,"Mkondiwa, Maxwell/0000-0003-0008-9095",McKnight Foundation,McKnight Foundation,"This research was conducted when the author was being supported by the McKnight Foundation under the Collaborative Crop Research Program for his PhD studies in the Department of Applied Economics, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities.",,44,0,0,2,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

Schumpeter's thesis of the obsolescence of the entrepreneurial function - already present in The Theory of Economic Development - is also scrutinized, by investigating the coherence between his conceptions of rationality and of rationalization.

Also contrary to the conventional view is our finding that round quotes are used more frequently in the more active of two market segments where equivalent assets are traded.

The results show that perceptions depend on the burdens of the occupational group, the size of the wage increase, information policies and potential consequences for other groups. These findings are in line with social and organizational justice theories about equity and informational justice.","[Pfeifer, Christian] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Dept Appl Microecon, Luneburg, Germany; [Stephan, Gesine] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Employment Res IAB, Dept Act Labour Market Policies & Integrat, Nurnberg, Germany; [Duetsch, Matthias; Struck, Olaf] Otto Friedrich Univ Bamberg, Dept Sociol, Chair Labour Studies, Bamberg, Germany",Leuphana University Luneburg; University of Erlangen Nuremberg; Otto Friedrich University Bamberg,"Stephan, G (通讯作者)，Inst Employment Res IAB, Regensburger Str 104, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany.",gesine.stephan@iab.de,"Struck, Olaf/AAE-1561-2020","Struck, Olaf/0000-0002-7631-6365",Hans-Bockler-Foundation [2011-462-2],Hans-Bockler-Foundation,This work was supported by the Hans-Bockler-Foundation [2011-462-2].,,9,3,3,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The issue appears of importance in view of the fact that, while the various theoretical definitions allow to understand the meaning of the concepts and to distinguish between Control, Influence and Portfolio Investment, still in practice recognizing whether Control exist and who the Controller is can be extremely tricky. The conundrum is relevant to more than just academic satisfaction. Indeed, those rules governing the recognition of the interest in a controlled subsidiary are different from the accounting treatment of the interest in Associates (Company over which another company has influence) and of portfolio investment (when the investor is not involved in managing the company). Hence, a proper classification of investments into categories (acquisition of Control, Influence or portfolio investment) is crucial for the preparation of proper financial statements. Investors and the general public can be easily misled otherwise. The IFRS 10, issued in 2011, provides guidance regarding the recognition of Control. Nonetheless, in reality the application of these rules can be tricky because recognizing Control(lers) is not always straightforward. We discuss the point theoretically and then we present two case-studies.","[Podda, Pietro Andrea; Muir, David] Anglo Amer Univ, Letenska 5, Prague 11800 1, Czech Republic",Anglo-American University,"Podda, PA (通讯作者)，Anglo Amer Univ, Letenska 5, Prague 11800 1, Czech Republic.",pietro.podda@aauni.edu; david.muir@aauni.edu,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,1233,1244,,,,,,12,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455325300123,0

Since the global financial crisis in 2008, there has been a shift in the conduct of monetary policy. Much like the behavior of asset holders themselves, who, in times of crisis, sought to trade off lower returns with more stable asset values, monetary policy changed from a de facto policy of stabilizing rentier income to one of preserving asset prices or rentier wealth. I analyze this particularly through the lenses of what happened with quantitative easing (QE) in the US, which coincided with a collapse of real interest rates, while asset prices were stabilized. This can also be seen in the way the banking sector was supported by QE where the market for mortgage-backed securities was sustained even as it actually meant a lower profitability for the overall U.S. banking sector during the QE interventions.","[Seccareccia, Mario] Univ Ottawa, Econ, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Seccareccia, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Econ, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",,,,Institute for New Economic Thinking,Institute for New Economic Thinking,"Mario Seccareccia is a professor of economics at the University of Ottawa, Ontario (Canada).

The effects of trade reform on technical efficiency are analysed using a stochastic frontier approach. Two variables represent trade reform in this model: effective rate of protection (ERP) and import ratio (IMP). The findings of the present study suggest that both trade reform variables have significant effects on technical efficiency. The coefficient of ERP has a positive sign and is statistically significant, which means that an increase in ERP increases the inefficiency (or decreases the technical efficiency) of firms in the chemicals industry. The coefficient of IMP is negative and statistically significant, which represents the negative impact of IMP on technical inefficiency (or positive on technical efficiency). Thus, trade reform, a reduction in ERP or an increase in IMP, has an unambiguously positive effect on technical efficiency in the Indonesian chemicals industry.","[Suatmi, Bernadetta Dwi] Kwik Kian Gie Sch Business, Jakarta Utara, Dki Jakarta, Indonesia; [Bloch, Harry; Salim, Ruhul] Curtin Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Curtin Business Sch, Perth, WA 6845, Australia",Curtin University,"Salim, R (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Curtin Business Sch, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",Ruhul.Salim@cbs.curtin.edu.au,"Bloch, Harry/O-1058-2019; Suatmi, Bernadetta Dwi/AAP-8433-2020","Bloch, Harry/0000-0002-4288-6925; Suatmi, Bernadetta Dwi/0000-0003-4758-5723","Directorate General of Higher Education (DIKTI), Indonesia","Directorate General of Higher Education (DIKTI), Indonesia","This article is based on first author's PhD dissertation submitted to Curtin University in 2016.

Data from more than 2800 hi-tech manufacturing SMEs in South Korea were collected to empirically test the conceptual framework. The results confirmed the hypothesized difference in performance. Firms indeed vary in degrees of explorative and exploitative innovation and thus have positive but imbalanced impact on their performance. Firms that are high (low) in both explorative and exploitative innovation perform best (worst) in longer-term growth. Firms that tilt toward exploitative innovation perform best in short-term profit.

We compare a price cartel with a price-quota cartel and analyze when and why firms prefer the latter to the former. Output quota may be required to solve coordination and incentive problems when market demand is sufficiently elastic. If market demand is sufficiently inelastic, then the cartel faces a trade-off between increasing prices and the amount of costly overproduction. We find that a price cartel prices consistently below the monopoly price to mitigate excessive production. In this case, a quota arrangement allows firms to avoid overproduction and to sustain the monopoly price. From a policy perspective, our findings suggest that an overall price increase in conjunction with more stable prices and market shares is indicative of collusion in industries where production precedes sales and outputs are imperfectly observable.

Design/methodology/approach - First, two distinct models of firm heterogeneity are considered as two possible structures for firms' competition: price competition and quality competition. Then, the author exploits the bilateral trade data of the world's 83 largest countries in order to examine a link between the empirical findings and the theoretical models. Findings - The empirical findings support a model of quality competition rather than price competition, in which firms in a country with a comparative advantage in a given product tend to improve their product quality as opposed to lowering production costs, so they compete on the quality-adjusted price. Research limitations/implications - This paper used product-level data to examine the spatial pattern of the average export unit value of a product, which is able to answer the question of whether an industry is involved with quality competition. The product-level data used in this study, however, are not ideally suitable for exploring the predictions of a heterogeneous firms' trade model. Originality/value - To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first paper that investigates a relationship between the country-product pair of comparative advantages and firms' self-selection behavior in the product-level data to shed light on the role of product quality in determining the structure of firms' competition.","[Whang, Unjung] Korea Inst Int Trade Policy, Sejong Si, South Korea",,"Whang, U (通讯作者)，Korea Inst Int Trade Policy, Sejong Si, South Korea.",uwhang2@gmail.com,,,,,,,17,6,6,0,15,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

The measurement results show that there are significant differences regarding the level of complexity among countries. High-income economies have higher complexity than low- and middle-income economies. The empirical findings demonstrate that economic complexity and different levels of human capital have positive effects on long- and short-term growth. A positive interaction effect on economic growth exists between economic complexity and human capital. In addition, secondary education as a proxy for human capital has a relatively greater positive direct effect and a much stronger interactive effect with complexity on economic growth. In addition, the magnitude of the interaction effect between economic complexity and human capital on long- and short-term growth increases as the revealed comparative advantage threshold grows.","[Zhu, Shujin; Li, Renyu] Hunan Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China",Hunan University,"Li, RY (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.",renyu0120@hnu.edu.cn,"zhu, shujin/JAC-2691-2023",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71573076],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant Number: 71573076].,,22,84,87,4,87,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

A deeper investigation of Sraffa's price equations reveals that this characterization is not well grounded. The notion of viability' of a system is thus re-defined here in such a way as to allow the determination of production prices for economies that are not in a self-replacing state (i.e. displaying positive net products in some industries and negative net products in others). Viability is here connected to the possibility for each industry to reintegrate the value of the means of production and to obtain a uniform non-negative rate of profit. It appears, thus, as a notion that mainly impacts the value side. This specification is relevant for an approach where the quantities are determined separately from the relations between value and income distribution. The focus on non-self-replacing systems opens the question on how to handle this and all cases of systematic changes in output levels without losing the property of persistence of production prices, which permits them to be regarded as centres of gravitation. This issue is explicitly linked to possible specific assumptions that can be made on returns. The various views on this point are discussed here in relation to the main features of the modern classical approach.","[Bellino, Enrico] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Via Emilia Parmense 84, I-29122 Piacenza, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Bellino, E (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Via Emilia Parmense 84, I-29122 Piacenza, Italy.",enrico.bellino@unicatt.it,,"BELLINO, Enrico/0000-0003-2021-5423",,,,,25,3,3,0,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

We found that advanced organisational structures of the firm positively moderate the former relationship, but only for firms achieving radical innovations.","[Bello-Pintado, Alejandro] Univ Publ Navarra, Campus Arrosadia S-N, Navarra, Spain; [Bianchi, Carlos] Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias Econ, Inst Econ, Montevideo, Uruguay","Universidad Publica de Navarra; Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay","Bianchi, C (通讯作者)，Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias Econ, Inst Econ, Montevideo, Uruguay.",alejandro.bello@unavarra.es; cbianchi@iecon.ccee.edu.uy,"Bianchi, Carlos/AAW-6359-2021","Bello Pintado, Alejandro/0000-0003-0186-716X; Bianchi, Carlos/0000-0003-0547-3950",Spanish Ministry of Education and Science [ECO2013-48496-C04-12-R],Spanish Ministry of Education and Science(Spanish Government),"The suggestions and criticism by anonymous referees were immensely constructive and helpful, we sincerely thank him.

A short position benefits the plaintiff by transforming a negative expected-value claim into a positive expected-value one and by enhancing the claim's settlement value. If the capital market is less than strong-form efficient, the plaintiff also benefits directly from the decline in the defendant's stock price. When the defendant is privately informed about the case's merits, bargaining failures can arise. While aggressive short-selling benefits the plaintiff at the expense of the defendant, moderate levels of short-selling can benefit the defendant and raise the settlement rate.","[Choi, Albert H.] Univ Virginia, Sch Law, 580 Massie Rd, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Spier, Kathryn E.] Harvard Law Sch, 1575 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Virginia; Harvard University,"Choi, AH (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Sch Law, 580 Massie Rd, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",achoi@law.virginia.edu; kspier@law.harvard.edu,,,National Science Foundation [SES-1155761],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We would like to thank Ken Ayotte, Ian Ayres, Patrick Bolton, James Dana, Andrew Daughety, Harold Edgar, John de Figueiredo, Janet Freilich, John Golden, Itay Goldstein, Jacob Hanna, Bruce Kobayashi, Alex Lee, Joshua Mitts, Mitch Polinsky, Arti Rai, Jennifer Reinganum, Alan Schwartz, Steve Shavell, Ted Sichelman, Abe Wickelgren, seminar participants at Columbia Law School, Harvard Law School, NBER Summer Law and Economics Workshop, Northwestern University Law School, Stanford Law School, University of Texas Law School, and University of Virginia Law School, and conference participants at Game Theory Conference at SUNY Stony Brook, Law and Economics Theory Conference at Duke University, Society for Institutional & Organizational Economics (SIOE) at Sciences Po, American Law and Economics Annual Conference at Yale University, Boston University School of Law IP Day, and Debraj Ray and several anonymous referees for helpful comments and suggestions.

Individuals exposed to high inequality may feel envious if they perceive that the success of others is granted rather than earned. Thus, envious individuals may be motivated to engage in religious and political activities to cope with their feelings. I trigger the sentiment of envy with a 2 x 2 design by interacting a priming video and low stakes. I find that individuals in the envy treatment donate a larger proportion of their endowment to a politically involved religious charity, my measure of support for the Islamic revival.

We document that although online prices change more frequently than offline prices, they nevertheless exhibit relatively long spells of fixed prices. By many metrics, such as large size and low synchronization of price changes, considerable cross-sectional dispersion, and low sensitivity to predictable or unanticipated changes in demand conditions, online prices are as imperfect as offline prices. Our findings suggest a need for more research on the sources of price rigidities and dispersion, as well as on the relative role of menu and search costs in online-pricing frictions.","[Gorodnichenko, Yuriy] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Sheremirov, Viacheslav] Fed Reserve Bank Boston, Boston, MA 02210 USA; [Talavera, Oleksandr] Swansea Univ, Swansea, W Glam, Wales; [Gorodnichenko, Yuriy] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Boston; Swansea University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Gorodnichenko, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Gorodnichenko, Y (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",ygorodni@econ.berkeley.edu; viacheslav.sheremirov@bos.frb.org; oleksandr.talavera@gmail.com,"Gorodnichenko, Yuriy/ABD-5366-2021; Talavera, Oleksandr/ABE-1913-2021","Talavera, Oleksandr/0000-0002-4799-778X",NSF; Sloan Foundation; Google,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Sloan Foundation(Alfred P.

In quantitative analyses I have conducted for the years 2010 through 2011, the results have yielded a different picture from what Bergmann's model predicts: although African American men are underrepresented in high-wage occupations, consistent with her model, this group does not appear to be overrepresented in low-wage occupational categories when the level of analysis is between major low-wage occupational categories instead of within categories.

This study aims to examine whether the UK could potentially benefit from this depreciation, that is, improve its trade balance with its euro area counterparts. Theory suggests that this could happen only if the Marshall-Lerner condition holds, i.e. if the sum of import and export elasticities is greater than unity. Due to the fact that the Marshall-Lerner condition is static, a more dynamic estimate, the J-curve, which allows for a distinction between the short-run and the long-run response of the trade balance, is employed using bilateral trade data between the UK and 10-euro area countries. Results, employing both bilateral ARDL and Pooled Mean Group methods show that, until a new trade agreement is reached, the UK trade balance vis-a-vis the euro area is not expected to change significantly in the short-run, while it should improve in the long-run. The wide range of bilateral findings underlies the idiosyncrasies between euro area countries and also suggests that there is a rationale for countries to explore different paths such as bilateral agreements with the UK.","[Michail, Nektarios A.] Cyprus Univ Technol, Econ Anal & Res Dept, Cent Bank Cyprus, Dept Commerce, Limassol, Cyprus",,"Michail, NA (通讯作者)，Cyprus Univ Technol, Econ Anal & Res Dept, Cent Bank Cyprus, Dept Commerce, Limassol, Cyprus.",,,,,,,,34,4,4,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

This is surprising as, everything else equal, fast growth should imply high capital returns. This paper develops a capital flow accounting framework to quantify the role of different factor market distortions in producing these patterns. Surprisingly, we find that distortions in labor markets, rather than domestic or international capital markets, account for the bulk of these flows. Labor market distortions that indirectly depress investment incentives by lowering equilibrium labor supply explain two-thirds of observed flows, while improvement in these distortions over time accounts for much of Asia's rapid growth.","[Ohanian, Lee E.] Stanford Univ, Hoover Inst, 405 Hilgard Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Ohanian, Lee E.] UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Ohanian, Lee E.; Wright, Mark L.

Carbon productivity has become an important approach to measure the level of low carbon development, because it can integrate the goals of economic development and carbon reduction. Therefore, it is of great significance to understand the influencing mechanisms of foreign trade on China's carbon productivity to improve trade quality and low carbon development. This research measured China's carbon productivity and analyzed the effect of foreign trade on carbon productivity through applying spatial lag model with the data of 30 provinces from 2000 to 2014. The results show that China's carbon productivity had obviously positive spatial spillover effect. Export-import significantly improved China's carbon productivity and mainly through import. As for the regional regression results, foreign trade of the western region contributed the most to enhance China's carbon productivity, while the eastern and central regions were at the stage that the foreign trade inhibited carbon productivity. Policy recommendations were put forward in terms of the emphasis of import trade, the optimization of trade structure, the customized measures in different regions to improve carbon productivity. Furthermore, provinces should coordinate with each other and eliminate inter-regional barriers to promote the market-oriented distribution of production factors, in order to realize the spillover effect of carbon productivity.

The goal is to test whether or not European states view US expenditures as a complement or as a substitute to their own military expenditures. Past work in this area has found mixed results concerning the effect of US military expenditures, but focus strictly on the spillins within a formal alliance, specifically NATO, and use a time series dominated by Cold War dynamics. This study differentiates itself by accounting for both US total military expenditures and its regional expenditures through incorporation of US military base and personnel deployments across Europe. Additionally, this paper uses government revenue in its estimation to mitigate potential endogeneity. Findings using Arellano-Bond dynamic panel analysis suggest that there is a strong probability of substitution among European states.","[Spangler, Ethan] Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",Washington State University,"Spangler, E (通讯作者)，Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",ethan.spangler@wsu.edu,,,,,,,29,11,11,0,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

The value of the good of either firm to any buyer depends on the number of neighbors on the network who adopt the same good. When the size of externalities increases linearly with the number of adoptions, we identify the set of pricing strategies that are consistent with an equilibrium in which one of the firms monopolizes the market. The set includes marginal cost (MC) pricing as well as bipartition pricing, which offers discounts to some buyers and charges markups to others. We show that MC pricing fails to be an equilibrium under non-linear externalities in a general network, but identify conditions for an equilibrium with bipartition pricing to be robust against perturbations in the externalities from linearity. The analysis is applied to platform competition in a two-sided market under local and approximately linear externalities. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

We find that monetary shocks cause adjustments of oil prices and industrial prices to be vastly different in the long-run, thereby indicting non-neutrality of money in the long-run. It is also found that oil prices tend to adjust more quickly than industrial (sticky) prices to monetary shocks to achieve the long-run equilibrium, thereby affecting relative prices in the short run.

Our baseline results show that the increase in minimum wage can explain about 32.3% of the growth in outward FDI from China over 2001-2012. We use three different strategies to address potential endogeneity concerns. First, we control for a number of local macroeconomic variables. Second, to rule out spatially-correlated confounding factors, we employ a regression design based on bordering cities across provincial borders. Lastly, we conduct a placebo test by studying the effects of minimum wage increase on FDI to tax-haven destinations. We then examine the heterogeneous effects of minimum wage increase. We find the effects on outward FDI to be stronger for more productive firms, those with foreign ownership, those in the more labor-intensive sectors, those located in the coastal region, for the years after 2004 and for production-oriented FDI projects.","[Fan, Haichao] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Inst World Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Lin, Faqin] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Tang, Lixin] Jinan Univ, Inst Econ & Social Res, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Fan, Haichao] Shanghai Inst Int Finance & Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Fudan University; Central University of Finance & Economics; Jinan University; Shanghai Institute of International Finance & Economics,"Tang, LX (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Inst Econ & Social Res, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",fan_haichao@fudan.edu.cn; linfaqin@cufe.edu.cn; lixintang.tang@gmail.com,"Tang, Lixin/G-9741-2019",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71603155, 71572048, 71503281, 71773148]; National Social Science Foundation of China [16ZDA043]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),"We thank Mi Dai, Shi Li, Carl Lin, Shuang Ma, David Neumark, Larry Qiu, Suhua Tian, Zhi Yu, Linke Zhu, Ben Zou and seminar participants at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics and Beijing Normal University for useful comments.

Using a binary instrumental variable, I characterize the sharp identified set for the local average treatment effect under the exclusion restriction of an instrument and the deterministic monotonicity of the true treatment in the instrument. Even allowing for general measurement error (e.g., the measurement error is endogenous), it is still possible to obtain finite bounds on the local average treatment effect. Notably, the Wald estimand is an upper bound on the local average treatment effect, but it is not the sharp bound in general. I also provide a confidence interval for the local average treatment effect with uniformly asymptotically valid size control. Furthermore, I demonstrate that the identification strategy of this paper offers a new use of repeated measurements for tightening the identified set.","[Ura, Takuya] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Ura, T (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",takura@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,52,11,11,2,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

In a deception game we investigate experimentally which factors could improve advice quality. Besides advisor competition and identifiability, we add the possibility for clients to make a voluntary payment, a bonus, after observing advice quality. While the combination of competition and reputation concerns achieves the highest rate of truthful advice, we observe a similar effect, when the bonus is combined with one of them. Thus, our results suggest that a voluntary component can act as a substitute for either competition or reputation, decreasing moral hazard. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

By adopting a sibling-differences strategy, we are able to obtain estimates that are not biased by unobserved genetic factors and family background which affect both education and health. To address the potential endogenous shocks that affect siblings differently within the family, we further employ an instrumental variable approach by exploiting a profound disturbance in the education system during the Cultural Revolution in China. The within-sibling estimates suggest that an additional year of schooling is found to be positively related to health status later in life (better self-reported health, lower probability of feeling uncomfortable, getting chronic diseases, and being underweight).

We document a gender gap in criminal activities, based on property crimes, using data from the U.S. National Incident Based Reporting System from 1995 to 2015. We show that there is a gender participation gap, with only 30 percent of the crimes being committed by females. We try to explain the gender participation gap by focusing on incentives to commit crime, such as criminal earnings and probability of arrest. We show that on average females earn 13% less than males while they face a 9% lower likelihood of arrest. We find that males respond more to changes in illegal earnings, with an elasticity of 0.36, while females are less responsive with an elasticity of 0.23. Both genders respond equally to changes in the probability of arrest, with an elasticity around -0.14. Using a Blinder-Oaxaca type decomposition technique, we find that differences in incentives explain about 8 % of the gender participation gap, while differences in responsiveness to changes in incentives, especially illegal earnings, explain about 56% of the gap. The fact that females behave differently than males has implications for the heterogeneity in response to crime control policies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The expansion removes the requirement that young individuals need to be enrolled as full-time students in order to remain on their parents' health insurance past the age of 18 and expands the coverage mandate to age 26 irrespective of student status. This changes the incentives for the full-time college enrollment decisions of young individuals. We use panel data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) for the years 2003-2013 and estimate that the dependent coverage expansion under the ACA decreases the probability to enroll as full-time student by 3 percentage points using a difference-in-differences framework. Furthermore, we find that part-time college enrollment is unaffected by the new policy.

If the decisions whether to pursue the action are made simultaneously, then neither or both may acquiesce leading to an inefficient outcome. However, inefficiency may be reduced if players move sequentially. We test this experimentally by introducing repeated two-stage versions of such a game where the action is individually profitable. In one version, players may wait in the first stage to see what their partner did and then coordinate in the second stage. In another version, sequential decision-making is imposed by assigning one player to move in stage one and the other in stage two. Although there are fewer cooperative decisions in the two-stage treatments, we show that overall subjects coordinate better on efficient cooperation and on avoiding both acquiescing. Yet, only some pairs actually achieve higher profits, while the least cooperative pairs do worse in the two-stage games than their single-stage counterparts. For these, rather than facilitating coordination, the additional stage invites unsuccessful attempts to disguise uncooperative play, which are met with punishment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

To this end, we estimate their policy rules in which primary surpluses respond to public debt and examine whether estimated policy rules satisfy the conditions for fiscal solvency. In the baseline solvency tests with time-invariant marginal responses of primary surpluses, we find that estimated policy rules satisfy the solvency condition that the marginal response be positive for the Benelux, northern, and eastern groups but fail to do so for the western and southern groups. When estimating their policy rules separately for eurozone and non-eurozone countries, we find that long-term fiscal sustainability of eurozone countries is more questionable in the sense that non-eurozone countries in all regional groups have significantly positive marginal responses, whereas eurozone countries in most regional groups do not. Finally, more general solvency tests that allow time-varying marginal responses reveal that only the Southern group fails to satisfy the generalized solvency conditions that marginal responses be always nonnegative and positive infinitely often. These findings seem to be consistent with the fact that countries in the Southern group experienced severe fiscal crises.","[Lee, Kyung-woo; Sung, Taeyoon] Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea; [Kim, Jong-Hee] Chonbuk Natl Univ, Dept Econ, 567 Baekje Daero, Jeonju Si 55896, Jeonbuk Do, South Korea",Yonsei University; Jeonbuk National University,"Sung, T (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea.",kwlee76@yonsei.ac.kr; jonghk5@jbnu.ac.kr; tsung@yonsei.ac.kr,,,,,,,15,9,9,1,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

An important yet often neglected NCD is mental disorder, which accounts for 14% of global disease burden but has been paid relatively little research attention in China. This paper uses a nationally representative dataset to investigate the prevalence and correlates of depression and depressive symptoms among the adult population in China. Our results indicate that the prevalence rate of depression, estimated with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), is high (37.9% for depressive symptoms and 4.1% for depression) and unevenly distributed across regions and subpopulations. Specifically, women, older people and those who live in the central/western and rural areas are more likely to be depressed. We also find significant socioeconomic gradients in mental health: higher education and income levels are associated with lower likelihood of depression, especially among the lower socioeconomic groups. Our results indicate the urgent need for depression prevention and treatment in China (particularly in the economically less developed regions) through the expansion of primary mental health care resources and a reduction of socioeconomic inequalities.

The authors exploit the flat-rate structure of China's corporate income tax, along with its system of targeted, preferential rates, to estimate the relationship between profits and tax rates. Their sample consists of approximately 60,000 observations of foreign-owned MNCs from the years 2005-2009. Using the traditional approach of regressing before-tax profits on tax rates, the authors find evidence consistent with profit-shifting. However, this approach is suspect because the nature of China's tax preferences makes it especially vulnerable to omitted variable bias. Accordingly, the authors employ finite mixture modelling to search for the existence of a group of profitshifting-MNCs. While their analysis identifies two types of firms, subsequent investigation failed to produce any evidence linking these to profit-shifting behavior. Robustness checks exploiting the panel nature of the dataset, along with further investigation of investmenttax elasticities, confirm the authors' null finding of profit-shifting. One reason for the lack of profit-shifting among Chinese MNCs may be that corporate tax rates were relatively low during this period.","[Qian, Xuefeng; Tian, Bifei; Chen, Ziruo] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Business Adm, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Reed, W.

We construct the dynamic network structure using the network connectedness measure of Diebold and Yilmaz (2009). We investigate the structural changes in connectedness of OPEC and non-OPEC members. Additionally, we study how the influence of OPEC members, non-OPEC countries and major oil producers evolve. We find that the network structure of major oil-producing countries changes significantly over time. Specifically, the impact of changes in oil-production of all OPEC members on global oil production declines, whereas the impact of non-OPEC on global oil production increases. OPEC's increase decisions have a significant and positive impact on OPEC and non-OPEC coordination. However, cut decisions do not affect coordination. We find that OPEC countries and developing countries have significantly higher levels of connectedness. Additionally, countries with high oil production levels have significantly more influence. The empirical results provide intuition about the recent developments in global oil production. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Our estimates suggest that the monetary and non-monetary components enter additively into marriage surplus, but with gender-specific marginal rates of substitution: divorce hazard is more sensitive to the non-pecuniary dissatisfaction of the wife than to that of the husband; impacts of the monetary components are also gender-specific and highly non-linear.

We present a meta-analysis of 74 primary studies containing 1120 estimates of the direct rebound effect in road transport to evaluate its magnitude and identify its determinants. We find that the short-run rebound effect is, on average, about 10-12%, whereas the long-run effect about 26-29%. However, variation of estimates is large and can mainly be explained by differences in the time horizon considered, the elasticity measure used, and the type of data and econometric approach employed in primary studies.

Our approach, which we denote by group transfer entropy, measures the overall sensitivity of a process to lagged realizations of a group of other processes. We supplement our measure by a suitable block bootstrap approach which allows to conduct inference. Our empirical analysis uses daily data of OVX, VIX, GVZ, and EVZ from 2008 to 2017. The results show that oil and stock market volatility are the most affected by past volatility changes in the other markets, which highlights the importance for investors to hedge against this predictable risk transmission.

Utilizing a standard Bayesian model comparison method, this paper formally determines four regimes existing in the market. It then employs a Markov switching vector autoregressive model to investigate the regime dependent responses of the market to its fundamental shocks. The results reveal that the US natural gas market tends to be much more sensitive to shocks occurring in regimes existing after the Decontrol Act 1989 than the other regimes. The paper also finds that shocks to the natural gas demand and price have negligible effects on natural gas production while the price of natural gas is mainly driven by specific demand shocks. Augmenting the model by incorporating the price of crude oil, the results show that the impacts of oil price shocks on natural gas prices are relatively small and regime-dependent.

Purpose of the article: This article is devoted to empirical evidence Whether there are signs of small business ability to compensate for negative trends, emerging in the sectors of large and medium-sized business in Ukraine. Methods: The dynamics of gross value added was chosen as the main indicator of small business potential to create compensatory effect for reduction in employment, share of value added and GDP, observed in sector of large and medium-sized business. For factor analysis of actual gross added value dynamics, the authors have built a multiplicative term, which expresses the different characteristics of economic activity in small, large and medium-sized business impact on the gross added value dynamics. The authors have also evaluated the specific impact of these factors using the method of chained substitution. Findings & Value added: The results obtained by factors analysis did not prove the thesis about small business capacity to compensate for the negative trends observed in the sector of large and medium business. The trend of economic activity in small business sector, trend of labor productivity, and trend in dynamics of added value share in small business output were causes of gross value added decreasing in the national economy during the period researched. These results can be interpreted as a sign that in case of unchanged quality indicators of economic activity in small business sector (in the first turn, the labor productivity and share of value added in output) this sector ability to compensate Cor negative trends in large business will be very doubtful.","[Kalchenko, Sergei; Trusova, Natalia] Tavria State Agrotechnol Univ, Bohdana Khmelnytskoho Ave 18, UA-72300 Melitopol, Zaporizka Oblas, Ukraine; [Hrybova, Diana; Serhii, Biliaiev] Melitopol Bohdan Khmelnitsky State Pedag Univ, Kiev, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Dmytro Motornyi Tavria State Agrotechnological University; Bogdan Khmelnitsky Melitopol State Pedagogical University,"Kalchenko, S (通讯作者)，Tavria State Agrotechnol Univ, Bohdana Khmelnytskoho Ave 18, UA-72300 Melitopol, Zaporizka Oblas, Ukraine.",5nk14336@ua.fm,"Grybova, Diana/P-9903-2019; Trusova, Natalia/P-8923-2019; Biliaiev, Serhii/B-5112-2018","Trusova, Natalia/0000-0001-9773-4534; Kal'cenko, Sergei/0000-0001-6609-3893",,,,,24,9,9,0,2,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

The results suggest that the very fact of a firm's location in a resource-dependent country is an overlooked country-specific determinant of the firm's capital structure and that financial institutions in resource-dependent countries may play a role in exacerbating a nation's resource curse.","[Kurronen, Sanna] Univ Helsinki, Arkadiankatu 7, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Kurronen, S (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Arkadiankatu 7, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",sanna.kurronen@gmail.com,,,Education Fund of Finland,Education Fund of Finland,"I would like to present my most sincere gratitude to Zuzana Fungacova for her tireless support in this research.

It suggests these differences can be viewed as an expression of cultural habits. We explore different ways of defining exposure to the communist regime: using number of years a person spent under the regime and also a dummy indicator for spending formative years (18-25) in it. We find both to be strong factors in explaining alcohol consumption behaviour. We consider differences in frequency of alcohol consumption and binge drinking using European Health Interview Survey (EHIS) micro data from Eurostat. Estimations are run with ordered probit model for men and women separately. Evidence suggests a statistically significant effect of experiencing communist regimes, which is larger for women's alcohol consumption frequency than for men's. It is also the most important factor in explaining more frequent male binge drinking. These effects hold after controlling for socio-economic, country level and time characteristics. This suggests the attitudes towards alcohol consumption could be more permissive in the Eastern Bloc countries.","[Malisauskaite, Gintare; Klein, Alexander] Univ Kent, Canterbury, Kent, England",University of Kent,"Malisauskaite, G (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Canterbury, Kent, England.",G.Malisauskaite@kent.ac.uk,"Klein, Alexander/KBQ-6003-2024","Malisauskaite, Gintare/0000-0002-0797-5949",,,,,21,5,5,0,8,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-5967,1095-7227,,J COMP ECON,J.

This paper theoretically and empirically investigates this trade-off through analysing the relationship between traditional output multipliers and debt multipliers' (the impact of policy on government debt). Theoretically the elasticity between the two is the marginal tax rate from movements of output in response to policy. This leads to two further hypotheses: first, if the marginal tax rate in the private sector is higher than that in the public sector, changes in government spending will result in a larger impact on debt than changes in taxes; and second, fiscal free lunches' are possible with recent estimates of the output multiplier. Indeed, empirically we find that tax revenues increase from exogenous tax cuts when the response of output is high.","[McManus, Richard] Canterbury Christ Church Univ, Canterbury, Kent, England",Canterbury Christ Church University,"McManus, R (通讯作者)，Canterbury Christ Church Univ, Canterbury, Kent, England.",,,"McManus, Richard/0000-0001-8056-0523",,,,,31,0,0,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

In a first step, redistribution measures are estimated with the help of exhaustive administrative data. Redistribution is decomposed into average tax rate and tax progression. In a second step, we investigate the impact of direct democratic institutions and their usage on tax policy and redistribution. The results suggest that the effect of direct democracy on income tax redistribution is a multilayered process. First, the theoretical availability of direct democracy tools does not seem to have the same impact as the effective use of them. Second, fiscal referendums may - in the short term -reduce redistribution through lower tax rates and lead to less tax progression. Third, an increasing number of ballots on initiatives leads to more tax progression and more redistribution in the long run. It seems that the short-term dampening effects of fiscal referendums on redistribution may be overridden in the long run by the expansive effect of popular initiatives.","[Morger, Mario] Ctr Lab & Social Policy Studies BASS, Konsumstr 20, CH-3007 Bern, Switzerland; [Schaltegger, Christoph A.] Univ Lucerne, Dept Econ, Frohburgstr 3, CH-6002 Luzern, Switzerland",University of Lucerne,"Morger, M (通讯作者)，Ctr Lab & Social Policy Studies BASS, Konsumstr 20, CH-3007 Bern, Switzerland.",mario.morger@buerobass.ch; christoph.schaltegger@unilu.ch,,"Morger, Mario/0000-0001-9826-444X",,,,,65,4,4,1,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

The Ramsey rule can be extended to regime-dependent interest-rate formulas for discounting future regime changes. Notwithstanding debate about empirically plausible values of the rate of pure time preference, I theoretically show that the effect of pure time preference is overwhelmingly dominated by the effect of the regime switching parameter.

In some settings, the open-ended format can incite respondents to strategically misrepresent these values and, hence, it may lead to biased welfare measures. Literature has developed several methods, such as an oath or a cheap talk, to encourage truthful disclosure of preferences. These methods rely primarily on positive reinforcement by invoking positive associations of trust, honour and honesty, among others. In this paper, we propose a new approach that seeks to mitigate strategic misrepresentation of preferences by means of negative reinforcement, which arouses negative associations of, for example, mistrust and insincerity. The proposed negative reinforcement approach involves punishment for dishonesty in the form of unfavourable recoding of stated values if those are suspected of being untruthful. The approach is examined in a field survey concerning valuation of an entertainment event in the Plant Garden in Nantes, France. The survey makes value overstatement potentially attractive to respondents. We find that respondents who are aware of subsequent unfavourable recoding of insincere (i.e., overstated) values to zeros state significantly lower willingness-to-pay values than respondents who are not faced with the possible recoding of their answers. The effectiveness of the proposed negative reinforcement approach in reducing value overstatement is assessed against an existing positive reinforcement approach, namely against using the oath. Both approaches are observed to generate statistically equivalent value estimates, pointing to their similar effectiveness in mitigating incentives to overstate values.","[Zawojska, Ewa] Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland; [Mahieu, Pierre-Alexandre] Univ Nantes, LEMNA, Nantes, France; [Sourd, Romain Crastes dit] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Choice Modelling Ctr, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Louviere, Jordan] Univ South Australia, Sch Mkt, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of Warsaw; Nantes Universite; University of Leeds; University of South Australia,"Zawojska, E (通讯作者)，Dluga 44-50, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland.",ezawojska@wne.uw.edu.pl,"Zawojska, Ewa/AAN-1584-2020","Zawojska, Ewa/0000-0002-9038-2019; Louviere, Jordan/0000-0001-7688-164X","European Research Council [615596-DECISIONS]; National Science Centre in Poland [2014/15/N/ HS4/01328, 2016/20/T/HS4/00013]","European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); National Science Centre in Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","We gratefully thank the anonymous reviewers whose valuable comments helped us improve the paper considerably.

Our results show that capabilities driven by corporate governance mechanisms currently constitute the pivotal support for firms' innovation capacity (FIC). Our main findings are that corporate governance drivers such as executive incentives (E-P) and the presence of independent nonexecutive directors (INEDs) have a bearing on FIC. Meanwhile, managerial performance (MP) and institutional shareholder activism (AI) emerge as basic motivational instruments and mechanisms of alignment between firm ownership and control. The influence of incentives and INEDs is found to be negative and that of institutional shareholder activism and MP to be positive. With respect to the business context, we find evidence of higher efficiency in firm disciplinary mechanisms in the Anglo-American than in the Continental corporate governance model.","[Bobillo, Alfredo M.; Rodriguez-Sanz, J.

In this paper, we assess the performance of secondary schools from 36 countries (26 OECD countries and 10 partners) participating in PISA 2012. For this purpose, we apply a robust conditional nonparametric approach that allows us to incorporate the effect of contextual factors at both school and country level in the estimation of efficiency measures. Our results suggest that there is a greater heterogeneity across countries than across schools. Particularly, we find that differences in efficiency estimates are mainly explained by economic indicators and cultural values. In contrast, some factors previously identified as potential determinants of student achievement, like the existence of tracking or central examinations, do not seem to significantly affect the efficiency of secondary schools.","[Cordero, Jose M.; Polo, Cristina; Simancas, Rosa] Univ Extremadura, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Avd Elvas S-N, Badajoz 06006, Spain; [Santin, Daniel] Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Appl Econ 6, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain",Universidad de Extremadura; Complutense University of Madrid,"Cordero, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Extremadura, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Avd Elvas S-N, Badajoz 06006, Spain.",jmcordero@unex.es; cristinapf@unex.es; dsantin@ccee.ucm.es; rsimancas@unex.es,"POLO, CRISTINA/GVS-7343-2022; Santín, Daniel/I-7784-2016; FERRERA, JOSE MANUEL CORDERO/S-5567-2018","POLO, CRISTINA/0000-0001-5164-164X; Santín, Daniel/0000-0002-1654-1659; FERRERA, JOSE MANUEL CORDERO/0000-0001-8783-6748; , Rosa/0000-0001-9203-7334","Spanish Ministry for Economy and Competitiveness (Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad) [ECO2017-83759-P]; Junta de Extremadura [IB16171]","Spanish Ministry for Economy and Competitiveness (Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad); Junta de Extremadura","The authors thank the financial support from the Spanish Ministry for Economy and Competitiveness (Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad) through grant ECO2017-83759-P and Junta de Extremadura through grant IB16171.",,103,25,27,1,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Endogenizing the schooling decision avoids overestimation of welfare loss because of the selection effect and the human capital effect.

Such spatial clustering revealed by spatial autocorrelation represents the spatial formations in which the development indicated by migration is statistically similar over the municipal borders. The results of survival analysis indicate that the chronic centripetal tendency of development generates higher path probabilities of a municipality staying in a surplus formation located in the main urban regions and an increased lock-in tendency compared with deficit formations in peripheries. Thus, the growth processes seem to translate into the self-reinforcing spatial formations of growth and decline in population, production and regional competitiveness suspended by economic downturns and recessions, and so this path dependence is cyclic and recurring, which means that paths constitute relatively short pulses. In the great surge of Information and Communication Technology industries in the 1990s, the spatial formations of migration were higher in volume and path-dependent, but against expectations, spatially less stable compared with more modest growth periods.","[Lehtonen, Olli] Nat Resources Inst Finland, Latokartanonkaari 9, FI-00790 Helsinki, Finland; [Tykkylainen, Markku] Univ Eastern Finland, POB 111, FI-80101 Joensuu, Finland",Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); University of Eastern Finland,"Lehtonen, O (通讯作者)，Nat Resources Inst Finland, Latokartanonkaari 9, FI-00790 Helsinki, Finland.",olli.lehtonen@luke.fi,,"Tykkylainen, Markku/0000-0001-5966-3659",,,,,57,2,2,2,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Using a two-country model with financial frictions, we compare adjustments in both countries. We condition one country to adopt a credit easing rule as the monetary regime, regardless of the source of the crisis. We consider results when the other country does nothing, or implements a fiscal (tax-rate) policy rule. Our results show that when both countries experience massive asymmetric shocks, the adoption of optimal policy rules can be used effectively to mitigate negative consequences for both economies. However if the crisis events are due to similar shocks, unconventional monetary policy or fiscal policy can improve conditions in own country, whilst worsening economic conditions in the other country, generating beggar-thy-neighbor growth outcomes.

Naive international diversification does not provide positive benefits for all investors during the 1993-2014 investment period. Relaxing the market allocation weight constraints applied to in sample mean variance optimized portfolios increases the potential for diversification gains. The return-to-risk benefits that these portfolios provide versus the domestic market portfolio are not statistically significant for many investors. There is also an imbalance between the global demand for equity in markets that provide portfolio efficiencies versus the supply of available equity, which is an additional constraint that may limit the efficiency gains that can be captured in equilibrium.

To address this issue, more efficient utilization of the existing network is a paramount alternative to building new transmission lines. Significant transfer capability enhancement can be readily achieved via a number of mature technologies that enable power flow control. Despite the promise of power flow controllers (PFC), their deployment has been very limited, due to a number of reasons, including heavy economic regulation. This has many drawbacks, including lengthy planning and approval time, lack of incentives for efficient planning and operation, and transfer of the investment risks to the ratepayers. This paper argues that PFCs pose characteristics that fit well within the framework of merchant transmission without its drawbacks, such as lumpy investments. This paper, thus, proposes to assign financial transmission rights (FTR) to merchant PFC owners based on the additional transfer capability that they offer to the system. The owners are expected to recover their investment costs through the revenues they collect from such FTRs. Unlike regulated rate of return payment, the proposed model provides the right incentive for efficient planning and operation of PFCs. The paper also proves FIR revenue adequacy in presence of the PFCs by developing a simultaneous feasibility test model. The performance of the method as well as its revenue adequacy are demonstrated, first, on a two-bus system, and then, on a three-bus system in presence of loop flows. The paper concludes that opening the electricity markets to merchant PFC projects would reveal profitable investment opportunities to improve the efficiency of the system. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We begin with a stylized model in which clean analytical expressions are available. The model predicts that a tax rate cut is most stimulative for output in periods in which output is relatively high. The model is also used to discuss some conceptual issues related to the construction of tax multipliers. We then consider a medium-scale DSGE model with tax rates on labor and capital income and on consumption. The model is solved via a third order perturbation. Consonant with the intuition from the analytical model, tax multipliers for all three types of tax rates vary significantly across states, and are most stimulative for output in states in which output is high. To evaluate the normative desirability of tax cuts as a tool to combat recessions, we also study the properties of the tax cut welfare multiplier, which measures the change in aggregate welfare conditional on a tax rate change. In contrast to output multipliers, welfare multipliers are found to be countercyclical. A number of extensions and modifications are considered and our conclusions are generally robust.

This paper also discusses how the measurement reform influenced the gender gap in achievements.","[Song, Yang] Colgate Univ, Dept Econ, 13 Oak Dr, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA",Colgate University,"Song, Y (通讯作者)，Colgate Univ, Dept Econ, 13 Oak Dr, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA.",ysong@colgate.edu,,"Song, Yang/0000-0003-0856-9560",,,,,31,0,0,0,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

Within the rationale for scalability, resides the inherent notion that a microfinance institution could make up for its loan-size disadvantage by disbursing enough small loans that would potentially translate in scale economies and thus cost efficiency gains. We test this assertion in the presence of uncontrolled growth the surge in microfinance lending during the boom years of 2004-2008. In a nutshell, are cost efficiencies evident during rapid microfinance expansion? We find that aggressive microfinance growth consistently results in cost inefficiencies.

For this purpose, we hypothesize that the probabilities of experiencing SD in the Mexican population are higher in individuals with DM2 depending on the type of localities, SD and clinical risk factors considered.

As a result, a shift can be observed in the strategies of empirical studies. They have moved from the use of standard multivariate statistical methods, which identify correlations or associations between variables only, to more complex econometric strategies, which can help to identify causal relationships. However, exogenous variations in databases have to be identified in order to apply causal inference techniques. This is a far from straightforward task. For this reason, this paper provides an extensive and comprehensive overview of the literature using quasi-experimental techniques applied to three well-known international large-scale comparative assessments, such as PISA, PIRLS or TIMSS, over the period 2004-2016. In particular, we review empirical studies employing instrumental variables, regression discontinuity designs, difference in differences and propensity score matching to the above databases. Additionally, we provide a detailed summary of estimation strategies, issues treated and profitability in terms of the quality of publications to encourage further potential evaluations.

While we find that schools in both locations hire more teachers to accommodate the calendar, teacher qualifications do not decrease for North Carolina. Our results are therefore consistent with, and can partly explain, evidence on the impact of YRS on student achievement.

Will the existing international financial institutions give more voices, votes, and top positions to Asia? Or will Asia create its own institutions that would rival the old architecture? This present paper argues, first, that China, and possibly India, will be in a position to be so influential that the international financial architecture may have to go through significant changes. Second, the three large crises in the last 20 years have made Asian countries more confident that they can manage capital flows by accumulating large foreign reserves and by adopting sound macrofinancial policies.

We have three main results, based on a life-cycle model with labor market frictions and labor force participation decisions. First, rising economic turbulence during the 1970s and 1980s accounts for the decline in employment among older workers in the United States. Second, the interaction between turbulence and institutions explains most of the reduction in labor force participation among older workers in Europe over this period, but ultimately explains little of the rise in unemployment. Third, only a small share of the increase in unemployment can be attributed to the early retirement policies that were implemented in Europe from the 1970s up until the early 1990s. Our analysis indicates that incorporating an operative labor supply choice can pose serious challenges to theories aiming to explain the European unemployment problem.","[Lale, Etienne] Univ Quebec Montreal, CIRANO, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Lale, Etienne] IZA, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Universite de Montreal; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Lalé, E (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec Montreal, CIRANO, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;Lalé, E (通讯作者)，IZA, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",lale.etienne@uqam.ca,,,,,,,50,3,3,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

In this paper, we assess the impact of these benefits on the female employment rate in the context of a full life-cycle model in which households decide on female labor supply and savings. One important aspect of our model is that we allow for returns to labor market experience so that participation decisions affect not only current earnings and Social Security pension eligibility but also future earnings. We quantify the effect on female labor supply and on household inequality of (i) removing spousal benefit, (ii) removing both spousal and survivor pension benefits, and (iii) extending from 35 to 40 the number of periods of the working career that are considered when calculating the retired worker's pension. We find that reforms (i) and (ii) significantly increase female employment throughout the life cycle, whereas reform (iii) has a very mild effect. The effect of (ii) on income inequality in older household is large, whereas the effect on consumption inequality is small. All three reforms have substantial effects on Social Security expenditure and fiscal revenues.","[Sanchez-Marcos, Virginia] Univ Canberra, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Bethencourt, Carlos] Univ La Laguna, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain",University of Canberra; Universidad de la Laguna,"Sánchez-Marcos, V (通讯作者)，Univ Canberra, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",sanchezv@unican.es; cbethenc@ull.es,"Bethencourt, Carlos/E-9267-2016; Sanchez-Marcos, Virginia/H-2543-2015","Bethencourt, Carlos/0000-0002-5605-9576; Sanchez-Marcos, Virginia/0000-0001-9260-4327",Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology [ECO2009-09614],Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government),We wish to thank the Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology for financial support under Grant ECO2009-09614.,,42,4,4,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

The pay-as-you-go social security systems of many countries are troubled by the increasing ratio of retirees to working people. In addition, many organizations face difficulties caused by a shrinking workforce and the accompanied shortage of skilled workers. To counteract, it is essential to create an environment in which older workers are encouraged to stay in the workforce. Therefore, it is important to understand which factors influence the retirement timing decision of workers. This study analyzes how widowhood and changes in demographic, health-related, and financial factors lead to changes in retirement plans of Health and Retirement Study (HRS) respondents. I compare respondents' actual retirement age with their retirement plans elicited in the HRS wave prior to retirement. The strongest change in retirement timing is caused by widowhood. Respondents who become widowed retire on average 1.7 years earlier than previously planned. The estimated effect of widowhood goes beyond the deterioration of physical health and mental health. My findings suggest that an intervention in an early stage after widowhood by the employer or by health and social care services can help the widowed employee to overcome the temporary adverse effects of widowhood and to prevent a precipitous retirement decision.","[Schreiber, Philipp] Univ Mannheim, Dept Finance, L9,1-2, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",University of Mannheim,"Schreiber, P (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Dept Finance, L9,1-2, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",phschrei@gmail.com,,"Schreiber, Philipp/0000-0001-6174-2604",,,,,51,3,4,6,17,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

We apply meta-regression analysis to 466 estimates drawn from 59 econometric studies that explore the Solow or Productivity Paradox that there is little impact of ICT on economic growth and productivity. We explore the differential impact of ICT on developed and developing countries and the differential impact of different types of ICT: landlines, cell phones, computer technology and Internet access. After accommodating potential econometric misspecification bias and publication selection bias, we detect evidence that ICT has indeed contributed positively to economic growth, at least on average. Both developed and developing countries benefit from landline and cell technologies, with cell technologies' growth effect approximately twice as strong as landlines. However, developed countries gain significantly more from computing than do developing countries. In contrast, we find little evidence that the Internet has had a positive impact on growth.","[Stanley, T.

This paper analyzes this intellectual shift by using discourse and citation-network analysis of the most-cited scholarly works on banking regulation and systemic risk from 1985 to 2014 and six in-depth interviews with central scholars. It demonstrates that the predominance of formalism, particularly partial equilibrium analysis, in studies on banking regulation pre-crisis impeded economists' engagement with the endogenous sources of systemic risks discussed in the systemic risk sample. These studies excluded observed phenomena that could not be accommodated in mathematical models, largely ignoring contributions based on historical and practitioners' styles of reasoning. Post-crisis, while informal analyses gain prominence in studies on banking regulation, attempts to conceptualize systemic risk as a negative externality indicate the persistence of formalism and equilibrium thinking and its concomitant epistemological limitations that stymie theoretical progress.","[Thiemann, Matthias] Sci Po, Ctr Etud Europeens, Paris, France; [Aldegwy, Mohamed] Cairo Univ, Law Fac, Giza, Egypt; [Ibrocevic, Edin] Goethe Univ, Frankfurt, Germany",Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po); Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University; Goethe University Frankfurt,"Thiemann, M (通讯作者)，Sci Po Ctr Etud Europeenes, 28 Rue St Peres, F-75004 Paris, France.",thiemann@soz.uni-frankfurt.de,"Ibrocevic, Edin/JMP-9041-2023; ibrocevic, edin/JMP-9063-2023","Ibrocevic, Edin/0000-0002-1418-2090",,,,,77,12,13,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The information theoretic approach is predicated on the notion of statistical equilibrium (SE) that takes a distribution over all possible states as an equilibrium, and therefore predicts the endogenous fluctuations of the system along with its central tendency simultaneously. For this reason, SE approaches can explain the observed data without relying on arbitrary assumptions about random noise and provide useful insights for many interesting economic problems that conventional methods have not been able to satisfactorily deal with. In this paper, we review the key elements of information theory focusing on the notions and applications of entropy and SE in economics, particularly paying attention to how entropy concepts open up a new frontline of economic research.","[Yang, Jangho] New Sch Social Res, New York, NY 10011 USA",The New School,"Yang, JH (通讯作者)，New Sch Social Res, New York, NY 10011 USA.",yangj994@newschool.edu,"Yang, Jangho/ABI-4953-2020","Yang, Jangho/0000-0002-7047-1874",,,,,57,20,21,3,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

We analyse the employment and wage changes for these low-wage sectors in the period 2009-2015. It turns out that tradable low-wage sectors are highly affected by minimum wage changes due to a high concentration of employees with wages just above the minimum wage.

A researcher's replication will be successful according to context-specific criteria in the preanalysis plan. The author also argues that the two biggest drawbacks of preanalysis plans-(1) that they discount unexpected but extraordinary findings and (2) that they make it difficult for researchers to prespecify all possible actions in their decision trees-are less relevant for replications compared with new research.

But can the change in the marginal distribution of earnings on its own explain the rise in top income shares? Are top executives replacing capital owners in the group of top-income earners, or are we rather witnessing a fusion of top capital and top earnings? This paper proposes an extension of the copula framework and uses it for exploring the changing composition of top incomes. It illustrates that changes in top income shares can easily be decomposed into respective changes in the marginal distributions of labour and capital income and the changing association between the two types of income. An application using tax record data from Norway shows that the association between top labour and capital incomes grew stronger between 1995 and 2005 in the top half of the wage and capital income distribution, though it declined for the top 1% of capital income receivers. A gender decomposition demonstrates that the association of wage and capital incomes at the top is particularly striking for men, whilst women are largely under-represented in the top halves of the two marginal distributions.","[Aaberge, Rolf] Univ Oslo, Stat Norway, Oslo, Norway; [Aaberge, Rolf] Univ Oslo, ESOP, Dept Econ, Oslo, Norway; [Atkinson, Anthony B.] Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford, England; [Atkinson, Anthony B.] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Atkinson, Anthony B.] Oxford Martin Sch, Inst New Econ Thinking, Oxford, England; [Konigs, Sebastian] OECD Inst Labor Econ, Paris, France; [Konigs, Sebastian] IZA Inst Labour Econ, Bonn, Germany",Statistics Norway; University of Oslo; University of Oslo; University of Oxford; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Oxford; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Aaberge, R (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Stat Norway, Oslo, Norway.;Aaberge, R (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, ESOP, Dept Econ, Oslo, Norway.",rolf.aaberge@ssb.no,,"Konigs, Sebastian/0009-0007-3471-5150",,,,,28,18,18,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

The Human Capital (HC) approach was used to estimate the social benefit arising from an additional childbirth. The value of a newborn child was calculated by summing up the discounted value of all expected future gross earnings of the individual, including an imputed value for household production. The estimation takes into account life expectancy and the probability of being employed or in household production by age-groups. Input data was obtained from Eurostat and the Human Mortality Database. In 2012, the purchasing power parity adjusted present value (PV) of a newborn child was EUR 108.4 thousand in Bulgaria and EUR 803.6 thousand in Denmark. By applying the actual exchange rates, the difference between the lowest value (EUR 48.8 thousand in Bulgaria) and the highest value (EUR 1.1 million in Switzerland) was increased. The PV was highly sensitive to the discount rate. The fertility interventions are expected to gain popularities among other health priorities as a tool to counter generation ageing. However, in order to enhance fertility among other health priorities, policy-makers must take into account the full social value based on the local estimates.","[Agh, Tamas; Gaspar, Katalin; Nagy, Balazs; Kalo, Zoltan] Syreon Res Inst, Budapest, Hungary; [Nagy, Balazs] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Fac Social Sci, Dept Hlth Policy & Hlth Econ, Budapest, Hungary; [Lehmann, Matthieu] PregLem SA, Geneva, Switzerland; [Kalo, Zoltan] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Fac Social Sci, Dept Hlth Policy & Econ, Inst Econ, Budapest, Hungary",Eotvos Lorand University; Gedeon Richter Chemistry Works; Eotvos Lorand University,"Kaló, Z (通讯作者)，Syreon Res Inst, Budapest, Hungary.;Kaló, Z (通讯作者)，Eotvos Lorand Univ, Fac Social Sci, Dept Hlth Policy & Econ, Inst Econ, Budapest, Hungary.",tamas.agh@syreon.eu; gaspark2@hotmail.com; balazs.nagy@syreon.eu; matthieu.lehmann@preglem.com; kalo@tatk.elte.hu,"Kalo, Zoltan/G-7582-2011","Kalo, Zoltan/0000-0001-7762-2607; Agh, Tamas/0000-0002-9609-0236","Gedeon Richter Plc., Hungary","Gedeon Richter Plc., Hungary","This research was financially supported by Gedeon Richter Plc., Hungary.

The climate change mitigation policies include carbon tax, emission trading, renewable portfolio standard, feed-in tariff, and renewable fuel standard. The total marginal effect of inequality on CO2 emission is divided into direct, indirect, and interaction effects. Results show that high-income inequality directly raises CO2 emission while indirectly reducing it through its impact on economic growth. Inequality weakens the effectiveness of certain climate change mitigation policies through an interaction effect between inequality and climate change mitigation policies. Whether inequality increases CO2 emission or vice versa cannot be confirmed from the empirical outcomes of total marginal effects of inequality on CO(2 )emission under different climate change mitigation policies. However, the effectiveness of climate change mitigation policies may be diminished when high inequality exists in a country.","[Bae, Jeong Hwan] Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Yangsantaekjiro 20,Hyunjin Evervil 109-301, Gwangju, South Korea",Chonnam National University,"Bae, JH (通讯作者)，Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Yangsantaekjiro 20,Hyunjin Evervil 109-301, Gwangju, South Korea.",jhbae@jnu.ac.kr,,,,,,,36,21,21,3,42,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

The effect of geopolitical risks (GPRs) is found to be heterogeneous across the BRICS stock markets, suggesting that news regarding geopolitical tensions do not affect return dynamics in these markets in a uniform way. GPRs are generally found to impact stock market volatility measures rather than returns, and often at return quantiles below the median, indicating the role of GPRs as a driver of bad volatility in these markets. While Russia bears the greatest risk exposure to GPRs in terms of both return and volatility, India is found to be the most resilient BRICS nation in the group. Noting that geopolitical shocks and in particular terrorist incidents are largely unanticipated, our findings underscore the importance of a strong financial sector that can help return the market to stability and an open economy that allows local investors to diversify country-specific risks in their portfolios.","[Balcilar, Mehmet] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Econ, Via Mersin 10, Famagusta, Northern Cyprus, Turkey; [Balcilar, Mehmet; Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Balcilar, Mehmet] Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier, France; [Bonato, Matteo] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, Auckland Pk, South Africa; [Demirer, Riza] Southern Illinois Univ Edwardsville, Dept Econ & Finance, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA",Eastern Mediterranean University; University of Pretoria; Montpellier Business School; University of Johannesburg; Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University Edwardsville,"Demirer, R (通讯作者)，Southern Illinois Univ Edwardsville, Dept Econ & Finance, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA.",mehmet@mbalcilar.net; mbonato@uj.ac.za; rdemire@siue.edu; rangan.gupta@up.ac.za,"Demirer, Riza/D-2981-2015; BALCILAR, MEHMET/K-7346-2019","Demirer, Riza/0000-0002-1840-8085; BALCILAR, MEHMET/0000-0001-9694-5196",,,,,43,151,156,9,82,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0939-3625,1878-5433,,ECON SYST,Econ.

Using a quantitative model to match the key aggregate and distributional features of the U.S. economy over the period 1990-2015, we show that the welfare-maximizing share of public investment in GDP depends critically on whether one internalizes the transition path between stationary equilibria or not. When welfare changes are evaluated by only comparing long-run stationary equilibria, the model implies that the government should increase infrastructure investment above its average share of 4 percent of GDP in the data. However, once the transition path and short-run dynamics are internalized, welfare-maximization generates an intertemporal trade-off in the path of infrastructure spending: a short-run increase significantly above its observed share in the data, but a long-run decline below this share to satisfy the government's budget constraint.","[Chatterjee, Santanu] Univ Georgia, Dept Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Gibson, John; Rioja, Felix] Georgia State Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Chatterjee, S (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Dept Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",schatt@uga.edu; jgibson25@gsu.edu; frioja@gsu.edu,,,,,,,20,7,8,2,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0164-0704,1873-152X,,J MACROECON,J.

A household is considered to be over-indebted if it is in default or arrears on a loan or if its ratio of debt service to income exceeds 50 percent. The persistence of over-indebtedness was tested using a Heckman random effects dynamic probit model controlling for the effect of household demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral characteristics. For Thailand, but not for Vietnam, past experience of over-indebtedness increases the probability of being over-indebted in the present, controlling for other household characteristics. Village support systems in Vietnam may be more effective in delivering households out of over-indebtedness than in Thailand where heavy debt burdens are taken more for granted. Household characteristics that significantly increase the probability of over-indebtedness include poverty, household size, low education, overly optimistic forecasting of income, and a sense of being less well off than other villagers.

As sectors with faster TFP growth produce more real output over time, their relative prices fall, with the price changes triggering increases in consumption demand that less than offset the price fall. As a result sectoral shares in nominal output decline. This generates a structural shift of the labour factor input to low productivity sectors over time. Policies targeting returns to labour and wage growth alone will be insufficient to address unemployment. Instead, policies targeting the supply side of the economy and international competitiveness are likely more effective for raising employment and growth. The paper is the first to test the TFP-price elasticity mechanism on emerging market data, and a first explanation of unbalanced growth in South Africa.","[Fedderke, Johannes W.] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Fedderke, JW (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",jwf15@psu.edu,"Fedderke, Johannes/N-1411-2019","Fedderke, Johannes/0000-0003-4482-5939",,,,,73,6,9,0,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

This paper revisits this hypothesis. We estimate the effect of crime on business ownership and performance using a matched dataset of census, survey and police data. In contrast to previous studies, which take into account perceived rather than actual crime and often focus on specific geographic areas, we do not find robust evidence that high crime rates have a negative impact on business ownership. Even though our estimate of the effect of crime is statistically significant and negative, it is economically small. Further, we find no evidence for a negative effect of actual crime on sales, profits and investment of informal businesses. This may imply that the low share of business ownership and self-employment in South Africa must have other reasons. These results may also suggest that crime may not be in general a serious threat for small businesses in low and middle income countries, however, this needs further empirical research.","[Grabrucker, Katharina; Grimm, Michael] Univ Passau, Chair Dev Econ, Innstr 29, D-94032 Passau, Germany; [Grimm, Michael] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Passau; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Grimm, M (通讯作者)，Univ Passau, Chair Dev Econ, Innstr 29, D-94032 Passau, Germany.",katharina.grabrucker@uni-passau.de; michael.grimm@uni-passau.de,,,,,,,60,4,4,0,12,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-5967,1095-7227,,J COMP ECON,J.

For both the mortgage and corporate rates, the passthrough shows significant structural shifts that can be entirely and largely explained by bank deleveraging.

J,"Han, C; Shin, K",,,,"Han, Chirok; Shin, Kwanho",,,What Explains Current Account Surplus in Korea?,ASIAN ECONOMIC PAPERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MODELS,"Since the currency crisis in 1998, Korea has experienced continuous current account surpluses. Recently, the current account surplus increased more rapidly-amounting to 7.7 percent of GDP in 2015. In this paper, we investigate the underlying reasons for the widening of Korea's current account surpluses. We find that the upward trend in Korea's current account surpluses is largely explained by its demographical changes. Other economic variables are only helpful when explaining short run fluctuations in current account balances. Moreover, we show that Korea's current account surplus is expected to disappear by 2042 as it becomes one of the most aged economies in the world. Demographic changes are so powerful that they explain, quite successfully, the current account balance trends of other economies with highly aged populations such as Japan, Germany, Italy, Finland, and Greece. When we add the real exchange rate as an additional explanatory variable, it is statistically significant with the right sign, but the magnitude explained by it is quite limited. For example, to reduce the current account surplus by 1 percentage point, a 12 percent depreciation is needed. If Korea's current exchange rate is undervalued 4 to 12 percent less than the level consistent with fundamentals, it is impossible to reduce Korea's current account surplus to a reasonable level by adjusting the exchange rate alone. Another way to reduce current account surplus is to expand fiscal policies. We find, however, that the impact of fiscal adjustments in reducing current account surplus is even more limited. According to our estimates, reducing the current account surplus by 1 percentage point requires an increase in budget deficits (as a ratio to GDP) of 5 to 6 percentage points. If we allow endogenous movements of exchange rate and fiscal policy, the impact of exchange rate adjustment increases by 1.6 times but that of fiscal policy decreases that it is no longer statistically significant.","[Han, Chirok; Shin, Kwanho] Korea Univ, Dept Econ, 5-1 Anam Dong, Seoul 136701, South Korea",Korea University,"Han, C (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Econ, 5-1 Anam Dong, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",chirokhan@korea.ac.kr; khshin@korea.ac.kr,"Shin, Kwanho/AAL-7502-2021","Shin, Kwanho/0000-0001-9747-7603",KIEP; Korea University [K1710071],KIEP; Korea University,"We appreciate the helpful comments of Sung-Chun Jung, Doo Yong Yang, Jae Ryang Lee, Jong-Wha Lee and Deok Ryong Yoon at the KIEP-IMF conference.

The Finnish education system is unusual also because there are no national testing programmes, and information on school quality measures is not publicly disclosed. Is school quality capitalized into house prices in this environment? Using a boundary discontinuity research design and data from Helsinki, we find that it is: 1 standard deviation increase in average test scores increases prices on average by 3%, which is comparable to findings from the UK and the USA. We argue that this surprisingly large effect is at least partly explained by the inelasticity of housing supply, as we use data from a densely populated urban area. We also show that the effect depends on local land supply conditions within the city and is highest in areas with inelastic supply. Furthermore, the price premium seems to be related to pupils' socioeconomic background rather than school effectiveness.","[Harjunen, Oskari] Aalto Univ Sch Business, Helsinki, Finland; [Harjunen, Oskari] City Helsinki Execut Off Urban Res & Stat, Helsinki, Finland; [Kortelainen, Mika; Saarimaa, Tuukka] VATT Inst Econ Res, Helsinki, Finland; [Kortelainen, Mika] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England",Aalto University; VATT Institute for Economic Research; University of Manchester,"Harjunen, O (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ Sch Business, Helsinki, Finland.;Harjunen, O (通讯作者)，City Helsinki Execut Off Urban Res & Stat, Helsinki, Finland.",oskari.harjunen@aalto.fi; mika.kortelainen@vatt.fi; tuukka.saarimaa@vatt.fi,"Saarimaa, Tuukka/AAL-4179-2020; Kortelainen, Mika/C-8030-2011","Saarimaa, Tuukka/0000-0001-5671-4836; Kortelainen, Mika/0000-0001-7868-9651",Academy of Finland [255445]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [255445] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Research Council of Finland),"The authors thank two anonymous referees, the editors of the special issue, Essi Eerola, Elias Einio, Peter Fredriksson, Stephen Machin, Antti Moisio, Mattias Nordin, Tuomas Pekkarinen, Matti Sarvimaki, Olmo Silva, Janne Tukiainen, and the seminar participants at CESifo, FDPE, ERSA 2013, HECER, Jyvaskyla, RES, and VATT for their useful comments.

Previous experimental studies have shown that these higher-order risk preferences affect the choices of individuals deciding privately on lotteries that only affect their own payoff. Yet, many risky and financially relevant decisions are made in the social settings of households or organizations. We elicit higher-order risk preferences of individuals and systematically vary how an individual's decision is made (alone or while communicating with a partner) and who is affected by the decision (only the individual or the partner as well). In doing so, we can isolate the effects of other-regarding concerns and communication on choices. Our results reveal that the majority of choices are risk averse, prudent, and temperate across social settings. We also observe that individuals are influenced significantly by the preferences of a partner when they are able to communicate and choices are payoff-relevant for both of them.","[Heinrich, Timo] Univ Durham, Business Sch, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England; [Mayrhofer, Thomas] Stralsund Univ Appl Sci, Sch Business Studies, Stralsund, Germany; [Mayrhofer, Thomas] Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Boston, MA USA; [Mayrhofer, Thomas] Harvard Univ, Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Durham University; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School,"Heinrich, T (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Business Sch, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England.",timo.heinrich@ibes.uni-due.de,,"Mayrhofer, Thomas/0000-0001-6287-5185; Heinrich, Timo/0000-0001-6827-1374",German Research Foundation (DFG) [FOR 655]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through the IN-EAST School of Advanced Studies [01UC1304],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through the IN-EAST School of Advanced Studies,"We thank the co-editor Charles N.

The literature on the endogenous choice of capital-and labor-augmenting technical change finds that technical change is purely labor-augmenting in steady state. The present paper shows that this finding is mainly an artifact of the underlying mathematical models. To make this point, Uzawa's steady-state growth theorem is generalized to a neoclassical economy that, besides consumption and capital accumulation, uses current output to create technical progress or to manufacture intermediates. The generalized steady-state growth theorem is shown to encompass four models of endogenous capital-and labor-augmenting technical change and the typical model of the induced innovations literature of the 1960s.","[Irmen, Andreas] Univ Luxembourg, CREA, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Irmen, Andreas] CESifo, Munich, Germany",University of Luxembourg; Ifo Institut,"Irmen, A (通讯作者)，Univ Luxembourg, CREA, Fac Law Econ & Finance, 162A Ave Faiencerie, L-1511 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",airmen@uni.lu,,"Irmen, Andreas/0000-0003-0410-8855",University of Luxembourg under the program Agecon C - Population Aging: An Exploration of its Effect on Economic Performance and Culture,University of Luxembourg under the program Agecon C - Population Aging: An Exploration of its Effect on Economic Performance and Culture,"This paper is a revised and extended version of my CESifo Working Paper Irmen (2013).

These viewpoints are especially important for modem free trade agreements (FTAs) analysis where impacts depend largely upon changes in non-tariff measures (NTMs) affecting trade cost. However, existing Melitz extensions for CGEs seem to struggle with numerical stability problems limiting sectoral and regional detail. That greatly reduces their usefulness for policy relevant analysis. We, therefore, develop a Melitz extension for a modular CGE with a focus on a numerical stability. Using the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) proposal as an illustrative example, we treat 22 manufacturing out of 57 sectors based on Melitz in an application with ten global regions and compare our findings to an Armington specification. Our results confirm the larger welfare and trade changes under the Melitz setting suggested both by theory and by empirical findings. We finally compare the sensitivity of trade and welfare impact when the same cost savings associated with reduced NTMs are differently allocated to variable and fixed cost of bilateral trade. We find in our application that the change in traded quantities is more sensitive to bilateral variable cost while welfare increases are more driven by reduced fixed cost, reflecting love of variety effects. Overall, the application underlines that our numerically robust implementation of the Melitz model in a CGE allows applications with high sectoral detail and thus opens the door to a more widespread application in impact assessments.","[Jafari, Yaghoob; Britz, Wolfgang] Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Nussallee 21, D-53115 Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn,"Jafari, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Nussallee 21, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",yaghoob.jafari@ilr.uni-bonn.de,"Britz, Wolfgang/I-3046-2014","Britz, Wolfgang/0000-0002-8532-3823",,,,,53,15,15,2,27,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

We conduct laboratory experiments in which subjects choose between a risky (in terms of exposure to unemployment) and a secure job after being assigned in early rounds to both types of jobs. Both jobs involve the same typing task. The risky job adds the element of a known probability that the typing opportunity will not be available in any given period. Subjects were informed of the exogenous risk premium being offered for the risky job. Women were more likely than men to select the secure job, and these job choices accounted for between 40% and 77% of the gender wage gap in the experiments. A method for classifying subjects according to risk preferences is derived from the theoretical framework and further demonstrates the higher incidence of risk aversion among women.","[Jung, SeEun] Inha Univ, Incheon, South Korea; [Choe, Chung] Hanyang Univ, ERICA Campus, Seoul, South Korea; [Oaxaca, Ronald L.] Univ Arizona, PRESAGE, LISER, IZA, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",Inha University; Hanyang University; University of Arizona,"Choe, C (通讯作者)，55 Hanyangdaehak Ro, Ansan 15588, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",choechung@hanyang.ac.kr,"Choe, Chung/L-6921-2013","Choe, Chung/0000-0002-5173-9644",University of Arizona; Georgia State University; Kent State University; University of Paris I/Paris School of Economics; Paris School of Economics [Fond de Recherche PSE 2014/2015-Dossier N4],University of Arizona; Georgia State University; Kent State University; University of Paris I/Paris School of Economics; Paris School of Economics,"We gratefully acknowledge helpful comments from Alberto Davila, Martin Dufwenberg, Jungmin Lee, Alston Mackenzie, Gary Solon, and from conference and seminar participants at the University of Arizona, Georgia State University, Kent State University, and the University of Paris I/Paris School of Economics.

The optimal policy is given by the stagewise feedback Stackelberg equilibrium of a dynamic policy game between a regulator and a monopolist. The regulator playing as the leader chooses an emission tax to maximize net social welfare, and the monopolist acting as the follower selects the output and the investment in abatement technology to maximize profits. We find that the optimal tax has two components. The first component is negative and equal to the gap between the marginal revenue and the price caused by the firm market power; the second component is given by the difference between the social and private shadow prices of the pollution stock. Considering a linear-quadratic model we show that if marginal environmental damages are constant, the difference between social and private shadow prices is positive and the optimal policy consists of taxing emissions at a constant rate if the marginal damages are large enough. However, if the marginal environmental damages are increasing the numerical exercises carried out show that this difference is negative at the steady state and the optimal policy gives the firm a subsidy when approaching the steady state regardless of the importance of the environmental damages. This result is explained by the negative effect that abatement technology accumulation has on the tax. Finally, it can be pointed out that although both models yield different predictions about the sign of the optimal policy the dynamics is globally stable for both cases. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Although revenue has declined sharply, evidence that weakened effective copyright protection undermines creation has been elusive. Instead, because of cost-reducing effects of digitization, the number of new recorded music products - and their apparent quality - has increased. This study examines movie production in India during a period of technological change that facilitated large-scale piracy. The diffusion of the VCR and cable television in India between 1985 and 2000 created substantial opportunities for unpaid movie consumption. We undertake a case study of this episode to shed light on possible impacts of piracy on supply. We first document, from narrative sources, conditions conducive to piracy as these technologies diffused. We then provide strong circumstantial evidence of piracy in diminished appropriability: movies' revenues fell by a third to a half, conditional on their ratings by movie-goers and their ranks in their annual revenue distributions. Weaker effective demand undermined creative incentives. While the number of new movies released had grown steadily from 1960 to 1985, it fell markedly between 1985 and 2000, suggesting a supply elasticity in the range of 0.2-0.7. Thus, our study provides suggestive evidence on a central tenet of copyright policy, that stronger effective copyright protection effects more creation. We contrast our findings with evidence from other contexts. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Using firm-level data for the period 2000-2009, we find that there is lower competition intensity in the non-tradable sector. The least competitive markets within this sector lay in professional services, network industries and segments of retail trade. We also find that reductions in competition intensity are relatively widespread in the economy, but in terms of sales, gross value added and employment they are more substantial in the non-tradable sector. Results suggest that some network industries and other services exhibit low and a declining competition intensity in the period under analysis. In addition, the article discusses the coherence of the profit elasticity with classic indicators of market power, such as the Herfindahl-Hirschman index and the price-cost margin, and find that in more than half of the markets there is an agreement in the dynamics of competition intensity.","[Amador, Joao; Soares, Ana Cristina] Banco Portugal, Lisbon, Portugal; [Amador, Joao] Nova Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal",Banco de Portugal; Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Soares, AC (通讯作者)，Banco Portugal, Lisbon, Portugal.",acsoares@bportugal.pt,,"Amador, Joao/0000-0002-8966-8036",,,,,42,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,MAY,2018,45.0,2,,,,,339,365,,10.1007/s10663-016-9363-1,0.0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GD0FR,,"Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430176500006,0

In the first stage, the model plans generator addition and transmission line setup prior to, and robust to, uncertainty realization. In the second stage, it plans power generation and dispatch after, and flexible to, uncertainty realization. The model exploits the idea of strategic robustness and operational flexibility as a way to improve performance in the face of uncertainty. The robust optimization framework uses deterministic uncertainty sets, with parameters that permit control over the level of conservatism of the solution. Because the resulting two-stage model is semi-infinite and, therefore, intractable, it is reformulated as an affinely adjustable counterpart. The reformulation uses affine decision rules on second-stage variables and converts, after constraint processing, the semi-infinite model into a finite single-stage mixed integer programming model. The resulting model is tested on the IEEE 30-bus system and value gains are shown by comparing the performance of the model with a deterministic model and a stochastic programming model with varying risk aversions.

We find that the optimal privatization of a public social enterprise under exogenous price control depends on the level of the regulated price. Namely, when the regulated price is low (medium, high), the optimal privatization is partial privatization (complete privatization, completely public owned). If the price control is optimized by maximizing social welfare, then the optimal privatization is complete privatization. For the case of the traditionally defined public firm, its optimal privatization is completely public owned when the price control is exogenously given.

We apply a data-driven procedure based on evolutionary computation to transform survey variables in economic growth rates. In a first step, we design five independent experiments to derive a formula using survey variables that best replicates the evolution of economic growth in each region by means of genetic programming, limiting the integration schemes to the main mathematical operations. We then rank survey variables according to their performance in tracking economic activity, finding that agents' perception about the overall economy compared to last year is the survey variable with the highest predictive power. In a second step, we assess the out-of-sample forecast accuracy of the evolved indicators. Although we obtain different results across regions, Austria, Slovakia, Portugal, Lithuania and Sweden are the economies of each region that show the best forecast results.

We present experimental evidence on this question in the context of a policy change in Indonesia that led to a permanent doubling of teacher base salaries. Using a large-scale randomized experiment across a representative sample of Indonesian schools that accelerated this pay increase for teachers in treated schools, we find that the large pay increase significantly improved teachers' satisfaction with their income, reduced the incidence of teachers holding outside jobs, and reduced self-reported financial stress. Nevertheless, after two and three years, the increase in pay led to no improvement in student learning outcomes. The effects are precisely estimated, and we can rule out even modest positive impacts on test scores. Our results suggest that unconditional pay increases are unlikely to be an effective policy option for improving the effort and productivity of incumbent employees in public-sector settings.","[de Ree, Joppe] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Bur Res & Econ Anal Dev, Cambridge, MA USA; Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Act Lab, Cambridge, MA USA; Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Amsterdam Inst Global Hlth & Dev, Amsterdam, Netherlands",The World Bank; University of California System; University of California San Diego; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Amsterdam; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"de Ree, J (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",,,,government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands,government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands,"This evaluation would not have been possible without generous financial support from the government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

This study employs Monte Carlo simulations and investigates this sign reversal problem. The simulations reveal instability in the decomposition results, particularly the effects of the intensity term and the economic structure term.

The results indicate 4%-31% directional spillover from crude oil prices to sovereign credit default swap (CDS) spreads. Venezuela, Colombia, Russia, and Mexico are the top recipients of crude oil shocks. The local and global factors explain a relatively large portion of the spillover as well (22.50% and 17.40% maximum, respectively). Further, using the OVX volatility index as a proxy for oil price uncertainty, we find an average directional volatility spillover of 9%.

In addition, the generalised method of moments (GMM) estimator is applied in order to address the persistence of corruption, which causes biased and inefficient estimators in estimation.

We apply a kernel-based nonparametric method to test quantile-on-quantile Granger causality from crude oil to firm returns. From the perspective of firm-level analysis, the findings are outlined as follows. First, our empirical results provide strong evidence to suggest the asymmetry in the linkage of extreme movements from crude oil to firm returns, that is, the case of positive risk spillovers are more severe than the case of negative risk spillovers; In particular, the down-to-down risk spillover is the most serious case. This phenomenon unravels the strong driving force of economic cycles. Second, risk transmission from oil price shocks to firm returns depends on the firm's industry features. In addition to the usual focus on inter-industry difference, we also note the within-industry heterogeneity. Third, we confirm that China's refined oil pricing reform of March 27, 2013 has had intensifying effects on the negative spillovers from oil prices to firms. For investors, we emphasize not only the awareness of the predictive power between extreme risks from international crude oil to China's firms but also the existence of heterogeneity in these predictive abilities across firms.

This study reconciles the theory with the empirics by introducing a multicountry framework with asymmetric trade costs. We find that the incentive to hold foreign equities to hedge real exchange rate risk is negligible because multiple trade partners act as a hedging channel for real exchange rate fluctuations. Further, our theory calls for a country's covariance-variance ratio to be constructed as the sum of the bilateral covariance-variance ratios of the multiple partners.

We also use our method to build a Millennium Development Goals (MDG) index as an example of constructing a more complex index. We find the living standard dimension provides a greater contribution to human development than the official HDI suggests, while the longevity dimension provides a lower proportional contribution. Our results also show considerable levels of disagreement relative to the ranks of official HDI.

We model a theoretically founded non-linear energy demand system, the generalized almost ideal, for the most important 117 countries in the world, which represent around 95% of the world population and 97% of the primary residential energy consumption, for the period 1978-2012. To this end, we assume a multi-stage utility maximization process, which models energy demand within a comprehensive theoretical framework. This paper offers three new contributions to research. First, we model energy aggregate demand response with a flexible and theoretically plausible simultaneous system. Second, we empirically measure the complete structure of price and expenditure elasticities of energy demand worldwide. Third, we explicitly estimate the impact of climate conditions on energy demand, with a newly constructed measure of weather impact based on geo-located heating and cooling degree-days. Econometric estimation reveals quantitative evidence of different income and price elasticities across countries and highlights the weather and capital stock impact on energy demand, inducing energy efficiency. Electricity tends to be a luxury good in advanced economies. Our results have welfare-improving policy implications, because appropriate policy strategies can help public decision-makers promote production efficiency and consumer welfare.","[Atalla, Tarek; Bollino, Carlo Andrea] KAPSARC, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Bigerna, Simona; Bollino, Carlo Andrea] Univ Perugia, Perugia, Italy",University of Perugia,"Atalla, T (通讯作者)，KAPSARC, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",tarek.atallah@outlook.com,,"Bollino, Carlo Andrea/0000-0002-7751-7089",,,,,67,7,7,2,18,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

We derive a number of alternative forecasting model specifications based on product spreads and compare the implied forecasts to the no-change forecast of the real price of oil. We show that not all product spread models are useful for out-of-sample forecasting, but some models are, even at horizons between one and two years. The most accurate model is a time-varying parameter model of gasoline and heating oil spot price spreads that allows for structural change in product markets. We document mean-squared prediction error reductions as high as 20% and directional accuracy as high as 63% at the two-year horizon, making product spread models a good complement to forecasting models based on economic fundamentals, which work best at short horizons.","[Baumeister, Christiane] Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Kilian, Lutz; Zhou, Xiaoqing] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Notre Dame; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Kilian, L (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, 309 Lorch Hall, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",lkilian@umich.edu,,,,,,,38,39,42,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

When the less salient provincial elections are held concurrently with the highly salient municipal elections, we observe three main effects: (1) turnout increases significantly by almost ten percentage points; (2) issues that are specific to the more salient (mayoral) contest affect the less salient (provincial) contest, with mayors' fiscal decisions impacting on the vote share of provincial incumbents; (3) issues that are specific to the less salient (provincial) contest stop affecting provincial elections outcomes. These findings shed light on how voters acquire information on incumbent politicians, and suggests that the effectiveness of an election as an accountability tool may be hindered by the concurrence with higher-stakes elections.

In such an economy, the rise in the interest rate following a monetary policy shock increases the cost of financing debt, thereby making a fiscal adjustment necessary to guarantee debt sustainability. The analysis is based on a DSGE model developed and calibrated to describe the Brazilian economy, where the effects of the interest rate on public debt service tends to be pronounced. The model incorporates a detailed public sector capable of intervening in the economy through several channels. Our simulations show that the magnitude of the reduction in GDP following a monetary policy shock varies considerably depending on the fiscal rule adopted. In particular, there is strong evidence that economic performance worsens when fiscal adjustment relies on public investment cuts.","[Cavalcanti, Marco A. F.

VAR estimates indicate that industry-level inventories and sales respond faster to an oil price shock than aggregate gross domestic product, especially in industries that are energy-intensive. In response to an unexpected oil price increase, sales drop and inventories are accumulated. This leads to future reductions in production. We estimate a modified linear-quadratic inventory model to inquire whether the patterns observed in the VAR impulse responses are consistent with rational behavior by the firms. Estimation results suggest that three mechanisms play a role in the industry-level dynamics. First, oil prices act as a negative demand shock. Second, the shock catches manufacturers by surprise, resulting in higher-than-anticipated inventories. Third, because of their desire to smooth production, manufacturers deviate from the target level of inventories and spread the decline in production over various quarters; hence the delay in the response of aggregate output.","[Herrera, Ana Maria] Univ Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40506 USA",University of Kentucky,"Herrera, AM (通讯作者)，Gatton Coll Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.",amherrera@uky.edu,,"Herrera, Ana Maria/0000-0003-3583-2555",NSF [SES-003840]; Harvard's Kennedy School of Government under a Repsol-YPF research fellowship,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Harvard's Kennedy School of Government under a Repsol-YPF research fellowship,"This research was supported by the NSF under Grant SES-003840 and was partially completed while visiting Harvard's Kennedy School of Government under a Repsol-YPF research fellowship.

A bootstrapped DEA metafrontier framework used in this study, as a first stage of analysis, is exploited to account for the heterogeneity between the Italian regions in the whole period and in two distinct time frames before and after EMU implementation. In a second stage, using a partial least squares model, the technology gaps estimated for each period are regressed, investigating factors related mainly to R&D efforts and trade behavior that may have affected regional performance. Our findings reveal a significant improvement for the Italian regions since 1993, a paradoxically unchanged behavior for efficiency performance in the Center-North regions, and clear identification of which regions performed better in terms of the technology gap. Inclusion of variables related to international trade performance in the model indicates that trade is of major importance for better regional performance. In addition, the technology gap is negatively influenced by R&D expenditures, denoting the catching-up phenomenon for the technology level of Italian regions.","[Kounetas, Kostas] Univ Patras, Dept Econ, Patras, Greece; [Kounetas, Kostas; Napolitano, Oreste] Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Business & Econ Studies, Via Gen Parisi 33, I-80134 Naples, Italy",University of Patras; Parthenope University Naples,"Kounetas, K (通讯作者)，Univ Patras, Dept Econ, Patras, Greece.;Kounetas, K; Napolitano, O (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Business & Econ Studies, Via Gen Parisi 33, I-80134 Naples, Italy.",kostas.kounetas@upatras.gr; napolitano@uniparthenope.it,"Kounetas, Kostas/AAI-5354-2020; Kounetas, Kostas Elias/C-3395-2013","Kounetas, Kostas/0000-0003-4976-6747; Kounetas, Kostas Elias/0000-0003-4976-6747",University of Naples - Parthenope on the project Institutional and Economic Imbalances in the Eurozone and in the Euopean Union,University of Naples - Parthenope on the project Institutional and Economic Imbalances in the Eurozone and in the Euopean Union,The authors would like to thank Prof. Kostas Tsekouras for his valuable comments which helped to improve the manuscript.

We identify the cultural effect, exploiting variations in the mean number of children born by country of origin, age, education level, and employment status. Results show that the home-country mean number of children born has a positive relationship to the number of children born of immigrants living in the US, suggesting that culture is important.

Using luminosity data to exploit within-country variation, I find that between 1992 and 2012 domestic output responded to increases in FMA with an elasticity in the range 0.3 to 0.6. By reducing trade costs, countries can increase their FMA, and so increase the spill-over of neighbouring growth into domestic growth.","[Moore, Alexander J.] Competit & Mkt Author, London WC1B 4AD, England",,"Moore, AJ (通讯作者)，Competit & Mkt Author, London WC1B 4AD, England.",alex.moore@cma.gsi.gov.uk,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

The papers in issue deal with two growing fields in the in the literature inspired by the complexity-based approach to economic analysis. The first group of contributions develops network models of financial systems and show how these models can shed light on relevant issues that emerged in the aftermath of the last financial crisis. The second group of contributions deals with the issue of validation of agent-based model. Agent-based models have proven extremely useful to account for key features economic dynamics that are usually neglected by more standard models. At the same time, agent-based models have been criticized for the lack of an adequate validation against empirical data. The works in this issue propose useful techniques to validate agent-based models, thus contributing to the wider diffusion of these models in the economic discipline.","[Napoletano, Mauro] OFCE, Paris, France; [Napoletano, Mauro] Univ Cote dAzur, SKEMA Business Sch, Sophia Antipolis, France; [Napoletano, Mauro] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Sophia Antipolis, France; [Guerci, Eric; Hanaki, Nobuyuki] Univ Cote dAzur, CNRS, GREDEG, 250 Rue Albert Einstein, F-06560 Valbonne, France",SKEMA Business School; Universite Cote d'Azur; Universite Cote d'Azur; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Napoletano, M (通讯作者)，OFCE, Paris, France.;Napoletano, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cote dAzur, SKEMA Business Sch, Sophia Antipolis, France.;Napoletano, M (通讯作者)，Scuola Super Sant Anna, Sophia Antipolis, France.",mauro.napoletano@sciencespo.fr; eric.guerci@unice.fr; nobuyuki.hanaki@unice.fr,,"HANAKI, Nobuyuki/0000-0003-3127-690X; Napoletano, Mauro/0000-0002-8128-6674",,,,,34,2,2,0,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

We examine the effects of paid sick leave mandates in Washington, D.C. (2008) and Connecticut (2011) on leave-taking behavior. After these policies are implemented, there are significant decreases in the aggregate rate of illness-related leave taking, relative to control groups, for both those directly affected and those not directly affected by the policy. The estimates are strong for Connecticut, but are more sensitive to the specification and weaken over time for D.C. We also find decreases in leave-taking when exploiting exogenous variation in access to paid sick leave through changes in local industry composition over time. Our results suggest that mandated sick leave policies can provide large positive public health externalities by allowing sick workers to stay home rather than coming to work and spreading their illness to customers and coworkers.

The perspective of a New Keynesian model with the financial accelerator,ECONOMIC MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Islamic banking; Optimal debt contract; Financial accelerator; Leverage; Profit-and-loss sharing,BANKING; EFFICIENCY; RISK,"This paper aims to inspect the stabilization aspects of Islamic financial contracts by drawing on a New Keynesian macroeconomic model with the financial accelerator. The model allows for shared responsibilities on both the assets and liabilities sides of the Islamic banks that resemble, in principle, the two-tiered Mudarabah financing on the asset side and profit-sharing investment accounts on the liability side. The implied optimal Islamic financial contract argues that payoff distribution between entrepreneur and bank is contingent on the macroeconomic environment via the entrepreneur's leverage, whereas that between bank and investors is endogenous to bank's capital and leverage. Compared to the conventional debt contract with a predetermined return, we find that an Islamic financial contract amplifies shocks as much as conventional financial contracts do, if not to a greater extent. The impacts on entrepreneurs' and banks' leverage, however, depend largely on the source of the shock and are opposite to those observed under conventional debt contract. Whereas favorable aggregate supply and monetary shocks increase the overall leverage, shocks favorably hitting preference and marginal efficiency of investment reduce the leverage. The underlying mechanism is the shock-shifting ex post payoff distribution between creditors and debtors that shapes the cost of the external finance and, thus, leverage.","[Wong, Chin-Yoong; Eng, Yoke-Kee] Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Petaling Jaya, Malaysia",Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR),"Wong, CY (通讯作者)，Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Fac Business & Finance, Jalan Univ, Kamper 31900, Perak, Malaysia.",wongcy@utar.edu.my,,,,,,,26,2,2,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Relative to the long-term action, the short-term action boosts output today but hurts output tomorrow. I explicitly characterize the optimal contract that always induces the long-term action. It features a cliff-like arrangement that rewards high output today based on the streak of consecutive high outputs the agent has generated leading up to today: The longer the streak, the larger the reward. The optimal contract can be implemented as a bonus bank. Bonus banks feature prominently in the recent debate on bonus reform. I shed light on the opposing arguments driving this debate by formally comparing the myopic agency optimal contract and optimal contracts that arise from traditional effort-shirking agency models.","[Zhu, John Y.] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Zhu, JY (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",,,,,,,,21,5,6,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

This coupled with sudden and periodic crashes in global and developed equity markets have stimulated the interest of investors to diversify across markets that have the potential to provide decorrelation with global markets during turbulent periods. At the same time, international diversification may intensify cross-border listing of stocks with its antecedent implication of shocks transmission. The above have engendered renewed interest among researchers to explore the dependence levels and spillover effects of shocks among emerging and developed equity markets. This paper examines tail dependence structure and (extreme) systemic risks spillover effects among international equity markets using advanced econometric techniques that underpin the modelling of asset returns. We find evidence of low positive significant dependencies between all African markets and their developed counterparts, except for Egypt. Although no evidence of spillover effects to the markets in Africa was found, both unidirectional and bi-directional causality between some African and developed equity markets is found, albeit with differences. We are unable to ascribe the dynamics in the causality structure to level of market integration. It is inferred that the degree of individual local markets interdependence with developed counterparts may reflect the relative size, liquidity and degree of foreign investors' participation.","[Boako, Gideon] AFEC, Training, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Boako, Gideon] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Accounting & Finance, Kumasi, Ghana; [Alagidede, Paul] Univ Witwatersrand, Grad Sch Business, Wits Business Sch, 2 ST Davids Pl, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Boako, Gideon; Alagidede, Paul] AFEC, Johannesburg, South Africa",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; University of Witwatersrand,"Boako, G (通讯作者)，AFEC, Training, Johannesburg, South Africa.",gboako@gmail.com,,,,,,,46,13,13,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Persistent gaps in total factor productivity (TFP) are the proximate cause; conventional and capital-free measurements confirm a sharp slowdown in TFP growth after 1995. Strikingly, eastern capital intensity, especially in industry, exceeds values in the West, casting doubt on the embodied technology hypothesis. TFP growth is negatively associated with rates of investment expenditures. The stubborn East-West TFP gap is best explained by low concentration of managers, low startup intensity and the distribution of firm size in the East rather than R&D activities.

Immigrants are more likely than natives to find a job using informal search through friends and relatives, and these jobs are associated with lower wages.","[Carlsson, Magnus] Linnaeus Univ, Ctr Labour Market & Discriminat Studies, Vaxjo, Sweden; [Eriksson, Stefan] Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, Uppsala, Sweden; [Rooth, Dan-Olof] Stockholm Univ, Swedish Inst Social Res, Stockholm, Sweden",Linnaeus University; Uppsala University; Stockholm University,"Carlsson, M (通讯作者)，Linnaeus Univ, Ctr Labour Market & Discriminat Studies, Vaxjo, Sweden.",,,"Eriksson, Stefan/0000-0003-3054-7157; Rooth, Dan-Olof/0000-0001-8887-5677",Swedish Research Council,Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council),"We are grateful for helpful comments from participants in the Royal Economic Society annual conference in Manchester, the EALE annual conference in Ljubljana, participants in the conference 'Immigration and Labour Market Integration' in Stockholm, and colleagues at Uppsala University and the Linnaeus University Centre for Labour Market and Discrimination Studies.

The literature tends to regard mainstream pluralism as a transitory state towards a new, post-neoclassical, mainstream. This paper advances a new interpretation: it suggests that the changing and fragmented state of mainstream economics is likely to persist over time under the impact of specialization (as a self-reinforcing mechanism) and the creation of new specialties and approaches, also through collaboration with researchers from other disciplines.","[Cedrini, Mario; Fontana, Magda] Univ Turin, Turin, Italy",University of Turin,"Cedrini, M (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dipartimento Econ & Stat Cognetti de Martiis, Lungo Dora Siena 100A, I-10153 Turin, Italy.",mario.cedrini@unito.it; magda.fontana@unito.it,"Fontana, Magda/GQZ-3403-2022","FONTANA, Magda/0000-0002-9504-2080; Cedrini, Mario Aldo/0000-0003-1059-4458",,,,,113,34,35,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

First, we derive sup-norm convergence rates for computationally simple sieve NPIV (series two-stage least squares) estimators of h(0) and its derivatives. Second, we derive a lower bound that describes the best possible (minimax) sup-norm rates of estimating h(0) and its derivatives, and show that the sieve NPIV estimator can attain the minimax rates when h(0) is approximated via a spline or wavelet sieve. Our optimal sup-norm rates surprisingly coincide with the optimal root-mean-squared rates for severely ill-posed problems, and are only a logarithmic factor slower than the optimal root-mean-squared rates for mildly ill-posed problems. Third, we use our sup-norm rates to establish the uniform Gaussian process strong approximations and the score bootstrap uniform confidence bands (UCBs) for collections of nonlinear functionals of h(0) under primitive conditions, allowing for mildly and severely ill-posed problems. Fourth, as applications, we obtain the first asymptotic pointwise and uniform inference results for plug-in sieve t-statistics of exact consumer surplus (CS) and deadweight loss (DL) welfare functionals under low-level conditions when demand is estimated via sieve NPIV. Our real data application of UCBs for exact CS and DL functionals of gasoline demand reveals interesting patterns and is applicable to other goods markets.","[Chen, Xiaohong] Yale Univ, Cowles Fdn Res Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Christensen, Timothy M.] NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10003 USA",Yale University; New York University,"Chen, XH (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Cowles Fdn Res Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",xiaohong.chen@yale.edu; timothy.christensen@nyu.edu,,,Cowles Foundation,Cowles Foundation,"This paper is a revised version of the preprint arXiv:1508:03365v1 (Chen and Christensen (2015a)) which was submitted to Econometrica in March 2015 and was a major extension of Sections 2 and 3 of the preprint arXiv:1311.0412 (Chen and Christensen (2013)).

It uses scenario analysis and quantitative techniques to capture the impact of macroeconomic stress on the stability of the Indian banks by evaluating financial soundness indicators (credit quality, quantity and quality of capital adequacy). The scenarios are generated through policy-based shocks vis-a-vis other external shocks. The results from the estimation of the model indicate a cointegrating relationship between credit quality and key macroeconomic variables including output growth rate, interest rate, money growth rate and exchange rate. The results of the scenario analysis reveal that the Indian banking sector remains largely sound in terms of total regulatory capital adequacy ratio as per current BASEL II and even BASEL III requirement. The results also show that expansionary monetary policy impacts credit quality and capital adequacy in a positive and significant manner via its effect on the economy's growth rate.

The paper presents a new integrated choice and latent variable (ICLV) model implementation called the Hybrid Multiple Discrete Continuous (HMDC) model that is capable of incorporating the influence of psychological factors (modeled as latent constructs) on MDC choice behaviors. Estimation of ICLV models (with single discrete choice kernels and MDC kernels) has been a challenge owing to the high dimensional integrals involved in the likelihood function. The typically used maximum simulated likelihood estimation (MSLE) approach becomes cumbersome when the dimensionality of integration increases. In this research, a composite marginal likelihood (CML) based estimation approach is proposed for parameter estimation of the HMDC framework. Unlike the ICLV model implementations with single discrete choice kernel, the dimension of the integral to be decomposed in the HMDC varies across observations. This necessitated the use of weights when decomposing the likelihood function using the CML approach. A simulation study was conducted using synthetic datasets to demonstrate the superiority of the weighted CML approach over its unweighted counterpart in the presence of MDC choice kernel. The applicability of the proposed model formulation and associated estimation routine was demonstrated using an empirical case study with data from the 2013 American Time Use Survey (ATUS). The empirical study identifies interesting association between day level moods and discretionary activity participation decisions.","[Enam, Annesha; Konduri, Karthik C.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 261 Glenbrook Rd,Unit 3037, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Pinjari, Abdul R.] Indian Inst Sci, Dept Civil Engn, Ctr Infrastruct Sustainable Transportat & Urban P, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India; [Eluru, Naveen] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Civil Environm & Construct Engn, 12800 Pegasus Dr,Room 301D, Orlando, FL 32816 USA",University of Connecticut; Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore; State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida,"Konduri, KC (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 261 Glenbrook Rd,Unit 3037, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",annesha.enam@uconn.edu; karthik.konduri@uconn.edu; abdul@civil.iisc.ernet.in; naveen.eluru@ucf.edu,"Pinjari, Abdul/Y-3020-2019; Eluru, Naveen/B-2965-2012","Pinjari, Abdul/0000-0002-3056-4259; Eluru, Naveen/0000-0003-1221-4113","Center for Teaching Old Models New Tricks (TOMNET), a University Transportation Center; U.S. Department of Transportation [69A3551747116]","Center for Teaching Old Models New Tricks (TOMNET), a University Transportation Center; U.S. Department of Transportation","The third author gratefully acknowledges partial support provided by the Center for Teaching Old Models New Tricks (TOMNET), a University Transportation Center sponsored by the U.S. Department of Transportation through Grant No. 69A3551747116.",,83,15,15,0,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

The main concern to construct a valid and unbiased price index is to address the problem of heterogeneity of real estate or put differently to control for both observable and unobservable quality attributes. The one most frequently used is probably the hedonic regression methodology (classic, but recently also spatial and quantile regression). An alternative approach to control for unobservable differences in assets' quality is provided by repeat sales methodology, where price changes are tracked based on differences in prices of given asset sold twice (or multiple times) within the study period. The latter approach is applied in renown S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller house price indices. Purpose of the article: The goal of the paper is to assess the applicability of repeat sales methodology for a major housing market in Poland. Previous studies used the hedonic methodology or mix adjustment techniques, and applied for major metropolitan areas. The most widely known example is the set of quarterly house price indices constructed by NBP- especially for the primary anal secondary market. The repeat sales methodology has not been adopted with significant success to date - mainly because of concern regarding relative infrequency of transactions on the housing market in most metropolitan areas (thus a potentially small sample of repeated sales). Methods: The study uses data on repeat sales of residential transactions m Krakow from 2003 to 2015.

We find that virtually all gains in spending on the social safety net for children since 1990 have gone to families with earnings, and to families with income above the poverty line. These trends are the result of welfare reform and the expansion of in-work tax credits. We review the available research and find that access to safety net programs during childhood improves outcomes for children and society over the long run. This evidence suggests that the recent changes to the social safety net may have lasting negative effects on the poorest children.","[Hoynes, Hilary W.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Schanzenbach, Diane Whitmore] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Northwestern University,"Hoynes, HW (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,,,,,98,24,27,1,6,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

A fight for a customer, payment backlogs, problems with debt collection and new branches cause that managers are looking for solutions that will influence positively on the situation of financial companies. Maintaining liquidity and generating income are the primary steps to build a competitive position and a progressive development of enterprises. One of the most popular methods that allows companies to do profitable business and increase their chances for safety is operation within group purchasing organizations. Currently in the Polish market there are many different types of GPOs (Group Purchasing Organizations). The choice of the right one is a chance to improve their financial situation. Purpose of the article: The aim of the article is to present an impact of group purchasing organizations on the financial situation of enterprises. In the article the classification of groups is done and there are shown the benefits that commercial enterprises operating in them gain. The article presents some obstacles to join specific group purchasing organizations and difficulties faced by companies operating in them. Methods: The studies were carried out on the basis of 60 SMEs. These companies operated in five Polish GPOs. The groups were divided into branch and multi-branch ones. The study period covered the years 2013-2015. In order to analyze the impact of purchasing groups on the financial situation of enterprises, some selected groups of financial ratios were used. A preliminary analysis of financial balance sheets and profit and loss account was conducted. Findings & Value added: The analysis showed that the choice or an appropriate group purchasing organisation had it large impact oil financial situation or companies. Different opportunities can be offered by a branch purchasing group than by the multi-branch one. Research has shown that better results relate to dynamics of revenues, costs, liquidity and profitability that are effects of operation within the branch purchasing groups. The analysis conducted has also showed that functioning within purchasing groups allows to maintain safe financial liquidity, apart from obtaining a low price of purchased goods and materials, and has a positive impact on the effectiveness of managing receivables and short-term liabilities.","[Zimon, Grzegorz] Rzeszow Univ Technol, Al Powstancow Warszawy 10, PL-35959 Rzeszow, Poland",Rzeszow University of Technology,"Zimon, G (通讯作者)，Rzeszow Univ Technol, Al Powstancow Warszawy 10, PL-35959 Rzeszow, Poland.",gzimon@prz.edu.pl,"Zimon, Grzegorz/V-5509-2018","Zimon, Grzegorz/0000-0002-2040-4438",,,,,24,30,32,4,10,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

We contend that the endogenous industrialization of the inter-war period generated political changes that paved the way for import-substitution industrialization during the post-war period. Even if this inward-oriented strategy failed to spur economic growth, protectionist policies became entrenched.

Then, it is hypothesized that education might directly affect environmental quality by worsening it at early stages and improving it once education expands from its certain level. Thus, we pursue an extension of the standard Environmental Kuznets Curve by including an indicator of the evolution of citizens' education. This empirical strategy might avoid bias on income coefficients and, in turn, assess the value of education as environmental policy. An application for Australia is given to illustrate this possibility by using higher education data for a large time span (1950-2014). Empirical results suggest that, in most of the studied period, expansion in education rate has increasingly compensated the rise of per capita CO2 emissions stemming from the economic growth. Moreover, only in recent years, both per capita income and education expansion have been proved to reduce emissions. However, provided that income growth is difficult to manage, it would be worth considering the possibility of promoting education in order to achieve environmental objectives. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In a field experiment requiring real effort, we investigate how schools can increase students' perseverance in math by shaping students' beliefs in their abilities to learn, a concept referred to by psychologists as mindset. Using protocols adapted from psychology, we experimentally manipulate students' beliefs in their ability to learn. Three weeks after our treatment, we find persistent treatment effects on students' perseverance and academic performance in math.

However, the empirical results show that South Africa is more affected by crises originating from China, India and Russia while these countries are least affected by crises originating from South Africa.

Under a supermodularity condition on the platform's profit function as a function of its prices, this result generalizes to any per-unit tax.

The questions of whether this decline has actually been an outcome of inflation targeting solely and whether inflation targeting has been successful in stabilizing other macroeconomic variables though remain. This study considers these questions on the basis of 16 inflation targeting countries and 21 non-targeting ones using a difference-in-difference approach. With regard to the baseline period of 1996-1999 during which neither of the groups was implementing inflation targeting, a difference-in-difference approach was employed to assess the effects of inflation targeting on inflation, output growth, real exchange rates, inflation volatility and real exchange rate volatility during moving 4-year periods between 2007 and 2015. Our estimates suggest that inflation targeting was superior in terms of harnessing inflation as well as inflation volatility. In terms of economic growth, however, inflation targeting seems to be neutral and in terms of real exchange rates it seems not to be stabilizing, if not de-stabilizing. A hybrid version of inflation targeting, namely the conventional inflation targeting augmented by an improved capacity to deliver macro-prudence as in the post-Lehman economic climate, can therefore be viewed as the best available policy alternative for the upcoming decades.","[Kose, Nezir; Yalcin, Yeliz] Gazi Univ, Dept Econometr, TR-06500 Ankara, Turkey; [Yucel, Eray] Ozyegin Univ, Dept Econ, Orman St, TR-34794 Istanbul, Turkey",Gazi University; Ozyegin University,"Yalcin, Y (通讯作者)，Gazi Univ, Dept Econometr, TR-06500 Ankara, Turkey.",nezir@gazi.edu.tr; yyeliz@gazi.edu.tr; eray.yucel@gmail.com,"Yucel, Eray/AAG-5262-2019; Köse, Nezir/AAB-6015-2021; yalcin, yeliz/A-7378-2018","Yucel, Eray/0000-0002-1038-4357; Kose, Nezir/0000-0002-4127-357X",,,,,25,8,8,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,FEB,2018,45.0,1,,,,,197,213,,10.1007/s10663-016-9357-z,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FT2QF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000422990400010,0

Assuming a simple dual-process framework, with the two modes of judgment running parallel to each other providing the decision-maker with their final estimates of the utility difference between the options, this method incentivizes the decision-maker to indicate which option they prefer in System 1 and which option is preferred in System 2. We apply the method to a series of simple decision tasks aimed at eliciting subjects' social preferences (as in Charness and Rabin, 2002). We observe that time pressure leads to a negative attitude towards the earnings of other participants when they are higher than those of the decision-maker. In other words, deliberation decisions are typically updated towards those corresponding with lower aversion to disadvantageous inequality (envy).","[Krawczyk, Michal; Sylwestrzak, Marta] Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Krawczyk, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland.",mkrawczyk@wne.uw.edu.pl; martasylwestrzak@wne.uw.edu.pl,"Krawczyk, Michał/ABA-7468-2020; Sylwestrzak, Marta/ABA-3279-2020","Sylwestrzak, Marta/0000-0002-7809-5826; Krawczyk, Michal/0000-0001-6795-1175",National Science Centre [2014/13/B/HS4/00458],"National Science Centre(National Science Centre, Poland)","We would like to thank Peter Katuscak, Martin Kocher, Ian Krajbich, David Rand, Ariel Rubinstein, as well as the participants of the seminar at the University of Economics in Prague and the ESA conference in Heidelberg for their helpful suggestions.

We apply this procedure to one of the most prominent targeted composite leading indicator for Switzerland, which is based on bivariate associations of potential variables with a reference series reflecting the Swiss growth rate cycle. We show that in a simulated real-time analysis the targeted indicator selection procedure outperforms the widely used approach to combine as many potential variables as possible. Furthermore, the regular updating procedure preserves the leading properties of the composite indicator with respect to the reference time series, as compared to the same composite indicator without such updates.","[Abberger, Klaus; Graff, Michael; Siliverstovs, Boriss; Sturm, Jan-Egbert] ETH, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, Zurich, Switzerland; [Abberger, Klaus; Sturm, Jan-Egbert] CESifo Munich, Munich, Germany",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Ifo Institut,"Graff, M (通讯作者)，ETH, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, Zurich, Switzerland.",graff@kof.ethz.ch,"Graff, Michael/AFV-4995-2022; Siliverstovs, Boriss/T-2405-2019","Graff, Michael/0000-0003-3844-9201; Sturm, Jan-Egbert/0000-0002-9421-5736; Abberger, Klaus/0000-0003-0963-8572",,,,,41,13,14,0,4,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

We show that the mortgage expansion was shared across the entire income distribution; that is, the flow and stock of debt rose across all income groups (except for the top 5%). The mortgage expansion was especially pronounced in areas with increased house prices, and the speed at which houses turned over (churn) in these areas went up significantly. However, the average loan-to-value ratios (LTV) at origination did not increase over the boom period. While homeownership rates increased for the middle- and upper-income households, there was no increase in homeownership for the lowest income groups. Finally, default rates postcrisis went up predominantly in areas with large house price drops, especially for high-income and high-FICO borrowers. These results are consistent with a view that the run-up in mortgage debt over the precrisis period was driven by rising home values and expectations of increasing prices.","[Adelino, Manuel] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Adelino, Manuel; Schoar, Antoinette] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Schoar, Antoinette] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Severino, Felipe] Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",Duke University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Dartmouth College,"Adelino, M (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.;Adelino, M (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"Adelino, Manuel/AAK-2869-2020","Adelino, Manuel/0000-0002-6308-8930",,,,,49,16,19,1,12,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0889-3365,1537-2642,,NBER MACROECON ANNU,NBER Macroecon.

The findings of this study show that 84% of the respondents perceive a decrease in rainfall, while 75% perceive an increase in temperature over the last 10-15years due to climate change. The study also finds a significant and positive association between farmers' perception of climate change, awareness (AWN), attitudes (ATT) and adaptation behaviour (ADB). Furthermore, the results reveal that awareness and attitudes play a mediating role between perception and adaptation behaviour. The findings could be useful to public and private organizations in learning more about farmers' perceptions and adaptation behaviour in developing a policy framework to reduce adverse effects of climate change.","[Akhtar, Rulia; Afroz, Rafia] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management Sci, Dept Econ, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Masud, Muhammad Mehedi] Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Dev Studies, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Rahman, Mahfuzur] Univ Malaya, Fac Business & Accountancy, Dept Finance & Banking, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Khalid, Haniza; Duasa, Jarita Binti] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management Sci, Dept Econ, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Akhtar, Rulia] Univ Malaya, CPDS, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",International Islamic University Malaysia; Universiti Malaya; Universiti Malaya; International Islamic University Malaysia; Universiti Malaya,"Akhtar, R (通讯作者)，Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management Sci, Dept Econ, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.;Akhtar, R (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, CPDS, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",rulia.aktar@yahoo.com,"Duasa, Jarita/AAP-3895-2021; Akhtar, Rulia/AAD-1252-2021; Rahman, Mahfuzur/P-5952-2019; Masud, Muhammad Mehedi/Q-6565-2016","Duasa, Jarita/0000-0002-6432-777X; Rahman, Mahfuzur/0000-0003-2072-5829; Masud, Muhammad Mehedi/0000-0003-0476-4481; akhtar, rulia/0000-0002-6980-4096","International Islamic University, Malaysia [FRGS15-180-0421]","International Islamic University, Malaysia","The authors would like to acknowledge the International Islamic University, Malaysia, for funding of 'Developing an Integrated Waqf Environmental Protection Model for Malaysian Rice Farmers' [grant number FRGS15-180-0421].",,58,14,16,2,49,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Second, we make use of a dynamic analysis to evaluate both the net directional connectedness for each market and all net pairwise directional connectedness. Our results suggest that a 38.99%, of the total variance of the forecast errors is explained by shocks across markets, indicating that the remainder 61.01% of the variation is due to idiosyncratic shocks. Furthermore, we find that volatility connectedness varies over time, with a surge during periods of increasing economic and financial instability.

According to the resource dependence theory (RDT), organizations should pay more attention to the stakeholders who control resources critical to the organization than to stakeholders who do not control vital resources. On the other hand, consistent with the resource based view (RBV), if they are to operate, act on opportunities and minimize threats, which is necessary to satisfy key stakeholders, they need resources and capabilities. Thus stakeholders might be seen as a link between external and internal resources. Purposes Our research attempted to comprehend the logic of strategic choices referring to stakeholders and resources. The underlying question was about the ability of recognizing the resources necessary for operating and satisfying key stakeholders. We attempt to thoroughly understand the decisions taken by public hospitals in relation to their stakeholders and the resources needed for their operation. Providing quantitative findings, we aim at answering the question how the resource based view (RBV), resource dependence theory (RDT) and stakeholder management can be used to explain the decisions made in public organizations in terms of stakeholder management. Methodology/Approach We used a survey and two vignettes to test the presented hypotheses. The research sample was 93 public hospitals operating in southern Poland. Findings Our research shows that applying orientation both towards RBV and RDT is positively correlated with organizational effectiveness. Managers use these two approaches to take actions oriented towards meeting the goals of the stakeholders, although we found that RBV is the fundamental approach. Although we expected that they invest resources in relationships with these stakeholders that allow them to acquire further resources, we found no support for this assumption.","[Austen, Agata] Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Human Resources Management, Katowice, Poland; [Fraczkiewicz-Wronka, Aldona] Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Publ Management & Social Sci, Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice; University of Economics in Katowice,"Austen, A (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Human Resources Management, Katowice, Poland.",,"Austen, Agata/AAR-5466-2021; Fraczkiewicz-Wronka, Aldona/S-8158-2018","Fraczkiewicz-Wronka, Aldona/0000-0002-7077-1068",,,,,53,1,1,4,6,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,2720-5088,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

Building an effective performance management system is a multi-criteria problem that requires contribution from experts having diverse backgrounds. Moreover, performance management is an inherently vague concept since almost the whole process requires linguistic assessments rather than numerical ones. Hence, to handle all those issues, an intuitionistic fuzzy multi-criteria and multi-expert analytic hierarchy process (AHP) based management model is proposed in this paper. In the determination of the criteria weights of the model, both the aggregated and compromised assessments of the experts are used in order to observe the effects of these two methods on the results.

Our findings suggest that a weak Zloty is preferred by exporting firms that have carried out product and process innovations and registered a trademark, patent or claimed a copyright. We confirmed that financial constraints and labour market regulations were important factors preventing the growth of innovative firms.

This article empirically examines the effect of the regulatory reform on OTC drug prices. To do so, we use county-level price data of 7 OTC drugs for the years of 2012 and 2013. Among them, 2 OTC drugs are available at non-pharmacy outlets due to the deregulation, and the remaining 5 are still only available at pharmacies. Employing a difference-in-differences estimation strategy, we find that after the regulatory reform, prices of the 2 OTC drugs increased by only 1.1% while those of the rest 5 increased by 6.5%. This result has implications for the government's policy of designating non-pharmacy outlets that can sell OTC drugs from the viewpoint of consumer welfare.","[Chung, Hoe Sang] Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Econ, 1 Kangwondaehak Gil, Chuncheon Si 24341, Gangwon Do, South Korea; [Kim, Min] Univ Maryland, Robert H Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",Kangwon National University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Chung, HS (通讯作者)，Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Econ, 1 Kangwondaehak Gil, Chuncheon Si 24341, Gangwon Do, South Korea.",hschung@kangwon.ac.kr,,"Kim, Min/0000-0002-3554-2497",,,,,4,2,2,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

It suggests that inflation can be stable and determinate at the zero bound, and by extension under passive policy including a nominal interest rate peg, and that arbitrary amounts of interest-paying reserves are not inflationary. Of the known alternatives, the New Keynesian model merged with the fiscal theory of the price level is the only simple economic model consistent with this interpretation of the facts.I explore two implications of this conclusion. First, what happens if central banks raise interest rates? Inflation stability implies that higher nominal interest rates will eventually result in higher inflation. But can higher interest rates temporarily reduce inflation? Yes, but only by a novel mechanism that depends crucially on fiscal policy. Second, what are the implications for monetary policy and the urgency to normalize? Inflation stability implies that low interest rate monetary policy is, perhaps unintentionally, benign, producing a stable Friedman-optimal quantity of money, that a large interest paying balance sheet can be maintained indefinitely. The fiscal anchoring required by this interpretation of the data responds to discount rates, however, and may not be as strong as it appears.","[Cochrane, John H.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Cochrane, John H.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Cochrane, JH (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Cochrane, JH (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,82,35,38,1,7,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0889-3365,1537-2642,,NBER MACROECON ANNU,NBER Macroecon.

We show that, when bidders' values are drawn from uniform distributions and are asymmetric, i.e., there is a strong bidder and a weak bidder (the strong bidder's distribution first order stochastically dominates that of the weak bidder's), the expected revenue in the sequential bidding first price auction (when the strong bidder bids first) may be higher than in the simultaneous bidding first price auction as well as the simultaneous bidding second price auction. The expected payoff of the weak bidder is also higher in the sequential first price auction.

There appears to be no significant direct link between warrantless arrest laws and domestic violence-related homicides. However, on the indirect front, we do find strong evidence that implementation of the arrest laws results in a drop in the probability of youth experiencing suicidal ideation.

Our model builds on the large empirical literature on voluntary production of pooled public knowledge goods, including source code in communities of software developers or data provided to open access data repositories. Our analysis shows under which conditions social preferences, such as 'group belonging' or 'peer approval', influence the stable coalition size, as such rationalising several stylized facts emerging from large-scale surveys of open-source software developers, previously unaccounted for.

Therefore, we argue that there is weak evidence in favour of the Feldstein-Horioka puzzle and that the long-run international solvency condition is maintained in most of these countries.

We use person fixed effects within both linear and two-part models, the latter to explore changes at extensive and intensive margins. A lower educated group (likely affected by minimum wages) is compared with higher educated groups (likely unaffected). Within the lower educated group, we find higher minimum wages are associated with lower rates of absence due to own and others' illness combined and due to own illness alone, but not associated with absence due to others' illness. A $1 increase in the real minimum wage results in 19 % (in DD model) and 32 % (DDD) decreases in the absence rate due to own illness evaluated at the mean. These findings are strongest for persons who are not employed year-round and among the lowest wage earners. In additional analysis, we show that these effects are likely not due to changes in labor supply or job-related attributes. Instead, we find a possible mechanism: higher minimum wages improve self-reported health for lower educated workers.","[Du, Juan] Old Dominion Univ, Econ, Constant Hall 2034, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; [Leigh, J.

We consider inequality/mobility relationships that are derived from nonlinearities in the transmission process of income from parents to children and the relationship that is derived from the effects of inequality of socioeconomic segregation, which then affects children.

Most post-communist Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries are characterized by very low relative efficiency for a number of historical, institutional, and other reasons. The aim of this study is to explore potential factors standing behind the low efficiency of CEE countries using a DEA approach - especially to identify redundant inputs entering the railway transport production process. The study employed DEA based on four inputs (track length, number of employees, and number of cars in passenger and freight transport) and two outputs (passenger-km and tonne-km) and included 24 European countries during 1999-2016. Excessive freight fleet size and overstaffing have been identified as redundant inputs in all CEE countries with the exception of the Baltic republics.","[Fitzova, Hana] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Fitzová, H (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",hana.fitzova@econ.muni.cz,,,[MUNI/A/1133/2017],,This work was supported by MUNI/A/1133/2017.,,20,0,0,1,5,"LETRA INTERACTIVE, SRO",BRATISLAVA,"NA REVINE 29-D, BRATISLAVA, 831 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-89962-08-2,,,,2018,,,,,,,119,126,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455265500015,0

Combining recent reservation-level census data and school enrollment data from 1911 to 1932, I find that reservations that sent a larger share of students to off-reservation boarding schools have higher high school graduation rates, higher per capita income, lower poverty rates, a greater proportion of exclusively English speakers, and smaller family sizes. These results are supported when distance to the nearest off-reservation boarding school that subsequently closed is used as an instrument for the proportion of past boarding school students. I conclude with a discussion of the possible reasons for this link.","[Gregg, Matthew T.] Roger Williams Univ, Gabelli Sch Business, 1 Old Ferry Rd, Bristol, RI 02809 USA",,"Gregg, MT (通讯作者)，Roger Williams Univ, Gabelli Sch Business, 1 Old Ferry Rd, Bristol, RI 02809 USA.",mgregg@rwu.edu,,,RWU Foundation,RWU Foundation,"I am grateful to the Editor and two anonymous referees for helpful comments.

This paper analyses the impacts of First World War and hostilities on the risk assessments regarding the Ottoman war debt, using manually collected data on the price of the Ottoman war bond traded at the stanbul bourse between 1918 and 1925. The empirical results imply that the defeat of the Bulgarian army and the peace offer of Austria-Hungary were associated with the increasing premium demanded by investors of the bond. The victories of the Turkish National Movement and the peace offer of the Allies to end the hostilities by 1922 positively affected the likelihood of the servicing of the debt.","[Hanedar, Avni Onder; Torun, Erdost] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Business, Izmir, Turkey; [Hanedar, Avni Onder] Sakarya Univ, Fac Polit Sci, Sakarya, Turkey; [Hanedar, Elmas Yaldiz] Yeditepe Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Istanbul, Turkey; [Ertugrul, Hasan Murat] Undersecretariat Turkish Treasury, Ankara, Turkey",Dokuz Eylul University; Sakarya University; Yeditepe University; Ministry of Customs & Trade - Turkey,"Hanedar, AÖ (通讯作者)，Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Business, Izmir, Turkey.;Hanedar, AÖ (通讯作者)，Sakarya Univ, Fac Polit Sci, Sakarya, Turkey.",onder.hanedar@deu.edu.tr,"Ertugrul, Hasan Murat/Q-9761-2019; hanedar, elmas yaldız/G-6350-2018; Ertugrul, Hasan Murat/GZM-7903-2022; torun, erdost/AAA-9763-2020","Ertugrul, Hasan Murat/0000-0001-9822-4683; hanedar, elmas yaldız/0000-0002-2996-3498; Ertugrul, Hasan Murat/0000-0001-9822-4683; torun, erdost/0000-0002-0946-2813; Hanedar, Avni Onder/0000-0003-4475-8473",,,,,47,2,3,1,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

Job retention among older workers is key to prolonging careers and increasing employment of older people which in turn is a crucial challenge for these countries. We find that the retention rates among workers aged 55-59 are low and amount to about a half of the retention rates among prime aged workers. Only in Poland the retention rates of older workers have increased for both men and women between 1998 and 2013. The individuals least likely to retain jobs after the age of 60 were women, those with lower education, working in industry, in medium or low-skilled occupations, and those living with a nonworking partner. The policies aimed at encouraging job retention in Central and Eastern Europe should focus on these groups of workers.","[Hardy, Wojciech; Kielczewska, Aneta] Inst Struct Res IBS, Wisniowa 40B-8, PL-02520 Warsaw, Poland; [Lewandowski, Piotr; Magda, Iga] Inst Struct Res IBS, Management Board, Warsaw, Poland; [Hardy, Wojciech] Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland; [Lewandowski, Piotr] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Magda, Iga] Warsaw Sch Econ, Dept Econ 1, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Warsaw School of Economics,"Magda, I (通讯作者)，Inst Struct Res IBS, Wisniowa 40B-8, PL-02520 Warsaw, Poland.;Magda, I (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland.",iga.magda@ibs.org.pl,"Magda, Iga/JJG-1837-2023; Hardy, Wojciech/ABC-4173-2021; Hardy, Wojciech/ABA-5334-2020","Magda, Iga/0000-0003-4923-6922; Hardy, Wojciech/0000-0002-8827-7359; Lewandowski, Piotr/0000-0003-2506-5639; Kielczewska, Aneta/0000-0003-4165-1240",World Bank Group [FY2016 Development Grant Facility Network for Jobs and Development (NJD): Creating Multi-Disciplinary Solutions - DGF] [502916-05],World Bank Group [FY2016 Development Grant Facility Network for Jobs and Development (NJD): Creating Multi-Disciplinary Solutions - DGF],This work was supported by the World Bank Group [FY2016 Development Grant Facility Network for Jobs and Development (NJD): Creating Multi-Disciplinary Solutions - DGF File: 502916-05].,,62,5,7,2,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1406-099X,2334-4385,,BALT J ECON,Balt.

Embedded in the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, the rollout was aimed at limiting, or possibly reversing, the negative effects of the recession that was just starting. Substantial research concentrated on capturing the impact of the stimulus on consumption behaviour. Prior research suggests that the tax rebate had a small and/or no positive effect. This raises the question: How did individuals spent their tax rebate? Using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation 2008 panel wave 1 topical module, the data suggest that more than half of the respondents, who received the rebate, used this one-time windfall to pay off debt. Our findings indicate that this effect is more pronounced among low-income individuals, who chose to service their debt burden instead of increasing immediate consumption. The findings point to a stabilizing effect of the tax rebate programme on the financial sector, suggesting that substantial distributional asymmetries exist concerning tax rebate programmes in an economy where a large share of households are indebted.","[Hisnanick, John J.] US Bur Census, Washington, DC 20233 USA; [Hisnanick, John J.; Kern, Andreas] Georgetown Univ, McCourt Sch Publ Policy, Washington, DC USA",Georgetown University,"Hisnanick, JJ (通讯作者)，2118 Edgewater Pkwy, Silver Spring, MD 20903 USA.",jhisnanick@yahoo.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

To foster innovation and growth in these firms, governments address financing constraints by initiating public support programs. For such financial support to be effective, it is, however, important that firms are able to augment publicly provided resources with additional means. This study examines the relationship between new ventures' subsidy receipt and long-term bank loans. Studying new ventures founded between 2005 and 2009 in Germany, we test whether the subsidy itself facilitates use to bank financing. Applying econometric techniques that account for the endogenous nature of a subsidy receipt, we find that subsidized young firms are more likely to use bank loans and to have obtained a larger share of their financing mix from banks. We further show that this effect is stronger in highly information-opaque sectors. These results suggest that the effect may be attributed to an information value carried by the grant that is relevant to banks' loan assessment procedures, especially when new venture value is difficult to judge.","[Hottenrott, Hanna] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Management, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Lins, Elmar; Lutz, Eva] Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, Entrepreneurship Entrepreneurial Finance, Dusseldorf, Germany",Technical University of Munich; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf,"Hottenrott, H (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Management, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",hanna.hottenrott@tum.de,"Hottenrott, Hanna/H-4014-2018; Hottenrott, Hanna/AAE-7037-2021","Hottenrott, Hanna/0000-0002-1584-8106;",,,,,65,14,15,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

This is also strictly connected with the adopted approach to strategic management (a planned long-term approach or a flexible one). The purpose of the article was therefore to examine whether there is a relationship between the approach to strategic management and the innovativeness in companies of various sizes. Two different aspects were considered: a flexible approach, understood as the dynamism of acting and responding to different changes, and a long-term and planned approach based on precise defining and implementing plans for further development. The results of the conducted research showed that in large enterprises, innovativeness involves responding strategically to challenges in the environment, rather than developing the planned concept in the long run. In small companies, however, it seems that innovativeness is not associated with the approach to strategic management not only as the long-term concept, but also as the flexible approach.","[Kaleta, Andrzej; Radomska, Joanna; Soloducho-Pelc, Letycja] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Strateg Management, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Kaleta, A (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Strateg Management, Wroclaw, Poland.",,"Sołoducho-Pelc, Letycja M./J-5679-2018; Kaleta, Andrzej/T-4781-2018; Radomska, Joanna/L-6484-2018","Sołoducho-Pelc, Letycja M./0000-0002-2941-2792; Kaleta, Andrzej/0000-0003-4912-7929; Radomska, Joanna/0000-0002-1597-8947",,,,,96,3,3,4,15,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

The relaxation approach will be included in the case of second order stochastic dominance constraints.","[Kankova, Vlasta] AS CR, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Prague, Czech Republic; [Kankova, Vlasta] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Dept Econometr, Pod Vodarenskou Vezi 4, Prague 18208 8, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Kanková, V (通讯作者)，AS CR, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Prague, Czech Republic.;Kanková, V (通讯作者)，Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Dept Econometr, Pod Vodarenskou Vezi 4, Prague 18208 8, Czech Republic.",kankova@utia.cas.cz,,,Czech Science Foundation [18-02739S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),This work was supported by the Czech Science Foundation under Grant No. 18-02739S.,,10,0,0,0,0,"LETRA INTERACTIVE, SRO",BRATISLAVA,"NA REVINE 29-D, BRATISLAVA, 831 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-89962-08-2,,,,2018,,,,,,,165,171,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455265500021,0

We control for microfinance-specific variables such as capital-assets-ratio, loans-assets and the size of the MFI. The analyses also account for the endogeneity problem by employing the fixed-effects two-stage least squares and the fixed-effects system generalized method of moments.

We show how two of the distinguishing characteristics of capital ownership and the intertemporal nature of investment give rise to a dynamic inefficiency. Firms that anticipate buying capital in the future overinvest because this increases their outside option of no trade in negotiations with dealers in the future, thereby lowering the bargained purchase price. Vice versa, firms that anticipate selling capital in the future strategically underinvest because this increases the bargained sale price. If the only motive for trade is capital depreciation, there is overinvestment. With stochastic productivity, high-productivity firms underinvest and low-productivity firms overinvest. In equilibrium, the inefficiency interacts with the externality from dealer entry and implies that no bargaining power achieves the constrained efficient allocation. We propose a regressive tax on capital that can restore efficiency. Finally, we calibrate the model to data on physical capital markets and show that depending on bargaining power, the welfare loss from the inefficiency can be large. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In this conceptual paper, the authors aim to model determinants of customer loyalty and put forward propositions to be empirically tested in further studies. The originality of the paper manifests itself in the theoretical model proposed, which clearly delineates determinants of customer loyalty (i.e., marketing communication channels, perceived service quality and customer satisfaction) and emphasises the importance of strategic decisions about communication channel options to match customer preferences to predict combined effects of customer loyalty across different cultural contexts.","[Lee, Kelvin] Nanyang Technol Univ, 42 Nanyang Ave,Student Serv Ctr Level 1, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Salciuviene, Laura] Univ Lancaster, Management Sch, Charles Carter Bldg,Room D08, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England",Nanyang Technological University; Lancaster University,"Lee, K (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, 42 Nanyang Ave,Student Serv Ctr Level 1, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",cskelvinlee@ntu.edu.sg; l.salciuviene@lancaster.ac.uk,,,,,,,97,0,1,1,11,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

This creates an important theoretical challenge: the literature (which the previous experience of Eurasian regionalism was very much in line with) conjectures that authoritarian states are unable to successfully implement an economic regional integration agreement (RIA). The aim of the article is to explore the conditions under which implementation of economic RIAs by autocracies happens. We argue that the implementation is influenced by the extent of economic, social and political ties between member states, and suggest that, unlike democratic states, which are more likely to implement a RIA where there are strong economic ties, non-democracies are more likely to do so in the case of intermediate economic dependence.","[Libman, Alexander] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Inst Sociol, Munich, Germany; [Vinokurov, Evgeny] Eurasian Dev Bank, St Petersburg, Russia",University of Munich,"Libman, A (通讯作者)，Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Inst Sociol, Munich, Germany.",alibman@yandex.com,"Vinokurov, Evgeny/F-1668-2014","Vinokurov, Evgeny/0000-0002-9584-3494",MOE Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences in Universities of China (Center for Russian Studies of East China Normal University) [16JJDGJW004],MOE Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences in Universities of China (Center for Russian Studies of East China Normal University),This article is supported by the MOE [grant number 16JJDGJW004] Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences in Universities of China (Center for Russian Studies of East China Normal University).,,96,16,16,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2018,30.0,3,,,,,334,364,,10.1080/14631377.2018.1442057,0.0,,,31,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GF8JM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432216800003,0

We develop an economic framework for the strength model, and test its consequences in the field by analyzing the appeal of various food types by university students who face time-varying academic self-control demands. Our study utilizes both empirical analysis of actual university-wide transactions data, and a field survey approach with a real snack choice task. Compared to cafeteria purchases, purchase of less healthy fast foods increases during the week of final exams when students' workloads are most cognitively demanding, compared to the purchase ratio of food sources during other times of the year. Helping to rule out alternative explanations, in the field survey the main robust and significant predictor of choosing an unhealthy snack over a healthy snack is subjects' self-reported time needed to complete their academic responsibilities during the upcoming week. As combined evidence, these findings are consistent with an economic model of limited self-control in which students choose how to allocate their self-control between academic activities and eating activities. Under such a framework, the overall effectiveness of policies designed to help individuals make beneficial choices in a specific domain could be in practice, adversely affected by limited self-control capacities.

Data include information about social and military background, and motives for more than 600 soldiers, 444 of whom answered the survey both before and after deployment. Soldiers are deployed to different missions under the same circumstances. To conceptualize motives among soldiers, we use factor analysis and find three factors: challenge, self-benefit, and fidelity. Challenge represents an occupational orientation; fidelity, an institutional orientation; and self-benefit, a desire for adventure. Exploiting the within-subject design of our data, we find that pre- and post-deployment motives vary significantly according to the type of mission and soldiers' previous experiences (first-timers or experienced soldiers). Our results suggest that after the mission, peace-keepers are generally more disappointed than peace-enforcers. Our results also show that self-benefit motives are important for younger soldiers with only a high school education, and that this group usually serves as peace-enforcers during their gap year.","[Lyk-Jensen, Stephanie Vincent; Glad, Ane] Danish Natl Ctr Social Res, Copenhagen, Denmark",,"Lyk-Jensen, SV (通讯作者)，Danish Natl Ctr Social Res, Copenhagen, Denmark.",svj@sfi.dk,"Lyk-jensen, Stéphanie Vincent/AAO-6027-2021",/0000-0003-1795-6757,Soldaterlegatet; Tryg; Lundbeck; Novo Nordisk; Aase and Ejnar Danielsen's funds,Soldaterlegatet; Tryg; Lundbeck(Lundbeck Corporation); Novo Nordisk(Novo NordiskNovo Nordisk Foundation); Aase and Ejnar Danielsen's funds,"This work was supported by Soldaterlegatet with financial support from Tryg, Lundbeck, Novo Nordisk, and Aase and Ejnar Danielsen's funds for financing the data collection.",,28,4,4,1,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

The literature has tended to explain this through skill-biased technical change (SBTC). Empirical work has concentrated around two variants: (1) capital-skill complementarity, (2) skill-augmenting technical change. Our purpose is to nest and discriminate between these two explanations. We do so in the framework of multilevel Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) production function, where factors are disaggregated into skilled and unskilled labor, and capital into structures and equipment capital. Using a five-equation system approach and several nesting alternatives, we retrieve estimates of the substitution elasticities and technical changes. Our estimations can produce results in line with capital-skill-complementarity hypothesis. However, those results are outperformed where the only source of the widening skill premium has been skill-augmenting technical change. We also show that the different explanations for SBTC have different implications for projected developments of the premium.","[McAdam, Peter] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany; [McAdam, Peter] Univ Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, England; [Willman, Alpo] Univ Kent, Canterbury, Kent, England",European Central Bank; University of Surrey; University of Kent,"McAdam, P (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Res Dept, Sonnemannstr, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany.",peter.mcadam@ecb.europa.eu,,,,,,,25,13,13,3,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Censored and double-hurdle regression models are used to estimate the relative contributions of bond-level, issuer-level, and macroeconomic factors that determine this distance, separately for those rated at or below the sovereign rating and those rated above. For the three quarters or more of sub-sovereign bond ratings that are constrained by the sovereign rating ceiling, a Tobit regression model shows a smaller distance - suggesting stronger sovereign-corporate linkages - for public sector enterprises and financial firms relative to other firms. Riskier global financial conditions are also associated with sub-sovereign bonds being rated closer to the sovereign rating. For the small number of sub-sovereign bonds rated higher than the sovereign rating, a double-hurdle model shows that certain debt features - such as bonds backed by future-flow receivables or other collateral or structured as Special Purpose Vehicles (SPV) - significantly raise the likelihood of piercing the sovereign rating ceiling and also increase the distance above the sovereign ceiling.","[Mohapatra, Sanket] Indian Inst Management, Econ Area, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India; [Nose, Manabu] Int Monetary Fund, African Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Ratha, Dilip] World Bank, Migrat & Remittances Unit, Dev Econ Vice Presidency, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad; International Monetary Fund; The World Bank,"Mohapatra, S (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management, IIM Old Campus, Ahmadabad 380015, Gujarat, India.",sanketm@iima.ac.in,"Ratha, Dilip/AAY-6419-2021",,"DEC Research Support Budget, World Bank, Washington, DC, USA; Research and Publications Committee, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, India","DEC Research Support Budget, World Bank, Washington, DC, USA; Research and Publications Committee, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, India","This work was supported by the DEC Research Support Budget, World Bank, Washington, DC, USA; Research and Publications Committee, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, India.",,41,13,13,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We find that interlocking director network has significant and negative effects on firm values measured as Tobin's Q and performance measured as return of assets and total factor productivity. This result suggests that the interlocking directors maintain and use vested right to pursue their own interests.

The main purpose of this article is to provide an empirical analysis of the reaction of road tax policy in a given French department' to changes in road tax policy in other departments'. The analysis uses a novel panel data set covering the 96 French metropolitan departments' for the period from 1984 to 2000. First, the results confirm the presence of significant spatial interactions between French departments' due to the road tax sticker. Second, the estimation results also show that the business tax rate and/or the property tax rate on developed land are complements to the road tax sticker, whereas the residence tax rate and/or the property tax rate on undeveloped land are substitutes to the road tax instrument. Finally, I find that departments' with a larger, younger and older population set higher rates for the road tax sticker.

First, we extend the Ganslandt and Maskus (2007) model of vertical pricing with parallel trade. Our innovation is to consider both domestic trade, where trading costs are relatively low, and international trade, where trading costs are relatively high. If trading costs decline, the model predicts price divergence in the former case, and price convergence in the latter case. Second, using the introduction of the euro as a natural experiment that reduced trading costs, we employ difference-in-differences estimation strategy to test the model's predictions. Our results show that while individual goods prices between countries converged by 2%, within-country prices diverged by 4%, supporting the predictions of our model.","[Nikolsko-Rzhevskyy, Alex] Lehigh Univ, Dept Econ, 621 Taylor St, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Ogrokhina, Olena] Lafayette Coll, Dept Econ, 730 High St, Easton, PA 18042 USA",Lehigh University; Lafayette College,"Nikolsko-Rzhevskyy, A (通讯作者)，Lehigh Univ, Dept Econ, 621 Taylor St, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.",alex.rzhevskyy@gmail.com; ogrokhio@lafayette.edu,"Nikolsko-Rzhevskyy, Alex/ABA-2553-2020",,,,,,20,3,3,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

A challenging feature of these problems is non-existence of an optimal solution due to considering multiple criteria and the proposed methods seeking to find a satisfactory solution called efficient of Pareto-optimal. In consideration of MCDA problem, in this paper a new method is proposed for solving DM problems, consisting three fundamental steps of initialization, orthogonalization, and comparison. Thus, a new MCDA method called total area based on orthogonal vectors (TAOV) is introduced. This method is constructed on orthogonality of decision criteria. Application of TAOV method is illustrated in a decision problem and its performance is evaluated regard to other MCDA methods. Furthermore, its features are explained around the features of a desirable MCDA method.

We address this question using Switzerland as an example and our approach, based on Boriss Siliverstovs (2017), can be easily extended to other national PMIs.

The approach is suitable when actual interaction takes place on a smaller local level, while the omitted variables are spatially correlated at a larger regional level and correlated with the included characteristics. We provide an empirical motivation and use Monte Carlo simulation to illustrate the bias-reduction effects in certain settings.","[Storm, Hugo; Heckelei, Thomas] Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn,"Storm, H (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Bonn, Germany.",hugo.storm@ilr.uni-bonn.de; thomas.heckelei@ilr.uni-bonn.de,"Storm, Hugo/AAT-9629-2021; Heckelei, Thomas/C-2714-2011; Storm, Hugo/GVU-3032-2022","Storm, Hugo/0000-0003-3791-3615; Heckelei, Thomas/0000-0002-6251-3480; Storm, Hugo/0000-0003-3791-3615",German Research Foundation (DFG) - Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [STO 1087/1-1],German Research Foundation (DFG) - Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),The work was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) - Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [grant number STO 1087/1-1].,,18,6,6,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

This simple economy uses these two components to evaluate how oil prices affect the consumer economy's gross domestic product and inflation. This model assumes that changes in the oil price transfer to macro variables through either supply (aggregate supply curve) or demand channels (aggregate demand curve). To examine the effects of this transfer, an Investment-Saving (IS) curve is used to look at the demand side and a Phillips curve is used to analyze the inflationary effects from the supply side. The empirical analysis concludes that movements in the oil price mainly affect the economy through the demand side (shifting the aggregate demand curve) by affecting household expenditures and energy consumption. This analysis provides several additional findings, among which is that easy monetary policies amplify energy demand more than supply, resulting in skyrocketing crude oil prices, which inhibit economic growth.","[Taghizadeh-Hesary, Farhad] Waseda Univ, Fac Polit Sci & Econ, Tokyo, Japan; [Yoshino, Naoyuki] ADBI, Tokyo, Japan; [Yoshino, Naoyuki] Keio Univ, Tokyo, Japan",Waseda University; Keio University,"Taghizadeh-Hesary, F (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Fac Polit Sci & Econ, Tokyo, Japan.",,"Taghizadeh-Hesary, Farhad/R-5136-2018","Taghizadeh-Hesary, Farhad/0000-0001-5446-7093; Yoshino, Naoyuki/0000-0001-8060-5314",,,,,41,9,9,0,11,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

The analysis of these relationships is vital considering the instability of the global economy which has affected growth. In this study, we employed annual time series data covering the period of 1970-2015. Using advanced co-integration and causality analysis, we found strong evidence on the relationship between each of the examined variables. The results from this study provide evidence on the taxes-growth nexus for Malaysia. An inverted U-shaped relationship is found between financial development and tax collection, while a U-shape reflects the economic condition. The nexus between economic growth and tax revenue enhances fiscal policies in the creation of transparent and mature financial systems which will further boost the collection of government revenues in Malaysia. The results of this study may provide an avenue for researchers and policymakers to understand the nature of the relationship between the examined variables and further assist in the formulation of new policies for economic sustainability.","[Taha, Roshaiza] Univ Malaysia Terengganu, Sch Maritime Business & Management, Kuala Terengganu, Malaysia; [Sliogeriene, Jurate] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Construct Management & Real Estate, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Loganathan, Nanthakumar] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Management, Johor Baharu, Malaysia; [Joksiene, Izolda] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Business Management, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Shahbaz, Muhammad] Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier, France; [Mardani, Abbas] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Dept Business Adm, Johor Baharu, Malaysia",Universiti Malaysia Terengganu; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Montpellier Business School; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Sliogeriene, J (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Construct Management & Real Estate, Vilnius, Lithuania.",Jurate.sliogeriene@vgtu.lt,"Shahbaz, Muhammad/AAS-6190-2021; TAHA, ROSHAIZA/J-2106-2015; Loganathan, Nanthakumar/I-7325-2012; Mardani, Abbas/D-5700-2015; Shahbaz, Muhammad/AAD-9038-2019","Shahbaz, Muhammad/0000-0003-2391-6997; Loganathan, Nanthakumar/0000-0002-3221-6629; Mardani, Abbas/0000-0003-1010-3655; Joksiene, Izolda/0000-0002-7871-8878",Ministry Higher Education of Malaysia under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme [FRGS/1/2017/SS08/UTM/02/5],Ministry Higher Education of Malaysia under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme,This research is funded by the Ministry Higher Education of Malaysia under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS/1/2017/SS08/UTM/02/5).

The paper finds robust evidence that output volatility is significantly lowered by a country's production of S&T publications. The results show that the effect of S&T publications on output volatility is particularly strong in middle-income, OECD and other high-income countries. However, for East-Asian, low-income and sub-Saharan African countries the effect is either weak or absent. These results provide strong evidence that not only OECD and other high-income countries are actively engaged in S&T research, emerging developing countries are also conducting S&T research, which is effective in reducing output volatility. The results are robust to adding a host of control variables, various subsamples and different estimation techniques.","[Tang, Sam Hak Kan] Univ Western Australia, Crawley, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Tang, SHK (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Business, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",sam.tang@uwa.edu.au,,,,,,,71,0,0,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

Outstanding debt generates a stream of rents to creditors and has become a significant burden on many households. A policy of household debt forgiveness could increase both economic equality and individual liberty. Under what conditions might such a policy be socially acceptable and what would be the implications of such a policy? For debt forgiveness to gain social acceptance the U.S. population would have to perceive the policy as fair and believe that such a program would treat all households equally. Furthermore, any such policy would be politically impossible if it stripped asset owners of money due or would not substantially lower household debt levels. This article explores some possible parameters that a politically feasible policy would contain, and it offers an estimate of policy costs.","[Wunder, Timothy] Univ Texas Arlington, Econ, Arlington, TX 76019 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington,"Wunder, T (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Arlington, Econ, Arlington, TX 76019 USA.",,,,,,,,23,1,1,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

The findings cast doubts on the popular perception that the recent surge in ODI from India is an unmixed economic blessing, a sign of coming of age of Indian companies in global business.

This study further explores potentially harmful effects of communication, by addressing the questions of (1) asymmetric communication and (2) the endogenous emergence of communication. Our theoretical analysis provides testable hypotheses regarding the effect of communication on competitive behavior and efficiency. We test these predictions using a laboratory experiment. The experiment shows that although asymmetric communication is not as harmful as symmetric communication, it leads to more aggressive competition and lower efficiency relative to the case when neither group can communicate. Moreover, groups vote to endogenously establish communication channels even though they would earn higher payoffs if jointly they chose to restrict within-group communication.","[Cason, Timothy N.] Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, Dept Econ, 403 W State St, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA; [Sheremeta, Roman M.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Weatherhead Sch Management, Dept Econ, 11119 Bellflower Rd, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Sheremeta, Roman M.] Chapman Univ, Econ Sci Inst, One Univ Dr, Orange, CA 92866 USA; [Zhang, Jingjing] Univ Technol Sydney, Econ Discipline Grp, POB 123, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University; Chapman University System; Chapman University; University of Technology Sydney,"Cason, TN (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, Dept Econ, 403 W State St, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA.",cason@purdue.edu,,"Zhang, Jingjing/0000-0003-3274-5245",National Science Foundation [SES-0721019],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank Jordi Brandts, Subhasish Chowdhury, David Cooper, Martin Dufwenberg, Enrique Fatas, Anya Samek, Marta Serra-Garcia, two anonymous referees, seminar participants at University of New South Wales, University of Technology, Sydney, Chapman University, Purdue University and participants at the Thurgau Experimental Economics Conference, the International Economic Science Association Meetings, the North-American Economic Science Association Meetings, the European Economic Science Association Meetings, and the workshop in honor of John Van Huyck for helpful discussions and comments.

We contribute to this literature by developing a DSGE model that assesses the effectiveness of countercyclical capital regulation in small open economies, in monetary unions or with exchange rate pegs, where policymakers do not have full control over traditional stabilisation instruments such as nominal interest and exchange rates. In such economies, macroprudential policy could potentially play an even more relevant role in mitigating the adverse effects of macro-financial feedback loops. To validate the model's ability to replicate the stylised facts of financial crises, we calibrate using data for the Irish economy, the scene of a recent housing crash. Our results demonstrate that the pro-active use of countercyclical capital regulation in the form of Basel HI-type rules can help attenuate boom-bust cycles driven by over-optimistic expectations. We also find that more aggressive action by regulators during the release phase can bolster the economy's ability to absorb a negative shock. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We study the case of the Freedom Party of Austria (FPA-) that, under the leadership of Jorg Haider, increased its vote share from less than 5% in the early 1980s to 27% by the end of the 1990s and continued to attract more than 20% of voters in the 2013 national election. We find that the inflow of immigrants into a community has a significant impact on the increase in the community's voting share for the FPA-, explaining roughly a tenth of the regional variation in vote changes. Our results suggest that voters worry about adverse labor market effects of immigration, as well as about the quality of their neighborhood. In fact, we find evidence of a negative impact of immigration on compositional amenities. In communities with larger immigration influx, Austrian children commute longer distances to school, and fewer daycare resources are provided. We do not find evidence that Austrians move out of communities with increasing immigrant presence.

The estimation procedure uses credit spreads to help identify the role of financial shocks amenable to stabilization via monetary or macroprudential instruments. The estimated model implies that monetary policy should not respond strongly to the credit cycle and can only partially insulate the economy from the distortionary effects of financial frictions/shocks. A counter-cyclical macroprudential instrument can enhance welfare, but faces important implementation challenges. In particular, a Ramsey planner who adjusts a leverage tax in an optimal way can largely insulate the economy from shocks to intermediation, but a simple-rule approach must be cautious not to limit credit expansions associated with efficient investment opportunities. These results demonstrate the importance of considering both optimal Ramsey policies and simpler, but more practical, approaches in an empirically grounded model.

However, under certain circumstances, fiscal austerity may worsen external disequilibrium. This paper discusses the conditions in which instability may emerge using a Keynesian model which highlights the crucial role of public investment for structural change and competitiveness in developing economies. In addition, the paper addresses the interactions between fiscal policy, the exchange rate policy and industrial policy. It is argued that a virtuous circle between these variables is possible. A competitive real exchange rate combined with an industrial policy aimed at increasing the diversification and technological intensity of exports may make compatible growth and income distribution.

A simple game of settlement is developed to reflect strategic interaction between creditors in this environment. Payoffs to creditors depend only on the rank-order in which they settle and the solution concept is Markov-perfect equilibrium. This generates an extremely simple and tractable solution under which delay depends a comparison between the immediate payoff and the average over payoffs going forward. The solution can generate sequences of cascade and delay observed in practice. Comparative dynamics, the effect of increasing the number of creditors and the impact on delay of secondary markets are analyzed. We derive the empirical distribution of delay implied by the model for comparison to the observed distribution of delays in the data. Finally, we derive predictions for the time path of settlements within a given sovereign debt restructuring as a function of the motives for creditors to holdout, and compare these predictions with data on the ongoing negotiations to restructure Argentina's debts.","[Pitchford, Rohan] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Acton, ACT 0200, Australia; [Wright, Mark L.

All of these perspectives can be seen as the profession wrestling with the implications of near-zero interest rates. In my view, pre-2008 macro theory provides all of the tools we need to understand the Great Recession.

By testing the hypothesis that poor governance leads to higher accumulation of MENA public debt over the period, the results show that only three governance indicators support well this hypothesis. These variables are Political Stability and Absence of Violence index, Regulatory Quality index and Rule of Law index. Moreover, the estimates suggest a significant indirect impact of bad governance operating via decreased GDP growth. These findings have important implications for policy makers of these countries which are currently facing major fiscal and external imbalances due to the high cost of war and terrorist attacks, low oil prices and a decline in trade. Sound public debt management represents an urgent task especially that public debt management problems often find their origins in the lack of attention paid by policymakers to the costs of bad governance and weak macroeconomic management (C) 2017 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland.

The measure of the gap is the smallest Frobenius norm of the correcting matrix function that would yield a Slutsky matrix with its standard rationality properties (symmetry, singularity, and negative semidefiniteness). As a result, we are able to suggest a useful classification of departures from rationality, corresponding to three anomalies: inattentiveness to changes in purchasing power, money illusion, and violations of the compensated law of demand. Errors in comparative-statics predictions from assuming rationality are decomposed as the sum of a behavioral error (due to the agent) and a specification error (due to the modeller).

Building on entropy balancing, my results reveal strong evidence that domestic BM participation significantly reduces financial dollarization in domestic BM countries compared to their non-domestic BM peers. Moreover, I find that the favorable impact of domestic BM on financial dollarization (i) is larger for inflation targeting countries compared to non-inflation targeting countries, (ii) is apparent exclusively in a non-pegged exchange rate regime, (iii) and is larger when there are fiscal rules that constrain the discretion of fiscal policy makers. Finally, I show that the induced drop in inflation rate and its variability, nominal exchange rate variability, and seigniorage revenue are potential transmission mechanisms through which the presence of domestic BM reduces financial dollarization in domestic BM countries.","[Balima, Weneyam Hippolyte] Univ Clermont Auvergne, Sch Econ, Clermont Ferrand, France; [Balima, Weneyam Hippolyte] Univ Clermont Auvergne, CERDI, Clermont Ferrand, France",Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA),"Balima, WH (通讯作者)，Univ Clermont Auvergne, Sch Econ, Clermont Ferrand, France.;Balima, WH (通讯作者)，Univ Clermont Auvergne, CERDI, Clermont Ferrand, France.",weneyam.balima@udamail.fr,,"Balima, Hippolyte/0000-0002-8036-0967",,,,,24,9,9,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

About 60 percent of the differences in slopes of early life-cycle wage profiles are explained by heterogeneity while individual differences in hours worked and education explain the remaining part almost equally. We show how our model is a particularly useful tool to comprehend the distinctions between compulsory schooling and a reduction in the cost of higher education. Finally, because policy changes induce simultaneous movements in observed choices and average per-year effects, linear instrumental variable (IV) estimates generated by those policy changes are uninformative about the returns to education for those affected. This is especially true for compulsory schooling estimates as they exceed IV estimates generated by the reduction in the cost of higher education even if the latter policy affects individuals with much higher returns than than those affected by compulsory schooling.","[Belzil, Christian] Univ Paris Saclay, Ecole Polytech, Dept Econ, CREST,CNRS, Paris, France; [Belzil, Christian; Hansen, Jorgen; Liu, Xingfei] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Hansen, Jorgen] Concordia Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Hansen, Jorgen] CIRANO, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Hansen, Jorgen] CIREQ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Liu, Xingfei] Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB, Canada",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paris Saclay; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Concordia University - Canada; Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal; University of Alberta,"Belzil, C (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Saclay, Ecole Polytech, Dept Econ, CREST,CNRS, Paris, France.;Belzil, C (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.",christian.belzil@gmail.com; Jorgen.Hansen@concordia.ca; feiya66@gmail.com,"Belzil, christian/HLW-1637-2023; Liu, Xingfei/ADF-4591-2022",,Investissement d'Avenir [ANR-11-IDEX-0003/Labex Ecodec/ANR-11-LABX-0047]; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [410-2011-1928],Investissement d'Avenir(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"We would like to thank the co-editor and two anonymous referees for useful comments.

We first consider the static game and then we address an evolutionary version of it. We show that the result for which under quantity competition strategic delegation entails output expansion and higher consumers' welfare than at the standard Cournot-Nash equilibrium is not necessarily true, but depends on the price elasticity of demand. Then, we study the main welfare implications of the model in order to understand whether the prevailing long-run industry configuration provides the highest welfare. We show that this may occur when both firms provide a mixed incentive and that, in this case, the model admits feasible trajectories the long-run configuration of which yields the highest welfare. Finally, we address the robustness of our results by means of an evolutionary model with heterogeneous players.","[De Giovanni, Domenico; Lamantia, Fabio] Univ Calabria, Dept Econ Stat & Finance, Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy; [Lamantia, Fabio] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Calabria; University of Manchester,"Lamantia, F (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, Dept Econ Stat & Finance, Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy.;Lamantia, F (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England.",ddegiovanni@unical.it; lamantia@unical.it,,"De Giovanni, Domenico/0000-0002-5851-6064; Lamantia, Fabio/0000-0003-2147-0979",EU COST Action [IS1104],EU COST Action(European Union (EU)European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)),"The authors would like to thank Mario Pezzino and Davide Radi as well as the anonymous referees for helpful comments on the paper.

Data from matching markets, however, may not exhibit perfect assortativity due to the presence of unobserved characteristics. This paper studies the identification and estimation of such models. We show that the distribution of the latent index is not identified when data from one-to-one matches are observed. Remarkably, the model is nonparametrically identified using data in a single large market when each agent on one side has at least two matched partners. The additional empirical content in many-to-one matches is demonstrated using simulations and stylized examples. We then derive asymptotic properties of a minimum distance estimator as the size of the market increases, allowing estimation using dependent data from a single large matching market. The nature of the dependence requires modification of existing empirical process techniques to obtain a limit theorem.","[Diamond, William] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Agarwal, Nikhil] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Agarwal, Nikhil] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Pennsylvania; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research,"Diamond, W (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",diamondw@wharton.upenn.edu; agarwaln@mit.edu,,,,,,,51,7,11,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

However, recently a rebound in fertility has been observed in several industrialized countries. A possible explanation of this trend may be the spread of egalitarian values that induced institutional changes - such as expansion of child care facilities and father leave - and also changes in norms and values - such as gender equity in the distribution of domestic work - that foster the combination of parenthood and the egalitarian lifestyle. To study the diffusion from traditional to egalitarian gender-behavior and its impact on fertility a two-dimensional system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations is used. It is shown that the long-run development of the total fertility within a population not only depends on key parameters such as the pace of diffusion of egalitarianism and the extent to which social interactions affect the egalitarians' birth rates, but also on the initial number of traditionalists and egalitarians. One of the main purposes of the present paper is to illustrate how bifurcation theory can be used to study the process of increasing gender equality and its implications on fertility.","[Feichtinger, Gustav; Prskawetz, Alexia; Simon, Christa] Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Stat & Math Methods Econ, Wiedner Hauptstr 8-10, A-1040 Vienna, Austria; [Feichtinger, Gustav; Prskawetz, Alexia; Wrzaczek, Stefan] WU, Vienna Inst Demog, Austrian Acad Sci,OAW, Wittgenstein Ctr Demog & Global Human Capital IIA, Welthandelspl 2,Level 2, A-1020 Vienna, Austria; [Seidl, Andrea] Univ Vienna, Dept Business Adm, Oskar Morgenstern Pl 1, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",Technische Universitat Wien; Austrian Academy of Sciences; University of Vienna,"Feichtinger, G (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Stat & Math Methods Econ, Wiedner Hauptstr 8-10, A-1040 Vienna, Austria.;Feichtinger, G (通讯作者)，WU, Vienna Inst Demog, Austrian Acad Sci,OAW, Wittgenstein Ctr Demog & Global Human Capital IIA, Welthandelspl 2,Level 2, A-1020 Vienna, Austria.",gustav.feichtinger@tuwien.ac.at,,"Seidl, Andrea/0000-0003-4882-5688",,,,,34,3,3,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

The proof is algorithmic in nature: gross substitutes is exactly the condition that enables a natural price adjustment procedure - known as Walrasian tatonnement - to converge to equilibrium. The same concept was also introduced independently in other communities with different names: M-(sic)-concave functions (Murota and Shioura), Matroidal and Well -Layered maps (Dress and Terhalle) and valuated matroids (Dress and Wenzel). Here we survey various definitions of gross substitutability and show their equivalence. We focus on algorithmic aspects of the various definitions. In particular, we highlight that gross substitutes are the exact class of valuations for which demand oracles can be computed via an ascending greedy algorithm. It also corresponds to a natural discrete analogue of concave functions: local maximizers correspond to global maximizers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Yet, while a large literature examines consumers' optimal price and product-search behavior under various market configurations, the equilibrium effects of such consumer segregation remain unexplored. To this end, I study a stylized model in which two local monopolistic markets differ in size and their consumers' willingness to pay. After observing their native market's price, a subset of flexible consumers may travel to the other market at positive cost, hoping for a bargain. I show that as long as the proportion of flexible high-valuation consumers is not too large, active and directed search to the lower-valuation market will occur in equilibrium. If the higher-valuation market is relatively large in size, complex mixed-strategy pricing emerges in equilibrium. For regulators, increasing the fraction of flexible consumers tends to be more effective than manipulating search costs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The industry is characterized by a finite number of ex-ante homogeneous firms that, characterized by na < ve expectations, decide next-period output by employing one of the two behavioral rules. The inverse demand function is linear and all firms have the same quadratic and convex cost function (decreasing return to scale). Based upon realized profits, the distribution of behavioral rules is updated according to a replicator dynamics. The model is characterized by two equilibria: the Cournot-Nash equilibrium, where all firms adopt the best-reply rule and produce the Cournot-Nash quantity, and the Walrasian equilibrium, where all firms adopt the Walrasian rule and produce the Walrasian quantity. The analysis reveals that the Walrasian equilibrium is globally stable as long as the rate of change of marginal cost exceeds the sum of residual market price sensitivities to output. If not, the Walrasian equilibrium loses stability and an attractor, representing complicated dynamics with evolutionary stable heterogeneity, arises through a bifurcation. As the propensity of firms to select the more profitable behavioral rule increases, the attractor disappears through a global bifurcation and the Cournot-Nash equilibrium can become a global Milnor attractor. To sum up, the best-reply rule can be evolutionary dominant over the Walrasian rule and this can lead an oligopoly to select the Cournot-Nash equilibrium.","[Radi, Davide] Univ Cattaneo, LIUC, Castellanza, VA, Italy",Universita Carlo Cattaneo - Liuc,"Radi, D (通讯作者)，Univ Cattaneo, LIUC, Castellanza, VA, Italy.",dradi@liuc.it,"Radi, Davide/M-6403-2013; Radi, Davide/HHR-9023-2022","Radi, Davide/0000-0001-7809-1166;",Department of Economics of Chuo University in Tokyo; University of Urbino Carlo Bo,Department of Economics of Chuo University in Tokyo; University of Urbino Carlo Bo,"The author thanks Gian Italo Bischi, Laura Gardini, Fabio Lamantia, Ivana Tuzharova, two anonymous reviewers and all participants in the Nonlinear Economic Dynamics 2015 conference in Tokyo (Tokyo NED conference) for their insightful comments and suggestions that have lead to several improvements in the paper.

We show that due to this setup our study is not suffering from selection and attrition issues plaguing existing studies. To estimate the causal effect of a unilateral trade liberalization we implement a difference in -differences model based on synthetic control methods. We find that on average agro-food exports of least-developed countries to Switzerland were about 80% higher due to the introduction of free market access. In other words, if Switzerland had followed the path of protectionism, least-developed countries' agro-food exports would have been almost half of what they are under free trade.

Global factors, such as a rise in global risk aversion and uncertainty and a reversal of nonstandard expansionary monetary policy, can also reduce the degree of co-movement of business cycles across countries.

While all of these species routinely make decisions in the context of social cooperation and competition, they have different socio-ecologies, which leads to different predictions about how they will respond. Our prediction was that anti-matching would be more difficult than matching in a symmetric coordination with simultaneous moves.

The results can be used to improve the performance of tax offices and to increase tax revenues. In this study, the operational flow of local tax offices was divided into two stages: tax collection and tax management. Network data envelopment analysis (NDEA) and a Russell directional distance function were used to evaluate operating efficiency in departments of 20 Taiwanese local tax offices for 2013. The results indicated that, first, efficiency was significantly different for tax collection and tax management. Second, the input inefficiency of tax collection was mainly due to total floor area, which was 15% larger than required, and the input inefficiency of tax management was mainly due to total floor area (23% larger than required), followed by direct labour input (19% larger than required). Finally, on average, the amount of collected property transfer taxes was 23% smaller than required. The model used in the present study included undesirable outputs. The findings indicated that the highest levels of overall inefficiency were due to inability to collect taxes (intermediate outputs) in Hsinchu County (9.27%), Chiayi County (3.25%) and Pingtung County (20.44%), which required reduction in the number of instances of inability to collect property taxes by 5619, 1258 and 12350 cases, respectively.

Our analysis is based on a general equilibrium model that includes inertias, such as imperfect sectoral labour mobility and vintage capital, and has a detailed depiction of the power generation sector. We found that international climate policy could reduce Russia's private welfare by 1.8% annually due to lower revenues from exports of fossil fuels. At the sectoral level, Russia could gain a comparative advantage in producing energy-intensive commodities and hence Russia's producers of those commodities increase their production and export supplies. This could result in a carbon leakage in Russia. Eliminating implicit subsidies on domestic consumption of gas and petroleum products could reduce Russia's private welfare loss by 0.6% points and eliminate the carbon leakage. Nevertheless, eliminating implicit subsidies on gas and petroleum products might not be sufficient to achieve the pledged emission reductions by 2030. Moreover, this leads to an undesirable increase in coal consumption and therefore, some additional climate policy such as a carbon tax or an emission trading system might be required. We also found that Russia's climate policy could have positive but moderate effects on the European economies; in particular, countries such as Lithuania, Slovakia, and Hungary benefit due to decreased export prices for gas, crude oil, and petroleum products from Russia.

We estimate time-varying electric grid marginal emissions and water consumption rates in ERCOT through a regression based analysis, and find that emissions and water consumption rates are lowest at high demand times due to those hours' reliance on cleaner natural gas generators. We utilize these emissions and water consumption rates to estimate the avoided GHGs and water consumption from grid electricity that solar panels provide. For electric vehicles, we estimate the net effect of this technology, given the avoided gasoline consumption but increase in grid-related charging. We find that, on average, solar panels avoid approximately 75% of yearly grid-related emissions (0.7 tons CO2/year per kW of solar capacity) and yearly grid-related water consumption (400 gal/year per kW of solar capacity), where the benefits depend on the orientation of the panels. We also find that electric vehicle deployment results in avoiding up to 70% of fuel-related emissions (3.5 tons CO2/year) and 60% of fuel-related water consumption (1400 gal/year), though the benefits significantly decrease with the efficiency of the counterfactual vehicle.

We integrate both the global economic policy uncertainty (GEPU) indices and several national economic policy uncertainty (EPU) indices with traditional determinants, such as global oil demand, supply, and speculation. Our analysis suggests that the EPU indices comprehensively integrate the information contained in other determinants. Specifically, GEPU indices and the U.S.'s EPU index have superior predictive powers for West Texas Intermediate spot oil volatility. This finding highlights the importance of EPU indices, implying that they are key factors to consider when determining crude oil market volatility. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The resulting equilibrium networks feature clustered connections and homophily. Clustering emerges because if player a is friend with b and b is friend with c, then a's information is likely to be shared indirectly with c anyway, making it less costly for a to befriend c.

When the government investment/GDP ratio reaches a certain point (threshold), the effect of government investment could change from positive to negative. The effect of public debt on economic growth demonstrates a similar pattern. Our results suggest that there must exist an optimal level of government investment or public debt as far as economic growth is concerned, although the optimal level may vary in different economies. The government investment/GDP and public debt/GDP ratios of China were respectively 15.66% and 41.14% in 2014.

We find that capital taxation has drastically different effects in the short run and in the long run. An increase in the capital income tax rate has both a consumption effect and a tax-shifting effect on the equilibrium growth rates of technology and output. In the short run, the consumption effect dominates the tax-shifting effect causing an initial negative effect of capital taxation on the equilibrium growth rates. However, in the long run, the tax-shifting effect becomes the dominant force yielding an overall positive effect of capital taxation on steady-state economic growth. These contrasting effects of capital taxation at different time horizons may provide a theoretical explanation for the mixed evidence in the empirical literature on capital taxation and economic growth.

By 2050, almost regardless of government policies, its urban population will have tripled. But the consequences are critically dependent upon policy choices: successful urbanization requires active and far-sighted government. At its best, urbanization can be the essential motor of economic development, rapidly lifting societies out of mass poverty. At its worst, it results in concentrations of squalor and disaffection which ferment political fragility. To date, African urbanization has been dysfunctional, the key indication being that cities have not generated enough productive jobs. If urban policies remain unchanged, future urbanization is likely to result in similar outcomes. This paper sets out how changed policies can unlock the potential of urbanization for prosperity. Primarily, it sets out the economic forces underlying this potential, and the specific policy actions they require. But policy actions do not just happen: they are generated by political processes that confer authority and capacity on public institutions. The paper concludes with a discussion of how politically urban policy-making might be improved.","[Collier, Paul] Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Collier, P (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, Oxford, England.",paul.collier@bsg.ox.ac.uk,,,DFID,DFID,"This paper is part of a DFID-funded research project on urbanization in Africa and other developing regions managed by the World Bank under Somik Lall, and conducted by a joint team at Oxford University and the London School of Economics (LSE).

This is particularly relevant in the current research environment. Because the recent financial crisis is considered as a structural break, research on current problems is often conducted using post-crisis data. That is, the available samples cover only a few years of data, often spanning only one business cycle or even less. We provide ample simulation-based evidence that samples of daily or monthly dynamic data covering periods of this magnitude are prone to a fairly substantial bias. Moreover, we are able to show that standard bootstrap-based bias correction techniques still work in those cases.","[El-Shagi, Makram] Henan Univ, Sch Econ, Kaifeng, Henan, Peoples R China; [El-Shagi, Makram] Halle Inst Econ Res, Halle, Germany",Henan University; Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung Halle (IWH),"El-Shagi, M (通讯作者)，Henan Univ, Sch Econ, Kaifeng, Henan, Peoples R China.;El-Shagi, M (通讯作者)，Halle Inst Econ Res, Halle, Germany.",,,,,,,,14,5,5,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

However, according to economic theory, optimal contracts should be highly dependent on individual conditions. We reconcile these observations in the context of a principal-agent model with both moral hazard and adverse selection. Motivating an agent could be increasingly costly to the principal because a more productive agent could also be more able to manipulate the terms of the contract. As a result, the principal may optimally pool some types by offering a contract with constant transfer and bonus. We also explore parameterizations where the optimal contract is fully separating but simple contracts attain a significant portion of the optimal welfare. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We consider a transportation sector originally using a dirty (fossil) fuel and examine the relative effectiveness of alternative policies: efficiency improvements in the dirty fuel technology sector (e.g., CAFE standards) and technology shifts by partial adoption of a new clean technology (e.g., low-carbon fuel standards). The model generates endogenous equilibrium quantities and prices for the dirty and clean fuels. We characterize the magnitude of the rebound effect as a function of demand and supply elasticities and use the equilibrium values to compare policy options. When the supply of the dirty fuel is inelastic, we find that introducing a new technology with non-zero emissions may actually increase the total level of emissions, similar to the leakage effect. A technology shift policy can perform better than an efficiency improvement policy in the dirty fuel sector only when the dirty fuel supply is sufficiently elastic, the emission intensity of the new technology very low, and the technology shift is greater than a threshold value. Using data for gasoline (as a proxy for the dirty technology) and several other cleaner technologies, we show that these conditions are satisfied by a hypothetical zero-emission technology, but not by electric vehicles using the average US generation mix or the current US corn based E85. Our results demonstrate the importance of accounting for the supply side in estimating the magnitude of the rebound effect and its impact on fuel consumption in a large-scale policy implementation.

Subjects are first asked to divide El 0 between two strangers, and then play a 10 dictator game with another stranger. We subtly vary the ethnicity of the receivers by providing subjects with surnames randomly drawn from the electoral register, including treatments that allow us to parse behaviour into either in-group favouritism or out-group negativity, an important behavioural distinction that is typically overlooked in the discrimination literature. Our results suggest that the observed discriminatory attitudes are the result of out-group negativity rather than in-group favouritism. We advance the literature on discrimination through the estimation of a structural model of group-contingent social preferences, which we exploit to perform counterfactual simulations. Our results provide insights into the behaviour of this unique demographic and provide a rationale for why they may support discriminatory policies in their voting behaviour. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We show that an informed sender and a strategic receiver get a higher ex-ante equilibrium payoff when the language is rich. The reverse holds for a naive receiver and an uninformed sender.

We show that mergers between firms producing the same-quality good lead wages to the reservation level, as well as maximize industry profits. However, it turns out that most of the market structure equilibria are shaped by mergers between producers of differentiated and homogeneous goods. This is so because mergers increase the market share of participating firms at the expense of that of the outsiders, leading to a scenario of preemptive mergers, where the main driving force can be to preempt rival mergers.

Our results show that PDLAs reduce innovative activity in the semiconductor industry by 10 percent, or 4089 patents, throughout the 19891999 period. On the contrary, research joint ventures (a different type of R&D cooperation) increase innovative activity. Based on a structural model, we provide evidence that PDLAs increase production costs and semiconductor prices by 1 percent, which results in customers paying an additional $1.1 billion for semiconductors per year. Beyond the common concern that R&D cooperations facilitate coordination activities in product markets via price fixing, our study highlights that PDLAs can be used as an instrument to coordinate R&D activities, which can reduce innovation activity and increase costs and prices.

We leverage a natural experiment at a large self-insured firm that required all of its employees to switch from an insurance plan that provided free health care to a nonlinear, high-deductible plan. The switch caused a spending reduction between 11.8% and 13.8% of total firm-wide health spending. We decompose this spending reduction into the components of (i) consumer price shopping, (ii) quantity reductions, and (iii) quantity substitutions and find that spending reductions are entirely due to outright reductions in quantity. We find no evidence of consumers learning to price shop after two years in high-deductible coverage. Consumers reduce quantities across the spectrum of health care services, including potentially valuable care (e.g., preventive services) and potentially wasteful care (e.g., imaging services). To better understand these changes, we study how consumers respond to the complex structure of the high-deductible contract. Consumers respond heavily to spot prices at the time of care, reducing their spending by 42% when under the deductible, conditional on their true expected end-of-year price and their prior year end-of-year marginal price. There is no evidence of learning to respond to the true shadow price in the second year post-switch.","[Brot-Goldberg, Zarek C.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Brot-Goldberg, ZC (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,,,,,45,181,236,8,87,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

We find that a pure HAR model fits oil volatility remarkably well. When adding ASVI, we discover that this variable has a significant and positive relationship with oil volatility. This relationship remains statistically significant when traditional financial and macroeconomic variables are accounted for; therefore, ASVI is not only a good proxy for traditional macro-finance variables, but also carries additional information. More importantly, out-of-sample predictions show that ASVI has high economic value, allowing traders of volatility-exposed portfolios to significantly increase returns. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

To restore market adequacy, capacity mechanisms (CMs) are widely discussed and implemented in various. types. They are intended to provide sufficient and clearly perceivable long-term price signals for available capacity. As integral part of the market, CMs interact with the other markets. Markets like day-ahead markets are used to trade energy. Imbalance markets or reserve requirements are examples for markets for flexibility. Among others, green certificates are in place to value emission-neutral injection from RES. Resulting altered prices and shifting remuneration have effects on all generation technologies. CMs may affect participating technologies by imposing a capacity demand. A resulting change in the generation mix may also have an impact on non-participating technologies. Two gaps can be identified in the discussion and modeling of CMs in the literature. First, proposed game-theoretic equilibrium models fall short in representing the distinctive features of different types of CMs. Second, most models incorporating CMs found in the literature only focus on the interaction with the energy-based market. Valid assessments of CM need to consider the interaction of remuneration for available capacity and flexibility, and the indirect interaction with the remuneration for emission-neutral RES. Two formulations of a game-theoretic market equilibrium model are proposed which represent specific CMs with its distinctive features, in particular a market-wide centralized capacity market (cCM) and targeted strategic reserves (SRs). Moreover, the equilibrium models explicitly combine the CMs with markets for flexibility and indirect with remuneration for RES. We contribute to the discussion of CMs by quantifying the interactions and shifting shares of remuneration. Based on the interaction between CMs and remuneration for emission-neutral injection, the effect of CMs on non-participating RES is described. We conclude based on the case study results that targeted mechanisms, like SRs, implemented with the single purpose of ensuring availability introduce large inefficiencies in the system by missing on the interaction between availability and flexibility. In contrast, a market-wide cCM provides a beneficial outcome for all technologies. At the same time, it yields a sufficient high reserve margin at lowest cost. It provides clear signals for the different values of energy-output, flexibility, availability and emission-neutral injection. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Using a logistic regression analysis of cross sectional data, the driving forces for adoption decision of biogas technology by rural households in the Tigray region, Ethiopia, were examined. The study found that the factors that significantly affect biogas adoption decision of rural households were for the most part socio-demographic factors and access to basic infrastructures. Besides, some environmental, institutional and economic attributes were significantly associated with diffusion of biogas technology. From among the variables included in the model, age of household head, family size, level of education, cattle size owned, distance to firewood collection site, access to electricity, access to credit and access to all weather roads were found to positively affect biogas adoption decision of households. On the other hand, distance to the nearest market negatively affected the adoption decision of the households. Female headed households tend more to adopt the biogas technology as compared to their male counterparts. As socio-economic attributes of households and environmental factors are mostly varied contextually and spatially, the policy of biogas technology promotion should be tailored based on the principle of fit for the purpose instead of the existing unimodal approach for all settings.

However, the evidence shows that few firms dominate exports in many countries. This paper analyzes the relative contribution of fundamental (country) and granular (individual) comparative advantage to the differences in specialization across countries in a particular activity: chess. Using data on the quality of around 146,000 chess players in 106 countries in 2015, I find that fundamental comparative advantage is the main contributor to the variation in countries' specialization in chess. However, the contribution of granular comparative advantage becomes larger when analyzing specialization in very high-quality chess players. Despite the appearance of chess servers that allow playing online and offer tools to improve chess skills, I do not find convergence in fundamental comparative advantage over the period 2001-2015.","[Minondo, Asier] Univ Deusto, Deusto Business Sch, Camino Mundaiz 50, Donostia San Sebastian 20012, Spain; [Minondo, Asier] Inst Complutense Estudios Int, Madrid, Spain",University of Deusto,"Minondo, A (通讯作者)，Univ Deusto, Deusto Business Sch, Camino Mundaiz 50, Donostia San Sebastian 20012, Spain.",aminondo@deusto.es,"Minondo, Asier/G-1769-2015","Minondo, Asier/0000-0001-8566-1278","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) - FEDER [ECO201568057-R, ECO2016-79650-P]; Basque Government Department of Education, Language policy and Culture [IT885-16]","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) - FEDER; Basque Government Department of Education, Language policy and Culture","Deusto Business School, University of Deusto, Camino de Mundaiz 50, 20012 Donostia - San Sebastian (Spain).

However, it is often observed that households with higher income, wealth, and education levels do not use electricity for all domestic activities such as lighting, heating, and cooking, creating a ladder within a ladder. Using a,comprehensive data set from the Living Standard Measurement Study from four African countries (Ethiopia, Malawi, Tanzania and Uganda), covering >17,000 households, this paper investigates the factors determining a household's adoption of electricity for lighting only and for lighting and cooking. The results of a multinomial logit model and an ordered probit model show that demographic characteristics, a household's wealth and human capital, access to markets and remoteness greatly accelerate a household's use of electricity for light and cooking, which provides evidence of a ladder within a ladder.

The empirical strategy exploits variation in the timing of an individual level survey and the proximity to social protests in 13 African countries. First, we find that trust in political leaders strongly and abruptly decreases after protests. Second, trust in the country monitoring institutions plunges as well. Both effects are much stronger when protests are repressed by the government. As no signs of distrust are recorded even a couple of days before the social conflicts, protests can be interpreted as sudden signals sent on a leaders' actions from which citizens extract information on their country fundamentals.

Although literature shows a positive FDI-migration relationship, I distinguish between short- and long-term effects of immigration, and show a contemporaneous negative relationship between FDI and immigration. The results show that immigration flows discourage FDI inflows (FDI-migration substitution), although larger immigration stocks induce FDI inflows (ethnic network externalities). Therefore, total effects need to be evaluated considering a tradeoff between contemporaneous substitution and the longer-term complementarity from network effects. While inward FDI promotion and immigration enhancement are often suggested as solutions to resolving shortages in domestic savings and labor, our results have implications for addressing the increasingly daunting policy issue of population aging.","[Tomohara, Akinori] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Tomohara, Akinori] RIETI, Tokyo, Japan; [Tomohara, Akinori] Aoyama Gakuin Univ, Tokyo, Japan",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Aoyama Gakuin University,"Tomohara, A (通讯作者)，Aoyama Gakuin Univ, Dept Int Econ, Shibuya Ku, Bldg 8 421,4-4-25 Shibuya, Tokyo 1508366, Japan.",jujodai@yahoo.com,,,Aoyama Gakuin University; [25380320]; [16K03650]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K03650] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Aoyama Gakuin University; ; ; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","I appreciate Jingsi Huang and Jin Ke for their research assistance and acknowledge the financial support from the Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (Nos. 25380320 and 16K03650) and Aoyama Gakuin University.

In the Australian context, mining firms form a large portion of listed companies. These miners tend to have more volatile earnings, operate with less certainty and higher risk in relation to capital investment. We look at a sample of ASX listed miners and non-miners from 2005 to 2013. We note that miners pay their CEOs less (AUD 1 m vs AUD 1.5 m for non-miners) overall. However, we also note that miners tend to use enhanced contingent long-term remuneration arrangements to significantly boost the pay-performance relationship compared to non-miners particularly during the pre-GFC period. Curiously, non-miners tend to have more generous short-term contingent arrangements linking executive pay and performance. The GFC, as an event, has adversely impacted these arrangements, lessening the generosity of pay-performance among miners, while enhancing these arrangements among non-miners. Overall, the results of the study provide support for optimal contracting theory and do not generally support the managerial power approach for both mining and non-mining firms.","[Yarram, Subba Reddy; Rice, John] Univ New England, UNE Business Sch, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia",University of New England,"Yarram, SR (通讯作者)，Univ New England, UNE Business Sch, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia.",syarram@une.edu.au,"Rice, John/AAO-4080-2021; Yarram, Subba/B-6219-2013","Rice, John/0000-0002-3923-4424; Yarram, Subba/0000-0002-9209-3499",,,,,50,3,4,0,17,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

A discretionary policy rule that includes the forecast deviation as an additional argument is estimated empirically for the period 1975-2009, covering the chairmanships of Arthur Burns, George Miller, Paul Volcker, Alan Greenspan, and the beginning of Ben Bernanke's term, by using inflation forecasts obtained from the Federal Open Market Committee's Greenbook and the Survey of Professional Forecasters and real-time estimates of the output gap. The estimated rule appears to provide a consistent description of the Fed's policy during the sample period presenting an alternative perspective regarding the key drivers of the high-inflation phase in the 1970s as well as of the successful Volcker disinflation in the early 1980s and the gradual transition to a regime of lower inflation and high policy credibility that has increasingly characterized monetary policy over the past two decades.

In general, both rules are designed to limit the countermeasures upon a violation; however, the former rule specifies the limits of composition in retaliation, whereas the latter one designates the limits of retaliation magnitude. We show that, albeit seemingly unrelated, the limited cross-retaliation rule complements the limited punishment rule in permitting greater trade liberalization. Specifically, we show how the limited cross-retaliation rule also helps limit the incentives to violate the trade agreement when the limited punishment rule prevails.

Our focus is specifically on conflict over land. Food is produced using inputs of labor and land, and the probability of victory in a conflict depends on relative group sizes. The group sizes are determined by individual migration and Malthusian population dynamics. Both factors result in larger populations at better sites, which deters attack. There are two necessary conditions for warfare: high enough individual mobility costs and large enough shocks to the relative productivities of the sites. Together, these conditions are sufficient. In particular, technological or environmental shocks that alter the productivities of sites can trigger warfare, but only if individual agents do not change sites in response. These results are consistent with evidence from archaeology and anthropology.","[Dow, Gregory K.; Mitchell, Leanna; Reed, Clyde G.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, Burnaby, BC, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Dow, GK (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, Burnaby, BC, Canada.",gdow@sfu.ca; leanna.mitchell@gmail.com; reed@sfu.ca,,"Dow, Gregory/0000-0002-5441-1353",HESP; Department of Economics at SFU; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [435-2016-0200],HESP; Department of Economics at SFU; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"We are grateful for comments from Cliff Bekar, Sam Bowles, David Burley, Timothy Earle, Curt Eaton, Mukesh Eswaran, Brian Ferguson, Lawrence Keeley, Patrick Kirch, Ian Kuijt, James Kai-sing Kung, Patricia Lambert, Gerard Padro i Miquel, Omer Moav, Peter Richerson, Stephen Shennan, Bruce Winterhalder, and two anonymous referees.

Conditioning as well on initial productivity (expected income), we find that the top three quintiles of men and the top two quintiles of women prefer unilateral divorce.","[Fernandez, Raquel] NYU, Dept Econ, 19 W 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Fernandez, Raquel] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Fernandez, Raquel] CEPR, Washington, DC 61942 USA; [Fernandez, Raquel] IZA, Washington, DC USA; [Fernandez, Raquel] ESOP, Washington, DC USA; [Fernandez, Raquel] BREAD, Washington, DC USA; [Wong, Joyce Cheng] Int Monetary Fund, 1900 Penn Ave NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA",New York University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); International Monetary Fund,"Fernández, R (通讯作者)，NYU, Dept Econ, 19 W 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA.;Fernández, R (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Fernández, R (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC 61942 USA.;Fernández, R (通讯作者)，IZA, Washington, DC USA.;Fernández, R (通讯作者)，ESOP, Washington, DC USA.;Fernández, R (通讯作者)，BREAD, Washington, DC USA.",raquel.fernandez@nyu.edu; jwong2@imf.org,,,"NSF; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",Fernandez wishes to thank the NSF for financial support.,,55,11,12,0,5,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7707,1945-7715,,AM ECON J-MACROECON,Am.

We use it to compute the frictional and non frictional unemployment rate for two economies characterized by different labor market institutions, namely the US and the Spanish economy. For the entire period under study, the US frictional unemployment rate is around 36 per cent of total unemployment, whereas for Spain, approximately 20 per cent of all unemployment is due to frictions. This outcome may be explained by the fact that Spain is a country with more labor market rigidities than the US. The empirical results obtained with our method are also consistent with the main result of Michaillat (2012): in both countries, non-frictional unemployment increases in recessions.","[Garcia, Jose Ramon] Univ Valencia, Valencia, Spain; [Sorolla, Valeri] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Sorolla, Valeri] BGSE, Barcelona, Spain",University of Valencia; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Barcelona School of Economics,"Garcia, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Valencia, Spain.",,"Garcia, Jose Ramón/L-5755-2014; Sorolla, Valeri/K-1169-2017","Sorolla, Valeri/0000-0002-2197-5232","Spanish Ministry of Education [ECO2010-21539, Eco2014-53150-R]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2015-67602-P]; Generalitat of Catalonia [2014 SGR 803]",Spanish Ministry of Education(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Generalitat of Catalonia,We are indebted to Jose I.

We present an endogenous growth model that incorporates altruism and son preference within the family as well as gender wage gap and gender wage discrimination in the labour market. We show that with the accumulation of physical capital and human capital, the output share of mental labour increases and the gender wage gap narrows. In the early stages of economic development, gender discrimination is becoming prevalent and the substitution effect of capital accumulation, which raises the cost of child rearing, is dominated by the income effect, so the growth rate of population increases with income. When the degree of gender wage discrimination starts to decline, the increased cost of child rearing induces families to invest more in the human capital of children and the growth rate of the population falls. The quantitative analysis shows that gender wage discrimination is indeed an important contributor to the demographic transition.","[Guo, Kaiming] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Lingnan Coll, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Yu, Jingwen] Beijing Foreign Studies Univ, Int Business Sch, Beijing, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University; Beijing Foreign Studies University,"Guo, KM (通讯作者)，Sun Yat Sen Univ, Lingnan Coll, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",guokaiming1984@gmail.com; yujingwen@bfsu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71503102, 71403028]; Young Faculty Research Fund of Beijing Foreign Studies University [2015JT005]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Young Faculty Research Fund of Beijing Foreign Studies University,We thank Alexandra Roulet and the anonymous referee for their valuable comments.

Secondly, there is no statistical difference between skilled and unskilled immigrants on the influence of the domestic labour market outcomes.

We show that small elections are not generally efficient and that there are equilibria where some voters vote against their private signal even if it provides useful information and abstention is allowed. This is not the case in large elections, where the fraction of voters who vote against their private signal tends to zero. In an experiment, we then study how informativeness of priors and private signals impact efficiency and information aggregation in small elections. We find that there is a substantial amount of voting against the private signal. Moreover, while most experimental elections are efficient, we find that it is not generally the case that better private information leads to better decisions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The data are from a company where agents work in teams and receive a bonus that depends on individual and team performance. Standard agency theory predicts that workers with productivity below the team average prefer a team bonus, while high-productivity agents prefer an individual bonus. Risk aversion may temper the taste for individual pay. This model predicts the observed relationship between productivity and bonus preferences very well. There is, however, one pattern that it cannot explain: many low performersespecially menprefer individual bonuses.","[Torsvik, Gaute] Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Torsvik, G (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway.",,,,,,,,28,1,1,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,JUL,2017,84.0,335,,,,,498,515,,10.1111/ecca.12188,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EW9FM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402822200008,0

However, recent measures show a decline in public- and private-sector investment, growing income inequality, declining trust in institutions, and evidence of secular stagnation. These indicators point to a diagnosis of an excessive focus on short-term results at the expense of long-term value creation. The challenge of short-termism is not isolated, as it pervades the entire investment value chain-from savers (who are increasingly dependent on short-term metrics to assess investments) and institutional investors (who are increasingly moving to passive investments) to boards and executives (who are under pressure from shareholders to deliver consistent quarterly results). Ultimately, all actors in the investment value chain will need to play an active role in restoring our capitalist system to a proper balance between long-term ownership and performance and in repairing the fraying bonds of societal trust.","[Barton, Dominic] McKinsey & Co Inc, New York, NY 10022 USA",McKinsey & Company,"Barton, D (通讯作者)，McKinsey & Co Inc, New York, NY 10022 USA.",dominic_barton@mckinsey.com,,,,,,,45,7,7,1,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

One of the instruments easily accessible to policy-makers is innovation contests; however, there is ambiguous empirical evidence concerning how such contests should be designed. Our experimental study provides evidence by analyzing the effects of two different innovation contests on subjects' innovativeness: a prize for the cumulative innovativeness and a prize for the best innovation. We implement a creative real effort task simulating a sequential innovation process, whereby subjects determine royalty fees for their created products, which also serve as a measure of cooperation. We find that both contest conditions reduce the willingness to cooperate between subjects compared to a benchmark condition without an innovation contest. While both contests have similar effects, the most sophisticated innovation is significantly more valuable when there is a prize for the best innovation. However, the total innovation activity is not influenced by introducing innovation contest schemes. From a policy perspective, the implementation of state-subsidized innovation contests in addition to the existing intellectual property rights system should be questioned. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

To measure women's rights, we consider economic, political and social rights that capture the extent of government's respect for these rights at country level over time. A free press improves government's accountability to the society and leads to better governance. In the context of women's rights, a free press can enhance positive rights by helping women raise voices and gain recognition, and thereby making the government create a more conducive environment for women's empowerment. Further, higher press freedom can reduce the infringement of negative rights by calling for greater public accountability. Yet, a free media, while necessary, may not be sufficient in enhancing such rights, and other institutional factors related to a country's development might be essential to reap the benefit of a free media. Our estimated marginal impacts show that greater access of media (in the form of internet and mobile users) and countries with greater democratic capital enhance the impact of media freedom on women's economic and social rights, with little effect on political rights.","[Cooray, Arusha] Univ Nottingham, Business Sch, Malaysia Campus,Jalan Broga, Semenyih Selangor 43500, Malaysia; [Dutta, Nabamita] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, 1725 State St, La Crosse, WI 54601 USA; [Mallick, Sushanta] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England",University of Nottingham Malaysia; University of Wisconsin System; University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Cooray, A (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Business Sch, Malaysia Campus,Jalan Broga, Semenyih Selangor 43500, Malaysia.",Arusha.Cooray@nottingham.edu.my; ndutta@uwlax.edu; s.k.mallick@qmul.ac.uk,"Dutta, Nabamita/K-3728-2019; Cooray, Arusha/X-1507-2019","Cooray, Arusha/0000-0001-8809-9188; Dutta, Nabamita/0000-0002-0943-5217",,,,,61,14,15,1,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Our optimism rest on how development may be conceptualised. When equated to a narrow measure in economic-wise which fundamentally ignores critical issues, then there is a possibility the outlook could be positive. But when conceptualised using a broad-based approach such as sustainable development, then the outlook could be negative. We assess a panel of 22 economies in Sub-Sahara Africa with the most recent dataset (1996-2013) from the World Bank and other reputable agencies. Our finding is quite robust. It holds in pooled OLS, Fixed effects and GMM within IV settings; and it also holds for different measures of institutions and different measures of development using growth per capita GDP and genuine wealth per capita, respectively. Taking stock of major policy blue-prints of selected countries in the region on the fight against corruption, we are able to point out that institutions play important role in insulating citizens against the devastation caused by corruption. Overall, through this comparison, we are able to signal that both incidental and systematic corruption poses a long-term threat to sustainable development.","[Forson, Joseph Ato; Buracom, Ponlapat] Natl Inst Dev Adm, Grad Sch Publ Adm, Bangkok, Thailand; [Chen, Guojin] Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ WISE, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Baah-Ennumh, Theresa Yaaba] KNUST, Dept Planning, Kumasi, Ghana",National Institute of Development Administration - Thailand; Xiamen University; Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology,"Forson, JA (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Dev Adm, Grad Sch Publ Adm, Bangkok, Thailand.",datoeagle@yahoo.com,"Chen, Guojin/JXL-1905-2024; Baah-Ennumh, Theresa Yaaba/AAP-5606-2020; forson, joseph Ato/W-4747-2017","Chen, Guojin/0000-0001-9457-9583; Baah-Ennumh, Theresa Yaaba/0000-0003-1572-2076; forson, joseph Ato/0000-0002-5997-5713",,,,,56,30,32,1,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

In this setting, growth and inequality arise endogenously allowing us to address new questions regarding their interplay and effect on cooperation. We find that amounts contributed are increasing over time even in the absence of punishment possibilities. Variation in wealth is substantial with the richest groups earning more than ten times what the poorest groups earn. Introducing the possibility of punishment does not increase wealth and in some cases even decreases it. In the presence of a punishment option, inequality in early periods is strongly negatively correlated with group income in later periods, highlighting negative interaction effects between endogenous inequality and punishment.

Kim et al. (2002) put forward a correctly-sized unit root test robust to a single variance break, called the KLN test. However, there can be more than one break in variance in time series data as documented in Zhou and Perron (2008), so allowing only one break can be too restrictive. In this paper, we show that multiple breaks in variance can generate spurious rejections not only by the standard DF test but also by the KLN test. We then propose a bootstrap-based unit root test that is correctly-sized in the presence of multiple breaks in variance. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed test performs well regardless of the number of breaks and the location of the breaks in innovation variance.","[Jeong, Soo-Bin; Kim, Tae-Hwan] Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, 134 Shinchon Dong, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Jeong, Soo-Bin] Korea Maritime Inst, 26 Haeyang Ro,301Beon Gil, Busan 606080, South Korea; [Kim, Bong-Hwan; Moon, Hyung-Ho] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",Yonsei University; Korea Maritime Institute; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Kim, TH (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, 134 Shinchon Dong, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",jsbeen@me.com; inthemood00@gmail.com; tae-hwan.kim@yonsei.ac.kr; hmun.econ@gmail.com,,,National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A5A2A01010546],National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government,We are grateful for the helpful comments from the participants at the seventh Joint Economic Symposium of Five Leading East Asian Universities held at the University of Singapore in January 2013.

In contrast to the conventional reserve requirement system, ABRR impose reserve requirements on financial institutions' asset holdings. The policy can be used for macro prudential purposes to reduce pro-cyclicality of financial institutions. Using a financial friction New Keynesian model based on Meh and Moran (2010), we show that ABRR can be a more effective instrument in the presence of sector-specific shocks than the Basel-III type countercyclical capital buffer. The reason is that the former policy can adjust the asset return of the specific sector hit by the shock, whereas the latter does not have such sector-specific treatment.","[Kang, Tae Soo] Korea Inst Int Econ Policy, Bldg C,Sejong Natl Res Complex,370 Sicheong Daero, Sejong, South Korea; [Suh, Hyunduk] Inha Univ, 100 Inharo, Incheon, South Korea",Korea Institute for International Economic Policy (KIEP); Inha University,"Kang, TS (通讯作者)，Korea Inst Int Econ Policy, Bldg C,Sejong Natl Res Complex,370 Sicheong Daero, Sejong, South Korea.",tskang@kiep.go.kr; hsuh@inha.ac.kr,,"Suh, Hyunduk/0000-0003-1761-6592",,,,,23,0,0,0,1,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

We use a three-person social-preference model in order to derive hypotheses on the effect of knowledge and power on tax choices.

Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity models indicate that the auctions did not reduce the conditional variance of the informal rate returns.

Exploiting geographical distance to the influential mission station as a measure of exposure to the missionary influence, together with an abundance of historical, geographic and climate controls, this study finds that the mission encouraged females to postpone their first marriage, while discouraging their engagement in polygynous relationships. In addition, due to the missionary influence, females were also motivated to convert to Christianity as well as to attain academic skills. These findings suggest that Christian attitudes and values, along with the missionary educational investment, may play a role in explaining the missionary influence onmarital practices.","[Kudo, Yuya] JETRO, Inst Developing Econ, Mihama Ku, 3-2-2 Wakaba, Chiba, Chiba 2618545, Japan",,"Kudo, Y (通讯作者)，JETRO, Inst Developing Econ, Mihama Ku, 3-2-2 Wakaba, Chiba, Chiba 2618545, Japan.",yuya_kudo@ide.go.jp,,,IDE-JETRO,IDE-JETRO,"Financial support from the IDE-JETRO for my field trip to Machinga, Mulanje and Zomba is gratefully acknowledged.

It draws upon a modem database that incorporates both mobile and VoIP calling made over the 2009-2012 period between 25 countries around the world. Among other things, it finds that modern consumers of international calling are most sensitive to mobile and VoIP telephone prices and that the deployment of broadband has replaced the deployment of fixed telephone lines as a key enabling infrastructure for international calling.

The business cycle is the result of two separate forces. On the one hand, there is Harrodian instability. On the other hand, this instability is contained by the inherent contradictions of capitalism. I focus on two of these contradictions: the profit-squeeze that results from the tightening of the labor market as employment and utilization increase, and the financial instability hypothesis as formulated by Hyman Minsky. With the inclusion of overhead labor, the model can explain the U-shaped behavior of the wage share along the business cycle (wage share decreases for low levels of utilization and increases for higher levels) that prevailed in most of the post-WWII period, as well as the decrease in the wage share as utilization increases that has been observed in the most recent cycles.","[Nikiforos, Michalis] Levy Econ Inst, Annandale On Hudson, NY USA",,"Nikiforos, M (通讯作者)，Bard Coll, Levy Econ Inst, Blithewood, Annandale On Hudson, NY 12504 USA.",mnikifor@levy.org,,"Nikiforos, Michalis/0000-0003-1477-7593",,,,,50,12,12,1,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

However, when the state sets a maximum price of a product or service in a potentially competitive market, it may unintentionally undermine competition in the market and may even facilitate tacit price collusion. This paper illustrates such regulatory fallacy in the case of the electronic interbank credit transfer service in Thailand, where the Bank of Thailand sets the maximum rates that a commercial bank may charge its customers. It also provides a follow-up of the central bank's regulatory amendments following the findings of the report.","[Nikomborirak, Deunden] Thailand Dev Res Inst, 565 Ramkamhaeng 39,Ramkamhaeng Rd, Bangkok 10310, Thailand",,"Nikomborirak, D (通讯作者)，Thailand Dev Res Inst, 565 Ramkamhaeng 39,Ramkamhaeng Rd, Bangkok 10310, Thailand.",deunden@tdri.or.th,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,3,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

We show that these contradicting results might be due to the false definition of risk-perception, which we correct by introducing Expected Downside Risk (EDR). The EDR parameter, similar to the Expected Shortfall or Conditional Value-at-Risk, measures the tail risk, however, fits and better explains the utility perception of investors. Our results indicate that when using the EDR as risk measure, both the positive and negative relationship between expected return and risk can be derived under standard conditions (e.g. expected utility theory and positive risk-aversion). Therefore, no alternative psychological explanation or additional boundary condition on utility theory is required to explain the phenomenon. Furthermore, we show empirically that it is a more precise linear predictor of expected return than volatility, both for individual assets and portfolios.","[Ormos, Mihaly; Timotity, Dusan] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Finance, Magyar Tudosok Krt 2, Budapest, Hungary",Budapest University of Technology & Economics,"Ormos, M (通讯作者)，Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Finance, Magyar Tudosok Krt 2, Budapest, Hungary.",ormos@finance.bme.hu; timotity@finance.bme.hu,"Ormos, Mihály/E-1051-2011","Ormos, Mihaly/0000-0002-3224-7636",Bolyai Foundation [BO/00144/15/9],Bolyai Foundation,"Bolyai Foundation, (Grant / Award Number: 'BO/00144/15/9)",,35,1,1,0,15,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

However, when remuneration in the public sector is less sensitive to economic cycles than in the private sector, as is typically the case, economic growth will worsen the position of workers in the public sector relative to workers in the private sector, even though their income improves in absolute terms. As a result, job satisfaction may be countercyclical in the public sector. We test this counterintuitive hypothesis in a real-effort laboratory experiment that simulates an economy with two sectors differing only in their remuneration scheme. Economic cycles are introduced in order to test for their effect on job satisfaction and productivity in each sector. We find that job satisfaction in the public sector is negatively correlated with the state of the economy. This effect, however, does not carry over to productivity: even though an increase in a worker's productivity in the public sector reduces his relative income, in comparison to a similar private sector worker, we find that this does not have a negative effect on job satisfaction.

We address this question in a laboratory experiment, where in democracy citizens can invest in profitable projects and vote on income taxation. In the alternative regime-autocracy-efficient investment levels and equitable redistribution are implemented exogenously, but there is a risk of resources being partially expropriated. Citizens can voluntarily switch from democracy to autocracy by a majority vote, which mimics recent historical examples, where voters voluntarily delegate political powers to an autocrat in exchange for a promise of high taxation and redistribution. We find that the likelihood of democracy breakdown increases with the degree of inequality but does not vary with productivity.

The setting is the standard representative consumer with a quasi-linear utility function. A key finding is that strict concavity of the quadratic utility function is critical for the demand system to be well defined. Otherwise, the true demand function may be quite complex: Multi-valued, non-linear and income-dependent. We uncover failures of duality relationships between substitute products and complementary products, as well as the incompatibility between high levels of complementarity and concavity. The two-good case emerges as a special case with strong but non-robust properties. A key implication is that all conclusions derived in applied economic models via the use of linear demand that does not satisfy the Law of Demand ought to be regarded with some suspicion.

Previous methods are classified into three broad classes: equilibrium-related, training sample-based, and estimation-based. We conduct several simulations comparing the accuracy of the initial estimates provided by these methods and how they affect the accuracy of other estimated model parameters. We find evidence against their joint estimation with standard moment conditions: as the accuracy of estimated initials tends to deteriorate with the sample size, spillover effects also deteriorate the accuracy of the estimates of the model's structural parameters. We show how this problem can be attenuated by penalizing the variance of estimation errors. Even so, the joint estimation of learning initials with other model parameters is still subject to severe distortions in small samples. We find that equilibrium-related and training sample based initials are less prone to these issues. We also demonstrate the empirical relevance of our results by estimating a New Keynesian Phillips curve with learning, where we find that our estimation approach provides robustness to the initialization of learning. That allows us to conclude that under adaptive learning the degree of price stickiness is lower compared to inferences under rational expectations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We propose an original and innovative measure of social closure based on the diversity of surname distribution, which reflects a community's history of migration and inbreeding. We find that, all else equal, communities with a history of social closure have lower crime rates and higher tax evasion rates than more open communities. The effect of social closure is likely to be causal, it is relevant in magnitude, statistically significant, and robust to changes in the set of included controls, in the specific measures of dependent and independent variables, in the specification of the regression equation, and in the possible sample splits. Our findings are consistent with the idea that social closure strengthens social sanctions and social control, thus leading to more cooperative outcomes in local interactions, but it reduces cooperation on a larger scale.

This assumption raises the question of what kindness is. In this paper, we offer a novel definition of kindness based on a notion of blame. This notion states that for player j to judge whether or not player i is kind to him, player j has to put himself in the position of player i, and ask if he would act in a manner that is worse than what he believes player i does. If player j would act in a worse manner than player i, then we say that player j does not blame player i. If, however, player j would be nicer than player i, then we say that player j blames player i.:We believe this notion is a natural, intuitive and empirically functional way to explain the motives of people engaging in reciprocal behavior. After developing the conceptual framework, we test this concept by using data from two laboratory experiments and find significant support for the theory. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

China has been at the receiving end of a large number of such measures. In this paper, we study how China's exports to its major trade partners have been affected when its major trade partners have used these measures either against China or against other countries. We find that Chinese exports to the country that imposed an antidumping duty decreased by approximately 35 percent. At the same time, an antidumping duty used by the importing country that was directed towards other countries but not against China led to an approximate 30-percent increase in China's exports to the policy-imposing country. These results remain robust across various specifications. Our findings have important policy implications. In particular, the magnitude of these effects highlights why it is important to curb the recent widespread use of these barriers.","[Chandra, Piyush] Stonehill Coll, Dept Econ, N Easton, MA 02357 USA",,"Chandra, P (通讯作者)，Stonehill Coll, Dept Econ, N Easton, MA 02357 USA.",pchandra@stonehill.edu,,,World Bank,World Bank(The World Bank India),"The author's acknowledgement: I thank Chad Bown, Michel O'Hara, Dean Scrimgeour and seminar participants at Stonehill College and Texas State University, San Marcos for excellent comments and suggestions.

Such incentives are frequently found in free trade zones, export processing regimes and measures targeted at foreign investors, both in China and other developing countries. In this paper we provide the first quantitative assessment of the effect that using subsidies with ESR has on exports, the intensity of competition and welfare, both in the enacting country and its trading partners, using a two-country model of trade with heterogeneous firms. We find that the subsidy with ESR boosts exports more than an equivalent unconditional subsidy available to all exporters. Crucially, the subsidy with ESR provides greater protection to low-profitability firms, while the unconditional subsidy does the opposite. The combination of export promotion and lower intensity of domestic competition generated by the subsidy with ESR can be described as protectionism through exporting. The imposition of an ESR, however, greatly exacerbates the welfare loss associated with subsidizing exporters.","[Defever, Fabrice] City Univ London, London, England; [Riano, Alejandro] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Defever, Fabrice] CEP, London, England; [Defever, Fabrice; Riano, Alejandro] GEP, London, England; [Riano, Alejandro] CFCM, Nottingham, England; [Defever, Fabrice; Riano, Alejandro] CESifo, Munich, Germany",City University London; University of Nottingham; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Ifo Institut,"Defever, F (通讯作者)，City Univ London, London, England.;Defever, F (通讯作者)，CEP, London, England.;Defever, F (通讯作者)，GEP, London, England.;Defever, F (通讯作者)，CESifo, Munich, Germany.",fabrice.defever@city.ac.uk; alejandro.riano@nottingham.ac.uk,"Defever, Fabrice/AAD-8744-2022","Defever, Fabrice/0000-0001-6462-0522; Riano, Alejandro/0000-0002-8824-4055",ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,75,32,37,1,32,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

When transfers are deterministic, the incentive constraints imply equal treatment independently of the government's taste for redistribution. We study whether random transfers may locally improve upon the egalitarian outcome. A suitable Taylor expansion offers an approximation of the utility function by a quasilinear function. The methodology developed by Myerson to deal with incentive constraints then yields a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a socially useful randomization. When this condition is met a large set of lotteries are locally improving. A special menu made of two lotteries only is of interest: all the agents with low risk aversion receive the same random transfer, financed by a deterministic tax paid by the high risk aversion agents.

A broader tax base enables revenue to be raised at lower tax rates, and so lower deadweight loss.

Results suggest that the markups paid by retail investors to underwriters decrease significantly with the incidence of public corruption. The relationship remains significant even when existing anti-corruption enforcement efforts are taken into consideration. Extant literature shows that the issuers of public debt from relatively more corrupt jurisdictions receive lower prices from underwriting banks in wholesale transactions. We develop and empirically show the mechanism through which this can occur. We offer the first evidence that the public debt market exerts disciplining pressures on the American states with greater levels of public corruption. When purchasing state-issued public debt, retail buyers appear to demand narrower markups by factoring in public corruption. This, we argue, is an important reason why underwriting banks offer lower prices when dealing with less disciplined fiscal sovereigns.","[Moldogaziev, Tima T.] Univ Georgia, Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Dept Publ Adm & Policy, Baldwin Hall 204, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Liu, Cheol] KDI Sch Publ Policy & Management, S445,263 Namsejong Ro, Sejong Si 30149, South Korea; [Luby, Martin J.] Univ Texas Austin, Lyndon B Johnson Sch Publ Affairs, 2300 Red River St,Stop E2700,Sid Richardson Hall, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; KDI School of Public Policy & Management; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Moldogaziev, TT (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Dept Publ Adm & Policy, Baldwin Hall 204, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",timatm@uga.edu; cliu@kdischool.ac.kr; mjluby3@msn.com,"Moldogaziev, Temirlan T/AAF-3499-2020","Moldogaziev, Temirlan/0000-0002-9951-1841",,,,,43,15,15,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,MAY,2017,70.0,2,,,,,306,329,,10.1111/kykl.12139,0.0,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,ER5LO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000398843600006,0

To do so, we formulate a stochastic model that minimizes a weighted average of expected transmission and generation costs and their conditional value at risk (CVaR). We show that the solution of this optimization problem is equivalent to the solution of a perfectly competitive risk averse Stackelberg equilibrium, in which a risk-averse transmission planner maximizes welfare after which risk-averse generators maximize profits. This model is then applied to a 240-bus representation of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council, in which we examine the impact of risk aversion on levels and spatial patterns of generation and transmission investment. Although the impact of risk aversion remains small at an aggregate level, state-level impacts on generation and transmission investment can be significant, which emphasizes the importance of explicit consideration of risk aversion in planning models.

The extended models address the issue under different economic structures or different types of social conflict. In the extended model with the urban unskilled minimum wage, we find that the skilled-unskilled inequality will be widened when the degree of controlling social conflict is increased.

Individual-level data on fast food and soft drink consumption and body mass index (BMI) for young adolescents from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, kindergarten cohort, (1998-1999) and adiposity measures for children from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2003-2004) were combined with designated market area (DMA) Nielsen media advertising ratings data. To account for unobserved individual-level and DMA-level heterogeneity, various fixed-and random-effects models were estimated. The results showed that exposure to soft drink and sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) advertisements is economically and statistically significantly associated with higher frequency of soft drink consumption among youth even after controlling for unobserved heterogeneity, with elasticity estimates ranging from 0.4 to 0.5. The association between fast food advertising exposure and fast food consumption disappeared once we controlled for unobservables. Exposure to cereal advertising was significantly associated with young adolescents' BMI percentile ranking, but exposures to fast food and soft drink advertisements were not. The results on adiposity outcomes revealed that children's exposure to cereal advertising was associated with both percent body fatness and percent trunk fatness; fast food advertising was significantly associated with percent trunk fatness and marginally significantly associated with percent body fatness; and exposure to SSB advertising was marginally significantly associated with percent body and trunk fatness. The study results suggest that continued monitoring of advertising is important and policy debates regarding the regulation of youth-directed marketing are warranted.","[Powell, Lisa M.] Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Wada, Roy] Boston Publ Hlth Commiss, Boston, MA USA; [Khan, Tamkeen] Amer Med Assoc, Chicago, IL 60610 USA; [Emery, Sherry L.] Univ Chicago, NORC, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; American Medical Association; University of Chicago,"Powell, LM (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",powelll@uic.edu,"Khan, Tamkeen/AAP-4930-2020",,National Cancer Institute (NCI) [R01CA138456],National Cancer Institute (NCI)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)),"This paper was supported by funding from National Cancer Institute (NCI) award number R01CA138456.

In this paper we shift the focus to the multiplier at the end, i.e., to the period in which a deficit spending program terminates. We show that recent time-series analyses and neoclassical as well new Keynesian business cycle models predict that the multiplier turns negative before spending expires. This means that aggregate output at the time of expiry of fiscal stimulus is lower than it could be without deficit spending. Here, we show why this phenomenon is a general outcome of mainstream business cycle theory and explain the underlying mechanism. Using phase diagram analysis, we prove that the aggregate capital stock at the time of expiry of fiscal stimulus is lower than it would be without a deficit spending program. This fact explains why aggregate output is below its laissez faire level as well.","[Strulik, Holger] Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany; [Trimborn, Timo] Vienna Univ Technol, Vienna, Austria",University of Gottingen; Technische Universitat Wien,"Trimborn, T (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Stat & Math Methods Econ, Wiedner Haupstr 8-105-3, A-1040 Vienna, Austria.",timo.trimborn@tuwien.ac.at,,"Trimborn, Timo/0000-0001-8749-7176; Strulik, Holger/0000-0002-5615-2412",,,,,32,1,1,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

It argues that growth has to be intended as a measure of the capability of the firm to successfully cope with the problems arising from increasing complexity. According to a Penrosean perspective, such a capability may be bounded at any given time by a lack of those (internal) managerial resources which provide the firm with a set of 'uniquely valuable' services, and which create a differential advantage over its competitors. In a 'dynamic capabilities' view, such advantages need to be continuously modified through a process of search and selection. This has assumed peculiar relevance in the face of the 'hyper-competition' regime characterising the more recent phase of industrial development, asking firms' executives to develop an increasing ability to find creative solutions to continuously moving targets, therefore making the management function a key driver to change.","[Trau, Fabrizio] Confederat Italian Ind Ctr Studi Confind, Econ Res Dept, Rome, Italy",,"Traù, F (通讯作者)，Ctr Studi Confind, Viale Astron 30, I-00144 Rome, Italy.",f.trau@confindustria.it,,,,,,,88,8,9,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The analysis focuses on the class of name-switching reputational equilibria, in which a firm discards its name if and only if its reputation falls below the entrants' reputation. The main technical result is the existence of a unique steady-state equilibrium within this class, in which the entrants' reputation is endogenous.

A shock worsening the liquidity properties of the pseudo-safe assets raises interest rate spreads and can cause a deep recession-cum-deflation. Expanding the central bank's balance sheet fills the shortage of safe assets and counteracts the recession. Lowering the interest rate on reserves insulates market interest rates from the liquidity shock and improves risk sharing between borrowers and savers.,"[Benigno, Pierpaolo] LUISS Guido Carli, Dept Econ & Finance, Viale Romania 32, I-00197 Rome, Italy; [Nistico, Salvatore] Sapienza Univ Roma, Dip Sci Sociali & Econ, Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy",Luiss Guido Carli University; Sapienza University Rome,"Benigno, P (通讯作者)，LUISS Guido Carli, Dept Econ & Finance, Viale Romania 32, I-00197 Rome, Italy.",pbenigno@luiss.it; salvatore.nistico@uniroma1.it,"Nisticò, Salvatore/JBS-4745-2023","Nistico, Salvatore/0000-0001-9054-923X; BENIGNO, PIERPAOLO/0000-0003-3332-7213",ERC [614879]; European Research Council (ERC) [614879] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We are grateful to Fabrice Collard, Luca Dedola, Behzad Diba, Paolo Gelain, Ricardo Lagos, and Tommaso Trani for helpful comments and suggestions and to an anonymous referee, to conference participants at the 18th Australasia Macroeconomics Workshop, the 11th Hydra Workshop on Dynamic Macroeconomics, the XIIIth Macroeconomic Policy Workshop on the Changing Role of Central Bank's Post Crises, the 18th Domestic and International Dimensions of Unconventional Monetary Policy Workshop, the 5th Summer Workshop in International Finance and Macro Finance, and the 2nd Padova Macreconomics Meetings and to seminar participants at the Central Bank of Brazil, CERGE-EI, EIEF, European University Institute, Monash University, National University of Singapore, Norges Bank, Reserve Bank of Australia, Victoria University of Wellington, University of Auckland, and University of Oxford.

However, in addition to efficiency (the optimal use of the public facility), we are also interested in the distribution of the public resources among all agents. Hence, we consider variants of the El Farol Bar problem, to be distinguished from many early studies in which efficiency is the only concern. We ask whether self-coordinating solutions can exist in some variants of the El Farol Bar problem so that public resources can be optimally used with neither idle capacity nor congestion being incurred and, in the meantime, the resources can be well distributed among all agents. We consider this ideal situation an El Farol version of a good society. This paper shows the existence of a positive answer to this inquiry, but the variants involve two elements, which were largely left out in the conventional literature on the El Farol Bar problem. They are social networks and social preferences. We first show, through cellular automata, that social networks can contribute to the emergence of a good society. We then show that the addition of some inequity-averse agents can even guarantee the emergence of the good society.","[Chen, Shu-Heng; Gostoli, Umberto] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Econ, AI ECON Res Ctr, Taipei, Taiwan",National Chengchi University,"Chen, SH (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Econ, AI ECON Res Ctr, Taipei, Taiwan.",chen.shuheng@gmail.com; u.gostoli@gmail.com,,,,,,,54,8,9,1,7,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

A seller who pays the entry cost may submit a bid comprising a location and a minimum price. We characterize the optimal information structure and show that the buyer prefers to attract only two bids. Further, additional sellers are inefficient since they reduce total and consumer surplus, gross of entry costs. We show that the buyer will not find it optimal to send public information to all sellers.

As a result, it is difficult to compare results on the importance of non-cognitive skills across literatures. Drawing from these literatures, this paper systematically relates various prototypical non-cognitive measures within one data set. Specifically, we estimate and compare several different strategies for measuring non-cognitive skills. For each strategy, we compare their relative effectiveness at predicting educational success and decompose what is being measured into underlying personality traits and economic preferences. We demonstrate that the construction of the non-cognitive factor greatly influences what is actually measured, how it relates to more standard taxonomies and what conclusions are reached about the role of non-cognitive skills in life-outcomes such as educational attainment. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, while sometimes difficult to interpret, factors extracted from self reported behaviors can have predictive power similar to well established taxonomies, such as the Big Five.

We define mobility in terms of both choice of institution and location of employment. A clear finding that emerges is that mobility is associated with superior earnings outcomes, principally through students extending their job search horizon. Our analysis examines the entire earnings distribution rather than focussing solely upon the mean, as in common in much of the existing literature. This will provide a much clearer picture as to the true effect of mobility on earnings. We also confirm, via bivariate probit analysis, that there is a positive correlation between individual mobility decisions with regard to the location of university attended and location of employment. There are important policy implications resulting from these findings. If raising student fees or associated living costs reduces mobility, for example through choosing to live at home, this may affect future earnings with consequent impact on loan repayments. Alternatively, any subsidies provided by the Scottish and Welsh governments for local students may not help their own economies given the incentive for students to leave their country of origin post-study to increase their potential earnings.","[Kidd, Michael P.] RMIT Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [O'Leary, Nigel] Swansea Univ, SERC, NILS, WISERD, Swansea SA1 8EN, W Glam, Wales; [Sloane, Peter] Swansea Univ, IZA, NILS, Swansea SA1 8EN, W Glam, Wales",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Swansea University; Swansea University,"O'Leary, N (通讯作者)，Swansea Univ, SERC, NILS, WISERD, Swansea SA1 8EN, W Glam, Wales.",michaetkidd@rmit.edu.au; n.c.oleary@swansea.ac.uk; p.j.sloane@swansea.ac.uk,"Sloane, Peter/AAA-6427-2021; kidd, michael/C-4230-2013","kidd, michael/0000-0001-6906-625X","ESRC [ES/L009099/1, RES-591-28-0001]; ESRC [ES/L009099/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L009099/1] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The DLHE data was made available from the Higher Education Statistics Agency through the Welsh Government, although neither bears responsibility for the analysis or interpretation of the data reported here.

This article is the first to test if these factors similarly affect warm-glow giving alone. There is no reason that one would expect the same outcomes given that the motivations for warm-glow giving are different from the motivations for total (warm-glow plus purely altruistic) giving. We find that warm-glow giving to charity or philanthropic institutions in a real-donation experiment increases when the endowment is earned. The option to take does reduce warm-glow giving to charity, but significant giving remains. Our results suggest that donating earned income creates greater utility than donating an equal amount from a windfall gain, and that warm glow comes not merely from the act of giving, but also from the characteristics of the recipient.

J,"Meyersson, E",,,,"Meyersson, Erik",,,Pious populists at the gate A case study of economic development in Turkey under AKP,ECONOMICS OF TRANSITION,,,English,Article,,,,,,synthetic control method; economic growth; Turkey,,"In this paper, I evaluate the economic track record of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) in Turkey, using the synthetic control method (SCM). This methodology compares the post-AKP development trajectory of Turkey with that of a weighted combination of similar but untreated countries. The SCM is particularly useful in this setting as it allows construction of a synthetic control to Turkey that replicates the pre-AKP development dynamics. I find that Turkey under AKP grew no faster in terms of GDP per capita when compared with a synthetic counterpart from a wide pool of other countries. Restricting the pool of control units to only include Muslim countries shows Turkey growing slower than its Muslim counterparts. Moreover, analysis of post-crisis recovery periods shows Turkey growing no faster than comparable post-crisis cases across time. However, expanding the outcome set to health and education reveals large positive differences in both infant and maternal mortality as well as university enrolment, consistent with stated AKP policies to improve access to health and education sectors for the relatively poorer segments of the population. Nonetheless, increased access in these fields is not matched by improved labour market access, as both labour force participation as well as unemployment have deteriorated, and especially so for women. As for measures of institutions, I fail to find any durable positive differences in measures related to democracy or human rights early on during the post-intervention period, and in several instances there is evidence of significant declines over the long run. A particularly salient feature of the AKP's reign is reduced political power of the military, consistent with the military in Turkey receiving lower economic rents than its synthetic counterpart during AKP's reign.","[Meyersson, Erik] Stockholm Sch Econ, Stockholm Inst Transit Econ SITE, POB 6501, SE-11383 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm School of Economics,"Meyersson, E (通讯作者)，Stockholm Sch Econ, Stockholm Inst Transit Econ SITE, POB 6501, SE-11383 Stockholm, Sweden.",erik.meyersson@hhs.se,,,,,,,37,3,3,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

The composition of the structural shocks during recessions and the periods immediately following recessions has changed, as have the responses of employment and hours to those shocks. Recessions before 1984 were followed by recoveries driven by positive permanent shocks to output, whereas post-1984 recessions were followed by weak recoveries in demand. Employment is more sensitive to demand shocks post-1984, leading to weak recoveries in employment. In addition, hours and employment were complements before 1984, but are treated as substitutes after 1984.

If one treats the farm household as the unit of analysis, it would be difficult to explain the conundrum. When seeing agricultural production from the lens of the division of labor, the puzzle can be easily solved. In response to rising labor costs, farmers outsource some power-intensive stages of production, such as harvesting, to specialized mechanization service providers, which are often clustered in a few counties and travel throughout the country to provide harvesting services at competitive prices. Through such an arrangement, smallholder farmers can stay viable in agricultural production. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Oil-market analysts interpreted this as an attempt to squeeze higher-cost producers, notably US shale oil, out of the market. Over the next year, crude oil prices crashed, with large repercussions for the global economy. We present a simple equilibrium model that explains the fundamental market factors that can rationalize such a regime switch by OPEC: (i) the growth of US shale oil production; (ii) the slowdown of global oil demand; (iii) reduced cohesiveness of the OPEC cartel; and (iv) production ramp-ups in other non-OPEC countries; while (v) reductions in US shale costs act against these factors. We show that these qualitative predictions are broadly consistent with oil market developments during 2014-2015. The model is calibrated to oil market data; it predicts accommodation up to 2014 and a market-share strategy thereafter, and explains large oil-price swings as well as realistically high levels of OPEC output.

Using a data set of workers and PhD students who recently graduated from Dutch universities, we simultaneously estimate two probit equations, one for the migration decision and one for the choice between working and pursuing a PhD. We take into account that both decisions can be affected by the climates in certain fields of study and universities to promote going abroad and starting a PhD. Our findings indicate that highly able graduates are significantly more likely than average graduates to go abroad.

However, large-scale deployment of energy-efficient technologies is constrained by several factors. Employing a survey of 509 industrial and commercial firms throughout Ukraine and a generalized ordered logit model, we quantified the economic, behavioral, and institutional barriers that may impede the deployment of energy-efficient technologies. Our analysis shows that behavioral barriers resulted from lack of information, knowledge, and awareness are major impediments to the adoption of energy-efficient technologies in Ukraine, and that financial barriers may further impede investments in these technologies especially for small firms. This suggests that carefully targeted information provisions and energy audits will enhance Ukrainian firms' investments in energy-efficient technologies to save energy consumption, improve productivity, and reduce carbon emissions from the productive sectors.

A group of citizens observe a signal of their government's performance, which is upwardly inflated by propaganda. Citizens want to support the government if it performs well and if others are supportive (i.e., to coordinate). Some citizens are unaware of the propaganda (credulous). Because of the coordination motive, the non-credulous still respond to propaganda, and when the coordination motive dominates they perfectly mimic the actions of the credulous. So, all can act as if they believe the government's lies even though most do not. The government benefits from this responsiveness to manipulation since it leads to a more compliant citizenry, but uses more propaganda precisely when citizens are less responsive.

The central payoff of a structural econometric model is that it allows an empirical researcher to go beyond the conclusions of a more conventional empirical study that provides reduced-form causal relationships. Structural models identify mechanisms that determine outcomes and are designed to analyze counterfactual policies, quantifying impacts on specific outcomes as well as effects in the short and longer run. We start by defining structural models, distinguishing between those that are fully specified and those that are partially specified. We contrast the treatment effects approach with structural models, and present an example of how a structural model is specified and the particular choices that were made. We cover combining structural estimation with randomized experiments. We then turn to numerical techniques for solving dynamic stochastic models that are often used in structural estimation, again with an example. The penultimate section focuses on issues of estimation using the method of moments.","[Low, Hamish] Univ Cambridge, Econ, Cambridge, England; [Low, Hamish] Cambridge INET, Cambridge, England; [Low, Hamish; Meghir, Costas] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England; [Meghir, Costas] Yale Univ, Econ, New Haven, CT USA; [Meghir, Costas] Inst Labor Econ IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Meghir, Costas] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Cambridge; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Yale University; IZA Institute Labor Economics; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Low, H (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Econ, Cambridge, England.;Low, H (通讯作者)，Cambridge INET, Cambridge, England.;Low, H (通讯作者)，Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England.",hamish.low@econ.cam.ac.uk; c.meghir@yale.edu,"Meghir, Costas/C-3370-2008","Low, Hamish/0000-0002-6064-9448",Cowles Foundation; Institution for Social and Policy Studies (ISPS) at Yale University,Cowles Foundation; Institution for Social and Policy Studies (ISPS) at Yale University,"We thank Tom Crossley, Felix Grey, Gordon Hanson, Enrico Moretti, Ann Norman, and Timothy Taylor for excellent comments and suggestions.

Estimating the call externality,INFORMATION ECONOMICS AND POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Call externality; Mobile industry; Incoming calls; Stated-preference choice experiment,NETWORK EXTERNALITIES; TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION; TELECOMMUNICATIONS; COMPETITION; RECEIVER,"A feature of electronic communication markets is that a consumer's decision to join or use a communications network can generate two effects on other users of the network: a network externality and a call externality. The former effect is defined as the benefit that users receive when a new subscriber joins the network (an expanded customer base can now be reached). The existence and magnitude of this effect is important from both theoretical and policy points of view. As a consequence, its empirical importance in various network markets has been documented in the literature. A call externality is defined as the benefit that a consumer derives when receiving a message (e.g. call) from another user, and it plays a crucial role both in the equilibrium predictions of theories of network competition and in the results of recent empirical work; however, as opposed to the network externality, no attempt has been made to quantify its empirical importance. In this paper I report results of a study designed to elicit and estimate the call externality. The data were generated using a stated-preference choice experiment designed to match theory and several characteristics of the mobile industry in Ecuador. To enhance the external validity of the results, the choice experiment was administered to over 2,500 individuals using 492 different internet-equipped government-run locations throughout the country. I find that call externalities are quite important in this market, but that their intensity depends heavily on the type of call (on-net v. off net) as well as on the type of user (pre-paid v. post-paid). The call externality parameter for on-net calls is estimated at 0.67, while the significance of the call externality for off-net calls is significantly smaller (economically and statistically). Further, I find that the existence of call externalities in the market are mostly driven by pre-paid users. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A number of commentators and researchers have suggested that this slowdown is at least in part illusory because real output data have failed to capture the new and better products of the past decade. I conduct four disparate analyses, each of which offers empirical challenges to this mismeasurement hypothesis. First, the productivity slowdown has occurred in dozens of countries, and its size is unrelated to measures of the countries' consumption or production intensities of information and communication technologies (ICTs, the type of goods most often cited as sources of mismeasurement). Second, estimates from the existing research literature of the surplus created by internet-linked digital technologies fall far short of the $3 trillion or more of missing output resulting from the productivity growth slowdown. Third, if measurement problems were to account for even a modest share of this missing output, the properly measured output and productivity growth rates of industries that produce and service ICTs would have to have been multiples of their measured growth in the data. Fourth, while measured gross domestic income has been on average higher than measured gross domestic product since 2004-perhaps indicating workers are being paid to make products that are given away for free or at highly discounted prices-this trend actually began before the productivity slowdown and moreover reflects unusually high capital income rather than labor income (i.e., profits are unusually high). In combination, these complementary facets of evidence suggest that the reasonable prima facie case for the mismeasurement hypothesis faces real hurdles when confronted with the data.","[Syverson, Chad] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Syverson, Chad] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Syverson, C (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.;Syverson, C (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",chad.syverson@chicagobooth.edu,,,,,,,45,107,125,3,19,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

To conduct our analysis, we modify the forward linkage methodology to take into account the bottleneck effect in the intermediate input of manufacturing production. Our estimates show that the production losses caused by the supply chain disruptions would amount to at least 0.35% of the country's GDP. We also analyzed how establishing multiple supply chains would work to mitigate the damage of potential natural disasters in the future.

The R&D process has a binary structure, with spillover effects. We provide a negative answer to the question in the title: Under noncooperative R&D, firms will conduct R&D for a broad parameter range, despite the presence of the cost paradox, as a result of being caught in a prisoner's dilemma. A second-best social planner is shown to have a higher propensity for R&D than the noncooperative scenario. However, if firms engaged in any of the known R&D cooperation scenarios, the answer to the question in the title would become affirmative. It follows that R&D cooperation leads to lower producer and consumer surpluses. This constitutes a major departure from the conclusions of the standard R&D model. Therefore, R&D cooperation in such environments should not receive favorable antitrust treatment.","[Amir, Rabah] Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Halmenschlager, Christine] Univ Paris II Pantheon Assas, CRED, F-75005 Paris, France; [Knauff, Malgorzata] Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland",University of Iowa; Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas; Warsaw School of Economics,"Amir, R (通讯作者)，Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",rabah-amir@uiowa.edu; Christine.Halmenschlager@u-paris2.fr; mknauff@sgh.waw.pl,"Halmenschlager, Christine/HGC-9421-2022","Halmenschlager, Christine/0000-0001-8738-6820; Knauff, Malgorzata/0000-0002-0749-4870",,,,,24,9,10,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Donations from corporate donors for example account for 25-35% of charitable income for the largest US charities, across charitable sectors. This note presents some tentative first evidence from a natural field experiment to shed light on how different types of potential donors: individuals, corporates and aristocratically titled individuals, respond to the same fundraising drive. Each donor type was randomly assigned to treatments varying in two dimensions: (i) whether information was conveyed about the existence of an anonymous lead donor, and (ii) how individual donations would be matched by the anonymous lead donor. We find that aristocrats are significantly more likely to respond and that corporates give significantly more than individuals. Treatment effects moreover suggest that (proportional) matching is to be avoided for corporate donors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Using a new data set linking every car sold in the United States to the credit supplier involved in each transaction, we find that the collapse of the asset-backed commercial paper market reduced the financing capacity of such nonbank lenders as captive leasing companies in the automobile industry. As a result, car sales in counties that traditionally depended on nonbank lenders declined sharply. Although other lenders increased their supply of credit, the net aggregate effect of illiquidity on car sales is large and negative. We conclude that the decline in auto sales during the financial crisis was caused in part by a credit supply shock driven by the illiquidity of the most important providers of consumer finance in the auto loan market. These results also imply that interventions aimed at arresting illiquidity in short-term credit markets might have helped contain the real effects of the crisis.","[Benmelech, Efraim] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA USA",Northwestern University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Southern California,"Benmelech, E (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,"Meisenzahl, Ralf/R-9713-2019",,National Science Foundation under CAREER award [SES-0847392],National Science Foundation under CAREER award,"We thank Bo Becker, Gadi Barlevi, Gabriel Chodorow-Reich, Dan Covitz, Diana Hancock, Arvind Krishnamurthy, Gregor Matvos, Jonathan Parker, Wayne Passmore, Karen Pence, Phillip Schnabl, Andrei Shleifer (the editor), Jeremy Stein, Philip Strahan, Amir Sufi, three anonymous referees, and seminar participants at the 2015 AEA Meetings, Basel Research Task Force, Berkeley (Haas), CSEF-IGIER Symposium in Economics and Institutions (Capri), Cornell University, Dutch National Bank, Emory University, Entrepreneurship and Finance Conference in memory of Ola Bengtsson (Lund University), Federal Reserve Board, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Federal Reserve Day Ahead Conference, Georgetown University, Georgia State University, Hong Kong University, Indiana University (Kelley School of Business), NBER Summer Institute, NBER Corporate Finance Meeting, NBER Monetary Economics Meeting, Northwestern University (Kellogg), Pennsylvania State University (Smeal), Singapore Management University, Stanford University, Tsinghua University, Tulane University, University of Munich, and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign for very helpful comments.

Where previous field experiments have typically been limited to either rebate subsidies or matching subsidies, we study both types and determine whether donors are aware of any offered subsidy. We provide evidence that this methodological shortcoming (i.e., the loss of control) is not trivial. Our findings suggest the assumption in earlier field studies, that the offered price is equal to the perceived or actual price, is likely incorrect and may result in underestimation of the price elasticities of giving. This set of results has strong implications for the design of effective subsidies in a variety of decision settings. In addition, our results serve to validate the lab studies' finding that matching subsidies are more powerful than rebate subsidies of equivalent cost at increasing total giving to charities.

We construct two indexes, one of ethnic purity and another of ethnic Serb concentration, and apply them to a counterfactual estimate of the outcome of 'peaceful' ethnic cleansing - what could have been achieved by population exchange based on pre-war territorial Serb power without war - in comparison to the actual outcome of the war. We find that the gross benefits of the chosen strategy of secession and war far exceed anything that could be achieved by the peaceful alternative. A conjectural assessment of perceived costs suggests that also net benefits were maximized by the war strategy. The implication for international deterrence policy is that credible judicial prosecution and punishment is the best way to alter the prospective perpetrators' calculus.","[Ferrero, Mario] Univ Piemonte Orientale, Inst Publ Policy & Publ Choice POLIS, Via Cavour 84, I-15100 Alessandria, Italy",University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro,"Ferrero, M (通讯作者)，Univ Piemonte Orientale, Inst Publ Policy & Publ Choice POLIS, Via Cavour 84, I-15100 Alessandria, Italy.",mario.ferrero@sp.unipmn.it,,,,,,,11,1,1,1,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

Data on these evaluations promise to be valuable for analyzing career dynamics and human resources practices. However, existing literature on subjective evaluations is based on data from individual firms. Furthermore, how supervisors evaluate workers and how firms use these evaluations might vary substantially with context, precisely because these evaluations are subjective. Thus, little is known regarding whether findings from single-firm studies generalize to broader settings. We examine personnel data from six large companies and establish how subjective performance ratings correlate with objective career outcomes. We find many similarities across firms in how these ratings correlate with base pay, bonuses, promotions, demotions, separations, quits, and dismissals and cautiously propose these as empirical regularities.

Contributing to the recent debate over the nature of the green premium, we find that eco-investors are creating clientele effects and that they may be subject to a green winner's curse.","[Fuerst, Franz] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge, England; [Gabrieli, Tommaso] UCL, Bartlett Sch Planning, 14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England; [McAllister, Patrick] Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Real Estate & Planning, Reading, Berks, England",University of Cambridge; University of London; University College London; University of Reading,"Gabrieli, T (通讯作者)，UCL, Bartlett Sch Planning, 14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England.",t.gabrieli@ucl.ac.uk,"Fuerst, Franz/C-8827-2009","Fuerst, Franz/0000-0003-2780-938X",,,,,46,14,16,0,25,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

We design a risk-adjusted yield spread and test its predictive content for economic activity on the periphery and the centre of Europe over the 1990-2012 period. This risk-adjusted bond yield spread is defined in a cross-country context and referred to as the GZ-type spread. Increases in the yield on corporate bonds issued in the countries on the periphery relative to the riskless yield (calculated using German zero-coupon term structure data) reflect increases in the risk premium that the financial market imposes on borrowers. The risk premium rises in all countries during European-wide recessions of the recent past, particularly those associated with the Global Financial and the Sovereign Debt Crisis. Our findings indicate further that this GZ-type spread acts as a reliable signal for imminent and near-term economic activity in countries where financial markets were shaken to their foundations during the Crisis period. For Germany, the GZ-spread has predictive content for industrial production but not for the unemployment rate. For GDP its predictive ability is confined to the EMU period.","[Guender, Alfred] Univ Canterbury, Dept Econ & Finance, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand; [Tolan, Bernard] New Zealand Treasury, Wellington, New Zealand",University of Canterbury,"Guender, A (通讯作者)，Univ Canterbury, Dept Econ & Finance, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand.",Alfred.Guender@canterbury.ac.nz,,"Guender, Alfred/0000-0001-6234-5643",,,,,26,1,1,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,FEB,2017,44.0,1,,,,,1,27,,10.1007/s10663-015-9309-z,0.0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EJ2NV,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000393048000001,0

However, such elicitation often suffers from two possible disadvantages. First, beliefs are recovered in the form of a summary statistic, usually the mean, of the underlying latent distribution. Second, recovered beliefs are biased significantly due to risk aversion. We characterize an approach for eliciting the entire subjective belief distribution that is minimally biased due to risk aversion. We offer simulated examples to demonstrate the intuition of our approach. We also provide theory to formally characterize our framework. And we provide experimental evidence which corroborates our theoretical results. We conclude that for empirically plausible levels of risk aversion, one can reliably elicit most important features of the latent subjective belief distribution without undertaking calibration for risk attitudes providing one is willing to assume Subjective Expected Utility.

We show that real house prices stayed constant from the nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century, but rose strongly and with substantial cross-country variation in the second half of the twentieth century. Land prices, not replacement costs, are the key to understanding the trajectory of house prices. Rising land prices explain about 80 percent of the global house price boom that has taken place since World War II.

The use of the latter has been quickly spreading and often criticized in recent times. The results show that the exact definition of the risk-sharing agreement is key in determining its economic effects. In particular, despite the concerns expressed by some authors, the incentive for a firm to invest in R&D may be the same or even greater than under cost-effectiveness thresholds. The greater flexibility on the timing of commercialization allowed by risk-sharing schemes plays a key role, by increasing the value of the option to invest in R&D under uncertainty. Under this scheme, a higher value for the firm is associated with earlier access to innovations for patients. The price for this is less value for money for the insurer at the time of adoption of the innovation.","[Levaggi, Rosella] Univ Brescia, Dip Econ & Management, Brescia, Italy; [Moretto, Michele] Univ Padua, Dip Sci Econ, Padua, Italy; [Moretto, Michele] FEEM, Milan, Italy; [Pertile, Paolo] Univ Verona, Dip Sci Econ, Verona, Italy",University of Brescia; University of Padua; Fondazione Mattei; University of Verona,"Levaggi, R (通讯作者)，Univ Brescia, Dip Econ & Management, Brescia, Italy.",rosella.levaggi@unibs.it; michele.moretto@unipd.it; paolo.pertile@univr.it,"Levaggi, Rosella/Q-6920-2019","Levaggi, Rosella/0000-0002-6018-1283; MORETTO, MICHELE/0000-0002-5892-8165; Pertile, Paolo/0000-0002-6555-5491",,,,,33,8,10,3,28,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

We are interested in the following set of questions: (a) the impact of source and host country terrorism on bilateral M&A flows using various measures of terrorism (i.e. prevalence, frequency and intensity); (b) whether terrorism affects developing countries differently; (c) whether good institutions in developing host countries can offset the negative effects of terrorism; and (d) whether terrorism incidents in a particular economy has negative spillovers to its neighbors. To preview the main conclusions, we find that an augmented gravity model fits the data well. While the occurrence of terrorism in either the host or source does not appear to have any impact on bilateral M&A, the frequency and intensity of terrorist attacks significantly deter M&A flows, especially in the latter. We also find that good institutions negate the impact of terrorist attacks in the developing host country. There is also some evidence that regional spillovers reduce M&As in the host country.","[Ouyang, Alice Y.] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Acad Publ Finance & Publ Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Rajan, Ramkishen S.] ESSEC Sch Business, Asia Pacific Campus,5 Nepal Pk, Singapore 139408, Singapore; [Rajan, Ramkishen S.] Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Singapore, Singapore",Central University of Finance & Economics; ESSEC Business School; National University of Singapore,"Rajan, RS (通讯作者)，ESSEC Sch Business, Asia Pacific Campus,5 Nepal Pk, Singapore 139408, Singapore.;Rajan, RS (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Singapore, Singapore.",Alice.Ouyang@gmail.com; rrajan1@gmu.edu,"Rajan, Ramkishen/J-2344-2017","Rajan, Ramkishen/0000-0002-7718-3867",China National Social Science Fund [16BJY167]; Key Project of China Ministry of Education [14JZD016]; CUFE Youth Innovation Fund,"China National Social Science Fund; Key Project of China Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, China); CUFE Youth Innovation Fund","Valuable research assistance by Sasidaran Gopalan is gratefully acknowledged as are insightful and constructive comments by two anonymous referees of this journal.

We show that hybrid policies that introduce bounds on the price or the quantity of abatement provide a way to hedge against differences in marginal abatement costs across partitions. Price bounds are more efficient than abatement bounds as they also use information on firms' abatement technologies while abatement bounds can only address emission uncertainty. Using a numerical stochastic optimization model with equilibrium constraints for the European carbon market, we find that introducing hybrid policies in EU ETS reduces expected excess abatement costs of achieving targeted emission reductions under EU climate policy by up to 89%. We also find that under partitioned regulation there is a high likelihood for hybrid policies to yield sizeable ex-post cost reductions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In line with recent empirical studies we discover that in the long run, the inflation and its uncertainty negatively impact the stock prices, opposed to the well-known Fisher effect. In addition we show that for several sector stock indexes the negative effect of inflation and its uncertainty vanishes after the crisis outburst. However, in the short run the results provide evidence in favour of a negative impact of uncertainty, while the inflation has no significant influence on stock prices, except for the consumption indexes.

Our approach enables the estimation of the different equations as one system, allowing the coefficients to differ across sectors, and also permits us to take cross-equation correlation of the errors into account. Employing a panel of Swedish manufacturing and service firms observed in three consecutive Community Innovation Surveys in the period 2008-2012, our full-information maximum likelihood estimates show that many key channels of influence among the model's components vary meaningfully in their statistical significance and magnitude across six different sectors based on the OECD classification on technological and knowledge intensity.

As a major user group of financial information, labour unions likely demand financial information of high quality and thus high-quality audits. As a union's request for wage increases is likely strong when a firm is performing well, management facing wage negotiations with the labour union has incentives to manipulate earnings downward and may therefore prefer auditors who allow more discretion. Using union data unique to Korea during 2005-2008, we find that firms with a stronger labour union tend to choose higher-quality auditors (i.e. Big N or industry specialist auditors). We also find that unionization is negatively (positively) associated with positive (negative) abnormal audit fees and audit hours, and the effects are more pronounced when the union is stronger and more active. Given that departures from normal audit fees and audit hours in either direction arguably impair audit quality, this finding is consistent with our prediction of unions' demand for high-quality audits. Overall, our findings suggest that labour unions play an important role in determining audit quality.","[Chung, Ju Ryum; Cho, Eun Jung; Lee, Ho-Young] Yonsei Univ, Sch Business, Seoul, South Korea; [Son, Myungsoo] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Coll Business & Econ, Fullerton, CA 92634 USA; [Chung, Ju Ryum] Univ Seoul, Sch Business, Adm, Seoul, South Korea",Yonsei University; California State University System; California State University Fullerton; University of Seoul,"Lee, HY (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Sch Business, Seoul, South Korea.",hylee@yonsei.ac.kr,"Cho, Eunjung/AAL-6647-2021",,,,,,75,2,2,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The aim is to move beyond skill-biased and task-based views of the impact of technical change on skills and to identify the structural determinants of employment changes. A model is developed explaining changes in jobs as a result of changes in demand - total, domestic and foreign -, wages, the importance of innovation in products and processes and the role of the international fragmentation of production. The empirical analysis is carried out on manufacturing and service industries of major European countries over the 2000-2014 period. Results show that moving from aggregate employment to the dynamics of professional groups major diversities emerge; managers for instance - are the main beneficiaries from product innovations, while clerks, craft and manual workers are negatively affected by the introduction of new processes. Separate estimations are also carried out for high and low tech industries and for Northern and Southern European countries, identifying a variety of ways in which patterns of innovation and structural change affect jobs in specific professional groups.","[Cirillo, Valeria] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, Piazza Martiri Liberta 33, Pisa, Italy",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"Cirillo, V (通讯作者)，Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, Piazza Martiri Liberta 33, Pisa, Italy.",v.cirillo@sssup.it,,"Cirillo, Valeria/0000-0003-4562-2359",,,,,55,16,18,4,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

Due to the presence of the 'Born-Global' phenomenon among exporters, we address the endogeneity introduced by self-selection, combining a generalised Blinder-Oaxaca approach with results from traditional matching techniques. Our results show that very few manufacturing firms export, and that export participation is highly persistent. There is also evidence supporting the LBE hypothesis and the results suggest a significant export premium of between 17 and 21%, controlling for differences in observable characteristics between exporters and non-exporters. Finally, qualitative information on non-exporters seeking new markets suggests that 'lack of knowledge of potential markets' is the most severe constraint to international market entry. We conclude that the Mozambican Export Promotion Institute (IPEX) could play an important role in overcoming this information deficit for potential Mozambican exporters.","[Cruz, Antonio] Univ Eduardo Mondlane, Fac Econ, Ctr Econ & Management Studies, Maputo, Mozambique; [Newman, Carol] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin, Ireland; [Rand, John] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Tarp, Finn] UNU WIDER, Helsinki, Finland; [Tarp, Finn] Univ Copenhagen, Helsinki, Finland",Eduardo Mondlane University; Trinity College Dublin; University of Copenhagen,"Rand, J (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Oster Farimagsgade 5, DK-1353 Copenhagen, Denmark.",john.rand@econ.ku.dk,"Tarp, Finn/T-9651-2017; Newman, Carol/J-6421-2012","Tarp, Finn/0000-0002-6247-4370; Newman, Carol/0000-0002-1785-0891",,,,,44,7,7,1,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

This study explores how firms' decisions of technology adoption and of exports are affected by openness to trade and the stringency of environmental regulations. It shows that: (1) these decisions induced by tightened environmental policies depend upon whether the upgraded technology is labor-biased or emission-biased; (2) the environmental impact of trade cost reductions on the aggregate emissions and price of emissions permits varies with the factor-biased feature; and (3) regardless of the factor-biased feature, the trade cost reduction induces firms to export and to upgrade the factor-biased technology, while it forces the least productive firms to exit the market. Moreover, the model is further calibrated to simulate policy scenarios of bilateral and unilateral variations in trade variable costs and environmental policies. The bilateral reduction of emissions cap may contribute to welfare gains in both home and foreign countries. The unilateral action of tightening environmental policy in the home country may hurt the home country, but makes the foreign country better off.","[Cui, Jingbo] Wuhan Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China",Wuhan University,"Cui, JB (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",jbcui@whu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71603191],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71603191].,,37,15,18,2,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

We study the behavior of an agent who can display both tendencies simultaneously. We introduce a novel notion of preference for hedging that applies to both objective lotteries and uncertain acts. We show that this axiom, together with other standard ones, is equivalent to a representation in which the agent (i) evaluates ambiguity using multiple priors, as in the model of Gilboa and Schmeidler, 1989, and (ii) evaluates objective lotteries by distorting probabilities, as in the rank dependent utility model, but using the worst from a set of distortions. We show that a preference for hedging is not sufficient to guarantee Ellsberg-like behavior if the agent violates expected utility for objective lotteries; we provide a novel axiom that characterizes this case, linking the distortions for objective and subjective bets.","[Dean, Mark; Ortoleva, Pietro] Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Dean, M (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",mark.dean@columbia.edu; pietro.ortoleva@columbia.edu,,,NSF [SES-1156090/1156091],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank Faruk Gul, one anonymous referee, as well as Simone Cerreia-Vioglio, Eddie Dekel, David Dillenberger, Federico Echenique, Drew Fudenberg, Paolo Ghirardato, Anna Gumen, Edi Karni, Peter Klibanoff, Fabio Maccheroni, Massimo Marinacci, Efe Ok, Leonardo Pejsachowicz, Gil Riella, Kota Saito, Todd Sarver, Andrei Savochkin, Kyoungwon Seo, Marciano Siniscalchi, Peter Wakker, and the participants at various seminars and conferences for their useful comments.

Analyzing the Effect of NAFTA on Local Convergence in Mexico,TRIMESTRE ECONOMICO,,,Spanish,Article,,,,,,convergence; clusters; international trade; NAFTA and Mexico,LIBERALIZATION; GROWTH; INCOME,"Background: Regional Economics and Economic Growth focus on the question of whether trade leads to a greater concentration of economic activity. Nevertheless, little empirical work has assessed the impact of trade on regional convergence. Therefore, this paper studies the regional convergence that has occurred in Mexico since NAFTA came into effect. Unlike previous papers, working with municipal-level data allows us to both observe the convergence patterns across space more clearly and to identify the effect of NAFTA. Methods: A conditional beta-convergence model and conditional club beta-convergence model were performed. However, in contrast to previous empirical studies, we use municipal panel data to identify more clearly the relationship between trade and regional convergence, and include the 2009 economic census to observe whether, after fifteen years of NAFTA, the economy has decentralized away from Mexico City to the US border regions. Results: The result shows that after NAFTA came into effect, the convergence in regions near the US border grew faster than it did in those further from it. However, there is a significant reduction in the beta coefficient after NAFTA, indicating a slowdown in the rate of convergence. Furthermore, we find that rather than becoming integrated into world markets, municipalities in the south have instead lagged behind their counterparts since the signing of NAFTA. Conclusions: Even though centrifugal forces are starting to function, there is a significant reduction in the beta coefficient after NAFTA came into effect. This suggests that better policies will be needed in order to control the increase in regional disparities.","[Diaz Dapena, Alberto; Fernandez Vazquez, Esteban; Rubiera Morollon, Fernando] Univ Oviedo, Lab Anal Econ Reg REGIOlab, Oviedo, Spain; [Garduno Rivera, Rafael] CIDE, Sede Reg Ctr, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",University of Oviedo; Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

The recursive mean adjustment (RMA) method proposed by So and Shin (1999) and Shin and So (2001) is employed to correct the downward bias in the panel unit root tests and in the half-life estimates of real interest rate differentials for traded and non-traded goods. The empirical findings differ depending on whether we apply the RMA. More importantly, the empirical results show that as more homogeneous economies become involved in terms of inflation-targeting regime, stronger mean reversion and much a tighter confidence interval are present. Thus, inflation-targeting plays an important role in providing favorable evidence for long-run RIP.","[Ding, Hui; Kim, Jaebeom] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Kim, J (通讯作者)，Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",hui.ding@okstate.edu; jb.kim@okstate.edu,,,,,,,33,6,6,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

The process of financialisation can roughly be described as an increasing importance of the financial sector that had an impact on the distribution between wages and profits, on the one hand, and retained earnings and financial income in the form of dividends and interests, on the other hand. This article seeks to explore the relationship between financialisation and labour's share of income using a time-series cross-sectional dataset of 13 countries over the time period from 1986 until 2007. The results suggest that there is indeed a relationship between increasing dividend and interest payments of nonfinancial corporations and the decline of the share of wages in national income. Other factors that can account for the decline relate to globalisation and a decrease in the bargaining power of labour.","[Dunhaupt, Petra] Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Badensche Str 50-51, D-10825 Berlin, Germany; [Dunhaupt, Petra] Inst Int Polit Econ IPE, Berlin, Germany",Berlin School of Economics & Law,"Dünhaupt, P (通讯作者)，Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Badensche Str 50-51, D-10825 Berlin, Germany.",petra.duenhaupt@hwr-berlin.de,,,,,,,75,63,65,4,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Also, the space for emergent institutions through the intentionality of agents, including their improving collective performance, reducing complexity, and others, is investigated. This article considers complex adaptive systems through games on networks in an evolution-of-cooperation perspective. Moreover, a surge in policy implications of economic complexity has emerged, even if still rather general.

In this article, we study the efficiency aspects of such contracts by incorporating the effect of labor mobility restrictions on knowledge transfer across firms, investment decisions by firms, and investment by workers. Following research that shows state-wise variations in the degree of CNC enforcement, we allow the strength of CNC enforcement to vary as a matter of regulatory policy and derive the optimal strength of enforcement. We also look at how regulations around CNCs should be optimally designed when employers can use collusive agreements, such as no poaching agreements, as an alternative to noncompete clauses. Given recent allegations of employer collusion among large Silicon Valley firms, we argue for a cautious approach in designing policies on CNC enforcement.

The argument in Daron Acemoglu et al. (2011) that differences in long-run economic performance of German states stem from differences in externally imposed French and domestic German institutions needs to be investigated further. A difference-in-difference estimation is used to identify a treatment effect causing growth differences between border and interior departments. The proposed treatment effect is the faster industrialization due to intensified minerals mining and railway construction in northern and northeastern France after 1850. It is shown that border departments experienced higher economic growth primarily after 1850 even though Revolution institutions and reforms were imposed in all of French departments. Therefore, externally imposed French Revolution institutions and reforms shouldn't be counted as primary factors of causing variation in economic development across German polities.","[Guleryuz, Ece H.] Istanbul 29 Mayis Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey",,"Guleryuz, EH (通讯作者)，Istanbul 29 Mayis Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey.",eguleryuz@29mayis.edu.tr,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,3,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2017,64.0,4,,,,,461,475,,10.2298/PAN141224013G,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FJ5KL,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412790300005,0

Design/methodology/approach - The construction of a database has revealed rather disconnected policy arrangements across Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) members in terms of service trade liberalization. Findings - Although the economic benefits arising from harmonized and liberalized policies across APEC members are widely recognized in the business sector, the relevant policy coordination seems to be missing. Research limitations/implications - With this status quo in mind, APEC could work on establishing its own harmonized service trade commitment table centering on simple foreign capital participation criteria. This would surely contribute to forming an APEC-wide GVC surrounding Korea, which actively aims to expand its economic ties in the Asia-Pacific region. Originality/value - The comparison of WTO-based and free trade agreement-based service trade commitments by APEC members (including Korea) and Association of Southeast Asian Nations ten members is an original research area, with many policy implications for Korea in the Asia-Pacific Region.","[Ishido, Hikari] Chiba Daigaku, Chiba, Japan",Chiba University,"Ishido, H (通讯作者)，Chiba Daigaku, Chiba, Japan.",hikariishidojp@yahoo.co.jp,,,KAKENHI [16H06548]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16H06548] Funding Source: KAKEN,"KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work was supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) Grant Number 16H06548.,,3,1,1,1,23,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Novel tests of heteroscedasticity are proposed, which have the form of a permutation Goldfeld-Quandt test and a permutation Breusch-Pagan test. Moreover, the asymptotic behavior of these permutation tests is investigated. Newly formulated theorems study the convergence of the tests to asymptotic tests based on the least weighted squares as well as to the test based on the least squares. A numerical experiment on a real economic data set on gross domestic product is presented, which also shows how to perform a robust prediction model under heteroscedasticity. The results are very different from those obtained with a standard estimation procedure. Various tests yield however rather similar results. Thus, taking the heteroscedasticity into account is very desirable, while the choice of a particular testing or estimation approach is not so crucial.

In this study, we examine the short-run and long-run impact of adopting the (new) public procurement policy on the aid inflows from the bilateral donors: Australia, the United Nations (UN), the European Union (EU), Japan, the Republic of Korea, France, and Germany. The autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) procedure is used to examine co-integration and the subsequent short-run and long-run effects. Additionally, the model incorporates per capita income, financial development, and crisis as a structural dummy; and the presence of threshold effect on aid inflows is examined. The results show that procurement legislation, financial development, per capita income and crisis have a long-run association with aid inflows. The new public procurement legislation has a positive effect on aid inflows from Australia, the EU, Germany, and the total aid. In the short-run, procurement legislation has a positive effect on aid inflows from the Republic of Korea only; and the procurement policy and financial development have a long-run positive effect on aid inflows to Fiji. Overall, improved procurement policies, a well-developed financial sector and a reasonable level of growth is necessary to bolster aid inflows, whereas political uncertainty and global financial crisis has a retarding effect on aid inflows.","[Kumar, Ronald Ravinesh; Patel, Arvind; Singh, Madhukar] Univ South Pacific, Laucala Campus, Suva, Fiji",University of the South Pacific,"Kumar, RR (通讯作者)，Univ South Pacific, Laucala Campus, Suva, Fiji.",kumar_rn@usp.ac.fj; arvind.patel@usp.ac.fj; madhukar.singh@usp.ac.fj,"Kumar, Ronald Ravinesh/H-4968-2015; Kumar, Ronald/AAK-7991-2020","Kumar, Ronald Ravinesh/0000-0001-9658-4896; Singh, Madhukar/0000-0002-8369-863X",,,,,45,2,2,0,4,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Procured from 1997 to 2003, the 47-foot MLB is the standard lifeboat of the USCG and all 117 MLBs remain in service. The aging of the MLB fleet has resulted in higher annual operating costs and lower operational availability, although the nature of this relationship remains unclear. Our estimation strategy utilizes an error components estimator to examine these issues. We employ three variants of the dependent variables (i.e. the standard logarithmic transformation as is most commonly seen in the literature, inverse hyperbolic sine [IHS], and level outcomes). The point estimates from the standard logarithmic model finds operational availability for the MLBs decreases at a rate between 0.83 and 1.8% per year and cost increases at a rate between 0.33 and 7.81% per year. Similar effects are shown with the IHS and level outcome specifications. In terms of nonlinearity effects, we find the most pronounced changes in operational availability and cost occur for MLBs aged 15 years or more (in comparison to younger MLBs).","[Lavin, Christopher W.] US Coast Guard, Off Surface Acquisit, Washington, DC USA; [McNab, Robert M.] Old Dominion Univ, Strome Coll Business, Norfolk, VA USA; [Sullivan, Ryan S.] Naval Postgrad Sch, Def Resources Management Inst, 205 Halligan Hall, Monterey, CA 93943 USA",Old Dominion University; United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; Naval Postgraduate School,"Sullivan, RS (通讯作者)，Naval Postgrad Sch, Def Resources Management Inst, 205 Halligan Hall, Monterey, CA 93943 USA.",rssulliv@nps.edu,"McNab, Robert/K-7212-2019","McNab, Robert/0000-0002-0093-3973",,,,,23,2,3,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

For the evaluation of the theoretical L-moments, the quantile function is usually used. Unfortunately, there does not exist a simple closed formula for the quantile function of finite mixtures. The weighted average of component quantiles is only a suitable approximation to the quantile. In the contribution, two possible methods for evaluation of the quantile function are used in a simulation study (both based on numerical methods).

Indeed, private security generates negative spillovers as criminals substitute non-protected targets for protected targets. Specific deterrence efforts may generate positive spillovers too, however, by raising the expected cost of committing crimes, thereby reducing crime in an area. The hypothesis that private security deters crime at the state level is tested. The demand for private security in an area is expected to be simultaneously dependent on the level of crime; so, an instrumental variables approach is employed in a panel-data fixed-effect model using state-level data from 1998 to 2010. Instruments for the amount of private security are state-wide licensing regulations for firms specializing in providing security, since these regulations should influence entry. Some state-level measures of violent and property crime are shown to be negatively and significantly related to increases in private security, suggesting that private security generates a general deterrence effect.","[Meehan, Brian] Berry Coll, Dept Econ, Mt Berry, GA 30149 USA; [Benson, Bruce L.] Florida State Univ, Dept Econ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Meehan, B (通讯作者)，Berry Coll, Dept Econ, Mt Berry, GA 30149 USA.",bmeehan@berry.edu,,,,,,,49,8,9,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The purpose of this paper is therefore to explore the factors that hinder the publication in such journals of articles on issues of race that require large amounts of tedious work. Among the reasons for this identified by the author's literature review on the topic are, on the one hand, the under-representation of (minority) authors (Knadler, 2009) writing about racial issues, and on the other factors such as the tendency for personal, methodological and prestige biases to cause the overwhelmingly white editors and reviewers to be less enthusiastic about publishing work related to this topic.

The recent literature on the determinants of military expenditures has mainly focused on countries' external security environments and their regime type. Based on existing theoretical work, we argue that, in addition to these factors, arms trade flows may have an important role to play. First, we show that rising imports of major conventional weapons do not necessarily translate into higher defense spending. Rather, this relationship depends on political, economic, and contract conditions that influence different choices of financing imports. Therefore, the effect should be very heterogenous. Second, exports may have both a negative or a positive impact depending on regime type and the perceived impact of exports on national security. We empirically test these expectations for 156 countries from 1949 to 2013 using arms trade and new military expenditure data provided by SIPRI. Employing static and dynamic panel data models, we find that the effect of arms imports on defense budgets does indeed differ between regions and time periods. With respect to exports, there is evidence of a strategic substitution effect between military expenditures and arms exports in democratic countries: increases in arms exports are followed by a reduction in military expenditures. For non-democratic societies on the other hand, arms exports do not tend to be associated with lower military spending.","[Pamp, Oliver; Thurner, Paul W.] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Geschwister Scholl Inst Polit Sci, Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Pamp, O (通讯作者)，Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Geschwister Scholl Inst Polit Sci, Munich, Germany.",oliver.pamp@gsi.uni-muenchen.de,,,,,,,54,22,23,0,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

Price choosing is one of the most important aspects for online businesses. Pricing requires both a scientific approach and intuition that helps to understand how customers perceive a brand and goods. The Internet has changed the ways of consumer price information analysis which previously have had a disseminated character. A user can compile information about a good price of various retailers in just a few clicks. Increased pricing information transparency causes strong competition among retailers and requires real-time monitoring and rapid response. Many online sellers use the competitive strategy of behaviour. They constantly monitor competitors' prices and on the basis of the obtained data set their own prices. The growth of the Internet commerce has prompted the development of applications for algorithmic pricing when sellers set the price using calculation algorithms. In addition, the authors offer general pricing model for the Internet market. The article is conceptual in nature, and will be useful to researchers in the field of online pricing and can be used in further studies.","[Patshin, Maksim] St Petersburg State Univ, 7-9 Univ Skaya Emb, St Petersburg 199034, Russia; [Kulpin, Sergey] Ural Fed Univ, 13b Lenina Str, Ekaterinburg 620014, Russia",Saint Petersburg State University; Ural Federal University,"Patshin, M (通讯作者)，St Petersburg State Univ, 7-9 Univ Skaya Emb, St Petersburg 199034, Russia.",andomiel-x@ya.ru; s.v.kulpin@urfu.ru,"Kulpin, Sergey/R-6859-2016","Kulpin, Sergey/0000-0002-3998-9341",Russian Foundation for Basic Research [16-36-00146],Russian Foundation for Basic Research(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)Spanish Government),"Research has been performed with the support of the Russian Foundation for Basic Research, grant No 16-36-00146 Research of marketing institutes in virtual market space.",,14,0,0,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,1146,1152,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455325300114,0

To investigate this possibility, we use data from Pakistan, a country that experienced an exponential rise in terrorism since 2001.

This correlation is robust to various alternative specifications (including an IV strategy), relevant in magnitude, and more pronounced for individuals who are male, poor, or less exposed to the media.

We find that the NMW increased average labour costs for companies that tend to employ low paid workers, both upon the introduction of the NMW and more recently following the Great Recession when many workers experienced pay freezes or wage cuts, but the NMW continued to rise. We find evidence to suggest that companies responded to these increases in labour costs by raising labour productivity. These labour productivity changes did not appear to come about via a reduction in firms' workforce or via capital-labour substitution. Rather they were associated with increases in total factor productivity, as theories of organisational change, training and efficiency wages would suggest.","[Riley, Rebecca] Natl Inst Econ & Social Res, 2 Dean Trench St,Smith Sq, London SW1P 3HE, England; Ctr Macroecon, London, England",,"Riley, R (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Econ & Social Res, 2 Dean Trench St,Smith Sq, London SW1P 3HE, England.",r.riley@niesr.ac.uk,,,Low Pay Commission [15/2]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K00378X/1]; ESRC [ES/K00378X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K00378X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Low Pay Commission; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The financial support of the Low Pay Commission (grant number 15/2)and the Economic and Social Research Council grant reference ES/K00378X/1 is gratefully acknowledged.

We find that incentives have a small positive effect on comprehension, as measured by the probability of making inconsistent choices and subjects' self-assessment.

However, a rejection by the Sargan-Hansen test is sometimes a serious concern for researchers. We highlight the fact that the Sargan-Hansen test for GMM estimators applied to panel data is a joint test of valid orthogonality conditions and coefficient stability over time. A possible reason for a rejection is therefore that the slope coefficients vary over time. One solution is to estimate an empirical model in which the coefficients are time specific. We apply this solution to the system GMM estimator of simple nondynamic Cobb-Douglas production functions for a selection of Swedish industries and find that relaxing the assumption of constant slope coefficients results in more satisfactory outcomes of the Sargan-Hansen test.","[Sato, Yoshihiro] European Inst Japanese Studies, Stockholm Sch Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Soderbom, Mans] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden",Stockholm School of Economics; University of Gothenburg,"Sato, Y (通讯作者)，European Inst Japanese Studies, Stockholm Sch Econ, Stockholm, Sweden.",yoshihiro.sato@hhs.se,,,Jan Wallanders och Tom Hedelius Stiftelse samt Tore Browaldhs Stiftelse,Jan Wallanders och Tom Hedelius Stiftelse samt Tore Browaldhs Stiftelse,Funding from the Jan Wallanders och Tom Hedelius Stiftelse samt Tore Browaldhs Stiftelse is gratefully acknowledged.,,5,3,4,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Qualitatively based competitive advantage must be continuously supported by investments, therefore it is accompanied by a relatively high investment rate. For Czech and Slovak economies, where the manufacturing industry is of some significance to the export performance, the key prerequisites for long-term competitiveness of firms in the globalised economic environment are R&D expenditures and employment of R&D personnel. The result of the comparison of the changes in investment rate, R&D expenditures and in the number of R&D personnel in the business sector, manufacturing and high-tech industry can be seen as an indicator of future competitiveness. The first aim of this paper is therefore to compare the changes in the indicators of innovative performance in the aforementioned industry sectors. This paper also analyses the status and development in high-tech manufacturing in years 2008 - 2015 and provides spatial and trend comparison (development is compared in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic).

Based on a dynamic model about the impact of the exit costs on FDI inflows and capital formation, we demonstrate that a host country should determine the exit cost considering two counterbalancing factors, that is, facilitating higher FDI inflows and reducing volatility of FDI inflows. When a host country is less vulnerable to volatility with inelastic risk aversion against FDI volatility, it is optimal for the host country with a negative income shock to take a more aggressive approach to induce FDI inflows by lowering exit costs. However, if the host country is more vulnerable to volatility with elastic risk aversion, the host country is advised to take a conservative approach by increasing exit costs to reduce FDI volatility. These findings, supported by the OECD data on 42 countries' exits costs, implicate that developing countries are recommended to lower exit costs to induce higher FDI inflows when they are not highly vulnerable to volatility shocks.","[Shin, Jinho; Kim, Young-Han] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Econ, 53 Myeongnyun Dong 3 Ga, Seoul, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Kim, YH (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Econ, 53 Myeongnyun Dong 3 Ga, Seoul, South Korea.",kimyh@skku.edu,,"Kim, Young-Han/0000-0002-4071-5751; Shin, Jinho/0000-0001-9026-5931",Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2016S1A5A2A01022153],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2016S1A5A2A01022153].,,14,0,0,3,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

Highlighting recent discoveries in evolutionary biology, the article argues that it is no longer tenable to insist that (neo-)Darwinism is the only proper doctrine for understanding biological evolution. Moreover, social evolution is much more than purely (neo-)Darwinian or (neo-)Lamarckian. As such, the debate on whether we deploy only (neo-)Darwinism or (neo-)Lamarckism generalized or not to understand social evolution is a red herring. Instead, social scientists should embrace generalized evolutionism, a more accommodating and versatile doctrine that subsumes (generalized) Darwinism or (generalized) Lamarckism. Empirical inquiries that deploy generalized evolutionism have shed important new light on some critical puzzles in human society: from institutional change to the foundation of economic development before 1500 AD, through the coming of the industrial revolution, to the evolution of the international system. More empirical efforts along this line of theorizing are needed.","[Tang, Shiping] Fudan Univ, SIRPA, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Fudan University,"Tang, SP (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, SIRPA, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,121,6,6,1,65,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Professional success is understood as the optimal combination of personal and professional achievements which correspond to the quality standards. The diagnostic instrumentarium is represented by two groups of techniques. The first group includes such methodologies for assessing personal qualities as Locus of Control offered by Julian B.

Second group includes methods of economic efficiency. The study proves that those managers who possess external locus of control have higher level of professional efficiency.

An interesting piece of empirical support for this argument comes from the strong Monday effect in the RMW factor: 94% (135%) of the reward to RMW factor accrues on Mondays (Monday Tuesdays). That is, the RMW premium is essentially a Monday (or 'early-in-the-week') effect, which may reflect a 'sound mind' processing of information, over a weekend trading break, to recognize 'value'.

Nearly a century after Thorstein Veblen wrote on the subject, one can find many parallel elements to the political landscape of the times. Today, the common man is often expressed by the 99%, and many accept that the dominant vested interest is that of global banks. Unlike in Veblen's times, economists today have many historical experiments in economic management that they can consult. By employing logic, historical experience, and an understanding of our current global finance-led capitalism, we offer a preliminary institutionalist analysis of the mechanisms of current monetary policy that flood Wall Street, while leaving employment, production, and investment Main Street all but forgotten. We then explain how vested interests have abandoned fiscal policy and left a deflationary macroeconomic environment.","[Vidal, Gregorio; Marshall, Wesley C.] Univ Autonoma Metropolitana Iztapalapa, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana - Mexico,"Vidal, G (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Metropolitana Iztapalapa, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",,,,,,,,11,2,2,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Even though these regimes may reduce compliance costs, they increase the complexity of the tax system and can be used by high-income individuals to avoid taxes. This paper uses administrative data from Chile to analyze whether the use of STRs is associated with strategic tax planning at the individual level. A descriptive analysis of the data finds three stylized facts that, taken together, are consistent with strategic behavior: STRs are used frequently, they are used mainly by high-income taxpayers, and high-income taxpayers are more likely to hold a portfolio of businesses filing taxes under STRs. We rationalize these facts with a simple model of small business creation and tax planning and test the model's predictions. We find that following a reform that made a particular STR more restrictive, reported individual incomes from businesses filing under that STR decreased between 10 and 15%, while income reported from alternative sources increased. Overall Taxable Income increased between 4 and 7%. This increase is explained by the more restrictive scenario for avoiding taxes through STRs, consistent with individuals using these regimes for tax planning.","[Agostini, Claudio A.; Repetto, Andrea] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Sch Govt, Santiago, Chile; [Engel, Eduardo] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Repetto, Andrea] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Nucleo Milenio Modelos Crisis NS 13001, Santiago, Chile; [Vergara, Damian] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Universidad Adolfo Ibanez; Universidad de Chile; Universidad Adolfo Ibanez; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Agostini, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Sch Govt, Santiago, Chile.",claudio.agostini@uai.cl,"Repetto, Andrea/AAF-7404-2021; Agostini, Claudio A./HLG-7336-2023","Agostini, Claudio A./0000-0002-3916-1501; Repetto, Andrea/0000-0003-2378-9684",CONICYT [DPI20140108],CONICYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)),"We thank Chile's Ministry of Finance and Chile's tax authority, Servicio de Impuestos Internos (SII), for access to the data used in this paper, and Paula Benavides, Conrado Canales, Pamela Castellon, Boris Gonzalez, Francisco Henriquez, Sandra Luckheide, Eduardo Pantoja and Carlos Recabarren for their help in its analysis.

We explore this question by taking advantage of a rare instance where a single party held a supermajority sufficient to unilaterally amend the constitution and overhaul the electoral system. We embedded a randomized experiment in a panel survey around the 2014 Hungarian elections, providing respondents with different information about recent changes to the Hungarian electoral rules. While respondents were largely pessimistic about the reforms, providing information yielded no significant effects on their views on the elections' legitimacy. But when information was presented alongside partisan cues, respondents became more negative in their views. Subgroup analysis shows that this effect is concentrated entirely among those not supporting the incumbent. Partisan differences in opinion dwarf any treatment effects we were able to induce. We provide evidence that these findings are unlikely the result of a well-informed populace. Rather, we provide the first experimental evidence that partisan-motivated reasoning applies not only to public policy under fixed institutions but also to changes to the institutional rules of a political system. Incumbents can exploit strong partisan attachments to reduce political competition.","[Ahlquist, John S.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Global Policy & Strategy, La Jolla, CA USA; [Ichino, Nahomi] Univ Michigan, Dept Polit Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Wittenberg, Jason] Univ Calif Berkeley, Charles & Louise Travers Dept Polit Sci, Berkeley, CA USA; [Ziblatt, Daniel] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Harvard University,"Ichino, N (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Polit Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",jahlquist@ucsd.edu; nichino@umich.edu; witty@berkeley.edu; dziblatt@gov.harvard.edu,,"Ichino, Nahomi/0000-0001-8057-3244",,,,,72,20,24,1,6,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-5967,1095-7227,,J COMP ECON,J.

Since generalised CUs are indistinguishable from FTAs in practice, our analysis implies that observed trade agreements (TAs) that have the appearance of FTAs may, in fact, be CUs. This possibility offers one potential explanation for the design of the WTO's rules on regional TAs, in particular the WTO's specification of a common external tariff as the defining feature of a CU.

Based on a questionnaire survey of clients of small rural lodgings, this study operationalizes TK within a wither model applying the variables of trust, affective commitment, quality of treatment and service, satisfaction, and loyalty. The data included 598 questionnaires which were processed through recourse to the structural equation models. The results enable the conclusion that the three TK dimensions (cognitive, technical, and social) appropriately measure TK. The variables that demonstrate the capacity for employees to act beyond the scope of that requested of them and pre-emptively understanding situations are the best to explain the cognitive dimension. The variables evidencing employee know-how present the best results for the technical dimension. The variables demonstrating interactions beyond the necessary tasks and client orientation are the ones that better measure the social dimension. The scale deployed in this article, representing a first attempt to render TK operationally from the perspective of customer evaluation, has certain limitations. Some of the questionnaire variables were simply eliminated, and this may reflect how the scale requires refinement to be applicable to broader-reaching evaluation processes. This article presents a first operational application of TK to a business environment and that enables evaluation by third parties as to its relevance and importance in fostering loyalty.","[Barbosa Pereira, Carla Alexandra; Batista Alves, Helena Maria; Matos Ferreira, Joao Jose] Univ Beira Interior, Management & Econ Dept, Estr Sineiro,Ed Ernesto Cruz, P-6200209 Covilha, Portugal; [Barbosa Pereira, Carla Alexandra; Batista Alves, Helena Maria; Matos Ferreira, Joao Jose] NECE, Estr Sineiro,Ed Ernesto Cruz, P-6200209 Covilha, Portugal",Universidade da Beira Interior,"Pereira, CAB (通讯作者)，Univ Beira Interior, Management & Econ Dept, Estr Sineiro,Ed Ernesto Cruz, P-6200209 Covilha, Portugal.;Pereira, CAB (通讯作者)，NECE, Estr Sineiro,Ed Ernesto Cruz, P-6200209 Covilha, Portugal.",cpereira@ubi.pt; halves@ubi.pt; jjmf@ubi.pt,"Ferreira, João J.M./K-7669-2012; ferreira, joao/JJE-8433-2023; Alves, Helena/L-2064-2019; Ferreira, Joao/HNP-5121-2023","Ferreira, João J.M./0000-0002-5928-2474; Alves, Helena/0000-0001-5192-2310;","FCT-Foundation for Science and Technology [UID/GES/04,630/2013]",FCT-Foundation for Science and Technology(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"This work is funded by National Funds through FCT-Foundation for Science and Technology within the project UID/GES/04,630/2013.",,46,2,2,5,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1868-7865,1868-7873,,J KNOWL ECON,J.

Unfortunately, few relatively simple models exist for testing this hypothesis in transportation settings-settings that are inherently multinomial. Our paper fills this gap. In particular, we address the following questions: how can one construct asymmetric, closed-form, finite-parameter models of multinomial choice and how do such models compare against commonly used symmetric models? Methodologically, we introduce (1) a new class of closed-form, finite-parameter, multinomial choice models, (2) a procedure for using these models to extend existing binary choice models to the multinomial setting, and (3) a procedure for creating new binary choice models (both symmetric and asymmetric). Together, our contributions allow us to create new asymmetric, closed-form, finite-parameter multinomial choice models. We demonstrate our methods by developing four new asymmetric, multinomial choice models. Empirically, most of our models strongly dominate the multinomial logit (MNL) model in terms of in-sample and out-of-sample log-likelihoods. Moreover, analyzing two policy applications, we find practical differences between the MNL and our new asymmetric models. Our results suggest that while asymmetric models may not always outperform symmetric ones, asymmetric choice models are worth testing because they might have better statistical performance and entail substantively different policy and financial implications when compared with traditional symmetric models, such as the MNL.","[Brathwaite, Timothy] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 116 McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Walker, Joan L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 111 McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Brathwaite, T (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 116 McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",timothyb0912@berkeley.edu; joanwalker@berkeley.edu,,,UCCONNECT; Caltrans [65A0529 TO 27],UCCONNECT; Caltrans,"We thank James A.

The OECD transfer pricing guidelines support that practice to the detriment of government budgets and public by considering the routine units as the low-risk ones. This paper reviews the relevant literature and shows that the traditional view of risk and profit allocation between strategy and routine units is inconsistent with their relative risks, resp. with relative risks of MNE's subsidiary and independent company. The long-term perspective of MNEs' members' downside risks provides correct information for transfer pricing regulation and fiscal authorities.

The use of social media allows musicians to communicate directly with their current and potential fans, which provides useful information about where concerts will be more successful. In particular, with the use of social media, musicians are likely to reach out relatively unexplored regions in choosing their concert locations. To examine the effect of social media use on the distribution of concert locations, we introduce an empirical methodology, using a zero-inflated generalized linear mixed model with a log link function. The model accounts for potential heterogeneous locational and temporal traits, allowing us to measure the impact of characteristics of the population on location selection. The parameters estimated from this model support an argument that the use of social media encourages musicians to pursue unexplored markets that they may not have considered before the use of social media.

We provide an overview of the contributions in these research streams, discuss the role of public policy, and suggest avenues for future research. Specifically, we call for a deeper understanding of: (1) the functioning and impact of VC firms' modes of internationalization; (2) micro-level processes such as the functioning and decision making of international investment committees, or the development of international human and social capital; (3) the role of country institutions in VC internationalization and its real effects; and (4) the interplay of international VC with alternative financing sources.","[Devigne, David] Vlerick Business Sch, PMV, Ghent, Belgium; [Devigne, David; Vanacker, Tom; Mulier, Klaas] Univ Ghent, Ghent, Belgium; [Manigart, Sophie] Vlerick Business Sch, Ghent, Belgium",Vlerick Business School; Ghent University; Vlerick Business School,"Vanacker, T (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.",TomR.Vanacker@UGent.be,"Vanacker, Tom R/C-9747-2012","Vanacker, Tom/0000-0001-5608-1944; Manigart, Sophie/0000-0002-3406-9386",Belgian Science Policy (BELSPO); Gimv Private Equity Chair; Vlerick Academic Research Fund,Belgian Science Policy (BELSPO)(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office); Gimv Private Equity Chair; Vlerick Academic Research Fund,"We are grateful to three anonymous reviewers, Mirjam Knockaert, Miguel Meuleman, Tereza Tykvova, and Bruno van Pottelsberghe for their helpful feedback.

Using 9 years of a longitudinal data set from a nationally representative survey in Japan from 2005 to 2013, we extract 15,242 respondents aged 50-59 years in the baseline year. We utilize positive self-rated health to present subjective health status and lifestyle diseases to present objective health status. Using dynamic panel data approach to control for endogeneity issue, we find that being married does protect respondents' subjective health, in terms of a higher probability of self-ratings of very good or good health statuses. Nonetheless, we find that marriage deteriorated their objective health in terms of a higher probability of having lifestyle diseases. Regarding the selection effect, better subjective health is found to select middle-aged and elderly Japanese into marriage, but such influence is fairly modest. Although objective health status also selects respondents into marriage, it positively affects women but adversely affects men. The findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between marriage and health, which may have substantial implications for health-related public policies for middle-aged and elderly people in Japan.","[Fu, Rong; Noguchi, Haruko] Waseda Univ, Fac Polit Sci & Econ, Tokyo 1698050, Japan",Waseda University,"Fu, R (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Fac Polit Sci & Econ, Tokyo 1698050, Japan.",natalieful988@aoni.waseda.jp,"Noguchi, Haruko/ABF-3059-2020; FU, Rong/O-7293-2018","Noguchi, Haruko/0000-0002-4437-8238; FU, Rong/0000-0002-2850-1697","Evidence Based Empirical Analysis of Japanese Health Care System under the aegis of the Ministry Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) [H26-Chikyukiboyippan-001]","Evidence Based Empirical Analysis of Japanese Health Care System under the aegis of the Ministry Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW)","This study was financially supported by the Evidence Based Empirical Analysis of Japanese Health Care System (H26-Chikyukiboyippan-001) under the aegis of the Ministry Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) (PI: Prof. Kenji Shibuya at The University of Tokyo).

The necessary changes that would allow for resolving these problems should, first of all, involve a new approach to human resource management and, in particular, the role of leadership in healthcare units. Numerous studies conducted over the years confirm the growing importance of leadership in modern organizations, especially in the healthcare sector. Purpose of the article: The main goal of the project is to identify the relationships between innovative leadership and the organizational efficiency of healthcare units in the context of innovation levels. The article discusses the research hypotheses concerning the existence of a relationship between management innovation and transformational leadership style in healthcare units, the existence of a relationship between transformational leadership style and the efficiency of healthcare units, the existence of a relationship between management innovation and the efficiency of healthcare units. Methods: The survey was conducted in 100 randomly selected healthcare units in Poland. The analysis of interdependencies was performed, among others, with the use of the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, the Kendall rank correlation coefficient, the coefficient of colligation, and a chi-squared test, while the measures were chosen based on their adequacy for correlated variables and their distribution. In order to verify the hypotheses formulated in the study, a number of statistical methods were applied, e.g. descriptive statistics and correlation analysis. Findings & Value added: The key result of the study identifies the role of transformational leader-ship style in the relationship between the level of innovativeness and efficiency in healthcare units. The article also points to practical implications that may contribute to improved management practices in healthcare units.","[Glod, Wojciech] Univ Econ Katowice, Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Glód, W (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Entrepreneurship & Management Innovat, Ul 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland.",NNojciech.glod@ue.katowice.pl,,,,,,,35,8,11,2,32,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

While many aspects of the Chinese economy are expected to change in this situation, an important component of the change is a significant and persistent growth slowdown. Not surprisingly, Australian commentary on China's growth slowdown has focussed on the implications for Australia's growth rate. Evaluations of this effect vary widely but are generally not firmly based on empirical research. This paper helps to fill this gap by analysing the likely effect on Australia's growth rate of a reduction in China's rate of economic growth. The analysis begins with a simple back-of-the-envelope calculation and then moves to regression analysis and the simulation of a vector-autoregressive model. Estimates are remarkably consistent across a range of models and suggest that the effect on Australia of a permanent fall in China's growth rate from 10% per annum to 7% per annum will be to reduce Australia's growth rate by about 0.2 percentage points in the short run and approximately 0.5 percentage points in the long run. While not trivial, given Australia's current growth rate, these estimates are hardly enough to justify prophesies of doom.","[Groenewold, Nicolaas] Univ Western Australia, Nedlands, WA, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Groenewold, N (通讯作者)，UWA Business Sch, Dept Econ, 35 Stirling Hwy, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia.",nic.groenewold@uwa.edu.au,,"Groenewold, Nicolaas/0000-0003-3612-4470",,,,,16,4,4,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

This raises serious concerns regarding the reliability of the resulting WTP estimates. We propose a simple experimental design that not only tests the external validity of SPA bids in this domain, but also suggests a procedure to help enhance the accuracy of WTP estimates for market goods in SPAs. Following the SPA, participants were offered a randomly chosen price at which they could purchase any amount of the good in an onsite real secondary market. A comparison between the SPA bids and behavior in the secondary market was used to uncover inconsistent subjects, who were classified as either overbidders or underbidders. We find robust evidence that the dominance of overbidding in SPAs leads to an upward bias in the WTP estimates. While this can compromise market good valuations by inflating the perceived value of products, our simple design can be used to adjust the bids in a manner that more accurately resembles the individual's true unobservable valuation for the market good.","[Kassas, Bachir] Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Palma, Marco A.; Anderson, David P.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Kassas, B (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",b.kassas@ufl.edu; mapalma@tamu.edu; danderson@tamu.edu,,"Palma, Marco/0000-0002-2080-3308; Kassas, Bachir/0000-0002-3922-471X",,,,,31,3,3,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

Management practices in South Korea had traditionally emphasized the organizational harmony over individual performance, and firm growth over short-term profits. However, as South Korea opened up to foreign firms after the financial crisis, domestic firms started to adopt western or more modern management practices. Using the industry level variation in management practices generated by the average industry management index of five advanced economies (the US, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy), I find that modern management increases the demand for technical skill. Moreover, modem management practices help achieve various organizational changes that utilize information technology. I also find that performance measured as the return on asset increases with modern management practices, and document the complementarity between modem management practices and technical workers in increasing the return on assets. In short, this paper finds that modem management practices may increase the earnings difference between skilled - in particular, technically skilled - and unskilled workers.","[Lee, Yong Suk] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Encina Hall E309,616 Serra St, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Lee, YS (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Encina Hall E309,616 Serra St, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",yongslee@stanford.edu,,,,,,,26,2,2,2,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5371,1879-1034,,LABOUR ECON,Labour Econ.,DEC,2018,55.0,,,,,,328,343,,10.1016/j.labeco.2018.11.001,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,HF8BD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000454465000018,0

I analyze the institutions that drove the incentives for both, and show that they came together to produce the Great Enrichment. These incentives were both material and social: between 1500 and 1700, the search for financial security and reputation cooperated in producing a unique institutional environment in which the elites in Western Europe produced the three legged-stool of European modernity: the Reformation, the Scientific Revolution, and the Enlightenment.

Cigarette taxes decrease smoking among pregnant women and lead to improved birth outcomes, especially among those with a low socioeconomic status. In this paper we investigate whether increasing cigarette taxes also translates into improved educational attainment of offspring from a low socioeconomic background. In order to answer this question, we exploit variation in cigarette taxes across U.S. states over time and analyze tax effects on grade retention and school enrollment among a large sample of adolescents representative of the population. We find that higher cigarette taxes during pregnancy are strongly associated with improved educational outcomes of children from a low socioeconomic background, but seem to have no effect on children from a higher socioeconomic background. Our findings therefore suggest that cigarette taxes can be an effective policy instrument for mitigating the propagation of a low socioeconomic status from one generation to the next.","[Settele, Sonja] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Management & Microecon Grp, Frankfurt, Germany; [van Ewijk, Reyn] Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Chair Stat & Econometr, Mainz, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,"Settele, S (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Management & Microecon Grp, Frankfurt, Germany.",settele@econ.uni-frankfurt.de; vanewijk@uni-mainz.de,,"Van Ewijk, Reyn/0000-0003-1252-8550",,,,,79,3,3,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5371,1879-1034,,LABOUR ECON,Labour Econ.,DEC,2018,55.0,,,,,,130,148,,10.1016/j.labeco.2018.09.003,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,HF8BD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000454465000008,0

We use a firm-level panel dataset extracted from an administrative survey and distinguish between the short-run and long-run determinants of non-regular labor demand. Using the estimated parameters of the labor demand function, we decompose the rate of increase in the macroeconomic non-regular worker ratio into determinant factor contributions. Our major results can be summarized as follows. First, the firm-level determinants of the demand for part-time and dispatched workers significantly differ. Second, our results suggest that the creation of part-time jobs stimulated by the increased female labor supply plays an essential role in non-regular worker growth relative to direct demand-side factors. On the contrary, increases in both the elderly and the female labor supply have reduced demand for dispatched workers. Third, the microeconomic demand conditions for non-regular labor are widely dispersed among firms. Neither the micro demand factors examined in this study nor industrial differences can explain this heterogeneity.","[Teruyama, Hiroshi] Kyoto Univ, Kyoto, Japan; [Goto, Yasuo] Seijo Univ, Tokyo, Japan; [Goto, Yasuo] Res Inst Econ Trade & Ind, Tokyo, Japan; [Lechevalier, Sebastien] Ecole Hautes Etud Sci Sociales, Paris, France",Kyoto University,"Teruyama, H (通讯作者)，Kyoto Univ, Kyoto, Japan.",teruyama@kier.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Goto, Yasuo/P-8728-2019",,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS KAKENHI) [16H03631, 26285068]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS Core-to-Core Program); European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant [645763]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16H03631, 26285068] Funding Source: KAKEN; Marie Curie Actions (MSCA) [645763] Funding Source: Marie Curie Actions (MSCA)","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS KAKENHI)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS Core-to-Core Program)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant(Marie Curie Actions); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Marie Curie Actions (MSCA)(Marie Curie Actions)","H.

The framework introduces three types of endogenous cognitive processes, namely learning, forgetting and unlearning, affected by internal and external dynamics. Such processes determine the reconfiguration of the ID cognitive structure based on the expansion and contraction of local knowledge. We apply the framework to three empirical cases: the Stoke-on-Trent ceramic ID, the Prato textile ID and the Macerata-Fermo footwear IDs. The empirical analysis describes the reconfiguration of the ID cognitive structure in relation to different cross-boundary relations, such as the introduction of a new policy, technological change and internationalisation. The results inform us that the contraction of some productive specialisations through forgetting may not be just the prelude of decline, but rather a condition fostering the exploration of new learning opportunities within paths of manufacturing recovery.","[Vecciolini, Claudia] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Univ House, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Bellandi, Marco; Vecciolini, Claudia] Univ Florence, Dept Econ & Management, Florence, Italy; [Santini, Erica] Fdn Ric & Innovaz, Florence, Italy; [Vecciolini, Claudia] Univ Trento, Doctoral Sch Social Sci, Trento, Italy",University of Birmingham; University of Florence; University of Trento,"Vecciolini, C (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Univ House, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",C.Vecciolini@bham.ac.uk,,"SANTINI, ERICA/0000-0001-5662-0119; BELLANDI, MARCO/0000-0002-9044-5630",European Commission under the Horizon 2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions project 'MAKERS: Smart Manufacturing for EU Growth and Prosperity' [691192],European Commission under the Horizon 2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions project 'MAKERS: Smart Manufacturing for EU Growth and Prosperity',"Department of Economics and Management, University of Florence (MB, CV); Fondazione per la Ricerca e l'Innovazione (ES); Doctoral School of Social Sciences, University of Trento (CV); and Birmingham Business School, University of Birmingham (CV).

We use a quantile-on-quantile regression approach to capture the dependence structure between gold returns and changes in uncertainty under different gold market conditions, while considering the nuances of uncertainty levels. To capture the core uncertainty effects on gold returns, a dynamic factor model is used. This technique allows summarizing the impact of six different indexes (namely economic, macroeconomic, microeconomic, monetary policy, financial and political uncertainties) within one aggregate measure of uncertainty. In doing so, we show that the gold's role as a hedge and safe haven cannot be assumed to hold at all times. This ability seems to be sensitive to the gold's various market states (bearish, normal or bullish) and to whether the uncertainty is low, middle or high. Interestingly, we find a positive and strong relationship between gold returns and the uncertainty composite indicator when the uncertainty attains its highest level and under normal gold market scenario. This suggests that holding a diversified portfolio composed of gold could help protecting against exposure to uncertain risks.","[Bouoiyour, Jamal; Selmi, Refk] Univ Pau, CATT, Pau, France; [Wohar, Mark E.] Univ Nebraska, Coll Business Adm, 6708 Pine St, Omaha, NE 68182 USA; [Wohar, Mark E.] Loughborough Univ Technol, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",Universite de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour; University of Nebraska System; Loughborough University,"Wohar, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Coll Business Adm, 6708 Pine St, Omaha, NE 68182 USA.",jamal.bouoiyour@univ-pau.fr; refk.selmi@univ-pau.fr; mwohar@unomaha.edu,,"Jamal, Bouoiyour/0000-0003-1920-1155",,,,,41,73,77,4,26,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

This interaction, termed a diabolic loop, is driven by government choice to bail out banks and the resulting incentives for banks to hold government debt instead of self-insure through equity buffers. We highlight the role of bank equity issuance in determining whether the diabolic loop is a Nash equilibrium of the interaction between banks and the government. When equity is issued, no diabolic loop exists. In equilibrium, banks' rational expectations of a bailout ensure that no equity is issued and the sovereign-bank loop is operative.","Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Nikolov, Kalin] European Cent Bank, Sonnemannstr 20, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; European Central Bank,"Nikolov, K (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Sonnemannstr 20, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany.",Kalin.Nikolov@ecb.int,,,,,,,31,34,37,3,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-6598,1468-2354,,INT ECON REV,Int.

Based on data gathered from seven inflation targeting emerging economies (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Poland, South Africa, and Turkey), this paper analyzes how much the credibility associated with the inflation target contributes to anchoring expectations. The findings denote that although credibility is relevant to reduce inflation expectations, these countries present low monetary credibility and thus the backward-looking behavior is predominant for the formation of inflation expectations. Therefore, in order to improve the expectations channel of monetary policy in emerging economies, a policy of increasing transparency regarding inflation expectations is mandatory to the central banks' task of anchoring inflation expectations.

It provides a new representation of the value function for these class of models. It compare a multistage conditional choice probability (CCP) estimator based on the new value function representation with a modified version of the full solution maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) in a Monte Carlo study. The modified CCP estimator performs comparably to the MLE in a finite sample but greatly reduces the computational cost. Using the proposed estimator, we estimate a dynastic model and use the estimated model to conduct counterfactual simulations to investigate the role Nature versus Nurture in intergenerational mobility. We find that Nature accounts for 20 percent of the observed intergenerational immobility at the bottom of income distribution. That means that 80 percent of mobility at the bottom of the income distribution is explained by economic decision and economic/institutional constraints.","[Gayle, George-Levi; Golan, Limor] Washington Univ, Dept Econ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Gayle, George-Levi; Golan, Limor] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA; [Soytas, Mehmet A.] Ozyegin Univ, Grad Sch Business, Istanbul, Turkey",Washington University (WUSTL); Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; Ozyegin University,"Gayle, GL (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, Dept Econ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.;Gayle, GL (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA.",ggayle@wustl.edu; lgolan@wustl.edu; mehmet.soytas@ozyegin.edu.tr,"Soytas, Mehmet Ali/L-7687-2019","Soytas, Mehmet Ali/0000-0001-5839-6069",,,,,55,4,4,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

The North firm serves the South market through either exports or foreign direct investment (FDI). The extent of effective cost difference between North and South depends on South's imitation, which in turn depends on South's IPR protection and absorptive capacity and North firm's location choice, all of which are endogenously determined in our model. For a given level of IPR protection, South's absorptive capacity under exports may be greater than under FDI. Even though innovation is exogenous to the model (and hence unaffected by South's IPR policy), strengthening IPR protection in South can improve its welfare. The relationship between trade costs and the degree of IPR protection that maximizes South welfare is non-monotone. In particular, South has an incentive to protect IPR only when trade costs are moderate. When masking technology or licensing is incorporated into the model, however, some protection of IPR may be optimal for South even if the trade costs are not moderate.","[Ghosh, Arghya] Univ New South Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Ishikawa, Jota] Hitotsubashi Univ, Fac Econ, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868601, Japan; [Ishikawa, Jota] RIETI, Tokyo, Japan",University of New South Wales Sydney; Hitotsubashi University,"Ishikawa, J (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Fac Econ, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868601, Japan.",jota@econ.hit-u.ac.jp,,"Ghosh, Arghya/0000-0002-6655-5434",Australian Research Council; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [26220503]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26220503] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We are grateful to Bob Staiger, Wolfgang Keller, Steve Yeaple, seminar participants at various universities and conferences including Asia Pacific Trade Seminars (APTS), Australasian Trade Workshop, European Trade Study Group (ETSG) Meetings, Midwest Trade Meetings, Hitotsubash Conference on International Trade and FDI, the Japanese Association for Applied Economics, and the Conference of the European Association for Research in Industrial Economics for valuable comments.

In order to do that, we build an estimated DSGE model that includes an explicit interbank market. Our results show that an increase of interbank default risk can generate a money market freeze. The subsequent flight-to-quality diverts funds from the risky interbank to the safer government bonds market causing a reduction of the credit supply. In this scenario, the standard monetary policy is ineffective due to the decoupling of policy and credit interest rates. A supplementary monetary stimulus is able to reduce default risk and thus shifting financial intermediaries preferences towards interbank lending. Finally, the monetary authority is able to avoid the accumulation of safe assets, partially alleviating the liquidity shortage and, to a lesser extent, dampen the drop in the real activity.","[Giri, Federico] Univ Politecn Marche, Piazzale Martelli 8, I-60121 Ancona, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University,"Giri, F (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Piazzale Martelli 8, I-60121 Ancona, Italy.",f.giri@staff.univpm.it,"Giri, Federico/AAE-8978-2020","GIRI, FEDERICO/0000-0002-2893-3262",European Union [612955],European Union(European Union (EU)),"The authors would like to thank all the participants to the CIDE WEEE 2013 in Perugia, IFABS conference 2014 in Lisbon, the ISCEF conference 2014 in Paris and the Money, Banking and Finance workshop 2015 hosted in Pavia for useful suggestions and the participants to the seminar at the National Bank of Poland in May 2016.

A novel aspect of our approach is that we set up and estimate a structural model that takes account of the break in the conduct of monetary policy that occurred when Spain joined the euro, including anticipation effects. On average, Spanish economic growth would have been around 0.8 percentage points higher and consumption growth 0.5 percentage points higher between 2008 and 2013 if Spain had retained an independent monetary policy. But because euro entry led to a large boom prior to the crisis, the level of economic activity would have been similar by late 2016, regardless of Spain's monetary arrangements.

The existing empirical literature has focused on testing the hypothesis that several macroeconomic and health financing determinants have an effect on OOP healthcare expenditures. Nevertheless, the related articles have not well tested the hypothesis concerning the potential impact of PHI financing on OOP spending. We find that public and PHI financing have a significant countervailing effect on OOP spending. Moreover, we show that unemployment rate has a significant positive impact on OOP expenditures. Sensitivity tests with variation of specifications and samples show that our findings are robust. We argue that policy-makers should give serious consideration to PHI institution; our results indicate that there is an inverse effect on OOP spending. We suggest that our examined countries have to provide financial risk protection to their citizens against OOP payments, rather than only attending health budgetary retrenchments in order to adjust public finances.

Empirical estimates indicate that a majority of parents in Africa, Asia, and the Americas consider the sex of children when making childbearing decisions. Many parents prefer sons and many prefer daughters. Comparisons with reported preferences suggest that survey respondents tend to underreport the degree to which they prefer sons or daughters.

Unlike most previous studies, this study proposes three types of educational mismatch status: (1) vertically mismatched only; (2) horizontally mismatched only; and (3) both vertically and horizontally mismatched. The findings show that the share of educationally mismatched workers is non-negligible in the Korean labour market (approximately 30 per cent). However, the data also points to an improvement in job matching over time. Regardless of the type of educational mismatch, the results provide evidence consistent with many previous studies: educational mismatch is significantly and positively associated with job turnover. In particular, vertically and horizontally mismatched workers are more likely to switch jobs than their vertically or horizontally mismatched counterparts. These findings indicate that educationally mismatched graduates are more likely to change jobs-suggesting that educational mismatch can be viewed as an investment in human capital at the beginning of a career.","[Park, Kihong] Korea Army Acad Yeong Cheon KAAY, Econ, Yeongcheon, South Africa; [Park, Kihong] Korea Army Acad Yeong Cheon KAAY, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Yeongcheon, South Africa",,"Park, K (通讯作者)，Korea Army Acad Yeong Cheon KAAY, Econ, Yeongcheon, South Africa.;Park, K (通讯作者)，Korea Army Acad Yeong Cheon KAAY, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Yeongcheon, South Africa.",kma3316@gmail.com,,"PARK, Kihong/0000-0002-6684-8755",,,,,45,5,5,1,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

First, I develop a theoretical framework where an individual's identity is strengthened by the status of their group. Then, utilizing data from the US General Social Survey, I find evidence that the average incomes of one's ethnic and religious groups are negatively correlated with one's preferences for redistribution. Controlling for household income and a number of other individual-level characteristics and additional controls, I find that a standard deviation increase in the average income of one's social groups correlates to a weakening of an individual's preferences for redistribution by 7% to 8%. This result is robust to the inclusion of rich controls and alternate measures of group status as well as a number of robustness checks, such as sample restrictions and the use of additional data.","[Quattrociocchi, Jeff] York Univ, Dept Econ, N York, ON, Canada",York University - Canada,"Quattrociocchi, J (通讯作者)，York Univ, Dept Econ, N York, ON, Canada.",jeffqfac@yorku.ca,,,,,,,25,3,3,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

Using a laboratory experiment, participants jointly produce a surplus using a real effort task with the entire surplus given to the person who put in higher effort. Participants then bargain over the surplus in a series of ultimatum games. Treatments varied whether the proposer or responder received the surplus prior to bargaining and the threat point of the responder. The results suggest that proposers respect prior ownership when the responder has a strong ability to punish, but not when punishment is weak. Responders respect prior ownership when their ability to punish is weak, but reject at high rates when they have strong punishment. An independent measure of individual sensitivity to rule following can explain some of the results, adding support to the theory that individual behavior in bargaining is driven in part by adherence to social norms.

Our empirical strategy exploits FCC regulations that result in plausibly exogenous variation in the number of impressions across the borders of neighboring counties. Applying this approach to detailed data on television advertisement broadcasts and viewership patterns during the 2004-12 presidential campaigns, our results indicate that total political advertising has almost no impact on aggregate turnout. By contrast, we find a positive and economically meaningful effect of advertising on candidates' vote shares. Taken at face value, our estimates imply that a one standard deviation increase in the partisan difference in advertising raises the partisan difference in vote shares by about 0.5 percentage points. Evidence from a regression discontinuity design suggests that advertising affects election results by altering the partisan composition of the electorate.","[Spenkuch, Jorg L.; Toniatti, David] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Anal Grp, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Spenkuch, JL (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Anal Grp, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,"Spenkuch, Jörg/L-3116-2013","Spenkuch, Jörg/0000-0003-1489-7288",,,,,88,62,74,4,50,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

This paper explores whether Bernanke's findings can be applied to the recovery from the East Asian financial crisis of 1997-98. We show that non-monetary financial factors played an important role in how quickly East Asian nations recovered in the years following 1998. Unlike the US experience during the Great Depression, East Asian nations generally implemented positive non-monetary financial reforms that helped speed recovery. We find that factors correlated with a healthy banking system had a significant, positive effect upon economic growth from 1999 to 2006 and that bank system health was particularly important in those East Asian countries that had traditionally weaker banking systems. Our findings suggest that the reform of financial institutions-such as strengthening financial sector supervision and implementing prudent regulations-should be given more attention when policies are devised to help economies recover from financial crises.","[Xue, Wenjun] Shanghai Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Taylor, Jason E.] Cent Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA",Shanghai University; Central Michigan University,"Xue, WJ (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",wxue005@fiu.edu,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

It is well known in the literature that in order for the RBC model to replicate quantitatively plausible empirical moments of small open economies, the model needs to feature counterfactually a small income effect on labor supply. This paper considers home production that introduces substitutability between market consumption and home consumption, which in turn generates a high volatility in market consumption in accordance with the data, even in the presence of a sizable income effect on labor supply. Furthermore, the model with estimated parameter values based on the simulated method of moments is able to match other empirical moments, such as the standard deviations of output, investment and the trade balance and the correlations between output and other macroeconomic variables. Given that home production is more prevalent in emerging markets than in developed economies, the model is able to replicate empirical differences between emerging markets and developed economies in the volatility of market consumption and the volatility/countercyclicality of the trade balance.

Market transparency is defined as the proportion of consumers that are fully informed about the market and thus not captive to one firm. We consider two main cases of strategic interaction, prices as strategic complements and as strategic substitutes. For the former class of games, conventional wisdom concerning prices is confirmed, in that they decrease with market transparency. Consumer welfare always increases with higher transparency but changes in firms' profits are ambiguous. For the latter class of games, an increase in market transparency may lead to an increase in one of the prices, which implies ambiguous effects on both consumer welfare and firms' profits.

Absent panel data, we construct synthetic panels using repeated cross sections of household expenditure surveys and subjective wellbeing surveys conducted during the 2000s and early 2010s. Objective welfare dynamics indicate mixed trends. About half of the poor in the 2000s moved out of poverty by the end of the decade, but chronic poverty remained high; upward mobility was strong in Syria and Tunisia, but downward mobility was pronounced in Yemen and Egypt. The analysis with subjective wellbeing data suggests negative developments in most countries during the Arab Spring transitions and provides evidence on the eroding middle-class consensus in Arab countries before and after the Arab Spring. Low education achievement, informal worker status, and rural residency are positively associated with lower chances for upward mobility and greater chances for downward mobility for both types of welfare measures.","[Dang, Hai-Anh H.] World Bank, Dev Data Grp, Survey Unit, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Dang, Hai-Anh H.] Vietnam Acad Social Sci, Ctr Anal & Forecast, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Ianchovichina, Elena] World Bank, Chief Economists Off Latin Amer & Caribbean Reg, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank; The World Bank,"Dang, HAH (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Data Grp, Survey Unit, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.;Dang, HAH (通讯作者)，Vietnam Acad Social Sci, Ctr Anal & Forecast, Hanoi, Vietnam.",hdang@worldbank.org; eianchovichina@worldbank.org,"Dang, Hai-Anh/AAW-5169-2021; Ianchovichina, Elena Ivanova/AAK-5943-2021","Dang, Hai-Anh/0000-0003-4913-5291",UK Department of International Development,UK Department of International Development,"We would like to thank the editor Stephan Klasen, two anonymous reviewers, Ragui Assaad, Martijn Burger, Sami Bibi, Hadi Salehi Esfahani, Francisco Ferreira, Ravi Kanbur, Peter Lanjouw, Norman Loayza, and participants at a workshop for the MENA Inequality Report (Washington, DC), the IARIW-CAPMAS conference (Cairo, Egypt), DECRG Hub seminar (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia), and the NEUDC conference (MIT) for helpful discussions on earlier versions.

In recent years, bailout, whereby a governmental entity takes charge of the reorganization, has appeared as an alternative. At the enterprise level, there is a Coase-like invariance proposition at work in which a failing concern is replaced by a going concern under either process. Significant differences arise once we move beyond the point of reorganization. The choice between bankruptcy and bailout is fundamentally a choice between alternative arrangements for corporate governance, and not about transforming failing concerns into going concerns because this will happen under either arrangement. We argue that political entanglement in corporate restructuring will tend to preclude the entrepreneurial discovery process. We recount the recent American auto and financial industry bailouts, highlighting how each episode was guided by political considerations, which served to distract the restructuring process from discovering those opportunities that market-based restructuring would have discovered.","[Dellisanti, Dylan; Wagner, Richard E.] George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,"Dellisanti, D (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",Dellisantid14@gmail.com; rwagner@gmu.edu,,,,,,,31,2,2,1,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

This paper evaluates the differentials in household expenditures across rural/urban areas, female/male-headed households, non-educated/educated-headed households and non-employed/employed-headed households, in ten Household Income and Expenditure surveys from four Arab countries: Egypt (2008, 2010 and 2012), Jordan (2006 and 2010), Palestine (2007, 2010 and 2011) and Tunisia (2005 and 2010). Unconditional quantile regressions are used to analyze the differentials across the population distribution and to decompose them by source. Results show that Egypt and Tunisia exhibit relatively high expenditure gaps across rural/urban and non-educated/educated groups. Expenditure gaps in Jordan and Palestine and those across non-employed/employed and female/male headed households are more moderate. Overall, education and the return to it, geographic location and household composition play an important role in bringing about, as well as reducing, economic inequality across social groups.","[Ramadan, Racha] Cairo Univ, Fac Econ & Polit Sci, Cairo, Egypt; [Hlasny, Vladimir] Ewha Womans Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Intini, Vito] United Nations Dept Econ & Social Affairs, New York, NY 10017 USA",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University; Ewha Womans University,"Ramadan, R (通讯作者)，Cairo Univ, Fac Econ & Polit Sci, Econ Dept, Cairo, Egypt.",racha.ramadan@feps.edu.eg,"Hlasny, Vladimir/AAI-9716-2020","Hlasny, Vladimir/0000-0002-6029-1634; Ramadan, Racha/0000-0003-3456-9345",,,,,73,3,3,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

At one extreme, it has been proven that risk preference can be entirely irrelevant (Sandroni in Econometrica 68:1303-1341, 2000; Blume and Easley in Econometrica 74(4):929-966, 2006). However, the agent-based computational approach indicates that risk preference matters and can be more relevant for survivability than forecasting accuracy (Chen and Huang in Advances in natural computation, Springer, Berlin, 2005; J Econ Behav Organ 67(3):702-717, 2008; Huang in J Econ Interact Coord, 2015). Chen and Huang (Inf Sci 177(5):1222-1229, 2007, 2008) further explained that it is the saving behavior of traders that determines their survivability. However, institutional investors do not have to consider saving decisions that are the most influential investors in modern financial markets. Additionally, traders in the above series of theoretical and simulation studies have learned to forecast the stochastic process that determines which asset will pay dividends, not the market prices and dividends. To relate the research on survivability to issues with respect to the efficient markets hypothesis, it is better to endow agents with the ability to forecast market prices and dividends. With the Santa Fe Artificial Stock Market, where traders do not have to consider saving decisions and can learn to forecast both asset prices and dividends, we revisit the issue of survivability and market efficiency. We find that the main finding of Chen and Huang 2008 that risk preference is much more relevant for survivability than forecasting accuracy still holds for a wide range of market conditions but can fail when the baseline dividend becomes very small. Moreover, the advantage of traders who are less averse to risk is revealed in the market where saving decisions are not taken into account. Finally, Huang's (2015) argument regarding the degree of market inefficiency is confirmed.","[Tsao, Chueh-Yung] Chang Gung Univ, Dept Ind & Business Management, 259,Wenhua 1st Rd, Taoyuan 33302, Taiwan; [Huang, Ya-Chi] Lunghwa Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Int Business, 300,Sec 1,Wanshou Rd, Taoyuan 33306, Taiwan",Chang Gung University,"Huang, YC (通讯作者)，Lunghwa Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Int Business, 300,Sec 1,Wanshou Rd, Taoyuan 33306, Taiwan.",cytsao@mail.cgu.edu.tw; estherhyc12@yahoo.com.tw,,,Ministry of Science and Technology [NSC. 99-2410-H-262-002],Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government),The authors are grateful to the respected editors and two anonymous referees for very helpful comments and suggestions.

In the face of various uncertain economic factors, economic fluctuation is an important criterion for evaluating different environmental policies. Thus, we established an environmental dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model under New Keynesian framework embodying nominal price rigidities, environmental policies, pollutant emissions and real uncertainties with the aim of comparing the impacts of different environmental policies on the macroeconomic fluctuations. The results are as follows. First, the responses indicate that all kinds of environmental policies are counter-cyclical. Emissions intensity policy has the strongest effect on curbing fluctuations. Second, a positive energy efficiency shock will lead to a corresponding increase in energy inputs, which is referred to as the energy rebound effect, as well as a rise in pollutant emissions. Third, an emissions intensity shock will exert greater impacts than environmental tax rate shock and emissions cap shock. Fourth, the lower is the price dispersion the less intermediate goods are needed, and, consequently, the lower are the pollutant emissions. Taken together, the results highlight the policy implications associated with choosing an environmental policy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, individuals have to vote over a redistributive policy and the author shows that, despite the desirability of the full redistributive outcomes, under some economic conditions the medium class is able to match with the high class in exchange of a minimum level of redistribution of wealth which keeps the low class far from economic and social opportunities.","[Ferrari, Luca] Univ Corsica, Corte, France",,"Ferrari, L (通讯作者)，Univ Corsica, Corte, France.",luca.ferrari.sdc@gmail.com,,,,,,,19,1,1,1,4,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,SEP 12,2018,12.0,,,,,,,,201857.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2018-57,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GW4YT,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000446933900001,0

This is disaggregated into urban and rural population groups, as well as by dimension and administrative region. At the province level, the study finds a positive relation between poverty incidence and intensity, but the highest intensity levels are experienced in areas where incidence is not that high relative to other areas. Provinces with high incomes generally have low poverty indices and the relationship appears to be nonlinear. An examination of household poverty using mixed logit analysis shows that poverty risk rises with household size. A substantial reduction of the risk is observed for households with heads who were able to matriculate high school. The household head's health status has a negative impact on the household's risk of being poor. These are contrasted with the results using the income poverty definition. Policy implications are drawn from the calculations and the econometric results.","[Bautista, Carlos C.] Univ Phiiippines, Virata Sch Business, Quezon City 1101, Philippines",,"Bautista, CC (通讯作者)，Univ Phiiippines, Virata Sch Business, Quezon City 1101, Philippines.",bautista@up.edu.ph,,"Bautista, Carlos/0000-0003-2291-3954",,,,,22,5,5,0,14,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

We define expectations as anchored when movements in short-run expectations do not trigger movements in expectations at longer horizons. Using time-varying parameter regressions, we provide evidence that anchoring has varied noticeably across economies and over time. In particular, we find that after the financial crisis expectations have been firmly anchored at the target in the United States and, to a lesser extent, in the United Kingdom. In the euro area, expectations have been de-anchored shortly after the crisis and again starting from 2014. In Japan de-anchoring is more pervasive all over the sample period.","[Buono, Ines; Formai, Sara] Bank Italy, Directorate Gen Econ Stat & Res, Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Buono, I (通讯作者)，Bank Italy, Directorate Gen Econ Stat & Res, Rome, Italy.",ines.buono@bancaditalia.it; sara.formai@bancaditalia.it,,,,,,,25,13,13,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0164-0704,1873-152X,,J MACROECON,J.

I find that over time a growing share of total investment consists of intangible assets, rather than investment in tangible assets, like machinery and buildings. Across countries, the level of economic development of a country is positively associated with its investment intensity in intangibles. By including intangible capital as an additional production factor, this paper finds that we can account for substantially more of the variation in cross-country income levels. Depending on the assumptions regarding the output elasticities of factor inputs, the observed differences in intangible capital can account for up to 16 percentage points of the cross-country income variation.","[Chen, Wen] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Chen, W (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Groningen Growth & Dev Ctr, Fac Econ & Business, Nettelbosje 2, NL-9747 AE Groningen, Netherlands.",wen.chen@rug.nl,,,,,,,48,10,10,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Bilingualism among the native born is defined as speaking a language at home other than or in addition to English. Native born bilingualism is rare; only 6.5% report a non-English language, and of those 71% report Spanish. Most of the native-born bilinguals report speaking English very well (85%), with most of the others speaking it well (10%). Other variables the same, overall bilinguals earn 4.7% less than monolingual English speakers, but the earnings differential varies sharply by the language spoken. Those who speak Native American languages, Pennsylvania Dutch and Yiddish have very low earnings due to a tendency to live in geographic or cultural enclaves. Spanish speakers earn 20% less than the monolingual English speakers overall, and other variables the same, have statistically significant 7% lower earnings. On the other hand, those who speak certain Western European and East Asian languages and Hebrew earn significantly more than monolingual English speakers.","[Chiswick, Barry R.] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Chiswick, Barry R.] IZA Inst Labor Econ, Bonn, Germany; [Miller, Paul W.] Curtin Univ, Perth, WA, Australia",George Washington University; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Curtin University,"Chiswick, BR (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA.;Chiswick, BR (通讯作者)，IZA Inst Labor Econ, Bonn, Germany.",brchis@gwu.edu,,,Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"The research assistance of Marina Gindelsky, Derby Voon, and RaeAnn Robinson is appreciated.

We show that real-time estimates of potential output for the United States and other countries respond gradually and similarly to both transitory and permanent shocks to output. Observing revisions in measures of potential output therefore tells us little about whether changes in actual output will be permanent.

Contestants differ in ability and agents with relatively low ability belong to a disadvantaged minority. All contestants compete for the main prize, but only disadvantaged agents can win the extra prize. We show that an extra prize is a powerful tool to ensure participation of disadvantaged agents. Moreover, for intermediate levels of the disadvantage of the minority, introducing an extra prize increases total equilibrium effort compared to a standard contest. Thus, even a contest designer not interested in affirmative action might establish an extra prize in order to enhance competition. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

First, the analysis of some passages that have been overlooked up to the present, in which the author explicitly expresses his disbelief in the omnipotence of the economic method, makes it possible to argue that Robbins did not share the confidence exhibited by the advocates of economics imperialism in the capacity of economics to explain non-economic phenomena. Second, this article shows that Robbins describes the influence of real scarcity on human behaviour in terms of a (static) constrained maximization problem, thereby confusing issues of method and scope in his writings. This confusion facilitated the view that economics is a method without a proper subject matter and its later expansion into other fields. In conclusion, although Robbins cannot be counted as an earlier promoter of economics imperialism, the misunderstandings implicit in his writings paved the way for the emergence of this intellectual movement.","[Falgueras-Sorauren, Ignacio] Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Dept Teoria & Hist Econ, El Ejido S-N, Malaga 29013, Spain; [Falgueras-Sorauren, Ignacio] Univ Navarra, IIESFV, Res Grp Filosofia & Econ, Pamplona, Spain",University of Navarra,"Falgueras-Sorauren, I (通讯作者)，Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Dept Teoria & Hist Econ, El Ejido S-N, Malaga 29013, Spain.;Falgueras-Sorauren, I (通讯作者)，Univ Navarra, IIESFV, Res Grp Filosofia & Econ, Pamplona, Spain.",ifs@uma.es,"Falgueras-Sorauren, Ignacio/ISB-4538-2023","Falgueras Sorauren, Ignacio/0000-0003-0367-1523","Junta de Andalucia [SEJ-122]; Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia [ECO2011-29355, ECO2014-53767P]",Junta de Andalucia(Junta de Andalucia); Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia(Spanish Government),"Financial support from the following institutions is acknowledged: the Junta de Andalucia, SEJ-122, the Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia ECO2011-29355 and ECO2014-53767P.

The study uses this variation in a difference-in-differences strategy to identify and estimate the causal effect of the differential increase in fees. Results based on survey data suggest that students compensate for the increase in fees with a reduction in consumption spending.

In this regard, we, first, estimate a dynamic factor model with time-varying loadings and stochastic volatility (DFM-TV-SV). Then, in the second step, we use a quantile-on-quantile (QQ) predictive regression model to capture the effect of EPU on the common factor and stochastic volatility derived from the DFM-TV-SV for the states and MSAs. Our results show that EPU has a significant negative effect on the common economic activity of both the states and MASs, and it also significantly increases the common volatility. However, the impact of uncertainty varies substantially depending on the initial states (quantiles) of both common output or volatility and EPU.

It seeks, in short, to make evolutionary economics yet more intellectually competitive. A self-contained account is given of a new model of the psychology of economic behaviour developed at the University of Queensland as part of the legacy of the Brisbane Club of evolutionary economists. Two results derived within this model are presented - the Schumpeter and Made to Stick theorems - and are used to elaborate the centrality of knowledge and its growth to the behaviour which drives evolutionary processes in the economy. A core contribution of this paper is to identify the way in which knowledge thus evolves. These are then used to elaborate explanations of evolutionary economic behaviour on both sides of the production-consumption dichotomy, in particular the manner in which the growth of knowledge may be facilitated by interpersonal interaction and particular conditions in the mind, or personality types. We discuss some relevant policy aspects of the model before concluding. The intention of this paper is to provide a basis for future research aiming to build a more coherent, more comprehensive and more simple view of the behaviour driving evolutionary dynamics.","[Markey-Towler, Brendan] Univ Queensland Brisbane, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland,"Markey-Towler, B (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland Brisbane, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",brendan.markeytowler@uqconnect.edu.au,,,,,,,136,5,6,1,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

The aspects taken into consideration are economic, spatial, environmental and cultural ones. Quality of life is therefore determined by various conditions in Which a human lives and the source of which is the hierarchy of needs and a value system. At the same time, quality of lite can be viewed in tarns of collectivity (objective aspect) and an individual's evaluation (subjective aspect). The former view shapes the existing living conditions and the latter results from the satisfaction from a specific person's life, experiences and ambitions. The multidimensionality of the quality of life categories translates into difficulties in defining and measuring it, and constitutes an interesting research object. Purpose of the article: The purpose of the article is to diagnose and evaluate the variety of the quality of life in Polish voivodeships, in objective terms by building a synthetic measure allowing for estimating inequalities in the quality of life of regional communities. It was assumed that quality of life will be characterised by indicators grouped into the following areas: material living conditions, economic activity, health, education and living environment quality. Methods: The main method used for measuring quality of life is the linear ordering based on Z. Hellnig's taxonomic measure which allows for organising voivodeships in terms of the quality of life of communities. Additionally, the cluster analysis (Ward's agglomerative grouping method) was used. which allowed for distinguishing voivodeships similar in terms or the analysed phenomenon. Findings & Value added: During the realisation of the research goal, special attention was paid to the complexity of the wraith of hie issue and its measurement in terms of economy and rather important V arieties in voivodeships were emphasized. the conducted analysis allowed for distinguishing groups of regions with the highest, high, low and the lowest quality of life.","[Nowak, Paulina] Kielce Univ Technol, Al Tysiaclecia PP 7, PL-25214 Kielce, Poland",Kielce University of Technology,"Nowak, P (通讯作者)，Kielce Univ Technol, Al Tysiaclecia PP 7, PL-25214 Kielce, Poland.",pnowak@tu.kielce.pl,,"Nowak, Paulina/0000-0002-0461-8559",,,,,35,33,33,1,4,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

A critique from an evolutionary perspective,JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Market failure; System failure; Economic policy; Policy advice; Evolutionary economics; Non-equilibrium economics,INNOVATION POLICY; MODEL-PLATONISM; THINKING; WELFARE; 2ND,"This paper reconsiders the explanation of economic policy from an evolutionary economics perspective. It contrasts the neoclassical equilibrium notions of market and government failure with the dominant evolutionary neo-Schumpeterian and Austrian-Hayekian perceptions. Based on this comparison, the paper criticizes the fact that neoclassical reasoning still prevails in non-equilibrium evolutionary economics when economic policy issues are examined. This is more than surprising, since proponents of evolutionary economics usually view their approach as incompatible with its neoclassical counterpart. In addition, it is shown that this fallacy of failure thinking even finds its continuation in the alternative concept of system failure with which some evolutionary economists try to explain and legitimate policy interventions in local, regional or national innovation systems. The paper argues that in order to prevent the otherwise fruitful and more realistic evolutionary approach from undermining its own criticism of neoclassical economics and to create a consistent as well as objective evolutionary policy framework, it is necessary to eliminate the equilibrium spirit.

More specifically, I consider how subsidies affect functioning of input and output markets, and the selection of business strategies within them. The main hypothesis is that subsidies affect these markets differently, and that allows rent-seeking that hinders the overall productivity of the sector. I apply a replicator dynamics model for the task. I test my hypothesis with the EU's 2003 CAP reform. The data is comprehensive microdata of Finnish grain and oilseed farms for years the 2004-2013. In order to examine distributional level shifts, I use quantile regression techniques. I find that the policy incentives have directed sectoral change more strongly than market incentives and have thus significantly affected production decisions. The subsidies have also attenuated the market signals and therefore increased sectoral inefficiency. The reform that aimed to improve market orientation has had little effect. The reform has affected structural change in input and output markets differently. While land use adjustment has become more rigid for all the farms, especially the more market oriented ones have been able to exploit increased output market flexibility. However, the negative effects are more prominent in total and the net effect of the reform was negative.","[Simola, Antti] VATT Inst Econ Res, POB 1279, Helsinki 00101, Finland",VATT Institute for Economic Research,"Simola, A (通讯作者)，VATT Inst Econ Res, POB 1279, Helsinki 00101, Finland.",antti.simola@vatt.fi,"Simola, Antti/HKV-5039-2023","Simola, Antti/0000-0002-0829-5232",,,,,28,2,2,2,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

A core concern is the practice of price discrimination and the rising dispersion of prices. After almost a decade of Full Retail Contestability, the State of Queensland finally removed its regulated price cap from the residential electricity market in 2016, while almost simultaneously, the two jurisdictions that pioneered this price deregulation reform, Great Britain and Victoria, were questioning their prior policy decision. Queensland makes for a fascinating case study because Southeast Queensland comprises a fully deregulated retail market while Regional Queensland is a regulated monopoly - with common input costs across both zones. Consequently, a regulated monopoly with a uniform tariff and 640,000 customers forms a very large control group, which can be directly compared to the competitive market of more than 13 million customers - making such analysis globally unique. Analysis of Queensland market conditions concludes the policy is welfare enhancing, and that British and Victorian concerns regarding price discrimination practices are misguided. To be clear, rising electricity prices are a problem, but price discrimination is not. The deregulated competitive market is, perhaps unsurprisingly, better at regulating the overall average tariff and consumer welfare has been enhanced by $184 million per annum - with some consumer segments very materially better off. However, certain modes of failure remain, viz. an inter-consumer misallocation problem and lack of transparency vis-a-vis the anchoring of discounts - known as the discounts off what? problem. The former is currently trivial, and the latter requires further research. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

It shows that China's unprecedented agricultural growth comparing to other emerging and developed countries was mainly driven by its world-beating productivity improvement, resulting from a series of fundamental reforms that have been undertaken in the Chinese agricultural sector since 1978. Despite the remarkable achievement, however, agriculture is playing a diminishing role in the growing Chinese economy, including declining agricultural employment. The paper illustrates that, as in other developed countries, the decline trend in China is an outcome of market forces in balancing various demands and supplies for goods and services as income rises. The research results will have important implications for further policy designs that seek to maintain a healthy agricultural growth in China in the future. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Exploiting local variation in birthplace unemployment rate at age 16 across 23 cohorts in France, we find that cohorts deciding on post-compulsory education in bad economic times are more educationally intergenerationally mobile - their level of educational attainment is less related to having a white-collar father. These cohorts are also more occupationally intergenerationally mobile; and a large fraction of this effect is explained by business cycle-induced differences in educational attainment. Results are robust to accounting for differential spatial mobility between birth and age 16 by parental occupation.

The reason is that internally controlled individuals may tend to (over-) react to random outcomes. Our evidence is based on an experiment in which subjects repeatedly invest in two identical, uncorrelated, risky assets and observe previous outcome realizations. Under mild restrictions, the optimal strategy is to make the same choice in each period. Yet, internals are more likely to make inconsistent risk choices. The effect size of locus of control is comparable with that of cognitive ability. Among inconsistent subjects, average switching behavior is in line with the gambler's fallacy.

We implement a nonparametric estimation method for both the tail and quantile dependence parameters on weekly data over the period 1989-2016 using copula. Our results suggest that the contagion effects between stock and currency markets are limited, even under extreme fluctuations. We also find a weak comovement between currency and bond markets, however, evidence of asymmetry is found in the dependence structure, possibly due to the 'risk-reward' scenario of international investors. Finally, our results indicate a weak dependence between stock returns and bond yields, possibly due to the low-yielding gilt and the thirst for income, pushing investors to diversify globally into other financial markets.

Thus, it examines the response of exchange rate to stock price changes contrary to the prominent practice in the literature where the former is hypothesized as the predictor. Consequently, it formulates a dynamic nonstationary heterogenous panel data model that corrects for any inherent weak endogeneity problem that may result from such reverse causality while also accounting for nonstationarity and heterogeneity features typical of Large N and Large T panels. It also tests for the role of asymmetries in the nexus in response to the increasing evidence in the literature suggesting that most financial series tend to exhibit leverage effects. Given the significance of Euro currency for OECD, the study further partitions the full data into Euro and Non-Euro areas. In addition, separate regressions are conducted for the pre- and post-Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in order to account for the role of financial crisis in the nexus. For robustness, the study considers both nominal and real variables and multiple data frequencies. In all, the result lends support to the Portfolio Balance Theory for the full OECD, the Euro area, and the non-Euro area, albeit with lesser evidence for the latter. Also, the validity of the theory became more evident after the global financial crisis while both long-run and short-run asymmetries are present in the nexus regardless of the data sample. Interestingly, findings that give rise to these conclusions are insensitive to different data frequencies, variable measurements and lag structures.","[Salisu, Afees A.] Univ Ibadan, Ctr Econometr & Allied Res, Ibadan, Nigeria; [Ndako, Umar B.] Cent Bank Nigeria, Monetary Policy Dept, Abuja, U Arab Emirates",University of Ibadan,"Salisu, AA (通讯作者)，Univ Ibadan, Ctr Econometr & Allied Res, Ibadan, Nigeria.",adebare1@yahoo.com; umarbida@gmail.com,"salisu, afees/N-1304-2018","salisu, afees/0000-0003-0619-6545",,,,,85,31,33,0,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

In the modeling process, the payoff matrices for the game between the core enterprises and the suppliers and the replicator dynamics equations for these two parties are constructed. The punishment mechanism is introduced to prevent the free-ride behavior of core enterprises. As the key technology of the IoT, the radio-frequency identification (RFID) implementation strategies of both parties are analyzed on the basis of the replicator dynamics. Both parties eventually achieve evolutionarily stable strategies by adopting the strategies of other participants. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to validate the effects of the parameters on the selection of RFID technology. Results show that the willingness of core enterprises and suppliers to implement RFID can be strengthened by adjusting relevant parameters. Thus, this study could contribute in generalizing the application of the IoT in supply chains.","[Yan, Bo; Jin, Zijie; Liu, Lifeng; Liu, Si] South China Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Commerce, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",South China University of Technology,"Yan, B (通讯作者)，South China Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Commerce, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",yanbo@scut.edu.cn,"luo, yuan/JLS-6416-2023",,National Social Science Foundation of China [13BJL072]; Guangdong Soft Science Research [2015A070704005]; Guangdong 12th Five-Year Philosophy and Social Sciences Planning [GD15CGL15]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2015KXKYJ02],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Guangdong Soft Science Research; Guangdong 12th Five-Year Philosophy and Social Sciences Planning; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This work was supported by projects of the National Social Science Foundation of China (13BJL072), Guangdong Soft Science Research (2015A070704005), Guangdong 12th Five-Year Philosophy and Social Sciences Planning (GD15CGL15), and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2015KXKYJ02).",,42,14,17,0,36,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

The domestic amplification effects (through the financial accelerator and collateral pricing) of both the capital surge from developed EU countries at the onset of the crisis and the capital reversal afterwards are the focus of the analysis. We show that domestic generators and amplificators of the crisis have much larger effects in the Balkan countries than in the Mediterranean countries, not to mention the countries of Central Europe. In the boom period, the financial accelerator was several times stronger in the Balkan countries than in the Mediterranean and Central European countries. In the bust and recovery periods, however, the direct effects of the financial accelerator declined, but the indirect effects increased considerably due to liquidity squeezes and contagion, especially strong were corresponding intercompany debt effects. In the Balkan countries, these effects in the bust and recovery periods were at least 50% larger than in the Mediterranean and Central European countries. Higher crisis costs in the Balkan countries, relative to the benchmark regions, could he attributed to the late integration of these economies into international financial and trade flows, weak institutions of financial intermediation, and inexperienced regulators; however, the importance of the contribution of misguided EU convergence doctrine cannot be ignored.

A two-stage game is developed in which the typology as well as the timing of the negotiations is endogenous. It is shown that, in pure strategies, no equilibria arise for a wide set of the parameters' space while RTM appears as the unique equilibrium agenda for a different combination of the parameters; moreover, multiple, asymmetric equilibria emerge in a limited area of the parameters' space.

In choosing between bank and bond financing, firms trade-off the greater flexibility of banks in case of financial distress against the lower marginal costs of large bond issuances. I find that, in response to a contraction in bank credit supply, aggregate bond issuance in the corporate sector increases, but not enough to avoid a decline in aggregate borrowing and investment. Keeping leverage constant while retiring bank debt would expose firms to a higher risk of financial distress; they offset this by reducing total borrowing. A calibration of the model to the Great Recession indicates that this precautionary mechanism can account for one-third of the total decline in investment by firms with access to bond markets.","[Crouzet, Nicolas] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Crouzet, N (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,,,,,,,60,35,43,4,40,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Yet for all other ethnic groups in a country, it is unclear whether having a similar ethnicity to the leader is beneficial. To shed light on this issue, I use a continuous measure of linguistic similarity to quantify the ethnic similarity of a leader to all ethnic groups in a country. Combined with panel data on 163 ethnic groups partitioned across 35 sub-Saharan countries, I use within-group time variation in similarity that results from a partitioned group's concurrent exposure to multiple national leaders. Findings show that ethnic favoritism is more widespread than previously believed: in addition to evidence of coethnic favoritism, I document evidence of non-coethnic favoritism that typically goes undetected in the absence of a continuous measure of similarity. I also find that patronage tends to be targeted toward ethnic regions rather than individuals of a particular ethnic group. I relate these results to the literature on coalition building and provide evidence that ethnicity is one of the guiding principles behind high-level government appointments.","[Dickens, Andrew] Brock Univ, Dept Econ, 1812 Sir Issac Brock Way, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A2, Canada",Brock University,"Dickens, A (通讯作者)，Brock Univ, Dept Econ, 1812 Sir Issac Brock Way, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A2, Canada.",adickens@brocku.ca,,,Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada [752-2014-2195],Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This research was funded by the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada (grant number 752-2014-2195).,,71,30,35,0,5,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7782,1945-7790,,AM ECON J-APPL ECON,Am.

QUANTITY COMPETITION; MIXED DUOPOLY; STACKELBERG LEADERSHIP; PRICE LEADERSHIP; OLIGOPOLY,"This paper investigates the theory of endogenous timing by taking into account a vertically-related market where an integrated firm competes with a downstream firm. Contrary to the standard results in the literature, we find that both firms play a sequential game in quantity competition and play a simultaneous game in price competition. Under mixed quantity-price competition, the firm choosing a price strategy moves first and the other firm choosing a quantity strategy moves later in equilibrium. Given that the timing of choosing actions is determined endogenously, aggregate profit (consumer surplus) is higher (lower) under price competition than under quantity competition. Lastly, social welfare is higher under quantity competition than under price competition when the degree of product substitutability is relatively low.","[Sun, Chia-Hung] Soochow Univ, Dept Econ, 56 Kueiyang St,Sect 1, Taipei 100, Taiwan; [Din, Hong-Ren] TransWorld Univ, Dept Tourism & Hospitality, 1221 Zhennan Rd, Touliu 640, Yunlin, Taiwan",Soochow University,"Sun, CH (通讯作者)，Soochow Univ, Dept Econ, 56 Kueiyang St,Sect 1, Taipei 100, Taiwan.",bluerainbon@yahoo.com.tw; jerry52.sun@msa.hinet.net,,,Ministry of Science and Technology [NSC 103-2410-H-265-002],Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government),"This article was supported by Ministry of Science and Technology, NSC 103-2410-H-265-002 (10.13039/501100003711).",,18,4,4,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

The team with the higher performance wins, and its members enjoy the prize as a public good. The value of the prize is identical to members of the same team but is unknown to those of the other team. We focus on the case in which a team's performance is the sum of its individual members' performances and analyze monotone equilibria in which members of the same team exert the same effort. We find that the bigger team is more likely to win if individual performance is a concave function of effort, less likely if convex, and equally likely if linear. We also provide a complete characterization of the equilibria for the case in which individual performance is a power function of effort and team value is uniformly distributed. For this case we also investigate how probabilities of winning, total team performance and individual payoffs are affected by the size of the team. The results shed light on the group-size paradox.

Although this country has implemented significant pro-market modernization reforms, it has an unexpectedly low female participation rate, wasting a vital source of economic growth. Several studies indicate that the cause of this low female labor participation in Chile would be a low conciliation between labor and family life. This experience is an important lesson for other developing economies that want to implement similar reforms. Methodology: In this article, we estimate a general equilibrium model by using Bayesian econometrics to quantify the effects of work-family conciliation at the aggregated level, through the effect of childcare. Results: Taking the case of Chile, we estimate important gains in increasing conciliation levels due to an increase in productivity rather than an increase in the labor supply. Conclusions: The main economic policy consequence for other developing or emerging economies is that higher levels of conciliation have important effects on economic activity, exceeding the financing costs.","[Jose Bosch, Maria] Univ Los Andes, Bogota, Colombia; [Garcia, Carlos J.] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Inst Latinoamer Doctrina & Estudios Sociales Ilad, Santiago, Chile; [Manriquez, Marta] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Santiago, Chile; [Valenzuela, Gabriel] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Ilades, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de los Andes (Colombia); Universidad Alberto Hurtado; Universidad Alberto Hurtado; Universidad Alberto Hurtado,"Bosch, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Los Andes, Bogota, Colombia.",mjbosch.ese@uandes.cl; cgarcia@uahurtado.cl; marta.manriquez@gmail.com; gavalenzuelavic@gmail.com,,"Bosch, Maria Jose/0000-0001-9745-433X",,,,,80,2,2,0,7,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

However, what has yet to be considered is the evidence based on different quality varieties. Using the most detailed Harmonized System 9-digit product-level data, the present paper provides evidence of crowding-out and crowded-out effects across different product quality segments and across manufacturing sectors by quality segments. The empirical evidence presented in this paper shows that the crowding-out effects of Chinese exports have been greatest at the lower end of the quality spectrum but less significant at the higher quality spectrum. Moreover, since 2007, China's own exports of lower quality manufactured goods have been increasingly crowded out. The key policy implication is that China's export path is in line with that taken by other Asian economies in previous decades; the crowded-out effect could achieve win-win outcomes for countries involved; and lower income countries would do well to be open to receive those relocated low value-added industries from China. However, the relocation policy in China is best implemented gradually as climbing up the product quality ladder takes time.","[Liu, Yan] Dalian Minzu Univ, Dept Int Econ & Trade, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Shi, Xunpeng; Laurenceson, James] Univ Technol Sydney, Australian China Relat Inst, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Dalian Minzu University; University of Technology Sydney,"Shi, XP (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Australian China Relat Inst, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",lhyddhmt@163.com; xunpeng.shi@gmail.com; James.Laurenceson@uts.edu.au,"Xunpeng, Roc Shi/I-5486-2019","Xunpeng, Roc Shi/0000-0001-9653-7395; Laurenceson, James/0000-0002-3991-0082",National Social Science Fund of China [13CGJ034],National Social Science Fund of China,Yan Liu acknowledges financial support from the National Social Science Fund of China (No. 13CGJ034; Project title Research on the Chinese Manufacturing Export Quality).,,23,18,23,7,108,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JUL-AUG,2018,26.0,4,,,,,1,23,,10.1111/cwe.12246,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GN3GV,,"Green Published, Bronze",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000438893100001,0

Levels of trust and trustworthiness are likely to depend on social utility; the magnitude of which is influenced by the social context governing individual relationships. Social networks are an example of such a social context. This paper investigates how social networks influence trust and trustworthiness by blending social network analysis with experimental economics methodology in two separate experiments. We show that trust and trustworthiness are higher for individuals who are more closely connected; in both cases, this relationship tapers off beyond second degree friendships. We also find that people tend to trust more central (popular) individuals. However, being more central (popular) has little influence on one's levels of trust and trustworthiness. We find these effects on trust to be only partially driven by the expectation of trustworthiness. We thus document evidence of a bias toward more closely connected and more popular individuals.

In a static version where capital is fixed and technology is exogenous, automation reduces employment and the labor share, and may even reduce wages, while the creation of new tasks has the opposite effects. Our full model endogenizes capital accumulation and the direction of research toward automation and the creation of new tasks. If the long-run rental rate of capital relative to the wage is sufficiently low, the long-run equilibrium involves automation of all tasks. Otherwise, there exists a stable balanced growth path in which the two types of innovations go hand-in-hand. Stability is a consequence of the fact that automation reduces the cost of producing using labor, and thus discourages further automation and encourages the creation of new tasks. In an extension with heterogeneous skills, we show that inequality increases during transitions driven both by faster automation and the introduction of new tasks, and characterize the conditions under which inequality stabilizes in the long run.","[Acemoglu, Daron] MIT, Dept Econ, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Restrepo, Pascual] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Boston University,"Acemoglu, D (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",daron@mit.edu; pascual@bu.edu,"Acemoglu, Daron/JQW-5242-2023",,Bradley Foundation; Sloan Foundation; Toulouse Network on Information Technology,Bradley Foundation; Sloan Foundation(Alfred P.

We use the model to examine the following question: can the sender benefit from a regulation that commits to disclosing more precise information? We show that the sender is worse off if an unconditional reduction in discretion induces a more informative equilibrium.

By exploiting the exogenous change created by this mandatory retirement policy, we use the mandatory retirement age as an instrument for retirement status to examine the effect of retirement on individual health using data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS). Our main finding is that the probability of fair or poor self-reported health among white-collar workers decreases by 34 percentage point after retirement. This result is generally robust to different model specifications, alternative measures of health, and different subsamples. In addition, we deliver evidence that increased health-related exercises and the cultivation of a better lifestyle are two possible channels through which retirement affects health.","[Che, Yi; Li, Xin] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Room 1006,1954 Huashan Rd, Shanghai 200052, Peoples R China; [Li, Xin] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, China Hosp, Dev Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Li, X (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Room 1006,1954 Huashan Rd, Shanghai 200052, Peoples R China.;Li, X (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, China Hosp, Dev Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",lixin241789@sjtu.edu.cn,,,"China National Science Foundation [71273176]; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71703099, 71703085]; Special Research Fund of China-ASEAN Collaborative Innovation Center for Regional Development [CWZ201514]; Development Program of Ministry of Education for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Teams [CWZ201514]; Shanghai Pujiang Program [16PJC048]",China National Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Special Research Fund of China-ASEAN Collaborative Innovation Center for Regional Development; Development Program of Ministry of Education for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Teams; Shanghai Pujiang Program(Shanghai Pujiang Program),"We are grateful to the editor, two anonymous referees, Alan J.

Working with a new dataset on issuance activity in domestic and international markets and firm performance, the paper finds that capital raising through these markets has grown rapidly since the early 1990s and involved an increasing number of firms. Whereas the amounts raised in equity and loan markets (relative to gross domestic product) stand well relative to international standards, bond issuance activity lags behind. However, bond financing has gained importance over time. Equity issuances take place primarily in domestic markets, whereas bonds and loans are mostly issued internationally, display long maturities and entail low levels of credit risk. Issuing firms from the Arab region are very large compared to international standards. They also tend to be larger, faster growing and more leveraged than non-issuing firms in Arab countries.","[Cortina, Juan J.; Ismail, Soha; Schmukler, Sergio L.] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Schmukler, SL (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",jcortinalorente@worldbank.org; sismail2@worldbank.org; sschmukler@worldbank.org,,,World Bank's Development Economics Department; Knowledge for Change Program (KCP); Middle East and North Africa Region; Economic Research Forum (ERF) in Egypt,World Bank's Development Economics Department; Knowledge for Change Program (KCP); Middle East and North Africa Region; Economic Research Forum (ERF) in Egypt,"We are grateful to Shanta Devarajan and Ibrahim Elbadawi for encouraging us to write the paper.

Parties alternate in office and cannot commit to future policies, but they can forge a political compromise where each party curbs excessive spending when in office if it expects future governments to do the same. In contrast to the received literature, we find that strict limits on government borrowing can exacerbate political economy distortions by making a political compromise unsustainable. This tends to happen when political turnover is limited. Conversely, a tight limit on the public debt fosters a compromise that yields the efficient outcome if political turnover is vigorous. Our analysis thus suggests that to sustain good economic policies, a society needs to restrict either the extent of political turnover or the ability of governments to issue debt, but not both.","[Cunha, Alexandre B.] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Ornelas, Emanuel] Sao Paulo Sch Economics FGV, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"Cunha, AB (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",research@alexbcunha.com; eaornelas@gmail.com,"ornelas, emanuel/A-7413-2014","Cunha, Alexandre B./0000-0001-8103-9043; Ornelas, Emanuel/0000-0001-8330-8745",Brazilian Council of Science and Technology (CNPq); LSE Santander Travel Fund,Brazilian Council of Science and Technology (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); LSE Santander Travel Fund,"We thank Dirk Krueger (the editor) and two anonymous referees for very useful comments and suggestions on a previous version of the paper.

In this context, the explicit goal to significantly raise the percentage of wages in the national household income was an integral part of the 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-15). These changes in economic strategy are likely to affect the attractiveness of the country to foreign investors. In this paper, we raise the hypothesis that soaring relative wages negatively affect foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows to China, and alter their distribution within China. In addition, low-wage countries in the Asian region might benefit from the changed direction of FDI inflows. We utilize fixed-effects panel models with spatial spillovers for Chinese provinces and developing ASEAN countries to provide strong and robust evidence that wage increases change the allocation of FDI within China. In addition, we show that the changes in China's economic strategy improve the chances of its low-income neighbors to attract FDI.","[Donaubauer, Julian] Helmut Schmidt Univ, Holstenhofweg 85, D-22043 Hamburg, Germany; [Dreger, Christian] German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",Helmut Schmidt University; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Donaubauer, J (通讯作者)，Helmut Schmidt Univ, Holstenhofweg 85, D-22043 Hamburg, Germany.",julian.donaubauer@hsu-hh.de; cdreger@diw.de,"Dreger, Christian/AAF-6719-2020",,,,,,24,8,8,0,8,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

That is, we combine national accounts, tax and survey data in a comprehensive and consistent manner to build homogenous annual series on the distribution of national income by percentiles over the 1900-2014 period, with detailed breakdown by age, gender and income categories over the 1970-2014 period. Our DINA-based estimates allow for a much richer analysis of the long-run pattern found in previous tax-based series, i.e. a long-run decline in income inequality, largely due to a sharp drop in the concentration of wealth and capital income following the 1914-1945 capital shocks. First, our new series deliver higher inequality levels than the usual tax-based series for the recent decades, because the latter miss a rising part of capital income. Growth incidence curves look dramatically different for the 1950-1983 and 1983-2014 sub-periods. We also show that gender inequality in labor income declined in recent decades, albeit fairly slowly among top labor incomes. E.g. female share among top 0.1% earners was only 12% in 2012 (vs. 7% in 1994 and 5% in 1970). Finally, we find that distributional changes can have large impact on comparisons of well-being across countries. E.g. average pretax income among bottom 50% adults is 20% larger in France than in the U.S., in spite of the fact that aggregate per adult national income is 30% smaller in France.","[Garbinti, Bertrand] Banque France, CREST, Paris, France; [Goupille-Lebret, Jonathan] Paris Sch Econ, INSEAD, GATE LSE, Paris, France; [Piketty, Thomas] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France",European Central Bank; Bank of France; INSEAD Business School; Paris School of Economics; Paris School of Economics,"Garbinti, B (通讯作者)，Banque France, CREST, Paris, France.",bertrand.garbinti@ensae.fr; jonathan.goupille@ens.fr; piketty@psemail.eu,"MOTREB, ayoub EL/AAB-1710-2019","Goupille-Lebret, Jonathan/0000-0001-5827-6374","European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme, ERC [340831]; French National Research Agency (ANR) (Centre d'acces securise aux donnees CASD) [ANR-10-EQPX-17]","European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme, ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); French National Research Agency (ANR) (Centre d'acces securise aux donnees CASD)","This is a shortened and revised version of a paper that was previously circulated as Income Inequality in France, 1900-2014: Evidence from Distributional National Accounts (DINA), WID.world Working Paper no 2017/4.

We adapt the Lopez-Perez and Spiegelman (2013) dot experiment to measure how a  weak vs.  strong message affects individuals' propensities for truthfulness when there is a monetary incentive to lie and no other person is affected by the communication. Weak messages state a fact, whereas strong statements  solemnly swear to the fact. In our first (between-subject) experiment, strong (vs. weak) statements increase the percentage of subjects choosing to tell the truth by approximately 30 percentage points in each of three different payoff scenarios that favor lying to a different extent. Because lies increase payoffs in the experiment, the weaker aversion to weaker lies is socially advantageous. In a second (within-subject) experiment participants choose between messages of different strength and we find (1) a preference for lying with weak (vs. strong) language, and (2) a significant fraction of subjects who are willing to pay a positive amount to avoid a strong vs. weak lie. From both experiments, we conclude that our subjects tend to be intrinsically less averse to dishonesty when a lie is conveyed with weak vs. strong language.","[Gawn, Glynis; Innes, Robert] Univ Calif, Sch Social Sci Humanities & Arts, Econ, 5200 N Lake Rd, Merced, CA 95343 USA",University of California System; University of California Merced,"Innes, R (通讯作者)，Univ Calif, Sch Social Sci Humanities & Arts, Econ, 5200 N Lake Rd, Merced, CA 95343 USA.",ggawn@ucmerced.edu; rinnes@ucmerced.edu,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

Depending on the State, up to 50% of jobs in the public sector are reserved for members of low castes. However, recruitment is highly discretionary, making it hard for low castes without connections to access reserved jobs and thereby benefit from affirmative action. This paper studies how having a local elected leader from the same caste affects the probability of applying for reserved jobs. The identification strategy focuses on the political reservation system at the village level that determines the caste group of the local elected leader. Taking data from three States in South India, I find that households are more likely to apply when the local elected leader is from their caste group. The evidence suggests that the impact is driven by updated beliefs regarding the probability of a successful application.","[Gille, Veronique] Univ Paris 09, PSL, UMR DIAL, IRD, 4 Rue Enghien, F-75010 Paris, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD),"Gille, V (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, PSL, UMR DIAL, IRD, 4 Rue Enghien, F-75010 Paris, France.",gille@dial.prd.fr,,"Gille, Veronique/0000-0002-3338-8641",European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)/ERC [269831],European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)/ERC(European Research Council (ERC)),"I am grateful for very useful comments from Kaivan Munshi, Liam Wren Luis, Flore Gubert, Catherine Bros and two anonymous referees.

Equally, pollutants generated during the production process also result in disutility. One of the policy weapons available to governments in regard to public debt is the generation of primary surpluses in order to sustain a capacity to repay the debt. Affecting this capacity are the cost/benefits involved in reduction of emissions through taxation. In this paper, we address the above factors in an extremely simple, dynamic game in order to find linkages between the notions of public debt, pollution, and taxation. The starting point of the model is identification of the current account as the basis of the equation of motion of the public debt which is considered as a stock. A regulator's task is to raise the nation's primary surplus to reduce the stock of public debt. Nash and Stackelberg differential game solutions are used to explore the strategic interactions. For the Nash equilibrium, it is found that in establishing the cyclical strategies during the game between the polluters on the one hand and the government on the other, the discount rate of the polluters is required to be greater than the government's discount rate. That is, polluters must be more impatient than the government. In the case of the hierarchical setting, the analytical expressions of the strategic variables and the steady state value of the public debt stock are important outcomes of this study. We find the analytical expressions of the reward functions, making the implementation by policy makers an easier task. Finally, we are able to show the conditions under which conflict is more intensive in the two cases of equilibrium, according to the shadow price of the environmental damages.

The excess entry theorem is well known in oligopoly theory. According to this theorem, a greater number of profit-maximizing firms enter a free-entry oligopolistic market than is optimal for welfare maximization. We demonstrate the possibility that insufficient entry arises when ECFs compete in a free-entrymarket. In particular, we show that if both the demand and cost functions are convex, insufficient ECF entry necessarily occurs. Our results suggest that competition among firms seeking purposes other than profit might lead to insufficient entry because differences in competing firms' objectives affect the intensity of market competition.","[Hamada, Kojun] Niigata Univ, Niigata, Japan; [Ohkawa, Takao] Ritsumeikan Univ, Shiga, Japan; [Okamura, Makoto] Gakushuin Univ, Tokyo, Japan; [Okamura, Makoto] Hiroshima Univ, Hiroshima, Japan",Niigata University; Ritsumeikan University; Gakushuin University; Hiroshima University,"Hamada, K (通讯作者)，Niigata Univ, Niigata, Japan.",khamada@econ.niigata-u.ac.jp,"Hamada, Kojun/I-9461-2019","Hamada, Kojun/0000-0002-4684-5477","JSPS KAKENHI [16K03615, 16H03612, 17K03734, 16K03658, 15K03492, 15K03436, 15K03370]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17K03734, 16H03612, 15K03370, 15K03436, 15K03492, 16K03615, 16K03658] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This study was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers 16K03615 and 16H03612 (Hamada), 17K03734 (Ohkawa), 16K03658 (Okamura), and 15K03492, 15K03436, and 15K03370 (Ohkawa and Okamura).",,20,4,4,1,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

We show that to satisfy the patentability requirement for minimum innovation size, each research and development (R&D) firm targets only industries in which the incumbent's technology is of sufficient obsolescence. This is because the technological gap between innovator and incumbent is greater in industries using older technologies. Although the increase in minimum innovation size reduces the number of industries targeted for R&D, it also increases the amount of R&D investment directed at those targeted industries. Consequently, introducing a minimum innovation size has a nonmonotonic (or negative) effect on the aggregate flow of innovations. Further, by deriving the endogenous long-run distribution of innovation size, we show that an increase in minimum innovation size reduces the mean innovation size. This implies that even if the patent office only grants patents for superior innovations, it causes innovators to produce generally inferior-quality innovations.","[Kishi, Keiichi] Kansai Univ, Suita, Osaka, Japan",Kansai University,"Kishi, K (通讯作者)，Kansai Univ, Fac Econ, 3-3-35 Yamate, Suita, Osaka 5648680, Japan.",kishi@kansai-u.ac.jp,,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, Japan; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [JP15J03874]","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)","I am grateful to two anonymous referees for their very constructive comments and suggestions on an earlier version of this paper.

Extant literature shows Bitcoin prices may be detached from economic fundamentals. The question that remains however is whether its price movements are linked with its transaction activity - a critical element of its growing market microstructure. Using number of Bitcoin transactions and unique addresses, respectively, to proxy for transaction activity, it is shown that a one standard deviation shock to transaction activity leads to just over a 0.30% gain in returns on the third day following the shock. By the sixth day, there is a reversal in price behavior and any such gams are expunged. When comparing the bidirectional linkages between returns and transaction activity, it is shown here that the contribution of return shocks to transaction activity is quantitatively larger in magnitude.

We show also that microfinance loans per capita are negatively associated with poverty gap (which measures the depth of poverty) and squared poverty gap (which measures the severity of poverty), implying that MFIs benefit not just the poor but also the poorest.","[Miled, Kamel Bel Hadj; Ben Rejeb, Jalel-Eddine] Univ Sousse, Higher Inst Management, Lab Management Innovat & Sustainable Dev, Sousse, Tunisia",Universite de Sousse,"Ben Rejeb, JE (通讯作者)，Univ Sousse, Higher Inst Management, Lab Management Innovat & Sustainable Dev, Sousse, Tunisia.",kamelbenmiled@gmail.com; Jaleleddine.benrejeb@esct.rnu.tn,"Bel Hadj Miled, Kamel/GQH-0809-2022","Bel Hadj Miled, Kamel/0000-0002-6076-3435",,,,,40,10,11,1,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1868-7865,1868-7873,,J KNOWL ECON,J.

This behavior increases the risk to lose investments. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a new AFI format: a one-page report that is short and easy to understand, as a complement to the long and complex traditional format in order to increase the usefulness of information for investors and to decrease investment risk. Two experiments provide evidence about the increased usefulness of AFI when using the new proposed format. More importantly, it seems that results in terms of profits also improve considerably in medium (one year) and long-term (four years) investments, in contrast to more modest profits of speculative investments. Furthermore, this difference occurs regardless of the investors' previous experience.","[Pascual-Ezama, David; Rodriguez Paredes, Mercedes] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Accounting & Finance, Madrid, Spain; [Sanchez-Martin, Maria-del-Pilar] Univ Francisco Victoria, Dept Law & Business, Madrid, Spain; [Gil-Gomez de Liano, Beatriz] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Social Psychol & Methodol, Madrid, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Pascual-Ezama, D (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Accounting & Finance, Madrid, Spain.",david.pascual@ccee.ucm.es,"Sánchez-Martín, Maria-Pilar/Z-2212-2019; Gil-Gómez de Liaño, Beatriz/L-1715-2014","Gil-Gómez de Liaño, Beatriz/0000-0002-7823-4486; Pascual-Ezama, David/0000-0001-8497-9401",Real Colegio Complutense in Harvard; Harvard Business School; Spanish Ministry of Science [ECO2013-44879-R],Real Colegio Complutense in Harvard; Harvard Business School; Spanish Ministry of Science(Spanish Government),"This project made possible in part by the financial support of The Real Colegio Complutense in Harvard by the Research Fellowships.

By proposing a narrative of collective responsibility and introducing modern and more transparent working methods in civilian and military institutions, post-Maidan civil society displayed the potential to act as an agent of change capable of contributing to substantial reforms and having a positive effect on the quality of governance.

In some cases, intensity standards are associated with tradable credit markets to help reduce firms' compliance costs. I develop a jurisdictional model of credit trading under an intensity standard, framed in terms of a Renewable Portfolio Standard for electric utilities. I find that regulators of firms with low compliance costs always allow for inter jurisdictional credit trade. Regulators of firms with high costs of compliance allow for credit trade under the condition that extra-jurisdictional credits count less towards compliance compared to credits generated within the jurisdiction. Counter-intuitively, increasing the stringency of the intensity standard when credit trading is possible can have the opposite of the intended effect and actually decrease renewable electricity generation. Using numerical simulations, I show that heterogeneity in terms of renewable costs or externalities across jurisdictions are not sufficient for inter jurisdictional credit trading to be a stable equilibrium outcome.","[Rudik, Ivan] Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, 475J Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",Cornell University,"Rudik, I (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, 475J Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",irudik@cornell.edu,,,,,,,17,4,4,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

The protectionism that is gathering steam under his presidency may yield some short-term gains, but at the detriment of the long-run. Examining the discontent among ordinary voters that brought Trump to power, this paper argues that this should be treated as an opportunity for a major regulatory reform. With the advance of digital technology, we have increasing returns to scale, and that, in turn, is making our antitrust laws backfire and hurt the well-being of ordinary people, thereby sowing discontent. The paper builds a simple model to illustrate this and makes the case for revoking the older antitrust laws and replacing them with some simple profit-sharing rules at the level of the firm, and the economy.

To do that, we implement three variants of the continuous wavelet methodology, namely the wavelet power spectrum, the cross wavelet, and the wavelet coherence, to aggregate and disaggregate quarterly data between 2005Q1 and 2015Q3. The wavelet analysis unveils that the relationship between the U.S. output and the aggregate energy use by source varies across frequencies and evolves over time. Our results specifically show that the consumption of all energy sources display significant interactive linkages with the U.S. output. At the disaggregate level, while we perceive the presence of co-movements and causality between pairs through frequency bands and over time in almost all sectors, the industrial sector exhibits the highest intensity of wavelet coherence with the added value. Our findings highlight the need of accounting for the various energy sources and economic sectors when studying the output-energy nexus and designing economic policies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In the second one, we analyse the origins of exchange rate scepticism. The third section briefly complements the previous discussion with reference to macroeconomic formulations that allow for short-run contractionary effects of a devaluation, reinforcing the scepticism in question. In the fourth section, we discuss the revival of development thinking in the 1980s and its discussion about East Asian trajectories, a literature that placed great emphasis on industrial policy. Finally, in the fifth section, we discuss the new historical facts and the new development macroeconomics models that are putting an end to exchange rate scepticism.","[Bresser-Pereira, Luiz Carlos] Getulio Vargas Fdn, Rua Araripina,132 Cidade Jardim, BR-05603030 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Rugitsky, Fernando] Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Econ Business & Accounting, Dept Econ, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Getulio Vargas Foundation; Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Bresser-Pereira, LC (通讯作者)，Getulio Vargas Fdn, Rua Araripina,132 Cidade Jardim, BR-05603030 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",bresserpereira@gmail.com,"Bresser-Pereira, Luiz Carlos/D-4258-2017; Rugitsky, Fernando/K-1051-2013","Bresser-Pereira, Luiz Carlos/0000-0001-8679-0557; Rugitsky, Fernando/0000-0002-4803-7270",,,,,56,9,13,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Traditional theory holds that, a large country should hold back its exports to improve its terms of trade. However, if the learning-by-doing effect exists, then a large country has an incentive to subsidize exports. In this paper, I present a formal industrial organization (IO) model to capture this story. I embed this IO structure into a trade model with three goods. I also conduct some counter-factual analysis and welfare analysis about various trade policies of the importer countries.","[Fang, Jing] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ, 1037 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Fang, J (通讯作者)，Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ, 1037 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.",jing_fang@hust.edu.cn,,,Fundamental Research Funds fro the Central Universities [HUST: 2012WQN051],Fundamental Research Funds fro the Central Universities,This material is based upon work supported by the Fundamental Research Funds fro the Central Universities HUST: 2012WQN051.,,22,0,0,2,6,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.

Reputational concerns arise because with positive probability agents are behavioral types, committed to demanding a fixed share of the surplus. In equilibrium, rational agents may demand almost the entire surplus and then wait, with the deadlock only broken by the arrival of news about future costs, even as the probability of behavioral types vanishes. Although both agents would benefit from a compromise reached immediately, they do not propose such agreements, because doing so would increase an opponent's option value of waiting.

As a first step for introducing viewpoints of multiple sectors in the context of business cycles, we consider a dual economy in which there are only two kinds of goods: the consumption good and the investment good. By examining a two-sector Keynesian model, we intend to take a look at some phenomena induced by interactions between the consumption good sector and the investment good sector, which cannot be observed in one-sector models. We then find that the stability of equilibrium and the possibility of emergence of a periodic orbit depend on whether the Keynesian stability condition holds or not and that along periodic orbits (business cycles), the consumption good sector lags behind the investment good sector and that the volatility (measured by the ratio of the amplitude of cycles to the equilibrium value) of the investment sector is larger than that of the consumption good sector. Also, we supplement the analysis by performing numerical simulations.","[Murakami, Hiroki] Chuo Univ, Hachioji, Tokyo, Japan",Chuo University,"Murakami, H (通讯作者)，Chuo Univ, Fac Econ, 742-1 Higashi Nakano, Hachioji, Tokyo 1920393, Japan.",hmura@tamacc.chuo-u.ac.jp,,"Murakami, Hiroki/0000-0002-3074-9528",Chuo University Personal Research Grant; JSPS KAKENHI [14J03350]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [14J03350] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Chuo University Personal Research Grant; JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Chuo University Personal Research Grant; JSPS KAKENHI, Grant Number: 14J03350",,75,12,12,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,MAY,2018,69.0,2,,,,,444,472,,10.1111/meca.12195,0.0,,,29,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GB2MW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428888200007,0

The correlation of values is modeled via the global games information structure. I focus on the double limits of perfect Bayesian equilibria as offers become frequent and the correlation approaches perfect. I characterize the Pareto frontier of the double limits and show that it is efficient, but the surplus split generally differs from the Nash bargaining split. I then construct a double limit that approximates the Nash bargaining split in the ex post surplus, but with a delay. Further, I prove the folk theorem when the range of the buyer's values coincides with the range of the seller's costs: any feasible and individually rational ex ante payoff profile can be approximated by a double limit.","[Tsoy, Anton] Einaudi Inst Econ & Finance, Dept Econ, Rome, Italy",,"Tsoy, A (通讯作者)，Einaudi Inst Econ & Finance, Dept Econ, Rome, Italy.",tsoianton.ru@gmail.com,,,,,,,46,2,2,1,4,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1555-7561,,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

Second, we extend their argument to a sequential pricing game in which one firm chooses its price before the other, given that both firms adopt G.L.P.

The active monetary and passive fiscal (AM/PF) policy may induce the raising of both interest rates and inflation rates. We find that there is a positive relationship between shopping time and inflation because higher inflation causes agents to reduce their money holdings so as to take more time for shopping. In addition, shopping time and output move in opposite ways due to the fact that higher shopping time results in lower working hours, so as to decrease production. Finally, this model fails to capture liquidity effect, but rather identify price puzzle through an expansion of monetary policy shock.","[Chang, Ming-Jen] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Chang, Ming-Jen] Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Hualien, Taiwan; [Liu, Meng-Chao] Sunny Bank, Int Banking Dept, Taipei, Taiwan",University of Liverpool; National Dong Hwa University,"Chang, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.;Chang, MJ (通讯作者)，Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Hualien, Taiwan.",ming-jen.chang@liverpool.ac.uk,,,,,,,29,2,2,3,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We find that having a father who is a liberal professional has a positive and significant effect on the probability of a graduate of becoming a liberal professional, To assess the processes at work in this intergenerational transmission, we evaluate the effect of having a liberal professional father on the probabilities to undertake each of the compulsory steps required to become a liberal professional, which are choosing a university degree providing access to a liberal profession, completing a period of practice, passing a licensing exam and starting a liberal profession. Having a liberal professional father has a positive and statistically significant effect on the probability to complete a compulsory period of practice and to start a liberal profession; whereas there does not seem to be an effect on the type of degree chosen and on passing the licensing examination, at least after controlling for child's and parental formal human capital.

We jointly analyze three different structural oil market shocks (i.e., aggregate demand, oil supply, and oil-specific demand shocks) and stock market volatility using a structural vector autoregressive model. Identification is achieved by assuming that the price of crude oil reacts to stock market volatility only with delay. This implies that innovations to the price of crude oil are not strictly exogenous, but predetermined with respect to the stock market. We show that volatility responds significantly to oil price shocks caused by unexpected changes in aggregate and oil-specific demand, whereas the impact of supply-side shocks is negligible.","[Bastianin, Andrea] Univ Milan, Milan, Italy; [Bastianin, Andrea; Manera, Matteo] Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, Milan, Italy; [Manera, Matteo] Univ Milano Bicocca, Milan, Italy",University of Milan; Fondazione Mattei; University of Milano-Bicocca,"Bastianin, A (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Methods DEMM, Via Conservatorio 7, I-20122 Milan, Italy.",andrea.bastianin@unimi.it,,,"Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR) research program titled Climate change in the Mediterranean area: scenarios, economic impacts, mitigation policies and technological innovation (PRIN) [2010S2LHSE-001]","Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR) research program titled Climate change in the Mediterranean area: scenarios, economic impacts, mitigation policies and technological innovation (PRIN)(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","We are grateful to two anonymous referees and Apostolos Serletis for insightful comments and suggestions.

Control communities are provided with block grants to fund local public goods, while households in treatment communities are provided with vouchers that they may either contribute to a public good or redeem at a discount for a private capital good. We find that the use of vouchers as a mechanism for aid delivery increases community participation in local public decision-making, changes the nature of allocation outcomes, and improves community satisfaction with allocation outcomes.","[Beath, A.] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [BenYishay, A.] Coll William & Mary, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA; [d'Adda, G.] Politecn Milan, Milan, Italy; [Grosjean, P.] Univ New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Weber, R.

We find that self selection creates high-performing teams. These teams perform better on a team task than randomly-assigned teams and as well as those assigned using the algorithm.

In its basic version, a control group is untreated at two dates, whereas a treatment group becomes fully treated at the second date. However, in many applications of the DID method, the treatment rate only increases more in the treatment group. In such fuzzy designs, a popular estimator of the treatment effect is the DID of the outcome divided by the DID of the treatment. We show that this ratio identifies a local average treatment effect only if the effect of the treatment is stable over time, and if the effect of the treatment is the same in the treatment and in the control group. We then propose two alternative estimands that do not rely on any assumption on treatment effects, and that can be used when the treatment rate does not change over time in the control group. We prove that the corresponding estimators are asymptotically normal. Finally, we use our results to reassess the returns to schooling in Indonesia.","[De Chaisemartin, C.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [D'Haultfoeuille, X.] Ctr Res Econ & Stat, Stockholm, Sweden",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"De Chaisemartin, C (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",,"PATTANAYAK, MANORANJAN/N-7858-2017",,research grant Labex Ecodec: Investissements d'Avenir [ANR-11-IDEX-0003/Labex Ecodec/ANR-11-LABX-0047],research grant Labex Ecodec: Investissements d'Avenir(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"We thank Yannick Guyonvarch for outstanding research assistance, and are very grateful to Esther Duflo for sharing her data with us.

In the present paper, we review more than a hundred papers from this literature and provide a comprehensive overview by first listing the existing theoretical frameworks, and then covering the common empirical approaches, synthesizing the demographic and personal characteristics of those who cheat, identifying the behavioural mechanisms found that affect dishonesty and finally we finish by discussing how the empirical evidence fit theory. Overall, the review concludes that many people behave dishonestly, but also that it is a highly malleable behavior sensitive to elements such as decision contexts, behaviour of others, state of mind and depletion. The review can be used as an overview of the dishonesty literature or as a guide or work of reference for selected topics of interest.","[Jacobsen, Catrine; Fosgaard, Toke Reinholt] Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Pascual-Ezama, David] Univ Complutense Madrid, Madrid, Spain",University of Copenhagen; Complutense University of Madrid,"Jacobsen, C (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.",cj@ifro.ku.dk,"Fosgaard, Toke R./E-6666-2015; Jacobsen, Catrine/E-7326-2015","Fosgaard, Toke R./0000-0003-0659-5490; Jacobsen, Catrine/0000-0002-3862-464X",,,,,129,92,98,3,62,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

Using a sample of medium-sized enterprises clients to whom a credit exposure was approved in one of the banks operating on the bank's market within a country belonging to the European Union, the expected profitability of these clients was compared by using firstly RAROC and then compared the results to the profitability calculation using EVA tool on the same set of data. Although both measures (RAROC and EVA) are based on the same initial variables, the results of profitability measure show different outcomes in terms of clients' profitability level and thus their contribution to the total clients' portfolio profitability. Using EVA tool instead of RAROC measurement thus could help bank's relationship managers and branch managers focus on those clients creating larger value added than others.","[Kreckova, Stepanka] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Finance & Accounting, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Krecková, S (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Finance & Accounting, Prague, Czech Republic.",xkres07@vse.ez,,,University of Economics [IP100040],University of Economics,"This paper was prepared within the research projects of Faculty of Finance and Accounting of University of Economics, Prague, realized with the institutional support of University of Economics, No. IP100040.",,26,1,2,0,20,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

As of the late 1980s, financial liberalization became also part of the Structural Adjustment Programs' sponsored by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. However, the literature on financial repression and liberalization remains controversial on its theoretical conclusions and policy implications. Given its importance for both the theory and policy of economic development and growth, this paper looks for a possible synthesis. After reviewing the theoretical contributions and empirical studies under the headings of the McKinnon-Shaw and new structuralists models, the survey concludes that a new synthesis might be found in the Post-Keynesian attempt to take an institutional perspective within a globalised financial and economic environment.","[Loizos, Konstantinos] Univ Athens, Athens, Greece",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens,"Loizos, K (通讯作者)，Univ Athens, Athens, Greece.",komilos@hol.gr,,,,,,,106,7,7,8,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

In particular, this paper has pursued to address one gap in existing research on open innovation, namely the investigation of its relationship with market orientation that promotes continual processes of innovation leading to higher customer value. Findings have shown how market-driven companies tend to overcome the classical view on relying innovation on internal Research & Development departments in order to become more permeable to the outside environment. In fact, market-driven companies develop distinctive outside-in, inside-out, and spanning capabilities that encourage the matching and integration of internal resources with external partners and open innovation emerges as an essential driver to preserve and improve their competitiveness.","[Arrigo, Elisa] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ Management & Stat, Milan, Italy",University of Milano-Bicocca,"Arrigo, E (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ Management & Stat, Milan, Italy.",elisa.arrigo@unimib.it,"Arrigo, Elisa/AFE-4718-2022","Arrigo, Elisa/0000-0002-9300-7230",,,,,51,6,6,1,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1868-7865,1868-7873,,J KNOWL ECON,J.

In the first model, we assume private ownership of natural resources and show that every competitive equilibrium converges to a balanced-growth equilibrium with the long-run rate of growth being determined by the discount factor of the most patient agents. In the second model, natural resources are public property and the resource extraction rate is determined by majority voting. For this model, we define an intertemporal voting equilibrium and prove that it also converges to a balanced-growth equilibrium. In this scenario, the long-run rate of growth is determined by the median discount factor. Our results suggest that if the most patient agents do not constitute a majority of the population, private ownership of natural resources results in a higher rate of growth than public ownership. At the same time, private ownership leads to higher inequality than public ownership, and if inequality impedes growth, then the public property regime is likely to result in a higher long-run rate of growth. However, an appropriate redistributive policy can eliminate the negative impact of inequality on growth.","[Borissov, Kirill; Pakhnin, Mikhail] European Univ St Petersburg, 3 Gagarinskaya St, St Petersburg 191187, Russia; [Pakhnin, Mikhail] RAS, St Petersburg Inst Econ & Math, 36-38 Serpukhovskaya St, St Petersburg 190013, Russia",European University at Saint Petersburg; Institute for Regional Economic Studies Russian Academy of Sciences; Russian Academy of Sciences; Central Economics & Mathematics Institute RAS,"Borissov, K (通讯作者)，European Univ St Petersburg, 3 Gagarinskaya St, St Petersburg 191187, Russia.",kirill@eu.spb.ru,"Borissov, Kirill/N-3302-2015; Borissov, Kirill/JAC-3976-2023; Pakhnin, Mikhail/D-4581-2016","Borissov, Kirill/0000-0002-0709-0841; Pakhnin, Mikhail/0000-0002-1253-1074",ExxonMobil,ExxonMobil(Exxon Mobil Corporation),"We are grateful to ExxonMobil for financial support.

For general potential games, we establish that maximizers of potential functions are Nash equilibria. For a particular class of potential games called aggregative potential games, we characterize Nash equilibria using a one-dimensional analogue of the potential function, which we call the quasi-potential function.

In particular and within the standard New Keynesian model, we evaluate to what extent communication of the inflation target is relevant to the success of inflation targeting. We find that if the central bank cares only about inflation stabilization, announcing the inflation target does not make a difference in terms of macroeconomic performance compared with a standard active monetary policy. However, if the central bank also cares about the stabilization of economic activity, communicating the target helps to reduce the volatility of inflation, interest rate, and output gap, although their average levels are not affected. This finding is consistent with the theoretical literature and provides a rationale for the adoption of a flexible inflation-targeting regime.","[Cornand, Camille] CNRS GATE LSE, Ecully, France; [Cornand, Camille] Univ Lyon, Lyon, France; [M'Baye, Cheick Kader] African Management Inst, Arusha, Tanzania",,"Cornand, C (通讯作者)，GATE L SE 93, Chemin Mouilles, F-69130 Ecully, France.",cornand@gate.cnrs.fr,"Cornand, Camille/H-3184-2017",,"ANR-DFG [ANR-12-FRAL-0013-01]; LABEX CORTEX of Universite de Lyon, within the program Investissements d'Avenir [ANR-11-LABX-0042, ANR-11-IDEX-007]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-12-FRAL-0013] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)","ANR-DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); LABEX CORTEX of Universite de Lyon, within the program Investissements d'Avenir(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR))","We are thankful to the ANR-DFG for a joint grant for financial support (ANR-12-FRAL-0013-01 StabEX).

The contribution offered by the literature is analyzed in the social network theory perspective and is reinterpreted in the light of the viable system approach (vSa) as a meta-model useful to highlight variables and processes involved in the interactions among several actors. The systematization of the contributions on the knowledge management facilitates the reading and the understanding of dominant managerial models, and somehow, outlines traits and characteristics of the knowledge society-as construct based on the relationship-that traditional approaches and instruments are often not properly adequate to understand. In this perspective, the paper aims to investigate the possible and potential contribution that university can offer to address the behaviors of local actors toward pathways of knowledge co-creation, able to positively impact on the local economic and social dynamics, in a win-win logic framework. Using a cross disciplinary approach, the paper proposes a conceptual framework able to identify possible influences that university can enforce on the local context in order to improve the social alignment requested to evolve from a transactional to a relational perspective, in which all actors play an active role in the processes of value generation and their needs are effectively satisfied. Proposed reflections are supported by the analysis of some practical observations with reference to the territory of Puglia region in Italy. They highlight the relevance of university as a key actor able to address the local resources to face the challenge of a changeable emerging context.","[Di Nauta, Primiano; Merola, Biagio] Univ Foggia, Dept Econ, Via A Gramsci 89-91, Foggia, Italy; [Caputo, Francesco] Univ Salerno, Dept Management & Informat Technol, Via Giovanni Paolo 2 132, Fisciano, SA, Italy; [Evangelista, Federica] Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, Dept Econ & Law, Via S Angelo, Cassino, FR, Italy",University of Foggia; University of Salerno; University of Cassino,"Caputo, F (通讯作者)，Univ Salerno, Dept Management & Informat Technol, Via Giovanni Paolo 2 132, Fisciano, SA, Italy.",fcaputo@unisa.it,"Di Nauta, Primiano/D-4507-2019; Caputo, Francesco/G-5539-2018; CORREA, RENATA/AAA-2417-2022; Ak, Ilayda/AAN-1228-2020","Caputo, Francesco/0000-0001-9583-7222; DI NAUTA, PRIMIANO/0000-0002-7416-7992",,,,,105,53,55,2,34,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1868-7865,1868-7873,,J KNOWL ECON,J.

It follows that equilibrium is unique and stable in the sense that rising supply implies falling prices. In our setting, there are two goods, which we interpret as consumption in different time periods, and many impatience types. Agents have the same Bernoulli utility function, but the types differ arbitrarily in time preference. Our main result is that if endowments are identical and utility displays nonincreasing absolute risk aversion, then market demand is strictly downward sloping local to equilibrium. We discuss implications for the literature surrounding Diamond and Dybvig (1983). (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This theorem states that when the government gives firms optimal subsidies, welfare is exactly the same before and after privatization. However, we present a seemingly paradoxical result. When a public firm incorrectly assumes that subsidies change the welfare size, privatization is necessarily welfare neutral, whereas when the public firm correctly recognizes that subsidies only bring about income redistribution, without affecting welfare, the situations in which neutrality holds are limited.","[Hamada, Kojun] Niigata Univ, Niigata, Japan",Niigata University,"Hamada, K (通讯作者)，Niigata Univ, Niigata, Japan.",,"Hamada, Kojun/I-9461-2019","Hamada, Kojun/0000-0002-4684-5477","JSPS [16H03612]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K03615, 16H03612] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We would like to thank the co-editor (Shingo Ishiguro) and two anonymous referees for their very helpful comments and suggestions on this paper.
