This article revisits Waring's analysis in the light of continued support of gross domestic product as a useful statistic. It explains the historical and personal context for her analysis, emphasizing postwar patriarchal values as well as Waring's experience as a Member of the New Zealand Parliament (1975-84) and her active engagement with women in developed and developing countries. It illustrates the support If Women Counted gives to reformers and recognizes that change has occurred, including provision for satellite accounts in the United Nations System of National Accounts (UNSNA). Nevertheless, the paper concludes that Waring's profound challenge to the central framework of UNSNA will continue as long as the system excludes unpaid household work and impacts on the natural environment from its core statistics.","[Saunders, Caroline; Dalziel, Paul] Lincoln Univ AERU, POB 85084, Lincoln 7647, New Zealand",,"Saunders, C (通讯作者)，Lincoln Univ AERU, POB 85084, Lincoln 7647, New Zealand.",caroline.saunders@lincoln.ac.nz; paul.dalziel@lincoln.ac.nz,"Dalziel, Paul/S-5888-2018; Saunders, Caroline/E-9227-2018","Dalziel, Paul/0000-0002-1757-6888; Saunders, Caroline/0000-0001-6394-4947",,,,,76,21,21,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

It is rooted in entrepreneurs' expertise and implies a set of principles that guide decision-making processes to be control-oriented as opposed to prediction-oriented. The underlying logic of strategic decision-making is influenced by various forms of uncertainty that entrepreneurs operate within in the process of business model development. The assumption is that the decision-making logic changes as the level or form of uncertainty changes. The main objective of this article is to analyze the degree to which entrepreneurs tend to apply each of the effectuation principles in developing a particular component of the business model. The study is qualitative in nature and it focuses on six case studies depicting micro and small companies operating in two creative industries sectors in Croatia. The data collection included semi-structured, in-depth interviews complemented with a survey and general business information about the companies. The empirical analysis juxtaposes business models of six companies in light of different forms of uncertainty each company operates within, idiosyncrasies of each business model and specific elements of effectuation that entrepreneurs/business owners have embodied into segments of the business model. The results pinpoint the components of the business model that are predominantly shaped by effectual logic in each of the case studies. The paper contributes to the advancement of empirical evidence in research studies connecting business model framework and theory of effectuation, and deepens the understanding of business model development of micro businesses operating in creative industries.","[Stanic, Marina; Koprivnjak, Tihana] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ, Trg Lj Gaja 7, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Stanic, M (通讯作者)，JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ, Trg Lj Gaja 7, Osijek, Croatia.",marina@efos.hr; tihana@efos.hr,"Koprivnjak, Tihana/ABE-5758-2020","Koprivnjak, Tihana/0000-0001-9881-6419",,,,,20,0,0,1,5,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,412,420,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426857700044,0

The paper provides analysis of the respective regulation, its practical application and repercussions. Findings indicate certain inconsistency in the analysed regulation. Regulation requires all the Croatian attorneys to have professional liability insurance in amount not less than therein stipulated. Regulation also asks for mandatory professional liability insurance of the Croatian law firms established as limited liability companies in an amount considerably higher than mandatory minimum amount of the professional liability insurance of an individual attorney. In the current practice, insurance of both a law firm established as a limited liability company and its lawyers has been asked for. Such interpretation of the said regulation causes considerable legal uncertainty. In most cases, it either diminishes one of the main characteristics of the limited liability company under Croatian law i.e. to be a legal subject separate from its founders, or has no legal basis at all. Analysed legal uncertainty presents a system risk for Croatian lawyers, their clients and insurers, demoting competitiveness of the entrepreneurial environment in the Republic of Croatia.

Customs cooperation in the context of the WTO is mainly conducted in three dimensions: the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), customs valuation, and trade facilitation. Article 69 of the TRIPS provides for customs cooperation against trade in goods infringing intellectual property rights, particularly counterfeit trademark goods and pirated copyright goods. Customs cooperation under customs valuation deals with the truth or accuracy of the good's declared value and is mainly inscribed in paragraph 8.3 of the Agreement on the Implementation of GATT Article VII and paragraph 12 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. Article 12 of the Agreement on Trade Facilitation (TFA) sets forth comprehensive rules on customs cooperation.

Learning outcomes improved in primary schools at the bottom of the performance distribution, which narrowed the performance gaps between schools. However, the component had a negative impact on the better performing primary schools. Overall, primary examination scores fell slightly but this effect was only temporary. In contrast, the performance-based component improved examination scores in junior secondary schools. This impact seems to have been greatest among better-performing schools, thus widening the performance gap between these schools and those whose performance was worse. The data suggest that the main impact of the performance-based grant in terms of learning outcomes operated through an increase in competition among schools to earn the performance-based grant rather than through receipt of the actual grant funds.","[Al-Samarrai, Samer; Shrestha, Unika; Hasan, Amer; Santoso, Santoso; Wijoyo, Wisnu Harto Adi] World Bank Grp, Educ Global Practice, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Nakajima, Nozomi] Harvard Univ, Harvard Grad Sch Educ, 13 Appian Way, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",The World Bank; Harvard University,"Hasan, A (通讯作者)，World Bank Grp, Educ Global Practice, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",salsamarrai@worldbank.org; ushrestha@worldbank.org; ahasan1@worldbank.org; nnakajima@g.harvard.edu; bsantoso@worldbank.org; wadiwijoyo@worldbank.org,"Nakajima, Nozomi/IXD-8775-2023","Al-Samarrai, Samer/0000-0002-9381-6492","REACH Trust Fund at the World Bank [TF0A1305, TF072368]",REACH Trust Fund at the World Bank,This work was supported by the REACH Trust Fund (TF0A1305 under TF072368) at the World Bank.

Moreover, competition might itself be an outcome of changes in productivity (e.g. Hoxby, 2003). We provide evidence for the negative effect of the threat of competition on students' test scores in elementary public schools in Poland. The identification strategy uses the introduction of the amendment facilitating the creation of autonomous schools in Poland in 2009 as an external shock to the threat of competition. We focus on the short run in which there is only a limited set of actions available to schools' principals. For the total sample we find no effect, however, for more competitive urban educational markets, we report a drop in test scores in public schools following the increased threat of competition. This negative effect is robust to the existence of autonomous schools prior to the amendment and to the size of public schools. It does not result from a pre-existing or concurrent trend either. We exclude student sorting and adjustments in schools' expenditures as potential channels.","[Bukowski, Pawel] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Ctr Econ Performance, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Kobus, Martyna] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Nowy Swiat 72, PL-00330 Warsaw, Poland",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Economics of the Polish Academy of Sciences,"Bukowski, P (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Ctr Econ Performance, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",p.bukowski@lse.ac.uk; mkobus@inepan.waw.pl,"Morales, Fabián/HNS-0601-2023","Kobus, Martyna Agata/0000-0003-2027-4693; Bukowski, Pawel/0000-0003-3795-6308",Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education under a Mobility Research Award [893/MOB/2012/0]; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education under a Mobility Research Award; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We thank Sascha O.

These neighbours, however, display differences as to the FSC implementation process, with smooth institutionalisation in Belarus and conflicts and closing of the FSC National Office in Poland. Based on the written materials and interviews we explored the governance and legitimacy of FSC decision-making in both countries to assess the impact of the structure of national forest sectors on the perception of FSC as a legitimate certification standard. Our results suggest that the critical difference consisted in the role of the government, which in Belarus championed FSC certification, encouraged all actors to participate and comply with FSC rules, even if those rules required changing national rules or ignoring potential conflicts. The effectiveness of FSC depends solely on the strong support of the government and can collapse if the support is withdrawn. In Poland, the government did not engage, leaving a free hand to the state bureaucracy and a major economic actor managing most of the forests in Poland. Strategic struggles between forestry actors and NGOs reduced the legitimacy of FSC certification. To change the status quo a government intervention might be necessary.","[Niedzialkowski, Krzysztof] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Philosophy & Sociol, Nowy Swiat 72, PL-00330 Warsaw, Poland; [Niedzialkowski, Krzysztof] Polish Acad Sci, Mammal Res Inst, Warsaw, Poland; [Shkaruba, Anton] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Tartu, Estonia; [Shkaruba, Anton] Erda RTE, Rijswijk, Netherlands",Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Philosophy & Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences; Polish Academy of Sciences; Mammal Research Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences; Estonian University of Life Sciences,"Niedzialkowski, K (通讯作者)，Polish Acad Sci, Inst Philosophy & Sociol, Nowy Swiat 72, PL-00330 Warsaw, Poland.",kniedzialkowski@ifispan.waw.pl,"Shkaruba, Anton/ADK-1387-2022; Niedzialkowski, Krzysztof/JQJ-5410-2023","Shkaruba, Anton/0000-0003-2536-2123; Niedzialkowski, Krzysztof/0000-0002-0410-6772",Polish National Science Centre [DEC-2015/16/S/HS6/00125]; Erasmus+ Jean Monnet activity [553575-EPP-1-2014-1-BY-EPPJMO-MODULE]; FSC process in Poland and Belarus,Polish National Science Centre; Erasmus+ Jean Monnet activity; FSC process in Poland and Belarus,"The Polish part of this research was carried out within a post-doctoral fellowship financed by the Polish National Science Centre, based on the decision No. DEC-2015/16/S/HS6/00125.

This was the culmination of a century of struggle to establish the 'right to work', once a key objective of the 19th century labour movement. Deeply resented and long resisted by employer groups, the policy was abandoned in the mid-1970s, without an electoral mandate. Although the Australian Labour Party and union movement urged public vigilance to preserve full employment during 23 years of Liberal rule, after 1978 they quietly dropped the policy as the Australian Labour Party turned increasingly to corporate donors for the money they needed to stay electorally competitive. While few leading lights of today's Labour movement care to discuss it, it is right that Australians celebrate this bold statement of our right to work, and the 30 years of full employment it heralded.","[Quirk, Victor] Univ Newcastle, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Fac Educ & Arts, Callaghan, NSW, Australia; [Quirk, Victor] Univ Newcastle, Ctr Full Employment & Equ, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia",University of Newcastle; University of Newcastle,"Quirk, V (通讯作者)，Univ Newcastle, Ctr Full Employment & Equ, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.;Quirk, V (通讯作者)，Univ Newcastle, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",victor.quirk@newcastle.edu.au,,,,,,,116,1,1,0,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

J,"Siriwat, P; Nijman, V",,,,"Siriwat, Penthai; Nijman, Vincent",,,Online media seizure reports: A tool to monitor CITES implementation in regulating the international rosewood trade,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Rosewoods are a group of timber species exploited and harvested heavily in the region of Southeast Asia predominantly for luxury furniture consumption in China. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of online media seizure reports as a tool to monitor enforcement and CITES implementations of rosewood (hongmu) species using Thailand as a case-study. Three rosewood species are found in the region of Southeast Asia, including, Siamese rosewood (Dalbergia cochinchinensis), Burmese rosewood (D. bariensis), and Burmese paduak (Pterocarpus macrocarpus). We analysed 1895 independent seizure reports from January 2013 to December 2017. Despite Siamese rosewood accounting for the majority, we find that the other two species are also exploited for the same trade purposes through similar channels. The analysis suggests that while the border regions are key seizure activity zones, industrial shipping ports and sea-routes are also used to illegally export timber. The international scope of the trade in terms of unregulated movement of timber and humans poses regional security concerns. Inter-agency cooperation is vital in combatting the trade, both domestically and internationally. Current domestic enforcement is found to not coincide with international regulations such as CITES. The role of CITES in regulating the rosewood trade in Thailand is still not effectively acknowledged. It is imperative for individual countries in the region to strengthen domestic legislation whilst also increasing regional cooperation to effectively acknowledge and enforce CITES regulations. The methods used in this study are novel and can be applied for policy management, offering information in a real-time manner which may otherwise be unavailable for timber species.","[Siriwat, Penthai; Nijman, Vincent] Oxford Brookes Univ, Oxford Wildlife Trade Res Grp, Oxford OX0 1BP, England",Oxford Brookes University,"Siriwat, P (通讯作者)，Oxford Brookes Univ, Oxford Wildlife Trade Res Grp, Oxford OX0 1BP, England.",siriwat.penthai@gmail.com,"Nijman, Vincent/AHD-8685-2022","Nijman, Vincent/0000-0002-5600-4276",,,,,31,8,9,1,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,DEC,2018,97.0,,,,,,67,72,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.09.004,0.0,,,6,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,HE0KP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452955800008,0

We argue that the procurement mode is plausibly exogenous, and show that auctions deliver stronger rail service growth than negotiations. Instrumenting rail service growth with procurement mode, we find that increasing rail service by 10% reduces carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide pollution by around 1% and 2%, respectively. Sulfur dioxide and ozone, pollutants with no clear link to rail, are not affected. Expanding rail service reduces car and motorcycle use, especially on leisure and shopping trips. The effects of railway services on car and motorcycle use and on air pollution build up over time. Lives saved by reducing pollution via rail service growth are worth substantially more than the required subsidies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Using census data from public schools containing detailed longitudinal information since 2010, the starting year of the program, and taking advantage of targeting rules based on dropout and grade repetition rates we fit a fuzzy regression discontinuity design to estimate program impacts. We also fit a difference-in-difference matching model as well as blocking with regressions to estimate the ATT impact of the program, based on observed characteristics used in the targeting process. Overall results indicate no significant impact of the program on test scores, grade repetition nor dropout rates.

The model covers softwood and hardwood markets for sawlogs, energy wood, and industrial wood. Our study region is a mountainous area in Switzerland that is close to the border, and therefore partially depends on the wood markets of the adjacent countries. The wood markets in this study region are characterized by many small-scale wood suppliers, and a mix of private and public owned forests. The model was developed to investigate the availability of wood in the study region under different market conditions. We defined several scenarios that are relevant to policy makers and analyzed them with a focus on the two most important assortments of wood in the study region, namely, sawlogs softwood and energy wood softwood. The development of the prices and amounts sold in the scenarios are compared to a business-as-usual scenario. The scenarios were designed to investigate i) the influence of intermediaries, ii) the influence of the profit-orientation of forest owners, iii) the influence of the exchange rate, and iv) the consequences of set-asides in the study region. The presented model has a large potential to support the planning of policy measures as it allows capturing emergent phenomena, and thereby facilitates identifying potential consequences of policy measures planned prior to their implementation. This was demonstrated by discussing the scenario findings with respect to Switzerland's forestry policy objective of increasing the harvested amount of wood to the sustainable potential. We showed that a higher profit-orientation of forest owners would be beneficial for this objective, but also revealed potential conflicts of different economic goals.","[Holm, Stefan; Thees, Oliver; Lemm, Renato; Olschewski, Roland] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Holm, Stefan; Hilty, Lorenz M.] Univ Zurich, Dept Informat, Binzmuhlestr 14, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland; [Hilty, Lorenz M.] Swiss Fed Labs Mat Sci & Technol, Empa, Lerchenfeldstr 5, CH-9014 St Gallen, Switzerland","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; University of Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science & Technology (EMPA)","Holm, S (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.;Holm, S (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Dept Informat, Binzmuhlestr 14, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland.",stefan.holm@wsl.ch; oliver.thees@wsl.ch; renato.lemm@wsl.ch; roland.olschewski@wsl.ch; hilty@ifi.uzh.ch,,"Hilty, Lorenz Manuel/0000-0001-5020-0586; Holm, Stefan/0000-0001-8104-896X","Swiss National Science Foundation [406640-142933, NRP 66]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [406640_142933] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)",Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"This work is part of the project titled An economic analysis of Swiss wood markets, which is funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation [project number: 406640-142933] through its National Research Program Resource Wood (NRP 66).",,36,7,9,0,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,OCT,2018,95.0,,,,,,26,36,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.07.005,0.0,,,11,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GT2VC,,"Green Published, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000444357400005,0

The main results suggest that youth unemployment is more pronounced in countries with poor GDP growth, a low share of construction activity and high public debt.

Wine politics show us that within market economies we find the same political movements. Markets, like politics, consist of institutions that differentially embed, codify and distribute power. In the case of France, small, individually weak wine producers became powerful in the aggregate; unified French grape growers came together to force a deal with the economically dominant wine merchants. Their joint political power was institutionalized in power-sharing, state-backed corporatist producer organizations. In contrast, small Italian producers failed to cooperate systematically and aggregate their power.

Emissions tax systems are relatively straightforward, cost effective and can generate revenues used to offset other distortionary taxes. Moreover, recent theoretical research (Weitzman, 2014) has demonstrated that under some conditions the globally efficient tax rate can be implemented through a majority voting rule. We extend this area of research by examining a uniform emissions tax system in the framework of an international environmental agreement in which only countries that voluntarily participate are subject to the tax. We show that in the simplest situation in which countries have identical marginal benefit and cost functions, the largest stable agreement consists of two countries and the tax system has little impact on abatement levels. Our analysis highlights that by ignoring the participation decision and assuming commitment by all parties, the efficiency gains from a uniform emissions tax system are overstated.

This study evaluated the cost-utility and cost-effectiveness of Onco-Move and OnTrack. A total of 230 patients were randomized to Onco-Move, OnTrack, or usual care (UC). Health outcomes included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), general and physical fatigue, and physical fitness measured at baseline, end of chemotherapy, and 6-month follow-up. Societal costs included professional and informal health care, work absenteeism, and unpaid productivity costs. Cost data were based on 3-monthly questionnaires, supplemented by medication data obtained from pharmacies. Onco-Move is not likely to be cost-effective due to the relatively high willingness-to-pay necessary to reach reasonable probabilities of cost-effectiveness (QALY, general and physical fatigue). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for OnTrack compared to UC were a,notsign26,916/QALY, a,notsign788/1-point decrease in general fatigue and a,notsign1402/1-point decrease in physical fatigue. The probability of OnTrack being cost-effective ranged from 31% at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of a,notsign0-79% at a WTP of a,notsign80,000/QALY, 97% at a WTP of a,notsign15,000/1-point decrease in general fatigue, and 86% at a WTP of a,notsign24,000/1-point decrease in physical fatigue. Both interventions had a low probability of being cost-effective for physical fitness. The probability of cost-effectiveness for both interventions was greater among compliant participants. Onco-Move is not likely to be cost-effective. Depending on the decision-makers' willingness-to-pay, OnTrack could be considered cost-effective in comparison with UC.

Employment correlates positively with local labor market diversity, but negatively with neighborhood diversity. Using several approaches to deal with the endogeneity of local labor market diversity, we do not find any robust evidence of a causal impact of diversity on employment at this rather aggregate level, suggesting that immigrants actually tend to self-select into more economically dynamic areas. However, taking advantage of the very precise localization of the data in order to correct biases related to residential sorting, we confirm a negative effect of neighborhood diversity.

Many supply- and demand-side factors in sub-Saharan Africa could cause smaller than expected epidemiological effects of this at-scale drug provision. We provide what appears to be the first quasi-experimental evidence on the effect of at-scale drug provision in a poor country, using the phased rollout of ART in Zambia, a setting where approximately one in six adults are HIV positive. Combining anthropometric data from national household surveys and a spatially based triple-difference specification, we find that local ART introduction increased the weight of high HIV likelihood adult women. This finding from a clinically difficult setting suggests that the generalized challenges of scalability of ART for adult health in sub-Saharan Africa are surmountable.","[Lucas, Adrienne M.] Univ Delaware, Dept Econ, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Lucas, Adrienne M.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Wilson, Nicholas L.] Reed Coll, Dept Econ, Portland, OR 97202 USA; [Wilson, Nicholas L.] Off Evaluat Sci, Portland, OR 97202 USA",University of Delaware; National Bureau of Economic Research; Reed College - Oregon,"Wilson, NL (通讯作者)，Reed Coll, Dept Econ, Portland, OR 97202 USA.;Wilson, NL (通讯作者)，Off Evaluat Sci, Portland, OR 97202 USA.",nwilson@reed.edu,,,NBER Africa,NBER Africa,"The NBER Africa Project provided generous financial and institutional support.

EQ-5D and ASCOT are useful for examining cost-effectiveness within the health and social care sectors, respectively, but there is a policy need to understand overall benefits and compare across sectors to assess relative value for money. Standard statistical mapping is unsuitable since it relies on conceptual overlap of the measures but EQ-5D and ASCOT have different conceptualisations of quality of life. We use a preference-based mapping approach to estimate the exchange rate using common TTO valuations for both measures. A sample of health states from each measure was valued using TTO by 200 members of the UK adult general population. Regression analyses are used to generate separate equations between EQ-5D-3L and ASCOT values using their original value set and TTO values elicited here. These are solved as simultaneous equations to estimate the relationship between EQ-5D-3L and ASCOT. The relationship for moving from ASCOT to EQ-5D-3L is a linear transformation with an intercept of -0.0488 and gradient of 0.978. This enables QALY gains generated by ASCOT and EQ-5D to be compared across different interventions. This paper estimated an exchange rate between ASCOT and EQ-5D-3L using a preference-based mapping approach that does not compromise the descriptive systems of the two measures. This contributes to the development of preference-based mapping through the use of TTO as the common metric used to estimate the exchange rate between measures.","[Stevens, Katherine; Brazier, John; Rowen, Donna] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Rowen, D (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",d.rowen@Sheffield.ac.uk,"Stevens, Katherine J/E-4679-2010; brazier, john e/B-1936-2008","Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780",Policy Research Programme in the Department of Health; Department of Health Policy Research Programme,Policy Research Programme in the Department of Health; Department of Health Policy Research Programme,"We would like to acknowledge all the participants who took part in the valuation interviews.

The effects of forestry on mercury in aquatic ecosystems,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,METHYLMERCURY EXPOSURE; METHYL-MERCURY; RISK; MITIGATION; POLLUTION; SCIENCE; WATERS; IMPACT,"In all Swedish lakes, the concentration of mercury (Hg) in fish exceeds the European Union threshold limit. While the ultimate source of Hg is primarily airborne emissions from fossil energy, forestry plays a small but important role because some forestry operations help mobilize and transform Hg, increasing Hg loads in downstream aquatic ecosystems. Simultaneously, climate change is placing additional demands on forests to provide biomass as a substitute for fossil fuel. Thus, decision-makers are facing a complex situation, a wicked problem, when it comes to how to handle the problem of forestry's effects on Hg in aquatic ecosystems while at the same time securing other ecosystem services. In order to explore forestry's degree of responsibility as well as possible solutions to this problem in Sweden, a transdisciplinary method has been used consisting of a structured dialogue with actors from relevant governmental agencies, forest companies, and forest associations. The analysis shows that while the issue can be addressed constructively, the complex character of the problem requires consideration of not only management practices for forestry but also current regulatory goals and environmental objectives. The Hg problem represents a class of difficult issues for forestry where stand- or property-based production has an impact on a greater spatial scale. This means that regulating the more direct impacts of forestry needs to be weighed against the implications this regulation may have on the overall issue of ecosystem services.","[Lidskog, Rolf] Orebro Univ, Environm Sociol Sect, SE-70182 Orebro, Sweden; [Bishop, Kevin; Eklof, Karin; Akerblom, Staffan] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquat Sci & Assessment, Box 7050, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Ring, Eva] Forestry Res Inst Sweden Skogforsk, Uppsala Sci Pk, SE-75183 Uppsala, Sweden; [Sandstrom, Camilla] Umea Univ, Dept Polit Sci, SE-90182 Umea, Sweden",Orebro University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Skogforsk; Umea University,"Lidskog, R (通讯作者)，Orebro Univ, Environm Sociol Sect, SE-70182 Orebro, Sweden.",rolf.lidskog@oru.se; kevin.bishop@slu.se; Karin.Eklof@slu.se; eva.ring@skogforsk.se; staffan.akerblom@slu.se; camilla.sandstrom@umu.se,"Ring, Eva/AAD-7412-2022; Lidskog, Rolf/AAV-2816-2021; Bishop, Kevin H/C-7816-2012; Ring, Eva/AAE-5439-2020; Sandström, Camilla/JHT-1664-2023; Åkerblom, Staffan/L-5421-2018","Ring, Eva/0000-0002-8962-9811; Lidskog, Rolf/0000-0001-6735-0011; Bishop, Kevin H/0000-0002-8057-1051; Sandström, Camilla/0000-0002-7674-6197; Åkerblom, Staffan/0000-0001-7607-9518",MISTRA (The Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research); Forestry Research Institute of Sweden (Skogforsk); Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU); Umea University,MISTRA (The Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research); Forestry Research Institute of Sweden (Skogforsk); Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU); Umea University,"This paper was written as part of the Swedish interdisciplinary program Future Forests, which is financed by MISTRA (The Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research), the Forestry Research Institute of Sweden (Skogforsk), the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), and Umea University.",,37,8,9,0,21,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,MAY,2018,90.0,,,,,,90,96,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.02.001,0.0,,,7,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GD8MK,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430766300011,0

The collective principles of forest producer organizations allow them to potentially provide formal and informal social protection benefits to their members in forest dependent communities. We review the literature to understand and document the role and practices of forest producer organizations in providing social protection. Our review finds that most of the social protection benefits provided by forest producer organizations are in the form of social insurance, informal insurance through pooled funds and social services in the community. However, there is limited evidence of the effectiveness or socio-economic impact of the social protection benefits provided by forest producer organizations. In addition, studies do not provide comprehensive information on design elements such as benefit levels, scope and duration. Our review also identifies a broad range of factors that enable or hinder the provision of social protection benefits and discusses the opportunities for strengthening and supporting the provision of social protection by forest producer organizations. The review's findings suggest that forest producer organizations can potentially contribute to the expansion of social protection coverage among the rural poor in line with the targets of the sustainable development goal (SDG) 1.","[Tirivayi, Nyasha; Nennen, Louise; Tesfaye, Wondimagegn] United Nations Univ UNU MERIT, Boschstr 24, NL-6211 AX Maastricht, Netherlands; [Ma, Qiang] Food & Agr Org United Nations, Rome, Italy",Maastricht University; Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),"Tirivayi, N (通讯作者)，United Nations Univ UNU MERIT, Boschstr 24, NL-6211 AX Maastricht, Netherlands.",tirivayi@merit.unu.edu,,"Tesfaye, Wondimagegn/0000-0001-9968-4593",,,,,67,8,8,1,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,MAY,2018,90.0,,,,,,106,114,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.01.010,0.0,,,9,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GD8MK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430766300013,0

To identify the causal effect we compare the educational attainment of siblings at age 21, exploiting the fact that they typically migrate at different ages within a given family. We consider several education outcomes conditional on family fixed effects. We take advantage of long running and detailed data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, which entails an oversample of immigrants and provides information on language skills. We find significant effects of age at migration on educational attainment and a critical age of migration not above age 6. The educational attainment of female immigrants responds more strongly to a high age at immigration than that of males. While language skills affect educational attainment they do not appear to fully explain the causal connection between age at migration and educational attainment.","[Lemmermann, Dominique; Riphahn, Regina T.] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Lange Gasse 20, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Riphahn, RT (通讯作者)，Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Lange Gasse 20, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany.",regina.riphahn@fau.de,,,,,,,33,18,19,1,14,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,1873-7382,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

This economic modeling study evaluated different preventive interventions for 30-year-old women with a confirmed BRCA (1 or 2) mutation. A Markov model was developed to estimate the costs and benefits [i.e., quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and life years gained (LYG)] associated with prophylactic bilateral mastectomy (BM), prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), BM plus BSO, BM plus BSO at age 40, and intensified surveillance. Relevant input data was obtained from a large German database including 5902 women with BRCA 1 or 2, and from the literature. The analysis was performed from the German Statutory Health Insurance (SHI) perspective. In order to assess the robustness of the results, deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. With costs of a,notsign29,434 and a gain in QALYs of 17.7 (LYG 19.9), BM plus BSO at age 30 was less expensive and more effective than the other strategies, followed by BM plus BSO at age 40. Women who were offered the surveillance strategy had the highest costs at the lowest gain in QALYs/LYS. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the probability of cost-saving was 57% for BM plus BSO. At a WTP of 10,000 a,notsign per QALY, the probability of the intervention being cost-effective was 80%. From the SHI perspective, undergoing BM plus immediate BSO should be recommended to BRCA 1 or 2 mutation carriers due to its favorable comparative cost-effectiveness.","[Mueller, Dirk; Danner, Marion; Borsi, Lisa; Stock, Stephanie] Univ Hosp Cologne AoR, Inst Hlth Econ & Clin Epidemiol, Gleueler Str 176-178, D-50935 Cologne, Germany; [Rhiem, Kerstin; Schmutzler, Rita] Univ Hosp Cologne AoR, Ctr Hereditary Breast & Ovarian Canc, Kerpener Str 34, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Stollenwerk, Bjoern] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Res Ctr Environm Hlth, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Ingolstadter Landstr 1, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany; [Engel, Christoph] Univ Leipzig, IMISE, Hartelstr 16-18, D-04107 Leipzig, Germany; [Rasche, Linda] Univ Hosp Cologne AoR, Dept Controlling, Kerpener Str 62, D-50937 Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne; University of Cologne; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; Leipzig University; University of Cologne,"Müller, D (通讯作者)，Univ Hosp Cologne AoR, Inst Hlth Econ & Clin Epidemiol, Gleueler Str 176-178, D-50935 Cologne, Germany.",dirk.mueller@uk-koeln.de; marion.danner@uk-koeln.de; kerstin.rhiem@uk-koeln.de; bjoern.stollenwerk@helmholtz-muenchen.de; christoph.engel@imise.uni-leipzig.de; linda.rasche@uk-koeln.de; borsilisa@yahoo.de; rita.schmutzler@uk-koeln.de; stephanie.stock@uk-koeln.de,"Stollenwerk, Björn/G-5408-2013","Borsi, Lisa/0000-0002-4656-0869; Engel, Christoph/0000-0002-7247-282X; Muller, Dirk/0000-0002-5576-0192; Stollenwerk, Bjorn/0000-0002-3189-409X",Federal Ministry of Education and Research [NKP-332-019],Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),The More- Risk Study was funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research'' (NKP-332-019).,,44,26,25,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

These Grand Designs proved to be misleading and even became obstacles in adapting to a world that is polycentric in design and increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous in nature. Ideological myopia was not the only factor that delayed a timely adaptation to a changing geopolitical environment; bureaucratic obstacles and psychological factors also came into play. This was the backdrop for what in Europe was perceived as strategic surprises (Arabellion, Ukraine/Crimean, Syria, IS) or as disruptive political developments (Brexit, US Presidential election). Addressing Europe's five most important partner regions (Russia/Ukraine, MENA, Turkey, USA, China), the Dahrendorf Foresight Process was initiated as a pilot project to improve the EU's foresight capabilities. It applied a four-step methodological approach to question current strategic thinking and to develop narratives of alternatively plausible futures in the EU's relationship with these regions. In stressing the importance of an early warning (indicator-based) system to make strategic foresight applicable for day-to-day politics and administrative processes, reference is being made to the 'Global Trends 2030' report of the US National Intelligence Committee (NIC).","[Bumws, Mathew J.] Atlantic Council, Strateg Foresight Initiat, 1030 15th St NW,12th Floor, Washington, DC 20005 USA; [Gnad, Oliver] Bur Current Affairs, Gustav Freytag Str 5, D-10827 Berlin, Germany",,"Gnad, O (通讯作者)，Bur Current Affairs, Gustav Freytag Str 5, D-10827 Berlin, Germany.",MBurrows@AtlanticCouncil.org; og@bureau-fz.eu,,,,,,,39,5,7,0,25,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,MAR,2018,97.0,,,,SI,,6,17,,10.1016/j.futures.2017.06.002,0.0,,,12,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,GA7AD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428485900002,0

The framework can be used to validate cost-effectiveness endpoints generated from routine data sources when comparable data is available directly from trial case report forms or from another source. We illustrate application of the framework using data from a recent trial-based economic evaluation of the probiotic Bifidobacterium breve strain BBG administered to babies less than 31 weeks of gestation. Cost-effectiveness endpoints are compared using two sources of information; trial case report forms and data extracted from the National Neonatal Research Database (NNRD), a clinical database created through collaborative efforts of UK neonatal services. Focusing on mean incremental net benefits at A 30,000 pound per episode of sepsis averted, the study revealed no evidence of discrepancy between the data sources (two-sided p values > 0.4), low probability estimates of miscoverage (ranging from 0.039 to 0.060) and concordance correlation coefficients greater than 0.86. We conclude that the NNRD could potentially serve as a reliable source of data for future trial-based economic evaluations of neonatal interventions. We also discuss the potential implications of increasing opportunity to utilize routinely available data for the conduct of trial-based economic evaluations.","[Achana, Felix; Petrou, Stavros; Khan, Kamran] Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Clin Trials Unit, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Gaye, Amadou] NHGRI, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Modi, Neena] Imperial Coll, Dept Med, Sect Neonatal Med, Chelsea & Westminister Hosp Campus, London SW10 9NH, England",University of Warwick; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI); Imperial College London,"Achana, F (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Clin Trials Unit, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",f.achana@warwick.ac.uk,"Khan, Kamran/JFJ-9362-2023; Petrou, Stavros/ABD-8323-2021","Petrou, Stavros/0000-0003-3121-6050; Majeed, Azeem/0000-0002-2357-9858; Khan, Kamran/0000-0002-4322-9695; Gaye, Amadou/0000-0002-1180-2792","National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) under its Programme Grants for Applied Research Programme [RP-PG-0707-10010]; MRC [G0501681, G0700452] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [1499410] Funding Source: researchfish; Medical Research Council [G0700452, G0501681] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institute for Health Research [RP-PG-0707-10010, NF-SI-0616-10103] Funding Source: researchfish",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) under its Programme Grants for Applied Research Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"This paper presents independent research funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) under its Programme Grants for Applied Research Programme (RP-PG-0707-10010).

Thanks to coopetition by means of networks, partnerships with several stakeholders, pooling of resources and project leadership, the Private Welfare State of Italian Foundations of banking origin (IFBOs) will be clustered for 2012s performances. Economic performances concern financial assets, which affect solvency, gains and philanthropy. According to reports coopetition is estimated for intensification from pure grant-making and resource pooling to partnerships. Six profiles are significant. When investments are modest, these foundations are profitable and solvent, though coopetition is not optimized. Increasing investments are combined with increasing philanthropy and coopetition. The article concludes that profiles experience a different intensity of coopetition.

However, this machinery that has been successfully engaged in a huge transitive work seems to apparently lose the natural inclination towards reflexivity and introspection and thus appears to miss the big picture. Although biological evolution paradigms were fruitfully inspirational for artificial evolution theories and a massive part of CI appears to have bio-mimetic roots, it is no less true that biologists and computer scientists produce two parallel series of research and literature. The aim of this paper is to provide more insight into how computational paradigms drawn their inspiration from evolutionary biology. Intelligent adaptive systems, as artifacts designed by humans, can be largely seen as an effort of mimicking intelligent biological behaviors that were shaped, developed, adapted and tuned by natural evolution, learning mechanisms or enculturation. The latter concept is supported by the new field of memetics that promotes an evolutionary vision of culture, studying the replication, spread and evolution of memes, as cultural replicators. The main focus is on describing these mechanisms and the ways of applying them to designing and tuning intelligent adaptive systems. The approach based on memetic algorithms is finally benchmarked against a similar approach based on genetic algorithms, for tasks in machine learning such as evolving type-2 fuzzy inference systems.","[Georgescu, Vasile] Univ Craiova, Craiova, Romania",University of Craiova,"Georgescu, V (通讯作者)，Univ Craiova, Craiova, Romania.",vasile.georgescu@feaa.ucv.ro,"Georgescu, Vasile/AAE-7661-2021",,,,,,25,0,0,0,10,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Thus, the society of the future means technology, unlimited possibilities of unknown connections and challenges. All these opportunities are, however, associated with risks, threats and vulnerabilities. The Internet, as a tool, has significantly contributed to the technological and scientific progress of mankind. The multitude of opportunities it offers and easy access to every citizen, with the lack of a unitary legislative framework at an international level, effective and concrete control over the development of some applications. This confrontation does not always have the desired result, and the relatively controlled development and use of it is very difficult to achieve, especially for state actors. The virtual world thus gains ground through addiction, the cyberspace becoming the quirk that aligns the successes and failures of mankind, the pattern of future battles that can reconfigure the map of the world, the easel on which our deep emotions are outlined. It is a mirror of society and the place where predictions on the future can be sold. Cyberspace has no borders. It is globalization in its purest form, it is a new paradigm of modernity. It is the opening of man to man at every level. Risk is a constant component of technological, social and economic development, but knowing the limits in which it can manifest, through its anticipation and action can diminish its negative effects. In front of the cyber-attacks, everything becomes vulnerable - from the critical infrastructure of a country to the security of each individual. The product effect is chained, each vulnerability creating prerequisites for exponential growth of associated risk and affecting security from an individual level to a global level. The virtual world is already the world of tomorrow. How will we identify the the opportunities and manage the benefits? And how will we reduce the associated risks, current and future threats? What are the solutions? These are the questions we will be trying to answer through our study.

Workfulness is a management program aimed at technology-intensive companies that rely strongly on digital media. The program encompasses strategies of disconnection for employees, including mobile and email-free work hours and technology-free meetings, in order to enhance focus and efficiency. This article investigates Workfulness as one prominent example of managerial approaches that are based on neuroscientific assumptions about human decision-making. Drawing on textual materials and interviews, the analysis shows that Workfulness manages digital distractions in the workplace by establishing a form of stimulus-control rather than appealing to rational self-control. Workfulness alludes to the necessity of making choices, but it considers unconscious behavior, which is explained with reference to preconscious workings of the brain. The human brain becomes a battleground between rational and impulsive decisions, and it is the disobedient brain that needs to be governed in order to become an efficient employee. We situate the Workfulness program as part of and at the same time extending the biopolitical economy by incorporating advances in neurosciences into modes of governance.","[Guyard, Carina; Kaun, Anne] Sodertorn Univ, Media & Commun Studies, Alfred Nobels Alle 15, S-14189 Huddinge, Sweden",Sodertorn University,"Kaun, A (通讯作者)，Sodertorn Univ, Media & Commun Studies, Alfred Nobels Alle 15, S-14189 Huddinge, Sweden.",anne.kaun@sh.se,,"Kaun, Anne/0000-0002-5879-2130",,,,,67,20,20,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

Car sharing, house-sharing, equipment-sharing are all instruments of the sharing/network and collaborative economy, which has started to gain academic and practice traction, but all this would not have been possible unless for the existence of the Internet. The Internet is constantly empowering consumers all over the world by making them more knowledgeable and granting them access to make more informed decisions. The second part of the paper uses qualitative research and is dedicated to a case study that analyses Pony Car Sharing company, in the context of sharing and knowledge economy, from the business model canvas perspective: key partners, key activities, value proposition, customer relationship, channels, customer segments, revenue streams and costs. The findings reveal that there is no legislative support for the sharing economy and that implementing such a business model requires substantial efforts from the business owner. Nevertheless, investments in educating the customers are not expendable.","[Hadad, Shahrazad] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 2-2A Calea Grivitei,Sect 3, Bucharest 010731, Romania; [Hadad, Shahrazad] Acad Romanian Scientists, 5 Splaiul Independentei, Bucharest 05009, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Academy of Romanian Scientists (AOSR),"Hadad, S (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 2-2A Calea Grivitei,Sect 3, Bucharest 010731, Romania.;Hadad, S (通讯作者)，Acad Romanian Scientists, 5 Splaiul Independentei, Bucharest 05009, Romania.",shahrazad.hadad@fabiz.ase.ro,"Hadad, Shahrazad/U-4289-2017",,Academy of Romanian Scientists [15/2018],Academy of Romanian Scientists,"The present paper has been financially supported by the Academy of Romanian Scientists, Program No. 15/2018 Strategies for Implementing Knowledge Economy in Romania.",,39,0,0,0,2,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,673,682,,,,,,10,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200059,0

However, the lack of a sufficiently clear definition for 'standards' causes regulatory uncertainty. This article considers the concept 'standard' from a developmental perspective; it specifically explores the textual evolution of its meaning during negotiations of the GATT/WTO TBT Agreements. Its main findings suggest that, since its initial incorporation in a draft text of the GATT, the term has been substantially modified throughout negotiations, particularly through the process of ECE/ISO harmonization during the Tokyo Round. There is also consistent evidence that the concept has developed to be considerably TBT-specific, albeit increasingly departed from the concept 'technical regulation'.","[Kim, Minjung] Seoul Natl Univ, Ctr Int Commerce & Strategy, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Kim, M (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Ctr Int Commerce & Strategy, Seoul, South Korea.",mjk@snu.ac.kr,,,,,,,12,3,3,0,9,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

This study was conducted using the method estimating the level of natural unemployment (equilibrium unemployment) proposed by the Centre for Economic Policy Research (1995). The analysis was based on individual, unweighted, quarterly raw data provided by the Polish LFS (BAEL) from the years 2002-2009 and 2016. The professional situation of the rural population in the analysed period improved, which was manifested in an increase in the employment rate and a reduction of the actual unemployment rate. Between the periods of 2002-2005 and 2006-2009 actual unemployment 'followed' the lower values of equilibrium unemployment. In 2016 the actual unemployment rate was lower than in previous periods; however, an adverse change was observed for its relation to the natural unemployment rate. If we assume that it will - as previously - strive to attain the equilibrium level, in the case of a downturn on the market for goods and services the actual unemployment among the rural population may considerably increase, particularly in the group of individuals whose main source of income is provided by unemployment benefits and the family farm.","[Kolodziejczak, Wtodzimierz] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Life Sciences,"Kolodziejczak, W (通讯作者)，Wojska Polskiego 28, PL-60637 Poznan, Poland.",kolodziejczak@up.poznan.pl,"Kołodziejczak, Włodzimierz/ABE-9463-2020","Kołodziejczak, Włodzimierz/0000-0001-7315-6717",National Science Centre [DEC-2017/01/X/HS4/00565],"National Science Centre(National Science Centre, Poland)","The paper is funded by the National Science Centre within the MINIATURA research project NCN DEC-2017/01/X/HS4/00565, entitled 'Determinants of Economic Activity of the Rural Population in Poland.

The multinational firm's incentives to serve the foreign country through FDI are mitigated in the average consumer's valuation for CSR in the responsible firm's country implying that CSR investments by local firms give space for inward FDI by low-cost multinationals targeting consumers without environmental and social responsibility consciousness.

The European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) announced the Gender Equality Index for the year of 2012 for the EU 28 countries, which was only 52.9 out of 100. Persisting inequality between women and men deepens the social economic inequality of the society and serves for the development of such negative trends as persisting pay gap and society polarization, which lead to diminishing middle class and growing gap between the rich and the poor. Due to prevailing stereotypes of gender roles, the group of women is constantly facing bigger social economic challenges caused by, firstly, stereotypical choice of education/profession, secondly, vertical and horizontal segregation of labor market and thirdly, less income, which in the long term forms less old age pensions for women. This research aims to analyze what is the influence of gender inequality to society's social economic inequality and to explore the different positions of women and men in the fields of income, material deprivation, vulnerability and resilience as well as to suggest recommendations for the reduction of gender inequality as inseparable part of social economic inequality and for the effective use of women's labor force as one of the hidden potentials for economic growth. The background of this research is theoretical framework and empirical evidence based on a sociological survey methodology (questionnaire). It is found that position of Lithuanian women is worse than men and requires special measures to be taken in the fields of income, material deprivation, vulnerability reduction and other spheres.","[Krinickiene, Egle] Mykolas Romeris Univ, Fac Econ & Business, Vilnius, Lithuania",Mykolas Romeris University,"Krinickiene, E (通讯作者)，Mykolas Romeris Univ, Fac Econ & Business, Vilnius, Lithuania.",eglekrinickiene@mruni.eu,,,Research Council of Lithuania [GER-009/2015],Research Council of Lithuania(Research Council of Lithuania (LMTLT)),This research is funded by the Research Council of Lithuania (No. GER-009/2015).,,25,0,0,1,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-67916-7; 978-3-319-67915-0,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,471,484,,10.1007/978-3-319-67916-7_31,0.0,,,14,Area Studies; Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL4TI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450786500031,0

More than any other case, this trade dispute exposed the underlying challenges to advancing the Doha Development Agenda. This article explores US compliance with the Dispute Settlement Body's successive rulings from 2005 to 2009 by examining executive compliance efforts in the face of congressional foot dragging, and how such efforts shaped the evolution of this trade conflict and framed its resolution in October of 2014. The examination confirms the pivotal role that congress played in preventing full compliance, but also reveals the importance of executive administrative discretion, legislative advocacy, and trade policy orientation in determining the outcome of the cotton dispute and its eventual impact upon US global trade liberalization leadership, including the US government's strategic withdrawal from the Doha round.","[Langevin, Mark S.] George Washington Univ, Elliott Sch Int Affairs, Washington, DC 20052 USA",George Washington University,"Langevin, MS (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Elliott Sch Int Affairs, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",mark@brazilworks.net,,,,,,,54,1,1,0,0,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The family subsidy system consists of three parts: the content system, the structure system, and the hierarchy. The western countries' family subsidy system was established in the 1940s. Its development has gone through the process of improving the content system, gradually building the structure system, and then designing the hierarchy system. The development of the family subsidy system in western countries shows that the establishment of the family subsidy system is the policy choice for ensuring children's rights.

However, there are also controversies over the theory. One of the reasons behind these controversies is that Herzberg didn't conduct further analysis of the essence of the theory when putting it forward. Herzberg divides the factors affecting the employees' job satisfaction into incentive factors which are related to the work itself and hygiene factors which are mainly relevant to the working environment. He believes that what motivate the employees can only be incentive factors, and hygiene factors merely eliminate the employees' dissatisfaction. This paper carries out an in-depth analysis of the essence of Herzberg's two-factor incentive theory and finds that the degree of the employees' subjective initiative is obviously different when it comes to these two kinds of factors, and the division of incentive factors and hygiene factors is essentially the division of the different areas in which the employees exert their subjective initiative. The research result shows that the source of the motivation lies not in certain fixed factors but in how much subjective initiative the employees can exert in these factors. If the organization managers really want to motivate the employees, they should provide adequate conditions for the employees to exert their subjective initiative completely.","[Li, Yao-kui] Taishan Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Tai An, Shandong, Peoples R China",Taishan University,"Li, YK (通讯作者)，Taishan Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Tai An, Shandong, Peoples R China.",,"liu, xinyu/IWD-6630-2023",,,,,,8,0,2,6,20,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-642-6,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2018,290.0,,,,,,321,324,,,,,,4,Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BM5QX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000465421000081,0

They include social network sites, online content management systems, streaming media platforms, mobile communication infrastructures, supply chain logistics solutions, and cryptocurrencies. Analysis of platforms and their capitalization should take into account the ways they structure social practice as assets and the constitutive opacity of platforms as configured realities. It explores capitalization by focusing on the problems of counting people and things on platforms. Via a case study of the software repository platform [Github. com] (https://github. com), it analyzes how 'platform numbers' participate in capitalization. It describes attempts to enumerate the elements of the platform by counting, mapping or listing them. The paper shows how attempts to enumerate people and things encounter forms of association, duplication, combination, imitation and configuration that are crucial to the ensemble but remain refractory to capitalization. It proposes configurative enumeration of the platform numbers as a way of conceptualizing these un-enacted excesses. In a configurative enumeration, the composition, the rhythms of imitation, variation and commutation, and constant relating, repairing and adjusting of configurations crucial to the ongoing formation of platforms come into view. Configurative enumerations engage the inventive realities of platformization, realities that precede and sometimes overflow their capitalization.","[Mackenzie, Adrian] Univ Lancaster, Dept Sociol, Lancaster, England",Lancaster University,"Mackenzie, A (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Dept Sociol, Lancaster, England.",a.mackenzie@lancaster.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K007912/1]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K007912/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K007912/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K007912/1] for the project 'Metacommuniities of Code'.,,66,16,19,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

Since then the policy had retained its original intention of reorienting Russia's economy towards East Asia, drawing it away in relative terms from Russia's traditional economic partners in Europe. To some extent Russia was even successful in achieving the policy's goal. However, the crisis caused by economic sanctions and the fall of oil prices in 2014 had caused a reformulation of both the role of East Asia in Russia's foreign economic relations and the practical approaches Russia employs to achieve the new Eastern policy's goal. This goal was effectively merged with that of developing the Russian Far East, which became seen as Russia's platform for integration with East Asia. The approaches to the development of the Far East have also been affected by the shortage of public funds for meaningful development programs which necessitated a shift to a creative institutional approach to regional development.

Finding the right balance of delivered value, development costs and market constraints is often a trial and error process. We propose a conceptual framework for framing innovation in a competitive landscape by addressing a key point that is crucial to coherent, effective and efficient innovation: the notion of Neglected Value. Neglected Value is the main driver of market adoption for segments that are currently not well-served by mainstream products. Identifying the Neglected Value for a given market segment, allows entrepreneurs to focus on the relevant value and thus minimize the waste (and cost) of irrelevant value. Delivering the neglected value must be done respecting the constraints, which if overlooked would jeopardize any possibility to penetrate the market. The Neglected Value is the essential component of the Innovation Canvas, a tool for designing innovation, which can be used both as an educational and a decision-making tool. This paper outlines the underlining of the Innovation Canvas and provides two business cases where the canvas can be applied. Moreover, the paper discusses a methodology for business development that is currently used in a university start-up pre-incubator.","[Pallotta, Vincenzo; Campisi, David] Univ Appl Sci Western Switzerland HES SO, 14 2800 Route Moutier, Delemont, Switzerland",University of Applied Sciences & Arts Western Switzerland,"Pallotta, V (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci Western Switzerland HES SO, 14 2800 Route Moutier, Delemont, Switzerland.",Vincenzo.Pallotta@heig-vd.ch; David.Campisi@heig-vd.ch,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,6,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,757,769,,,,,,13,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200066,0

ASEAN member states, as well as China, Japan, and South Korea, are increasingly involved in the processes of market-driven regionalization, and to some extent in regionalism. A regional economic integration usually requires meeting three basic conditions: an economic structures complementarity, a favorable policy, and a well-developed infrastructure. Thus, improvements in the physical infrastructure connectivity are of key importance for a more advanced integration in East Asia. Without good connectivity, the diversity that exists in East Asia will bring disparity instead of prosperity. Physical connectivity (infrastructure) is crucial in supporting the complementarities in production processes across the region, especially under conditions of highly developed regional production networks in East Asia. The main purpose of the article is to describe and analyze selected infrastructure developments in East Asia and to identify the most significant challenges in the field.

Indeed, one can argue that olive, and olive oil, were as critical as they shaped a form of culture, a seminal pillar that supported the Mediterranean civilisations and that has since then spread worldwide, influencing others. Taking into consideration this framework, the research presented in this paper is focused on the examination of the main trends on olive and olive oil in the Iberian Peninsula, from production to retail and consumption, by analysing several datasets covering recent decades. Ultimately, this research intends to examine whether olive oil production is effectively thriving in spite of the sector efforts, as the challenges being faced cannot be disregarded as well. In terms of findings for more recent years, it was possible to conclude that despite the increasing recognition of the benefits of olive and olive oil by the society, and despite the increase in olive production, the consumption of olive oil has been decreasing internally, being replaced by increases in exports. This is most probably due to the economic conditions that have deteriorated due to the 2008's financial crisis, which, together with an increase in olive oil prices, has prevented a considerable portion of the population to have financial conditions to access to the consumption of such an important component of the Mediterranean diet.","[Ribeiro, Humberto] Univ Aveiro, ESTGA, GOVCOPP, Aveiro, Portugal; [Alves, Sandra Raquel] Polytech Inst Leiria, ESTG, CIC DIGITAL, Leiria, Portugal; [Roska, Vlasta] Univ North, Koprivnica, Croatia; [Lousas, Carla] Polytech Inst Braganca, ESTG, Braganca, Portugal",Universidade de Aveiro; University North - Croatia; Instituto Politecnico de Braganca,"Ribeiro, H (通讯作者)，Univ Aveiro, ESTGA, GOVCOPP, Aveiro, Portugal.",hnr@ua.pt; raquel.alves@ipleiria.pt; vlasta.roska@unin.hr; carlalousas@gmail.com,"Ribeiro, Humberto/AAJ-9053-2020","Ribeiro, Humberto/0000-0003-4747-1048",,,,,29,9,9,0,5,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,1,18,,,,,,18,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO8KK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000527683300001,0

This study compares average TFP performances of Turkish firms and aggregate TFP in Turkey with firms in a group of selected countries using data collected by the World Bank. Data was collected through firm-level surveys that follow a standard methodology. Cross-country comparison of TFP performances shows that there are significant differences between average and aggregate TFP across countries. While aggregate TFP in Turkey ranks high among the peers, the rank of Turkey's average TFP is lower. Also, relative to the peer group, productivity distribution is more dispersed in Turkey and large firms are more productive than small firms. This finding is consistent across various methodologies implemented to measure TFP. Despite low average productivity in Turkey, there are some industries such as Textile, Chemicals, Basic Metals and Machinery where Turkish firms rank among the top.","[Seker, Murat] Bogazici Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey; [Seker, Murat] Turkish Airlines, Istanbul, Turkey",Bogazici University; Turkish Airlines; Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK),"Seker, M (通讯作者)，Bogazici Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey.;Seker, M (通讯作者)，Turkish Airlines, Istanbul, Turkey.",murat.seker@thy.com,"Şeker, Murat/AAH-2251-2022; Şeker, Murat/AEN-1900-2022","Şeker, Murat/0000-0002-8998-9542; Şeker, Murat/0000-0002-8998-9542",,,,,10,0,0,2,6,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-76288-3; 978-3-319-76287-6,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2018,9.0,,,,,,343,360,,10.1007/978-3-319-76288-3_25,0.0,,,18,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO7XE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000525862100025,0

In order to stand out, modern companies must be capable of comprehending all of the aspects of the consumers' environment and anticipate consumers' demands, as well as the approach to be used as part of their integrated marketing communication. In the past twenty years, the mobile phone and telecommunications market has seen immense growth marked by yearly advancements in technology. The market is saturated with a large number of substitutes and the supply greatly exceeds the demand. The emphasis in this paper has been put on studying consumer behaviour, more specifically on the influences involved in choosing a mobile phone and tariff for the population of children. The children of today have come to own mobile phones earlier than ever before and have come to reach levels of technological literacy the likes of which are rarely encountered in adults. As such, they are becoming more and more noticed as a source of influence within the family. The paper summaries results of empirical researches; focus groups and a survey. Researches studied what influences families when it comes to the process of purchasing a mobile phone and a tariff for the population of children. The subjects were children in the age from seven to fourteen years and their parents. Both researches studied what influences families when it comes to the process of purchasing a mobile phone and a tariff for the population of children. The subjects were children between the ages of seven and fourteen and their parents. The research examined the way children use mobile phones, the reasons behind mobile phone usage in children as well as the customer journey of choosing the mobile phone model and tariff option for children. The parents of children who are not active mobile phone users were separated from the parents of children who actively use and own mobile phones.

Our study focuses on a specific subjective determinant of work motivation related to pay, namely on pay satisfaction, and on its potential factors in the area of organizational justice. Past investigations found that employee's subjective reactions towards their pay (i.e. their pay satisfaction) are grounded in their perceptions of the fairness of pay distribution and decisions, i.e. of the ways in which financial rewards are allocated within the company. We took into account two dimensions of organizational justice that have been shown as for being especially relevant for employee satisfaction and motivation, i.e. distributive and procedural justice. Our hypothesis was that pay satisfaction mediates the influence of distributive and procedural justice on work motivation. The study was conducted on a sample of 270 Romanian employees of companies in various sectors located in Iasi who were administered the research instruments measuring the four variables in our model. The model, comprised of the pattern of relationships between variables, was tested through structural equation modeling. Our results show that distributive and procedural justice perceptions have a positive influence on pay satisfaction, which further exerts a positive effect on work motivation. Overall, these two relationships indicate that pay satisfaction is a mediator of the influence of the two dimensions of organizational justice on work motivation. A direct effect of procedural justice on the latter variable was also highlighted by the results of the data analysis and was included in the general model. Further studies should test the role of other objective and subjective dimensions in this pattern of relationships, as well as examine the effect of interventions designed to improve employees' perceptions of organizational justice.","[Uriesi, Sebastian] Alexandru I Cuza Univ Iasi, 11 Carol I Blvd, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Uriesi, S (通讯作者)，Alexandru I Cuza Univ Iasi, 11 Carol I Blvd, Iasi, Romania.",sebastur72@gmail.com,,,,,,,42,0,0,0,4,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,534,543,,,,,,10,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200048,0

Concentrating on the Barbadian efforts to stem shoreline retreat, it explores whether investments in shoreline stabilization and beach amenity enhancement have beneficial effects on medium-term economic growth. The analysis relies on the synthetic control method as a way to systematically choose comparison units (beach sites), which allows for precise quantitative inference in small-sample studies. Our results indicate that in the first three years after shoreline stabilization works were completed, local economic effects, as measured by nighttime lights data, are positive and indicate a positive trend. Confidence bounds obtained by a bootstrapping method suggest that the positive trend is robust in the last two years-post-treatment. Shoreline stabilization works may therefore not only help preserve fragile ecological conditions, but further lead to sustainable growth in the local economy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Evidence from OECD and European Union regions and cities is used to motivate discussions about the likely long-run effects of demographic change on the efficacy of public policy to manage the population decline and the fiscal implications of trends towards governance decentralisation. As it becomes evident, there are significant, demographically driven asymmetries regarding both the fiscal underpinnings of local government and the efficacy of local land-use management and adjustment policies. In general, regions facing adverse demographic trends appear to be increasingly vulnerable over the long-term to increasing fiscal constraints, thereby limiting their ability to effectively and pragmatically manage decline.","[McCann, Philip] Sheffield Univ Management Sch, 1 Conduit Rd, Sheffield S10 1FL, S Yorkshire, England",,"McCann, P (通讯作者)，Sheffield Univ Management Sch, 1 Conduit Rd, Sheffield S10 1FL, S Yorkshire, England.",p.mccann@sheffield.ac.uk,"McCann, Philip/C-6307-2013",,,,,,61,14,15,1,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

We distinguish between spending on pensions, spending on other cash transfers and taxation. For each of these instruments of redistribution, we further distinguish three features: size, pro-poorness and targeting towards households with children. Pensions are generally neglected in analyses on child poverty, but are relevant through the presence of two, partially offsetting, forces. Increased pension spending weakens the relative income position of children, but pensions also substantially contribute to the household income of children from multigenerational households. This ambiguous result signals a challenge: while reductions in pension spending may be desirable in the long run in several European welfare states, policymakers-especially in Southern and Eastern Europe-should be aware that this not only directly involves income losses for the elderly, but also for a non-negligible share of (predominantly poor) children.","[Diris, Ron] Maastricht Univ, Dept Econ, Tongersestr 53, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Vandenbroucke, Frank] Univ Amsterdam, Spui 21, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Verbist, Gerlinde] Univ Antwerp, Ctr Social Policy Herman Deleeck, St Jacobsstr 2, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium",Maastricht University; University of Amsterdam; University of Antwerp,"Diris, R (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Dept Econ, Tongersestr 53, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",r.diris@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Verbist, Gerlinde/AAC-4935-2019","Verbist, Gerlinde/0000-0001-9253-3477",,,,,44,13,14,3,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

This data set provides a rare opportunity to investigate the effects of high school class sizes on student outcomes. Seoul has maintained strong restrictions on educational choices to achieve the ideal of equal educational opportunities. The identification mainly comes from the large-scale CSR policy implemented in 2002. By using the within-school between-cohort variation in class size intended by the CSR policy, we find that the effects of high school class sizes on test scores are small with tight confidence intervals. We confirm this result by using the additional within-school variation in class size arising from the major division, especially the implicit rule of class allocation between majors. Further, the distributional effects are no different from the average effects either. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Market participants endogenously determine whether to implement corrective policies. We consider three policy instruments (Pigouvian taxes and subsidies, and quantity regulation) and two levels of policy efficiency (full and half). We then explore how individual cultural worldviews might contribute to the rejection of policies that correct the market failure. Our results indicate that people often oppose policies that improve their material outcomes, and we find that such opposition is significantly explained by cultural worldviews. Interesting connections emerge between individual worldviews and specific policy instruments. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The preferred estimates indicate that Medicaid expansion is associated with statistically significant lower premiums for gold plans (17 percent) and the second-lowest-priced silver plans (25 percent). I also find evidence that Medicaid expansion decreases average premiums for other silver and bronze plans by about 16 and 13 percent, respectively. Overall, these findings are consistent with lower expected medical cost after Medicaid expansion removed certain low-income individuals from the marketplace risk pools.","[Peng, Lizhong] Univ West Georgia, Dept Econ, Carrollton, GA 30118 USA",University System of Georgia; University of West Georgia,"Peng, LZ (通讯作者)，Univ West Georgia, Dept Econ, Carrollton, GA 30118 USA.",lpeng@westga.edu,,,American Institutes for Research,American Institutes for Research,"I would like to thank Chad Meyerhoefer, Yi Lu, and two anonymous referees for helpful comments and suggestions.

The multicenter cross-sectional study included all adult outpatients in charge of the 14 main Nephrology Centers of Tuscany Region during 7 weeks from 2012 to 2013. Direct medical costs have been estimated using tariffs for laboratory tests, diagnostic exams, visits, hospitalization and prices for drugs. Non-medical costs included expenses of low-protein special foods, travel, and formal and informal care. Patients' and caregivers' losses of productivity have been estimated as indirect costs using the human capital approach. Costs have been expressed in Euros (2016). Totals of 279 patients in stage 4 and 205 patients in stage 5 have been enrolled. The estimated mean annual social cost of a patient with CKD were a,notsign7422 (+/- a,notsign6255) for stage 4 and a,notsign8971 (+/- a,notsign6503) for stage 5 (p < 0.05). Direct medical costs were higher in stage 5 as compared to stage 4; direct non-medical costs and indirect costs accounted, respectively, for 41 and 5 % of the total social cost of CKD stage 4 and for 33 and 9 % of CKD stage 5. In Italy, the overall annual social cost of CKD was a,notsign1,809,552,398 representing 0.11 % of the Gross Domestic Product. Direct non-medical costs and indirect costs were weighted on the social cost of CKD almost as much as the direct medical cost.

A cost-effectiveness analysis of NGCCT compared with invasive coronary angiography (ICA) was performed for these difficult-to-image patients for England and Wales. Five models (diagnostic decision model, four Markov models for CAD progression, stroke, radiation and general population) were integrated to estimate the cost-effectiveness of NGCCT for both suspected and known CAD populations. The lifetime costs and effects from the National Health Service perspective were estimated for three strategies: (1) patients diagnosed using ICA, (2) using NGCCT, and (3) patients diagnosed using a combination of NGCCT and, if positive, followed by ICA. In the suspected population, the strategy where patients only undergo a NGCCT is a cost-effective option at accepted cost-effectiveness thresholds. The strategy of using NGCCT in combination with ICA is the most favourable strategy for patients with known CAD. The most influential factors behind these results are the percentage of patients being misclassified (a function of both diagnostic accuracy and the prior likelihood), the complication rates of the procedures, and the cost price of a NGCCT scan. The use of NGCCT might be considered cost-effective in both populations since it is cost-saving compared to ICA and generates similar effects.","[Burgers, L. T.; Redekop, W. K.; Lhachimi, S.

This has been given the political urgency following the media and other commentary associated with the arrival of a disease that causes 'diebacic' of European Ash (Fraxinus excelsior) -a tree species with deep cultural associations. In 2014 the UK government published a plant biosecurity strategy and linked to this invested in research to inform policy. This paper reports the findings of a survey of informed UK publics on the acceptability of various potential strategies to deal with ash dieback, including no action. During the summer of 2015, we conducted a face-to-face survey of 1152 respondents attending three major countryside events that attract distinct publics interested in the countryside: landowners & land managers; naturalists and gardeners. We found that UK publics who are likely to engage discursively and politically (through letter writing, petitions etc.) with the issue of ash dieback a) care about the issue, b) want an active response, c) do not really distinguish between ash trees in forestry or ecological settings, and d) prefer traditional breeding solutions. Further that e) younger people and gardeners are open to GM breeding techniques, but t) the more policy-empowered naturalists are more likely to be anti-GM. We suggest that these findings provide three 'steers' for science and policy: 1) policy needs to include an active intervention component involving the breeding of disease-tolerant trees, 2) that the development of disease tolerance using GM-technologies could be part of a tree-breeding policy, and 3) there is a need for an active dialogue with publics to manage expectations on the extent to which science and policy can control tree disease or, put another way, to build acceptability for the prospect that tree diseases may have to run their course.

The Age of Em describes a future scenario in which human minds are uploaded into computers, becoming emulations or ems. In the scenario, ems take over the global economy by running on fast computers and copying themselves to multitask. The book's core methodology is the application of current social science to this future scenario, a welcome change from the usual perspectives from physical science, computer science, and philosophy. However, in giving a wide tour of the em world, the book sometimes gets bogged down in details. Furthermore, while the book claims that the em takeover scenario would be a good thing for the world and thus should be pursued, its argument is unpersuasive. That said, the book offers by far the most detailed description of the em world available, and its scenario offers a rich baseline for future study of this important topic. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

These range from a strong focus on commodity production complemented by economic rationalities -e.g. focusing on plantations to community-based or social forestry approaches highlighting local participation and stakeholder engagement, to a focus on ecosystem services and conservation. A major challenge involves the potential orientation of the overall forest policy and management paradigm either towards integrating manifold demands more or less evenly across an area, or towards dividing the land base into forest areas with different management priorities. The specific reconciliation and integration of both sides of the spectrum have been at the centre of scientific and political discussion on forest policy and management for several decades. In this context, the German model of integrative and multifunctional forest management has received international attention. It is regarded as an example for integrating diverse (societal and ecological) demands into a timber-production-oriented management approach. At the same time, the model's primary focus on timber production has been criticised by some. In this paper, we analyse the political dimension of the German model by tracing the birth and evolution of the so-called LOWE programme, a much noticed governmental forest management programme in the German state of Lower Saxony. LOWE has frequently been presented as a particularly successful example of multifunctional forestry. We first assess the specific societal and political circumstances that led to the establishment of the programme 20 years ago. Subsequently, we assess its political function in forest policy debates about various demands on Lower Saxony's public forests. We show that the evolution of the programme can be interpreted in two distinct but non-exclusive ways. On the one hand, LOWE was a strategic success story for the Forest Service because it aligned (and also appeased) conflicting demands in line with the changing political priorities. On the other hand, it also embodied a learning process towards environmental policy integration. By underlining LOWE as an example of the German model of integrative multifunctional forest management, we reiterate the strategic importance of this model in the German context and also highlight future challenges and related research needs.

In this paper we study the energy futures of farms up to 2030. A two-rounded mixed Delphi study combining qualitative and quantitative data was carried out to gather the views of experts within agriculture, as well as climate and energy issues. In the first round the experts answered a questionnaire and were interviewed and on the second round a feed-back report from the first round and an online questionnaire was used. The experts were asked to estimate probable and evaluate preferred futures of eleven energy sources in farm-level energy usage. Images of the future were constructed by performing a cluster analysis of the quantitative data. The quantitative clusters were complemented with qualitative material providing, arguments, meanings and rationale of and paths to the images of the future. Six scenarios were formed this way: 1) Boiler and Pump, 2) Incremental Change, 3) Energy Boost Plus, 4) Energy Boost Minus, 5) Renewable Prosperity and 6) Energy Save. The six scenarios differ in how much they envision traditional energy forms (bulk electricity, oil, natural gas) will be used and what is the emphasis of combustion of biofuels (wood, liquid biofuels, biogas, other biomass) and the use of other renewables (wind, solar energy, heat pumps and hydropower).

Evolutionary economics is the answer. It starts from the realistic premise that society and the economy are shaped by competition, but unlike neo-classical economics, it proceeds empirically by observing and analysing what has been happening to the economy and society. It does so on the premise that a process of social selection is taking place, analogous but not identical to that of biological selection. This dynamic approach requires a revival of economic history. By reporting on, and inviting debate over, what is happening and its implications, the adoption of an evolutionary approach should help restore the moral content of economics and the surrounding social sciences. Such a change in approach would be a paradigm shift, and will take time. That it will happen is likely: in the end facts kick.

The present analysis aims to contribute to the examination of institutional corruption in the health sector by analyzing whether the current payment mechanism of separately remunerating salaried hospital physicians for treating supplementary insured patients in public hospitals, in combination with the public hospital physician's possibility of taking up dual practice as a self-employed physician with a private practice and/or as an attending physician in private hospitals, has the potential to undermine the primary purposes of the Austrian public health care system. Based on the analysis of the institutional design of the Austrian public hospital sector, legal provisions and directives have been identified, which have the potential to promote conduct on the part of the public hospital physician that systematically undermines the achievement of the Austrian public health system's primary purposes.","[Sommersguter-Reichmann, Margit] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Dept Finance, Resowi G2, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Stepan, Adolf] Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Management Sci, Theresianumgasse 27, A-1040 Vienna, Austria",University of Graz; Technische Universitat Wien,"Stepan, A (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Management Sci, Theresianumgasse 27, A-1040 Vienna, Austria.",adolf.stepan@tuwien.ac.at,,,Brocher Foundation,Brocher Foundation,"Adolf Stepan was partly funded by the Brocher Foundation.

To date, 17 states have opted out. The majority of the opt-out states cited increased access to anesthesia care as the primary rationale for their decision. In this study, we assess the impact of state opt-out policy on access to and costs of surgeries and other procedures requiring anesthesia services. Our null hypothesis is that opt-out rule adoption had little or no effect on surgery access or costs. We estimate an inpatient model of surgeries and costs and an outpatient model of surgeries. Each model uses data from multiple years of U.S. inpatient hospital discharges and outpatient surgeries. For inpatient cost models, the coefficient of the opt-out variable was consistently positive and also statistically significant in most model specifications. In terms of access to inpatient surgical care, the opt-out rules did not increase or decrease access in opt-out states. The results for the outpatient access models are less consistent, with some model specifications indicating a reduction in access associated with opt-out status, while other model specifications suggesting no discernable change in access. Given the sensitivity of model findings to changes in model specification, the results do not provide support for the belief that opt-out policy improves access to outpatient surgical care, and may even reduce access to outpatient surgical care (among freestanding facilities).","[Schneider, John E.; Scheibling, Cara] Avalon Hlth Econ LLC, 26 Washington St,3rd Fl, Morristown, NJ 07960 USA; [Ohsfeldt, Robert] Texas A&M Univ, Hlth Policy & Management, 212 Adriance Lab Rd, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Li, Pengxiang] Univ Penn, Div Gen Internal Med, 423 Guardian Dr, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Miller, Thomas R.] Amer Soc Anesthesiologists, 1061 Amer Lane, Schaumburg, IL 60173 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of Pennsylvania,"Scheibling, C (通讯作者)，Avalon Hlth Econ LLC, 26 Washington St,3rd Fl, Morristown, NJ 07960 USA.",Cara.scheibling@avalonecon.com,"Ohsfeldt, Robert/AAG-6514-2019","Ohsfeldt, Robert/0000-0002-6117-056X",American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA),American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA),"The study was completed by Avalon Health Economics, funded by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA).

The authors' studio, Pantopicon, was asked to carry out a (near future) foresight desk study investigating the changing role between people and their home/office interiors. Furthermore they were asked to render tangible the challenges brought forward by this study and create a thought-provoking experience for an audience of professionals and general visitors within the context of a trade fair (i.e. the Biennale Interieur in Kortrijk, Belgium). The article will zoom in on the particular way in which this challenge was taken up, i.e. by creating an immersive experience embodying imminent future changes by means of five fair booths. Each represented a fictitious company with products or services aimed at new needs, opportunities and abilities emerging from changes in the relationship between people and their home interiors. This article describes the follow-up approach, the results obtained and reflects upon a series of key learnings following from the experience in particular and the role and value of conceptual design in enhancing the experience factor in foresight in general. Hence, we aim to illustrate how an immersive conceptual design approach can be used in an applied foresight context and how it raises new questions and opportunities for both research and applied contexts.

However, relatively little is currently known about whether low-performing students are in fact more likely to exit charter schools than surrounding traditional public schools. We use longitudinal student-level data from two large urban school systems that prior research has found to have effective charter school sectors-New York City and Denver, Colorado-to evaluate whether there is a differential relationship between low-performance on standardized test scores and the probability that students exit their schools by sector attended. We find no evidence of a differential relationship between prior performance and the likelihood of exiting a school by sector.

As such, it offers a new perspective on women's contribution to household resources. Results show that servants working for the most well-off households in eighteenth-century Amsterdam could save a marriage budget that was between one-third and half of the capital that an unskilled man could save in the same amount of time. Furthermore, servants' wages would in theory have been sufficient to support a family of four at the subsistence level, illustrating that women's wages and potential savings cannot be ignored.","[Boter, Corinne] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Rural & Environm Hist, Hollandsweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Boter, C (通讯作者)，Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Rural & Environm Hist, Hollandsweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",corinne.boter@wur.nl,,,Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [276-53-007],Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"I would like to thank the editors of Feminist Economics and the three anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments.

Moreover, the phenomenon of the information society accentuated the confrontation of the competing interests of producers and users, a conflict that often takes the form of a clash between two irreconcilable socio-economic concepts. The European Union's main legal response to the challenge of copyright protection in the context of digital technologies was the adoption of the Directive (2001/29) on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. This act was a significant step in harmonising copyright protection within the EU, but it is outdated and poses numerous problems of implementation. In September 2016, the European Commission issued a proposal for a Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market, whose prospect of adoption is still uncertain. Protection of privacy and trust in the online environment is another issue of growing complexity, especially in the context of often divergent national legislations. The EU Data Protection Directive (95/46) - that globally defined the rights and duties of all stakeholders with respect to the processing of personal data - was adopted more than 20 years ago and was recently repealed by the Regulation 2016/679, applicable from 25 May 2018.

Drawing on the expanding literature on financial performativity, including within the field of cultural economy, the article submits that by virtue of its centrality to multiple, closely interconnected and often highly recursive sets of relations between economies, financial markets and central banks, the yield curve is performative at a range of different levels; and, parsing various different extant understandings of performativity, the article theorizes the particular nature of such performativity in the yield curve context. Against the grain of the bulk of the literature on financial performativity, however, the article also endeavors to connect the yield curve's performativity explicitly to questions of privilege (the privileges of representation) and power (the power to perform) and their unequal distribution. That is to say, the article argues that to understand the multidimensional performativity of the yield curve, we need to draw out its political as well as cultural economy.","[Christophers, Brett] Uppsala Univ, Dept Social & Econ Geog, Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University,"Christophers, B (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Dept Social & Econ Geog, Uppsala, Sweden.",brett.christophers@kultgeog.uu.se,,,,,,,46,15,17,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

How exactly might governments return externality-correcting tax revenue to overcome regressivity and not alter marginal incentives? In addition, there is a desire to achieve a double dividend in the use of externality-correcting taxes, that is, to use the revenue to offset existing distortionary taxes, such as those on labor that produce a deadweight loss. In this article, the authors explain a classroom game that was developed for students to understand the theory of externalities, taxation dead weight loss, and regressivity. Then, the problem helps students explore the actual design of a policy that satisfies the double dividend hypothesis and corrects for regressivity.","[Duke, Joshua M.; Sassoon, David M.] Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, 531 South Coll Ave, Newark, DE 19716 USA",University of Delaware,"Duke, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, 531 South Coll Ave, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",duke@udel.edu,"Duke, Joshua/ABB-9392-2021","Duke, Joshua/0000-0002-9895-1191",,,,,19,5,5,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0485,2152-4068,,J ECON EDUC,J.

Attaining this objective requires planning, assumptions, funding and continuous monitoring. The need to recognize and make provision for benefit payments in advance, involves the actuary in placing a present value on the future commitment to pay benefits. The main calculations carried out by actuaries are to determine annual cost (required contributions) of providing the pension benefits and the level of liabilities that should be recognized at a specific point in time. Contributions inflow is occurring at a different time and in a different pattern, so that the time value of money is an important consideration. Actuarial methods and assumptions in determining both the cost and funded status of pension plans and institutions for retirement provision across the European countries are different. Project Unit Method is the most common method used for determining the required contribution rate. Also, other methods, such as: Attained Age, Entry Age and Aggregate Methods are also sometimes used. Actuarial assumptions required in the valuation of retirement are economic assumptions and demographic assumptions. The flexibility in assumption setting and the lack of standardised sensitivity analysis creating potential hazards within the pension scheme. The aim of this paper is to show the influence of various actuarial assumptions on pension benefits and provision, because pension liabilities are highly sensitive to changes in actuarial assumptions. Special attention is given to plans of defined payments after termination of employment, rendering of a service, i.e. Projected Unit Credit Method (PUCM) in accordance with IAS 19 requirements. Various simulations and sensitivity analyses are prepared in order to evaluate the parameters of the model, validation and verification of obtained results.","[Kerkez, Marija] John Naisbitt Univ, Fac Business Studies, Belgrade, Serbia",,"Kerkez, M (通讯作者)，John Naisbitt Univ, Fac Business Studies, Belgrade, Serbia.",majap@rcub.bg.ac.rs,"Paunovic, Marija V/D-5615-2016","Paunovic, Marija V/0000-0001-5216-0039",,,,,8,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,360,368,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ2BZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418819000037,0

Don't the existing financial corporations focus on creating shareholder value, while at the same time neglecting the traditional functions of the banking sector? The modern financial crises and numerous cases of embezzlement and unethical behaviour by banks have revealed that Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFIs) pose actual danger to the stability of banking sectors and even of entire national economies, by contributing to excessive systemic risk. Banking systems become too large to qualify for public assistance, should it be needed. At the moment it is difficult to assess whether the newly created EU institutions of the banking union are capable of providing security to customers of banks. It is paradoxical, that modern financial systems, in spite of up-to-date economic, finance management, management accounting and controlling solutions, are more than ever vulnerable to crises in the global markets.

This essay discusses some of the rhetorical and theatrical contrivances that are used to generate artificial business situations in which the student can experience a moment of decision and test his quality as a leader. These training formulas, we argue, rely on the therapeutic hope of dramaturgical self-realization, but often degenerate into a form of regressive fetishism in which the fantasy of existential resolve and serious decision-making can be playfully and safely enacted. Surrealism and its demise provide an angle from which the peculiar fragility of these operations can be understood: what the experiential business curriculum provides, in this interpretation, amounts to a sort of subrealist shield, a protective dilution of the challenges that await in the world at large. When the element of the ethical pledge is added to this compendium of techniques, the result is a self-referential (and essentially indulgent) form of spiritual exercise solely oriented to the auto-elevation of the business self.","[Lezaun, Javier] Univ Oxford, Inst Sci Innovat & Soc, Oxford, England; [Lezaun, Javier] Univ Oxford, Sch Anthropol & Museum Ethnog, Oxford, England; [Muniesa, Fabian] PSL Res Univ, CNRS UMR 9217, Mines ParisTech, Ctr Sociol Innovat, Paris, France",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; Universite PSL; MINES ParisTech; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Muniesa, F (通讯作者)，PSL Res Univ, CNRS UMR 9217, Mines ParisTech, Ctr Sociol Innovat, Paris, France.",fabian.muniesa@mines-paristech.fr,"Muniesa, Fabian/C-4650-2008","Muniesa, Fabian/0000-0001-8756-3241",European Research Council [263529]; European Research Council (ERC) [263529] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),This work was supported by the European Research Council [263529].,,59,15,15,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

We found that the relationships of the SEE markets with the benchmark developed markets, and among them, are not stable in the long-run. Using the VAR model, Granger cause causality, impulse response and variance decomposition, we came to the conclusion that while in the crisis period the SEE stock markets shows high interrelations among them and with the developed markets, the inter-linkages diminished after the crisis period. In the pre- and post-crisis period SEE markets have on average zero correlations, modest lead-lag interactions, small responses to other market shocks, and most of the variance is explained by their own shock. The opposite is true for the crisis period, when SEE markets have a significant adjusted effect, and each market responds to the impulses coming from most of the other markets. This suggests that in the period of instability and uncertainty SEE markets follow a common path, and in the calm periods with optimism and positive expectations the lead-lag relations of the SEE markets with the developed stock markets diminish.","[Naumoski, Aleksandar; Arsov, Sasho] Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ Skopje, Fac Econ, Skopje, Macedonia; [Gaber, Stevan] Goce Delcev Univ, Fac Econ, Stip, Macedonia; [Gaber-Naumoska, Vasilka] Publ Revenue Off, Skopje, Macedonia",Saints Cyril & Methodius University of Skopje; Institute of Economics Skopje; Goce Delcev University of Stip,"Naumoski, A (通讯作者)，Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ Skopje, Fac Econ, Skopje, Macedonia.",aleksandar@eccf.ukim.edu.mk; sarsov@eccf.ukim.edu.mk; stevan.gaber@ugd.edu.mk; vasilka.gaber-naumoska@ujp.gov.mk,"Naumoski, Aleksandar/HJB-0287-2022","Naumoski, Aleksandar/0000-0002-2602-5041; Arsov, Sasho/0000-0002-8149-1504",,,,,20,2,2,0,1,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

The main objective of this paper is to identify the perception of Bucharest's inhabitants concerning environmental degradation and to identify the existence of ecological behavior of the citizens, seen as consumers. By identifying consumer's perception this study reveals the opportunity for businesses in Bucharest to use concepts from eco-marketing because the consumer's needs are oriented in such way.

Those on the 'inside' occupy stable jobs, while those on the 'outside' confront increased levels of social and economic risks. There are, however, various prominent, but divergent, operationalizations of the insider-outsider phenomenon. While some scholars opt for indicators rooted in current labor market status of individuals, others prefer to consider occupational class groups as bases of the insider-outsider divide. As these operationalizations of outsiderness capture different profiles of outsiders, we test the extent to which they lead to consistent or inconsistent conclusions about electoral behavior. The article yields two consistent findings that are robust across all the operationalizations: that outsiders are less likely to vote for major right parties than are insiders, and that outsiders are more likely to abstain from voting. Additionally, we find that occupation-based outsiders tend to support radical right parties, while status-based outsiders rather opt for radical left parties-a finding supported by the association between social risk and authoritarian preferences. We test our expectations using multinomial logit models estimating vote choice on the first five waves of the European Social Survey from 2002 to 2010 across western Europe.","[Rovny, Allison E.] Univ Gothenburg, CERGU, Dept Sociol & Work Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Rovny, Jan] MaxPo, Sci Po, Paris, France; [Rovny, Jan] Univ Gothenburg, CERGU Polit Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg; Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po); University of Gothenburg,"Rovny, AE (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, CERGU, Dept Sociol & Work Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden.",allison.rovny@sciencespo.fr,"Rovny, Jan/AAD-2807-2020","Rovny, Jan/0000-0002-6071-4289","CERGU; University of Gothenburg; CEE research center at Sciences Po, Paris; LIEPP research center at Sciences Po, Paris; MaxPo research center at Sciences Po, Paris","CERGU; University of Gothenburg; CEE research center at Sciences Po, Paris; LIEPP research center at Sciences Po, Paris; MaxPo research center at Sciences Po, Paris","The work on this article was supported by CERGU and the University of Gothenburg, and by the CEE, LIEPP, and MaxPo research centers at Sciences Po, Paris.

The present research analyzes the operating profit margins from 70 large taxpayers from Romania from 3 main markets: retail sale of automotive fuel in.specialized stores, retail sale in non-specialized stores with food, beverages or tobacco predominating (supermarkets) and manufacture of electrical/electronic equipment, other parts and accessories for motor vehicles; and compares them to operating profit margins of independent entities that have no direct affiliations with other companies. The analysis looks at the risk related to some financial performance indicators that an entity has, such return on total cost or return on sales to the same performance indicators of independent companies in the field the company belongs. The operating margins best suited fir activity of the large taxpayers taken into consideration, will be compared with an interquartile range calculated from the operating margins obtained by independent entities in order to conclude the risk probability, revealing if that entity has an operating margin similar to the '' free market ''.","[Stana, George Bogdan; Turlea, Ioan Codrut] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Stana, GB (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",,"Turlea, Codrut/AAV-5773-2020; Turlea, Ioan Codrut/HLG-5053-2023",,,,,,7,0,0,0,2,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

The paper focuses on analysing the processes of industrial enterprises, dealing with their importance and profit, classified by size. The result revealed that process activities, such as input logistics and marketing, are dominant in micro-enterprises, and such activities are important in profitable enterprises. In middle-sized enterprises, there is a more significant difference between marketing/sales and services without any relations to profit. However, there is a requirement to intensify these activities in non-profitable enterprises. Large enterprises revealed a significant influence of the scientific and technological development and also, to a lesser extent, of marketing, sales and purchase. Non-profitable enterprises should also focus on improving the quality of such processes.","[Vachal, Jan; Partlova, Petra; Strakova, Jarmila] Inst Technol & Business, Okruzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice 37001, Czech Republic","Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice","Váchal, J (通讯作者)，Inst Technol & Business, Okruzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice 37001, Czech Republic.",vachal@mail.vstecb.cz,"Pártlová, Petra/AAF-2516-2021; Straková, Jarmila/ABE-8222-2020","Pártlová, Petra/0000-0003-2404-6073;",,,,,34,3,3,1,10,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2261-2424,,,SHS WEB CONF,,,2017,39.0,,,,,,,,1027.0,10.1051/shsconf/20173901027,0.0,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL5MQ,,"gold, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452181300027,0

In the wake of the crisis, many WTO Members adopted new prudential measures, including regulatory instruments to resolve too-big-to fail institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act embodies the US post-crisis response. Dodd-Frank introduced a Resolution Authority, aimed at preventing future government bailouts and bankruptcies of too-big-to-fail institutions. From an international trade perspective, the Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) and National Treatment (NT) principles of The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) may limit certain applications of the Resolution Authority. US subsidiaries with a foreign parent are not to be treated less favourably than domestic companies or competitors from third countries providing like services. The US could thus fall short of its MFN and NT principles if it uses the Resolution Authority in a selective manner. The Panel Report in Argentina-Financial Services makes it clear that the Prudential Carve-Out will not provide unlimited justification in such cases. In a broader context, it is argued that the GATS's MFN and NT principles should be seen as a stabilizing force in maintaining financial stability across borders.","[Van de Ven, Laurens Hubert] De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Van de Ven, Laurens Hubert] WTO, Permanent Representat Netherlands, Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Van de Ven, LH (通讯作者)，De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",laurens.vandeven@debrauw.com,,,,,,,67,0,0,0,0,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Despite suffering an economic slowdown during the late 2000s, Brazil was considered as one of the leading countries in the Latin American region. It became the sixth largest economy of the world by 2012, surpassing the United Kingdom. In social terms, Brazil also showed improvements. Data on unemployment, minimum wages and inequality were promising, showing that nearly 30 million people entered the middle class, minimum wages in the year 2015 were 117% higher than in the year 2000 and the Gini index decreased from 0.601 in the year 2000 to 0.5148 by the year 2014 (World Bank, 2017). All these improvements happened thanks to equality promoting social programmes. However, all these positive changes did not seem to end social conflicts. By the year 2011, 161 social conflicts were registered, positioning Brazil as a country with a medium level of violence (PNUD y Fundacion UNIR, 2011). According to the UNDP, 7% of all Latin American conflicts happened in Brazil. At a macroeconomic level, conflict was on the rise during the years 2004-2014, despite all the country ' s efforts to improve its living standards (UNDP). This paper proposes that this paradox can be explained by analysing the situation of Brazil's Federal States and each region individually. One can see that the bulk of Brazil's GDP is concentrated on Federal States with megacities, while the rest of the country is mostly poor. This in turn shows that while rich regions were reducing their levels of violence, poor regions'violence indicators were on the rise during this period. It is important to state that the levels of violence are measured by the homicide rate per 100 thousand inhabitants. In addition, according to Helder Ferreira and Diogo Martins, corruption is a factor that increases and worsens social inequality in terms of income. Therefore, corruption is another factor that could be explain the paradox (Ferreira & Martins, 2014).","[Vasquez, Enrique] Univ Pacifico, Dept Econ, Lima, Peru",Universidad del Pacifico Peru,"Vasquez, E (通讯作者)，Univ Pacifico, Dept Econ, Lima, Peru.",Vasquez_ee@up.edu.pe,,,,,,,97,4,4,0,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,1,23,,,,,,23,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426857700001,0

Recent FTAs include provisions on regulatory cooperation and convergence, as well as intellectual property provisions going well beyond the scope of the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs). These rules have particular importance for the generic and biosimilar medicines' sectors and have important links to public health objectives. A growing number of sectors are covered by the substantive provisions of FTAs, often by means of dedicated and sector-specific rules and chapters catering to country-and/or industry-specific needs and interests. The article provides the relevant background in terms of trade law, trade negotiations and FTA trends, particularly as they relate to intellectual property rights and pharmaceuticals. The article places its core emphasis on the domestic impact of FTAs. Examples are drawn from the pharmaceutical sector of generic and biosimilar medicines. The potentially decisive impact of FTAs implies the necessity that all interested parties be more pro-actively involved in order to shape the future of the applicable legal frameworks, internationally and domestically.","[Vergano, Paolo R.; Dolle, Tobias] FratiniVergano European Lawyers, Brussels, Belgium; [Vergano, Paolo R.] FratiniVergano European Lawyers, Singapore, Singapore",,"Vergano, PR (通讯作者)，FratiniVergano European Lawyers, Brussels, Belgium.;Vergano, PR (通讯作者)，FratiniVergano European Lawyers, Singapore, Singapore.",p.vergano@fratinivergano.eu; t.dolle@fratinivergano.eu,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,2,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Multilayer perceptron neural networks and neural networks of basic radial functions are used for processing. A total of 10,000 neural structures are generated for each cost-interest relationship and the corresponding profit, of which 5 are retained, showing the best results. The results indicate that in all cases of profit there is no dependence between the interest and the amount of profit generated.

First, this article focuses on the theory of Armington substitution elasticity of nonhomogeneous products and then estimates the overall level of Armington substitution elasticity of China's imported commodities. Second, this article studies the fluctuation trend in Armington substitution elasticity's estimations using a state space model. The results of this article indicate that the value of Armington substitution elasticity of China's imported commodities is negative and decreased significantly after the international financial crisis, which means that the relationship between China's imported commodities and domestic products is complementary rather than substitutional. Moreover, this article finds evidence of the price transmission effect in China's imported commodities. However, this effect is not obvious and weakened after the international financial crisis. Finally, we conclude that, if it wishes to prevent serious inflationary problems in China, the Chinese government should pay attention to the price of domestic products instead of focusing on the hazards of imported inflation (deflation).","[Wu, Chongyu] Renmin Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Jiantao] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Hui] Ludong Univ, Dept Mkt, Yantai, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhongyi] Jilin Univ, Sch Econ, Changchun, Peoples R China; [Cai, Xinyi] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Jiantao] Beihang Univ, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Beihang University; Ludong University; Jilin University; Tsinghua University; Beihang University,"Zhou, J (通讯作者)，Beihang Univ, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",zhoujiantaoA1032@buaa.edu.cn,,,,,,,33,1,1,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

According to research studies, invasive species promote uncontrolled changes in the ecosystem, endangering agriculture and negatively affecting the economy. The research aim is to examine the spread of Sosnowsky's hogweed and the opinions of local residents on the control of this invasive species in Rezekne municipality. Sosnowsky's hogweed spreads in Latvia as a whole, including Rezekne municipality. In the rural territory of Berzgale of Rezekne municipality, Sosnowsky's hogweed has spread the most. A survey of randomly selected territories did not identify considerable differences in the spread of Sosnowsky's hogweed between 2012 and 2016. According to a survey of residents living in Rezekne municipality, the residents chose mainly the cheapest methods to control Sosnowsky's hogweed, and only a small proportion of them believed that they had sufficient knowledge of control methods for Sosnowsky's hogweed. The present research employed the following research methods: monographic and descriptive, analysis, synthesis, statistical analysis and a sociological method - a survey. The Wilcoxon test was employed to analyse field data and compare territories. The Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS) and the tools of the R program and Microsoft Excel were employed to process the data.

Dry-powder inhalers (DPIs) require forceful inhalation for optimal delivery, and approximately 40% of Global Initiative for Asthma(GINA)-defined Step-3+ patients inhale corticosteroid and long-acting beta-agonist through DPIs. The CRITIKAL study (Price et al. in J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract 5:1071-e9-1081-e9, 2017) found a statistically significant association between insufficient inspiratory effort' error and increased risk of uncontrolled asthma and hospitalisation-requiring exacerbations. This paper explores the cost-effectiveness of an error-targeted intervention.MethodsA probabilistic Markov cost-utility model simulated patients transitioning between controlled and uncontrolled health states over oneyear. Odds ratios (ORs, from the CRITIKAL study) of a patient having uncontrolled asthma conditional on making the error were applied to baseline transition probabilities sourced from the literature, both indirectly via an adjustment formula (Zhang et al. in JAMA 280:1690-1691, 1998) and directly by assuming OR approximates relative risk (RR). The analysis explored complete/partial eradication of the error when the intervention was priced to match comparators, as well as impact of indirect costs based on lost/reduced productivity.ResultsThe intervention dominated both DPI comparators overoneyear, with direct cost savings of 45/86 pound with 0.0053/0.0102 additional quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and had the highest probability of being cost-effective at a 20,000 pound/QALY threshold. Key factors driving variance were weekly utilities per state and RR of moving to an uncontrolled state.ConclusionThe analysis demonstrated the economic and societal costs of insufficient inspiratory effort' and potential economic benefits of introducing an effective intervention to reduce/eradicate this error. Further research should assess the economic impact of other handling errors.","[Forster, Rebecca; Dunlop, William C.

The empirical findings are quite confusing and even contradictory. Researchers have found positive, negative, U-shaped, inverted U-shaped, S-shaped, and inverted S-shaped relationships between degree of internationalization and performance. Based on plausible theoretical explanations such as networking effects, cost and benefit mechanisms and minimum efficient scale (MES), the recommendation for further research is to change focus - from an overall level to a more detailed country-industry and company size contextual level. The underlying assumption is that more specific contextual aspects are paramount to the existence and shape of the I-P relationship. Building on the resource-based view and the S-shape theory of internationalization, this paper aims at such an empirically focused investigation of SMEs within the Swedish wood manufacturing industry. A repeated cross-sectional survey study using hierarchical regression analysis has revealed a linear negative relationship between internationalization and performance. Given that wood manufacturing is a low-tech industry, not highly automated and with a low level of MES, the results are expected. The size of the Swedish market is big enough to amortize the initial investments of establishing a small wood manufacturing business, and the costs associated with internationalization diminish overall performance. In addition, the follow-up tests of ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) and piecewise regression revealed a non-linear relationship between (1) internationalization and performance for highly internationalized firms in 2001, (2) internationalization and growth for low internationalized companies in 2001, and (3) internationalization and performance for highly internationalized groups in the pooled dataset. Considering the costs and benefits associated with international activities, the non-linear effects of internationalization on performance or growth is plausible.","[Hosseini, Mojtaba; Brege, Staffan; Nord, Tomas] Linkoping Univ, Linkoping, Sweden",Linkoping University,"Hosseini, M (通讯作者)，Linkoping Univ, Linkoping, Sweden.",mojtaba.hosseini@liu.se; tomas.nord@liu.se; staffan.brege@liu.se,,"Nord, Tomas/0000-0001-6246-268X",industry organization Swedish Wood,industry organization Swedish Wood,This work was financially supported by the industry organization Swedish Wood.,,67,9,12,3,49,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,DEC,2018,97.0,,,,,,110,121,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.09.013,0.0,,,12,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,HE0KP,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452955800012,0

There was a determination to create a world in which large-scale unemployment was abnormal and at worst only a temporary phenomenon. The war had shown that this was possible in a community united to pursue a common goal and the aim was to create such a community in a world free from the horrors of war, by creating communities in which the welfare of every person was important. Australia was remarkably successful in achieving this for 30 years. Its success depended on governments responding to any sustained increase in unemployment by undertaking large increases in public sector expenditure supported by accommodating monetary policy and tax cuts if desirable. In bad times as well as good, there was a determination to ensure that both the incomes and prices paid for necessities by the less well-off did not force anyone to live in poverty. The biggest obstacle to achieving this today is the growth of neoliberalism with its emphasis on 'freedom' or giving individuals the ability to act as they please with minimal constraints and an ideological commitment to small government.","[Nevile, John] Univ New South Wales, Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Nevile, John] Univ New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Nevile, J (通讯作者)，Univ New South Wales, UNSW Business Sch, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",j.nevile@unsw.edu.au,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

In addition to questions of environmental suitability, the economic viability of Eucalyptus is a significant hurdle to widespread adoption for commercial plantings. We sought to assess the potential obtainable yields and economic feasibility of Eucalyptus grandis Hill ex. Maiden and E. benthamii Maiden et Cambage, two species suitable for the southern United States. Using the process-based growth model 3PG, we projected potential yields at the sub-county level for E. grandis in Florida where it is operationally grown and E. benthamii in USDA Plant Hardiness Zones 8a and 8b where it has shown tolerance to occasional low temperatures. The 3PG model estimated mean annual volume increment, inside bark (MAI) that was used to estimate land expectation value (LEV) and internal rate of return (IRR). The MAI of E. grandis ranged from 18 to 119 m(3) ha(-)1(y)ear(-1) (9 to 59.5 dry Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) with a mean of 42.6m(3) ha(-1)year(-1) (20.8 dry Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) for sites in peninsular Florida. The lower growth projections came from north Florida areas where annual frosts occur. Excluding urban areas, the LEV of E. grandis ranged from $-1264 to $1710 ha(-1) with a mean of $424 ha(-1). The estimated IRR ranged from -9.7% to 16.9% with a mean of 8.2%. Eucalyptus benthamii MAI ranged from 3.3 to 76 m(3) ha(-1)year(-1) (1.8 to 41.8 Mg ha(-1)year(-1)), with a mean of 21.9m(3) ha(-1)year(-1) (11.9 Mg ha(-1)year(-1)). The higher yields were primarily located in coastal regions of USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 8b. Excluding urban areas, LEV ranged from $-2707 ha(-1) to $1532 ha(-1). The maximum estimated IRR was 15.9%. Our results show that Eucalyptus is potentially profitable as a bioenergy crop in the southern USA, but potential profitability of E. benthamii was limited by low temperature; positive LEV was obtained where productivity was 30m(3) ha(-1)year(-1) or more. Profitability was restricted to a small percentage (12%) of sites theoretically within the operational range in the southern U. S. indicating that a wholesale conversion of Pinus taeda plantations is unlikely.","[Stanturf, John A.] USDA Forest Serv, Southern Res Stn, 320 Green St, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Young, Timothy M.; Huang, Xia] Univ Tennessee, Knoxville Ctr Renewable Carbon, 2506 Jacob Dr, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Perdue, James H.] USDA Forest Serv, Southern Res Stn, 2506 Jacob Dr, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Dougherty, Derek; Pigott, Michael] Dougherty & Dougherty Forestry Serv Inc, POB 82013, Athens, GA 30608 USA; [Guo, Zhimei] Auburn Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, 306A Comer Hall, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Stanturf, John A.] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Kreutwaldi 5, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; UT Institute of Agriculture; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; Auburn University System; Auburn University; Estonian University of Life Sciences,"Stanturf, JA (通讯作者)，USDA Forest Serv, Southern Res Stn, 320 Green St, Athens, GA 30602 USA.;Stanturf, JA (通讯作者)，Estonian Univ Life Sci, Kreutwaldi 5, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia.",johnalvin.stanurf@emu.ee; tmyoung1@utk.edu; jperdue@fs.fed.us; ddougherty@progressiveforestry.com; mpigott@progressivetiveforestry.com; zzg0001@auburn.edu,"Stanturf, John A./M-4171-2019; Young, Timothy M/D-9949-2011","Stanturf, John A./0000-0002-6828-9459; Young, Timothy M/0000-0001-9564-6506","U.S. Forest Service, Southern Research Station [FS 07CR11330115087]; USDA McIntire-Stennis research project [TENOOMS-101]; University of Tennessee Agricultural Experiment Station, Center for Renewable Carbon; Department of Forestry, Wildlife and Fisheries; NASA LaRC POWER Project","U.S. Forest Service, Southern Research Station(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service); USDA McIntire-Stennis research project; University of Tennessee Agricultural Experiment Station, Center for Renewable Carbon; Department of Forestry, Wildlife and Fisheries; NASA LaRC POWER Project","We thank two anonymous reviewers for helpful suggestions that improved our manuscript.

We focus on three aspects related to scheduling: student fatigue, time center dot of instruction, and instructor schedules. Data cover five academic years at the United States Air Force Academy, where schedules are randomized, grading is standardized, and there is substantial variance in schedule structure. Analyzing over 180,000 student-course outcomes, we find causal evidence of cognitive fatigue brought on by scheduling multiple courses in a row. The expected performance of two students in the same class may differ by as much as 0.15 standard deviations simply owing to their prior schedules. All else equal, students perform better in the afternoon than in the early morning. We also note that instruction improves with repetition. Heterogeneous effects by ability suggest that overall gains are possible. Prioritizing certain schedules would be equivalent to improving teacher quality by one-third of a standard deviation. A reorganization of students' daily school schedules is a promising and potentially low-cost educational intervention.","[Williams, Kevin M.] Occidental Coll, Dept Econ, 1600 Campus Rd, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USA; [Shapiro, Teny Maghakian] Slack Res & Analyt, San Francisco, CA USA",Occidental College,"Williams, KM (通讯作者)，Occidental Coll, Dept Econ, 1600 Campus Rd, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USA.",KevinW@Oxy.edu; tshapiro@slack-corp.com,,,,,,,35,11,14,1,15,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,1873-7382,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

Education finance reformers advocate delivering extra resources to disadvantaged school districts to close academic achievement gaps, but their efforts are subject to criticism from skeptics who believe that extra resources do not actually improve performance. This study leverages variation in per-pupil expenditures from a specific provision of the state aid formula in New York State that allows districts to maintain prior levels of total state aid even as their student enrollment declines. We uncover achievement gains of approximately 0.047 standard deviations in math and 0.042 standard deviations in English corresponding to $1000 in additional per-pupil spending.

Korpi and Palme argued that low-income targeting leads to less redistribution and explained this trade-off as a result of coalition politics among different social strata. Indeed, recent empirical studies suggest that highincome earners tend to have more negative attitudes toward redistribution in the context of targeted spending (the polarization hypothesis). Contrary to most studies, which have relied on a single data source and measure, this study explores whether the polarization hypothesis is supported by multiple (both micro and macro) data sources. The findings of this study indicate that different question wordings produce different responses to inequality and redistribution. Some of the results confirmed the polarization hypothesis, whereas others did not. This article attempts to explain these discrepancies by comparing the wording patterns of inequality-attitude measures and arguing that high- and low-income earners polarize their views in the context of low-income targeting when their sense of ingroup favoritism and intergroup conflict is sufficiently triggered.","[Sumino, Takanori] Univ Oxford, Dept Sociol, Manor Rd Bldg, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England",University of Oxford,"Sumino, T (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Sociol, Manor Rd Bldg, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",takanori.sumino@trinity.ox.ac.uk,"Sumino, Takanori/Q-2581-2015","Sumino, Takanori/0000-0003-3042-1888",,,,,59,7,7,1,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

And can we nudge teachers to support and encourage better decision making? Education decisions are taken at young ages and involve immediate costs and potential, future benefits. In such settings behavioural barriers (e.g. lack of self-control, limited attention and social norms) likely influence choices and this may motivate the use of low cost 'nudges' to gently push behaviour in the desired direction. Our review of nudging interventions shows that while nudging often has positive effects, the greatest effects often arise for individuals affected most by the behavioural barrier targeted by the intervention. Hence understanding underlying behavioural mechanisms is crucial. Negative effects may arise in situations where nudges potentially crowd-out intrinsic motivation, if nudges pressurise individuals, or in situations where the choice architect has an insufficient understanding of behavioural mechanisms.","[Damgaard, Mette Trier] Aarhus Univ, Fuglesangs 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark; Trygfondens Ctr Child Res, Fuglesangs 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Damgaard, MT (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Fuglesangs 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark.",mdamgaard@econ.au.dk; hnielsen@econ.au.dk,,,,,,,217,125,147,20,111,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,1873-7382,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

Thus, the purpose of this study was to provide normative values in the SF-6D in relation to the Chilean population. A cross-sectional study was conducted evaluating 5293 people. SF-6D utilities were derived from the SF-12 questions. Mean SF-6D utility index for the whole sample was 0.74. It was better for men (0.78) than for women (0.71). The ceiling effect was much higher for men (11.16%) than for women (5.31%). Women were more likely to show problems in any dimension than were men. Chilean population norms for the SF-6D help in the decision-making process around health policies. Men reported higher health status than women in all subcategories analyzed.

Drawing on rich statewide administrative data, we observe small but significant test score gains for students assigned to the same teacher for a second time in a higher grade. We control for selection into repeat student-teacher matches with teacher fixed effects and either student fixed effects or flexible controls for student past achievement. The effects are largest for minorities, and there is some evidence that gains are most evident for students with generally less effective teachers (as measured by value-added). We also provide suggestive evidence of spillover benefits: students assigned to classes in which a large share of classmates are in repeat student-teacher matches experience gains even if not previously assigned to that teacher themselves. This suggests that effects at least partly operate through improvements in the general classroom learning environment. Overall, our findings indicate that there may be potential low-cost gains from the policy of looping in which students and teachers progress through early school grades together, and may explain the recent experimental evidence that teacher specialization has negative effects on student achievement given that this likely decreases student-teacher familiarity.","[Hill, Andrew J.] Montana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Econ, POB 172920, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Jones, Daniel B.] Univ South Carolina, Dorla Moore Sch Business, Dept Econ, 1014 Greene St, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Hill, AJ (通讯作者)，Montana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Econ, POB 172920, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",andrew.hill6@montana.edu; daniel.jones@moore.sc.edu,"Hill, Andrew/JWG-8406-2024",,,,,,27,27,41,1,23,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,1873-7382,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

We find that teachers serving initially higher performing students have more precise value-added estimates and in most cases have higher year-to-year stability levels than teachers with lower performing students. We also decompose the variation in value-added estimates into components that reflect persistent and transitory variation in true teacher performance as well as variation caused by imprecision in the estimates. We find that teachers with lower performing students have less precision in their estimates and more transitory variation in value-added from year to year than other teachers. Our estimates imply that if teachers serving initially lower performing students had levels of precision and transitory variation in their value-added estimates equal to those serving higher performing students, the year-to-year stability in their estimates would actually exceed that of teachers with initially higher performing students.","[Stacy, Brian; Wooldridge, Jeffrey] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, 486 W Circle Dr, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Guarino, Cassandra] Univ Calif Riverside, Grad Sch Educ, 2123 Sprout Hall, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",Michigan State University; University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Stacy, B (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, 486 W Circle Dr, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",brian.w.s-tacy@ers.usda.gov; cassandra.guarino@ucr.edu; wooldri1@msu.edu,"Stacy, Brian/O-4077-2019","Stacy, Brian/0000-0002-3039-2004; Guarino, Cassandra/0000-0002-9252-9678","Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education [R305D100028, R3058090011]","Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education(US Department of Education)","The research reported here was supported by the Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education, through Grants, R305D100028 and 83058090011 to Michigan State University.

However, not all regions experience the same degree of coal-to-gas generation switching or electricity price declines. Specifically, regions experiencing more coal-to-gas switching experience smaller electricity price drops. We provide intuition that may explain this pattern. This finding also has environmental and welfare consequences: coal-fired plants emit more pollutants, and therefore regions that benefit more from greater emissions reductions experience lower benefits from declining electricity prices.

A renewable, perfect substitute for oil is available at constant unit cost. The climate-aware region uses a carbon tax and a renewables subsidy as policy instruments. Due to heterogeneity in climate policies between regions, the oil price path possibly contains two limit-pricing phases. We specify conditions under which a tightening of climate policies results in lower initial carbon emissions. A renewables subsidy and a carbon tax effectively force the monopolist to sell more oil to the climate-ignorant region, during the stage when demand from the climate-aware region has already vanished. We calibrate the model and numerically investigate climate damage and welfare effects of the policies of the climate aware region.

In contrast, we ask whether taxes that penalize high emitters induce changes in the retirement of existing and inefficient vehicles. We exploit natural experiment conditions in Switzerland to analyze the impact of three different bonus/malus annual registration fee schemes implemented at the cantonal level. In the three schemes, the bonus rewards new, fuel-efficient vehicles. The malus is retroactive in canton Obwalden, i.e. it is charged on both new and existing high-emitting cars, but prospective in Geneva and Ticino. We use a difference-in-difference design within a survival analysis framework to assess direct treatment effects and spillover effects. While the bonus/malus in Obwalden hastens the retirement of existing high-emitting vehicles (by around 5%), the scheme in Geneva postpones retirement (by some 3%). We find no statistically significant effects in Ticino. These findings have important implications about the desirability of bonus/malus schemes and on their design, as well as on old car scrappage programs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In this first part, I derive the formulas for five types of forest property taxation under the generalized Faustmann formula. They are the unmodified property tax, the site value tax, the flat property tax, as well as the gross and net forest revenue productivity taxes. The impacts of these taxes in terms of fiscal neutrality and tax burden are then examined. Fiscal neutrality examines whether the imposition of a tax will affect management decisions. Tax burden measures the magnitude of the reduction in the value of the land, known as the site burden, and that of the forest as a whole, known as the forest burden, as a result of the imposition of a property tax on forestland of different productivities. Analytical results indicate that all forest property taxes are theoretically not fiscally neutral. They will all shorten the optimal harvest age. This is in sharp contrast to the results under the classic Faustmann formula under which the latter 4 types of taxes are all known to be fiscally neutral. In terms of tax burden, the unmodified property tax, the fiat property tax and the gross forest revenue productivity tax impose a heavier site burden on less productive land than on more productive land. The forest burden is age dependent. At age 0, all but the flat property tax imposes a lighter burden on less productive land. At the optimal harvest age, the unmodified property tax, the flat property tax and the gross forest revenue productivity tax impose a heavier burden on less productive land. The net forest revenue productivity tax imposes a heavier tax burden on the less productive land when the annual management cost is small. When the annual management cost is significant, the tax burden could become lighter on the less productive land. Only the site value tax imposes a lighter site and forest burden on the less productive land consistently.","[Chang, Sun Joseph] Louisiana State Univ, Agr Ctr, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Chang, SJ (通讯作者)，Louisiana State Univ, Agr Ctr, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",xp2610@lsu.edu,,,McIntire-Stennis Cooperative State Research Program [14-JV-11330143-102]; USDA Forest Service [14-JV-11330143-102]; Forest Service,McIntire-Stennis Cooperative State Research Program; USDA Forest Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service); Forest Service(Natural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service),Research supported in part by the McIntire-Stennis Cooperative State Research Program and USDA Forest Service Joint Venture Agreement 14-JV-11330143-102.

Crucial questions include the impact of early development of positive psychological attributes on socioeconomic outcomes, and whether interventions to reduce poverty increase such attributes. We examine the impact of international child sponsorship on the psychology of Indonesian children by employing a novel program evaluation technique-a quantified analysis of children's self-portraits. To identify causal effects, we exploit an eligibility rule that established a maximum age for participation. We find that international sponsorship significantly raises sponsored children's levels of happiness (0.42 sigma), self-efficacy (0.29 sigma), and hope (0.66 sigma).","[Glewwe, Paul] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Ross, Phillip H.] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Wydick, Bruce] Univ San Francisco, Dept Econ, 2130 Fulton St, San Francisco, CA 94117 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Boston University; University of San Francisco,"Wydick, B (通讯作者)，Univ San Francisco, Dept Econ, 2130 Fulton St, San Francisco, CA 94117 USA.",wydick@usfca.edu,,"Wydick, Bruce/0000-0003-3619-9026",University of San Francisco,University of San Francisco,"Paul Glewwe is a professor in the Department of Applied Economics at the University of Minnesota.

The potential endogeneity of maternal mental health shocks is dealt with by utilizing nationally representative panel data from two cohorts and individual fixed-effects instrumental variables models. While our results show that poor maternal mental health does not affect children's general health, asthma morbidity, or anthropometric measures, our results indicate that children of depressed mothers do need extra medical care. For this child health outcome, higher adverse impact is found for boys, younger children, children of mothers with lower education, and children in lower-income households. We also find that children of depressed mothers are more likely to have food or digestive allergies and tonsillitis incidence. Our study demonstrates that failing to account for endogeneity of maternal mental health shocks could overestimate the harmful impact of poor maternal mental health on child health. Our findings are robust to a battery of sensitivity and specification tests.","[Huong Thu Le] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Math Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Huong Thu Le] Univ Western Australia, Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Nedlands, WA, Australia; [Ha Trong Nguyen] Curtin Univ, Bankwest Curtin Econ Ctr, Perth, WA, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); University of Western Australia; Curtin University,"Nguyen, HT (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Bankwest Curtin Econ Ctr, Perth, WA, Australia.",ha.nguyen@curtin.edu.au,"Huong, Le/JOJ-9777-2023; Nguyen, Ha/GWQ-7088-2022; Huong, Le/AGQ-2821-2022","Huong, Le/0000-0003-4630-5734; Nguyen, Ha/0000-0002-2240-8942",Curtin Business School,Curtin Business School,Funding from Curtin Business School's Journal Publication Support Award is gratefully acknowledged.,,106,12,13,0,10,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",2332-3493,2332-3507,,AM J HEALTH ECON,AM.

From this perspective, the aim of this article is to explore whether the expansion of the welfare state should be seen as a barrier to economic growth and competitiveness, as neoliberal' economists often argue, or whether increasing public social provision might contribute to enhancing real income. After a comparative discussion of the evolution of different welfare models in developed countries, we advance our argument that public social spending is not a drain on competitiveness or an obstacle to economic efficiency. On the contrary, we explore the possibility that increasing welfare expenditure can stimulate economic growth along with lowering inequality, while the so-called efficiency thesis' (according to which globalisation needs to be accompanied by the retrenchment of welfare states in order to promote external competitiveness) produces worse economic performance and higher inequality. As a test of this hypothesis, we analyse empirical data on 34 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries from 1990 to 2013. We use econometric analysis to indicate that the so-called compensation thesis' (a process whereby globalisation is regulated through expansion of welfare states) may contribute to real income dynamics, while greater income inequality may inhibit per capita gross domestic product growth.","[Tridico, Pasquale; Meloni, Walter Paternesi] Roma Tre Univ, Dept Econ, Via Ostiense 159, I-00154 Rome, Italy; [Tridico, Pasquale] Roma Tre Univ, Econ Growth & Welf Syst, Rome, Italy; [Meloni, Walter Paternesi] Roma Tre Univ, Econ, Rome, Italy",Roma Tre University; Roma Tre University; Roma Tre University,"Tridico, P (通讯作者)，Roma Tre Univ, Dept Econ, Via Ostiense 159, I-00154 Rome, Italy.",pasquale.tridico@uniroma3.it,"Paternesi Meloni, Walter/JXL-7768-2024","Paternesi Meloni, Walter/0000-0001-9293-123X",,,,,67,21,21,3,27,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

A decision analytic model in Microsoft Excel was used to compare vedolizumab with other biologic treatments (infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab) for the treatment of biologic-na < ve patients with UC in the UK. Efficacy data were obtained from a network meta-analysis using placebo as the common comparator. Other inputs (e.g., unit costs, adverse-event disutilities, probability of surgery, mortality) were obtained from published literature. Costs were presented in 2012/2013 British pounds. Outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs and outcomes were discounted by 3.5% per year. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were presented for vedolizumab compared with other biologics. Univariate and multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess model robustness to parameter uncertainty. The model predicted that anti-tumour necrosis factor-na < ve patients on vedolizumab would accrue more QALY than patients on other biologics. The incremental results suggest that vedolizumab is a cost-effective treatment compared with adalimumab (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of A 22,735 pound/QALY) and dominant compared with infliximab and golimumab. Sensitivity analyses suggest that results are most sensitive to treatment response and transition probabilities. However, vedolizumab is cost-effective irrespective of variation in any of the input parameters. Our model predicted that treatment with vedolizumab improves QALY, increases time in remission and response, and is a cost-effective treatment option compared with all other biologics for biologic-na < ve patients with moderately to severely active UC.","[Wilson, Michele R.] RTI Hlth Solut, 300 Pk Off Dr, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Bergman, Annika; Chevrou-Severac, Helene] Takeda Pharmaceut AG, Zurich, Switzerland; [Selby, Ross] Takeda UK Ltd, High Wycombe, Bucks, England; [Smyth, Michael] Takeda Dev Ctr Europe Ltd, London, England; [Kerrigan, Matthew C.] PHMR Ltd, London, England",Research Triangle Institute; Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd; Takeda Development Centre Europe Ltd.,"Wilson, MR (通讯作者)，RTI Hlth Solut, 300 Pk Off Dr, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",mwilson@rti.org,"Smyth, Michael/IRZ-1169-2023","SMYTH, Michael/0000-0001-9215-803X","Takeda Pharmaceuticals, AG","Takeda Pharmaceuticals, AG","The research presented in this manuscript was funded by Takeda Pharmaceuticals, AG.",,32,18,19,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

This empirical case study in the Ashanti Region of Ghana seeks to understand the motivations for such violation. The study finds that low deterrence, economic gains to be derived, high patronage of chainsaw milled lumber on the domestic and the West African sub-regional markets, apparent lack of social sanctions for violators, weak morals of the actors involved, perceived unreasonableness of the regulations that prohibit chainsaw milling and low legitimacy of the regulators have all contributed to the violation behaviour. It also highlights the importance of contextual factors particularly poverty and political support in shaping the violation behaviour.

This paper departs from an assumption that visions may guide urban development work, and examines and compares national and local governments' visions of future sustainable cities in Norway. The case study is the urban multilevel governance program 'Cities of the Future'. Previous literature on urban sustainability and multilevel governance stresses the importance of shared visions and goals between stake-holders. However, the paper finds that, in the context under investigation, visions were partially dis-aligned between national and local stakeholders. Nevertheless, participants from both national and local governments considered the Cities of the Future program as successful. This was especially due to the learning networks facilitated by the program. The paper critically discusses the assumption of alignment and suggests a shift of attention from the content of vision to the processes of vision making. By this, we may understand visions as possible trading zones for the negotiation of future directions in urban sustainability.","[Ingeborgrud, Lina] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Interdisciplinary Studies Culture, Edvard Bulls Veg 1, N-7048 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Ingeborgrud, L (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Interdisciplinary Studies Culture, Edvard Bulls Veg 1, N-7048 Trondheim, Norway.",Lina.ingeborgrud@ntnu.no,,,Research Council of Norway [230365],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),This work was funded by the Research Council of Norway.

We link monthly data on search frequency in local Search Units to information on changes in local open enrollment options driven by No Child Left Behind (NCLB) sanctions as well as state school choice policies including open enrollment, tuition vouchers, charitable scholarship tax credits, and tuition tax credits. Our results indicate that NCLB-driven expansions in school choice have large, positive effects on the frequency of searches done for schools in that area. We find less evidence that state choice policies affect online search behavior, however search frequency also increases when charter school penetration in a given area rises. These estimates suggest that the information parents have about local schools is endogenous to the choice environment they face, and that parental information depends not just on the availability of data but also the incentive to seek and use it.","[Lovenheim, Michael F.] Cornell Univ, 102 Martha Rensselaer Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Lovenheim, Michael F.] NBER, 102 Martha Rensselaer Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Walsh, Patrick] St Michaels Coll, Colchester, VT USA",Cornell University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Lovenheim, MF (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, 102 Martha Rensselaer Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.;Lovenheim, MF (通讯作者)，NBER, 102 Martha Rensselaer Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",mfl55@cornell.edu,"Lovenheim, Michael F/K-7260-2012",,Cornell Institute for Social Science; St. Michael's College,Cornell Institute for Social Science; St. Michael's College,"We gratefully acknowledge funding for this research from the Cornell Institute for Social Science and St. Michael's College.

We further find that gender norms shaped by beliefs on women's political empowerment and economic opportunity affect the gender gaps in test scores in general. Interestingly, gender norms do not seem to particularly influence math related stereotypes, but instead, preferences for math. Finally, the evidence indicates that these findings are driven by cognitive skills, suggesting that social gender norms affect parent's expectations on girls' academic knowledge relative to that of boys, but not on other attributes for success such as non-cognitive skills.

Achieving the goal of the paper is based on the analysis of available internal data from large territorial clusters in Russian regions. Based on these data, it was possible to assess the impact of territorial clusters on the innovative potential of the Russian regions in terms of financial, economic, organizational and technological aspects. The results showed the absence of strategic goals focused on the innovative development of the national economy. The main measure of success should be the increase of the level of social and economic development and the improvement of the quality of life of the society. The results include a definition of the concept of the development of innovative territorial clusters. It was also possible to define the financial and economic mechanisms for the development of innovative territorial clusters. These mechanisms are important for the sustainable development of innovative territorial clusters.","[Abrashkin, Mikhail; Aleksahina, Vera] State Budgetary Higher Educ Inst Moscow Reg Univ, Ul Gagarin 42, Korolev 141070, Moscow Region, Russia; [Pogodina, Tatiana] Fed State Educ Budgetary Inst Higher Educ Financi, Leningradsky Prospect 49, Moscow 125468, Russia; [Sikyr, Martin] Czech Tech Univ, Masaryk Inst Adv Studies, Kolejni 2637-2a, Prague 16000 6, Czech Republic",Czech Technical University Prague,"Abrashkin, M (通讯作者)，State Budgetary Higher Educ Inst Moscow Reg Univ, Ul Gagarin 42, Korolev 141070, Moscow Region, Russia.",abrashkinms@mail.ru; pogodina15@yandex.ru; aleksakhina@ut-mo.ru; martin.sikyr@cvut.cz,"Pogodina, Tatiana/L-9855-2018; Abrashkin, Mikhail MS/D-7710-2015; Šikýř, Martin/K-4913-2017",,,,,,14,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,11,19,,,,,,9,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400002,0

There are essentially two types of such agreements, an exclusive and an open variant. While the former apply among the signatories only, the latter are implemented on a Most-favoured-Nation (MFN) basis. To preclude 'free riding', the entry into force of such open PAs is usually conditioned on the participation of a 'critical mass' of countries, representing market shares of some 80% or more-quite a challenging benchmark. To promote more frequent use of PAs, given the plethora of pressing policy concerns, whether investment-, competition-or labour-related, the negotiation of exclusive agreements is being (re-) considered in current discussions. However, the entry into force of any non-MFN-based agreement would need to be accepted by consensus among all 160-odd WTO Members, and this may prove virtually impossible to achieve. This article thus proposes, based on past experience, to further explore the potential for open PAs among interested Members in the form of co-ordinated improvements of current commitments or, if not covered by the existing WTO framework, by way of ` WTOextra' understandings.","[Adlung, Rudolf; Mamdouh, Hamid] WTO Secretariats Trade Serv & Investment Div, Brussels, Belgium",,"Adlung, R (通讯作者)，WTO Secretariats Trade Serv & Investment Div, Brussels, Belgium.",rudolf.adlung@gmail.com; hamid-mamdouh@outlook.com,,,,,,,66,9,12,0,7,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Under these conditions, the optimal strategy of rationally operating economic entities is the reproduction of low-skilled labour resources, which is accompanied by the leaching of highly qualified specialists from the labour market.

While the speed of technology acquisition is increasing, the power of service differentiation is gradually decreasing. ISPs do not differ much on the service provided. The first step in increasing competitiveness is to understand why customers choose a particular service provider.

The findings of the research present the factors affecting the consumer's choice of an Internet Service Provider in Albania. It is showed that brand image is the most influential factor in the selection of ISPs.

The most important conclusions are the following: In the examined case it is the introduction of a reporting-operating Project Portfolio Management Office (PPMO). The general conclusion is every PPMO has to be tailored to the needs of the organization. In this process, the role of top management should be considered which has two dimensions. 1) The ideation process is top-down or bottom-up 2) the top management is part of the operative implementation of the ideas or it has only a supervisor role.","[Csendes, Istvan] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest,"Csendes, I (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary.",istvan.csendes@uni-corvinus.hu,,,,,,,39,0,0,0,0,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,1143,1152,,,,,,10,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200097,0

According to the conventional open economy model one of the important advantages of the floating exchange rate regime is that a country can pursue an autonomous monetary policy. Recently the empirical validity of the trilemma has been questioned: H. Rey argued that the choice is between openness to financial flows and monetary independence, 'irreconcilable duo', no matter which exchange rate regime prevails. We derive a contagion model of monetary policy to examine whether the degree of 'policy contagion' is indeed unrelated to the exchange rate flexibility in CEE economies. Our main findings are that: (1) the spillover effect from the euro area monetary policy is strong for the Czech Republic, but rather weak for Hungary, Poland and Romania; (2) the trilemma monetary policy independence indices are rather crude and their informativeness is substantially limited; (3) the CEE countries, except for the Czech Republic, are likely to maintain their monetary independence in the face of future ECB's exit from the zero-interest-rate policy.","[Dabrowski, Marek A.] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Macroecon, Ul Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland; [Papiez, Monika; Smiech, Slawomir] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Stat, Ul Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics; Cracow University of Economics,"Dabrowski, MA (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Macroecon, Ul Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",marek.dabrowski@uek.krakow.pl; monika.papiez@uek.krakow.pl; slawomir.smiech@uek.krakow.pl,"Śmiech, Sławomir/I-3253-2018; Papież, Monika/I-3257-2018; Dąbrowski, Marek A./V-2257-2018","Papież, Monika/0000-0003-3597-2080; Dabrowski, Marek A./0000-0003-3079-1811",National Science Centre in Poland [DEC-2015/17/B/HS4/02681],"National Science Centre in Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)",The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the National Science Centre in Poland (grant no.

Since consumers' needs should be on the first place, every new development opportunity should take that into account. Evidence from 2017 confirms the fact that the public healthcare system is unable to demonstrate a rapid growth, because there are still many deficiencies, which need to be corrected (waste of financial resources, waste of time, etc.). This suggests a meticulous analysis and a necessary deficiencies' gradual improvement, in order to fundamentally improve the public health system. Notably, managers from public healthcare institutions should be capable of correctly speck what quality means; otherwise, expecting a quality management would be hopeless. We therefore consider that improvement processes must have as a debating point the patients' voice, what dissatisfies them in addition to their rights about a qualitative public health system. This paper will analyze, and therefore try to predict, an apparently minor yet important aspect, like the circumstance of expecting in front of the medical room. For this analysis two statistical tools were used - ANOVA analysis and regression analysis. The results, formed as a linear distribution, demonstrated that the patients' delaying time is influenced by the delay in informational system. In conclusion, as recommendations, the research is an ongoing study, which will further analyze other possible factors that may influence the patients' waiting.","[Dinulescu, Ruxandra; Smeureanu, Ion; Dobrin, Cosmin; Popa, Ion] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Dinulescu, R (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",ruxandra.dinulescu@man.ase.ro; ion.smeureanu@csie.ase.ro; cdobrin@yahoo.com; ipopa@yahoo.com,"Popa, Ion/H-5068-2016; Boghian, Ruxandra/AAL-4307-2021; Dobrin, Cosmin/AFW-2382-2022","Popa, Ion/0000-0003-0703-3828; Boghian, Ruxandra/0000-0002-9290-815X; Dobrin, Cosmin/0000-0002-8866-9643",,,,,16,4,4,0,11,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

There is now a political agreement that these emissions must decrease. So far one way forward has been to design and maintain carbon markets. As part of this process, trees in the tropics have been enrolled in peculiar transactions: actions such as reforesting a land of degraded savannah or preserving a piece of forest can produce tradable emission credits to offset against CO2 emissions in distant locations. Based on a multi-sited investigation of carbon offsetting, including fieldwork in the Congo, the paper presents a journey across different marketization sites where the enrolment of forest carbon into market exchanges can be seen to be at stake. Several operations are foregrounded, from United Nations negotiations and the measurement of carbon stocks, to business venture and legal work. The paper proposes a focus on the mundane that attends to details and frictions. This provides a deflationary story of the marketization of forest carbon, a story of contingencies and unexpected ramifications.","[Ehrenstein, Vera] Goldsmiths Coll, Dept Sociol, London, England",University of London; Goldsmiths University London,"Ehrenstein, V (通讯作者)，Goldsmiths Coll, Dept Sociol, London, England.",v.ehrenstein@gold.ac.uk,,,European Research Council [313173]; European Research Council (ERC) [313173] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),The writing of this paper was supported by a European Research Council [grant no. 313173] held by Daniel Neyland.,,48,5,5,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

The author conducted a qualitative research making use of semi-structured interviews with nine elite respondents who for the purpose of this research were defined as individuals that have been involved in initiating, developing and managing HE partnerships at executive levels. The analyses demonstrate that HEI partnerships may produce a wide range of outcomes depending on the external factors, purpose, length, specialism, and priorities of the collaboration. Nevertheless, this research has identified 18 partnership outcomes which are grouped into three categories such as academic, financial and marketing and managerial outcomes. Results of the research infer that performing in accordance to partner's expectations helps overcome trust related issues thus building confidence in partners. The establishment of confidence might lead towards exploring other collaborative possibilities and therefore be able to have a combination of academic, financial and marketing and managerial outcomes at the same time. Results show that nurturing and supporting the application of KM activities is essential in allowing the HE partners to share, transfer, apply and absorb the knowledge needed to attain the intended partnership outcomes. The extent to which knowledge is exchanged and distributed within and across HEI partners might encourage the development of new products and services which in return helps an HEI to minimize risk through portfolio diversification and establish a sustainable business model.","[Elezi, Enis; Bamber, Christopher] Univ Bolton, Deane Rd, Bolton BL3 5AB, Greater Manches, England",University of Bolton,"Elezi, E (通讯作者)，Univ Bolton, Deane Rd, Bolton BL3 5AB, Greater Manches, England.",ee3mpo@bolton.ac.uk; C.Bamber@bolton.ac.uk,"Elezi, Enis/AFL-8064-2022; Elezi, Enis/AAG-8012-2022; Bamber, Chris/ABC-5423-2020","Elezi, Enis/0000-0001-5031-6415; Elezi, Enis/0000-0001-5031-6415; Bamber, Chris/0000-0001-8555-0690",,,,,21,2,2,0,1,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,573,586,,,,,,14,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200051,0

The strong assumptions on which the Coase Theorem relies also can be included to show why the theorem may not hold.

However, diverse national FRAND enforcement practices that take either a contractual or an antitrust approach challenge TRIPS integrity. While personal property recognition for SEPs lends constitutional support to the contractual approach to FRAND enforcement, private property's in-built limitation warrants a balance with the antitrust approach for needs from others. A critical examination of the TRIPS conclusion and the analytical structure of TRIPS provisions reveal that TRIPS obligation against anticompetitive practices is imperative. The imbalance of harmonized TRIPS with un-harmonized FRAND practices reflects TRIPS birth defect and challenges TRIPS integrity. To improve balance of rights and obligations in international trade and to ensure innovation and technology dissemination that is conducive to social and economic welfare, the paper calls for a contract-antitrust balanced approach to FRAND enforcement and the resumption of WTO's competition negotiations.","[Guan, Wenwei] City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Law, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",City University of Hong Kong,"Guan, WW (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Law, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",w.guan@cityu.edu.hk,,"Guan, Wenwei/0000-0003-1414-8949",City University of Hong Kong [7004790],City University of Hong Kong(City University of Hong Kong),"This research was partially supported by a Strategic Research Grant from the City University of Hong Kong (Project No.: 7004790).

Investment disputes may be submitted to investor-state dispute resolution mechanisms including the ICSID under BITs. In the case of financial disputes, the newly established Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank may provide a platform for its members to settle their disputes. As for those countries which have neither acceded to the WTO nor joined other regional trade regimes, nor signed any FTAs or BITs with China, China may settle the disputes with them through government agreements like protocols, or refer the disputes either to domestic judicial bodies or to arbitration. The purpose for this is to ensure that dispute settlement under the OBOR Initiative will be more economical, efficient and enforceable.","[Hu, Jiaxiang] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, KoGuan Law Sch, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jie (Jeanne)] Univ Sydney, Law Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; University of Sydney,"Hu, JX (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, KoGuan Law Sch, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",jxhu@sjtu.edu.cn; humility_us@hotmail.com,,,Shanghai Jiao Tong University [2]; University of New South Wales [2],Shanghai Jiao Tong University; University of New South Wales,This article is part of the research program which has received the joint support from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and the University of New South Wales under the Seed Grant Project (No. 2).,,45,7,7,2,22,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

There are many different forms of short food supply chains (SFSC), but they share a common characteristic of reduced numbers of intermediaries between the farmer or food producer, and the consumer. The growing interest in SFSCs is shown in the paper - this reflects mainly the consumer demand for quality and traceability, given the alarming health crises in food markets. From a customers' point of view, SFSCs transfer more complete information about the origin of the food and, for producers, SFSCs retain a higher share of added value. The overview on the impact of short supply chains is provided in the paper. The results of the analysis show that the supply chain may have some beneficial economic effects. It is noticed that the SFSCs have potential to increase farm value added (profit allocation), promote sustainable farming systems, diversify production and contribute to local economic development.","[Jarzebowski, Sebastian] Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Fac Appl Informat & Math, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Jarzebowski, S (通讯作者)，Nowoursynowska 166, PL-02787 Warsaw, Poland.",sebastian_jarzebowski@sggw.pl,,,European Commission [728055]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [728055] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme,European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),The paper was prepared within the framework of research granted by European Commission within Horizon 2020 Programme as a project 728055 'Short supply chain Knowledge and Innovation Network - SKIN'.,,23,0,0,6,25,Warsaw Univ Life Sciences Pr,Warsaw,"Nowoursynowska 166, Warsaw, POLAND",,,978-83-7583-803-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,360,365,,10.22630/ESARE.2018.2.49,0.0,,,6,Development Studies; Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Geography,BO1TO,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000502418600049,0

The analysis was conducted in two ways - it concerned: 1) spatial differentiation analysis and 2) the assessment of the effectiveness of granting social services. In most analyses of spatial distribution for the assessment of the intensity of the social assistance, the indicators compare the structure of people receiving benefits in relation to the total population. The Authors propose the use of the Multiplicative Indicator of Poverty Intensity (MIPI), which consists of 4 components: the number of people living on a given street, the number of beneficiaries of social assistance and the number and the amount of social services granted. Assessment of the effectiveness of social assistance is treated in an extended way than the commonly-used approach expressing the ratio of the number of beneficiaries in relation to the actual number of people in need. The dynamic approach was also taken into account, which allowed determining changes in the effectiveness of social assistance and residence allowances.

The research was based on the National Agricultural Census data and followed the administrative division of Poland. The analysis of man-made determinants was carried out for three factors: (1) historical (HIS), (2) urban (URB), where poviats fell into two categories: well-urbanised, i.e. with townships, and lessurbanised, i.e. with rural districts only; and (3) the Common Agricultural Policy (AB/EU), where poviats were differentiated by the absorption level of the European funds, i.e. below and above the national average. The analysis demonstrated that the Polish agriculture shows a historically-driven, polarised spatial structure - with Western Poland on one end and Eastern Poland on the other - and, thus, it revealed the necessity for the continuation of the processes aiming at territorial cohesion in the EU.","[Jezierska-Thole, Aleksandra; Rudnicki, Roman] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Earth Sci, Dept Spatial Management & Tourism, Lwowska 1, PL-87100 Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Jezierska-Thöle, A (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Earth Sci, Dept Spatial Management & Tourism, Lwowska 1, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",alekjez@umk.pl; r.rudnicki@umk.pl,"Jezierska-Thöle, Aleksandra/AAM-1967-2021","Jezierska-Thöle, Aleksandra/0000-0002-7607-9531",National Science Centre in Poland [2011/03/B/HS4/04952],"National Science Centre in Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)",This study was conducted and financed in the framework of the research project Changes in the spatial structure of Polish agriculture under the influence of instruments of the Common Agricultural Policy in the years 2012-2015 granted by the National Science Centre in Poland (Nr 2011/03/B/HS4/04952).,,15,1,1,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,719,728,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400072,0

This is because the feature that there is no substantive dispute in the realization of the security interest case determines that it does not apply the relevant provisions of the ordinary procedure on prosecution and admissibility.

However, the estimations of the exchange rate pass-through vary widely in the existing literature. Our article proposes the use of a policy-based instrumental variable for exchange rate, exploiting the exchange rate reform in China, and finds that 67% of exchange rate pass-through into the FOB export price of Chinese exports. This contrasts to the almost full exchange rate pass-through using OLS estimation.

There have been increasingly more farmers participating into the program. However, their enthusiasm for high premium payment was rather low as most of them selected the minimum premium for insurance. In this article, the discounted utility theory from behavioral economics was adopted to analyze insurance selection behaviors of farmers; in addition, a discounted incremental utility model with a hyperbolic discounting function was also further constructed to describe their insurance decision-making processes. Based on the investigation of time preferences of farmers, their insurance participation behaviors of diverse natures were simulated. The corresponding results indicated that active insurance participation and low insurance premium payment were rational choices for most farmers; in comparison, for the elders with higher income, different choices can be made. Therefore, policy makers could formulate differentiated subsidy policies directing at farmers from different groups, so as to stimulate their enthusiasm for premium payment.","[Liu, Zhonghai; Li, Kuangqi; Zhang, Ning; Li, Lianyou] Hunan Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Coll Finance & Stat, Changsha 410006, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Fan, Yi] Cent South Univ Forestry & Technol, Coll Econ, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China",Hunan University; Central South University of Forestry & Technology,"Zhang, N (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Coll Finance & Stat, Changsha 410006, Hunan, Peoples R China.",zhangning1231@126.com,,,,,,,25,2,2,4,51,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

For the chosen model, the regime switching equation satisfactorily fits the data, confirming the presence of rational bubbles for all countries. The dynamics of the exchange rate series for each country is interpreted with the help of the estimated bubbles.

The objective of such analyses is to look for factors (covariates) that significantly affect the duration of the enterprise. The use of traditional statistical methods, e.g. regression analysis, is not possible in this situation due to the occurrence of the censored observations. The most popular statistical methods in duration analysis comprise: the Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the Cox proportional-hazards regression model. As an alternative, survival trees (a regression tree approach) can be used. The model building process is based on recursive partitioning of the set of enterprises into homogenous subsets and the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival function or the Cox regression model in each terminal node is reported. The article presents the results of enterprises duration time analysis in Lodzkie Voivodship on the basis of data from the National Official Business Register REGON in the years 2010-2015 with the use of survival trees (the GUIDE algorithm - Generalized Unbiased Interaction Detectionand Estimation - proposed by Loh, 2002).

Regional and municipal authorities perform the assigned powers based on the available financial resources at their disposal, and this fact generates high regional differentiation in terms of social protection level provided.

This law came into effect just at a time when the new financial crisis started getting stronger. This crisis has affected the development of corporate bankruptcies not only in the Czech Republic but also in other countries. Bankruptcies of Companies (Maczynska, 2009) are the necessary selection mechanism in the world of business and have an important rationalizing function - they rid the market of entities that are unable to meet the appropriate efficiency requirements. The aim of this paper is to analyze the development of bankruptcies of companies (using total and monthly data) in the Czech Republic in the period 2008 to 2017 with a forecast for 2018.

The European Commission's proposed reduction by 5% of the CAP budget for 2021-2027 is one of the first Brexit consequences that potentially can result in a decline in EU farm incomes. The leaving the single market and customs union by the UK, traditionally taking a liberal market position, will probably affect not only the CAP, but also agricultural policies amongst WTO and G20 member countries. With lack of some kind of free trade agreement between the UK and the EU, agri-food net exports from the EU27 to the UK will decrease.","[Zawojska, Aldona; Siudek, Tomasz] Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Fac Econ Sci, Nowoursynowska 166, PL-02787 Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Zawojska, A; Siudek, T (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Fac Econ Sci, Nowoursynowska 166, PL-02787 Warsaw, Poland.",aldona_zawojska@sggw.pl; tomasz_siudek@sggw.pl,"Zawojska, Aldona/C-9397-2011","Zawojska, Aldona/0000-0003-3668-0127; Siudek, Tomasz/0000-0001-8400-5631",,,,,26,0,0,0,1,Warsaw Univ Life Sciences Pr,Warsaw,"Nowoursynowska 166, Warsaw, POLAND",,,978-83-7583-802-2,,,,2018,,,,,,,201,206,,10.22630/ESARE.2018.1.28,0.0,,,6,Development Studies; Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Geography,BO1TN,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000502413100028,0

As an important art and culture form, of course, The Virtue and Filial Piety of Liangzhou has powerful effect to cultivate people to pursue the virtue and standardize their daily behavior admired and implemented by the descendants of Yang and Huang. And the translation of such culture could enlarge its effect, attract more people to care for and inherit it. This paper, based on translation theory, culture inheritance theory, culture going-out theory and comprehension of the materials reflecting the culture of The Virtue and Filial Piety of Liangzhou, explores the translation strategies of such culture from Chinese to English. Research shows that translation of the culture of The Virtue and Filial Piety of Liangzhou from Chinese to English should follow at least nine strategies, and they are translator first, flexible utilization of both foreignization and domestication, translation alteration, adoption of register, human translation, deep translation, functionality + loyalty and scientific administration of translation behavior. And comprehensive utilization of the strategies could provide necessary safeguards for its translation and guarantee the quality of its target text which will be accepted and appreciated by people who use English.","[Zhang Fumin] Hexi Univ, Coll Foreign Languages & Literature, Zhangye 734000, Gansu, Peoples R China",Hexi University,"Zhang, FM (通讯作者)，Hexi Univ, Coll Foreign Languages & Literature, Zhangye 734000, Gansu, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,2,FRANCIS ACAD PRESS,LONDON,"35 IVOR PL, LOWER GROUND, LONDON, NW1 6EA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-912407-98-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,95,101,,,,,,7,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BL4ID,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450418800020,0

The aim of this study was to determine the incremental costs that arise due to the treatment of patients with BPD, in relation to MDD patients adjusted for gender and age. Insured persons who suffered from BPD (F60.3; N = 6599) or MDD (F32, F33; N = 26,396) in the year 2010 were identified from the German Health Risk Institute research database. To estimate the costs resulting from disorder-specific health care service utilization and the mean total costs per patient for the health care system, we analyzed anonymized claims data of individuals with BPD and matched individuals with MDD. The costs resulting from disorder-specific health care service utilization 1 year after index diagnosis amounted to 8508 EUR for BPD and 8281 EUR for MDD per patient utilizing services. With mean total annual costs per patient of 4636 EUR versus 2020 EUR 1 year preceding index diagnosis, 7478 EUR versus 3638 EUR in the year after index diagnosis, and 11,817 EUR versus 6058 EUR 2 years after index diagnosis, BPD patients incurred markedly higher costs. Since the treatment of BPD causes incremental costs for the German health care system compared to the treatment of MDD, and since both conditions are associated with a high level of suffering, there is a need for establishing adequate and early treatment of these mental disorders.","[Bode, Katharina; Kroeger, Christoph] Tech Univ Brunswick, Dept Psychol, Humboldtstr 33, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany; [Vogel, Rolf] Elsevier Hlth Analyt, Jagerstr 41, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Vogel, Rolf; Walker, Jochen] InGef Inst Appl Healthcare Res Berlin, Spittelmarkt 12, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",Braunschweig University of Technology; Reed Elsevier; Elsevier,"Bode, K (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Brunswick, Dept Psychol, Humboldtstr 33, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany.",katharina.bode@tu-braunschweig.de,"Kröger, Christoph/IVU-8770-2023","Kröger, Christoph/0000-0002-2176-6078",,,,,30,20,27,0,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

This review synthesizes the current evidence base examining the contribution of forest and trees to agricultural production and livelihoods in the tropics, where production often occurs within complex land use mosaics that are increasingly subjected to concomitant climatic and anthropogenic pressures. Using systematic review methodology we found 74 studies investigating the effect of forest or tree-based ecosystem service provision on a range of outcomes such as crop yield, biomass, soil fertility, and income. Our findings suggest that when incorporating forests and trees within an appropriate and contextualized natural resource management strategy, there is potential to maintain, and in some cases, enhance yields comparable to solely monoculture systems. Furthermore, this review has illustrated the potential of achieving net livelihood gains through integrating trees on farms, providing rural farmers with additional income sources, and greater resilience strategies to adapt to market or climatic shocks. However, we also identify significant gaps in the current knowledge that demonstrate a need for larger-scale, longer term research to better understand the contribution of forest and trees within the broader landscape and their associated impacts on livelihoods and food production systems.

This phenomenon, the Hawthorne effect, can bias estimates of program impacts. Unobtrusive sensors substituting for human observation can alleviate this bias. To demonstrate this potential, we used temperature loggers to measure fuel-efficient cookstoves as a replacement for three stone fires. We find a large Hawthorne effect: when in-person measurement begins, participants increase fuel-efficient stove use approximately three hours/day (53%) and reduce three-stone fire use by approximately two hours/day (29%). When in-person measurement ends, participants reverse those changes. We then examine how this Hawthorne effect biases estimates of fuel use and pollution concentrations. Our results reinforce concerns about Hawthorne effects, especially in policy-relevant impact evaluations. By measuring the Hawthorne effect we permit researchers to correct for the bias it introduces. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The issue is not only relevant at the macro-economic level, but also has a direct bearing on the growth of regions and cities. In this article, we examine the relationship between structural transformation and economic (output) growth across British cities over the last half-century. During this time, the British economy has gone through a series of extensive structural transformations, most notably a historical shift from an industrial to a post-industrial structure. But also within the dominant 'post-industrial' economy, some service activities have been growing at a faster rate and appear to be more dynamic than others. We show how the structural transformations in the national economy have played out quite differently across British cities, shaping to a considerable extent their divergent growth trajectories over the past five decades. At a broad level, it is possible to distinguish between a number of distinct growth groups of cities, and these also display significant differences in the extent and direction of structural change and reorientation. While differences in structural change have been important in shaping city growth paths, other 'city-specific' factors also appear to have exerted an influence, and thus require investigation. Despite the importance of structural change on the growth trajectories of British cities, the most comprehensive analysis was undertaken some 30 years ago (see Hausner, 1987). This article seeks to fill this lacuna in knowledge.","[Tyler, Peter] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England; [Evenhuisb, Emil; Martin, Ron; Gardiner, Ben] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Downing Pl, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England; [Sunley, Peter] Univ Southampton, Geog & Environm, Univ Rd, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Gardiner, Ben] Cambridge Econometr, Cambridge CB1 2HT, England",University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; University of Southampton,"Tyler, P (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England.",pt23@cam.ac.uk; ee293@cam.ac.uk; rlm1@cam.ac.uk; Sunley@soton.ac.uk; bg@camecon.com,"Evenhuis, Emil/J-4659-2019; Martin, Ronald/JPW-9668-2023","Evenhuis, Emil/0000-0001-8473-245X; SUNLEY, PETER/0000-0003-4803-5299",ESRC [ES/N006135/1]; ESRC [ES/N006135/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/N006135/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This research was undertaken as part of a project funded by the ESRC (ES/N006135/1) into Structural Transformation, Adaptability and City Economic Evolutions, as part of its Urban Transformations Programme.

This paper examines the possibility that both dosage and timing matter for these racial complementarities. Using a model of education production that explicitly accounts for past observable inputs, a conditional differences-in-differences estimation procedure is used to nonparametrically identify dynamic treatment effects of various sequences of interventions. Applying the methodology to Tennessee's Project STAR class size experiment, I find that racial complementarities may vary considerably according to the treatment path. Early exposures to same-race teachers yield benefits that persist in the medium run. This same-race matching effect may explain a nontrivial portion of the black-white test score gap.","[Penney, Jeffrey] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Dept Econ, Bogota, Colombia",Pontificia Universidad Javeriana,"Penney, J (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Dept Econ, Bogota, Colombia.",dr.jeffrey.penney@gmail.com,,,,,,,29,13,22,0,12,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

Consumers appear sensitive to out-of-pocket cessation medication costs, which has relevance to recent Affordable Care Act insurance expansions and coverage regulations.","[Richards, Michael R.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Hlth Policy, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Marti, Joachim] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Hlth Policy, London, England; [Maclean, Johanna Catherine] Temple Univ, Dept Econ, NBER, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Maclean, Johanna Catherine] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Fletcher, Jason] Univ Wisconsin Madison, La Follette Sch Publ Affairs, Madison, WI USA; [Fletcher, Jason; Kenkel, Donald] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kenkel, Donald] Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Dept Policy Anal & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Vanderbilt University; Imperial College London; National Bureau of Economic Research; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; National Bureau of Economic Research; Cornell University,"Richards, MR (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Hlth Policy, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",Michael.r.richards@vanderbilt.edu,"Marti, Joachim/C-5141-2016","Marti, Joachim/0000-0001-5763-3704",University of Pennsylvania Health Policy High Value Care Working Group; Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics,University of Pennsylvania Health Policy High Value Care Working Group; Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics,"We thank NBER and IMS Health for encouraging and facilitating this work through their research initiative launched in 2012.

The management and communication of uncertainty in the L'Aquila earthquake,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,L'Aquila earthquake; L'Aquila trial; Uncertainty management and communication; Mass emergencies; Expert advice,TRIAL,"In the spring of 2009, a strong earthquake shook the Italian city of L'Aquila and the region surrounding it. Besides the tragedy of human and material losses, the disaster triggered an unprecedented series of legal consequences. In this paper, we take the L'Aquila case, in all its psychological, social and legal controversies as exemplary for reflecting on how uncertainty can be recognized, treated and communicated in the context of mass emergencies. We examine the inherent path-dependency and multidimensional nature of uncertainty by projecting it along a number of axes, analyzing how the different components evolve and interact with each other. We show that contradictions, controversies and conflicts are bound to arise in the practice of expert advice for public policy as a result of: 1) the improper reduction of the overall situational uncertainty to its scientific component only; 2) the treatment and communication of scientific uncertainty as an independent variable that can be analyzed and computed in isolation from ethical, political and societal concerns. Finally, we provide some suggestions about a more integrated approach to expert advice for public policy. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Drawing on the 'Varieties of Capitalism' literature, we contend the relationship between finance and income inequality is amplified in countries with liberal market economies (LME). Based on a panel analysis of 17 OECD countries from 1980 to 2007, we find that growth in financial sectors and the financial labor force is associated with higher income inequality, greater wage disparities and a greater concentration of income in the most affluent households. More importantly, we find the magnitude of these effects are stronger in LME and LME-like countries. Specifically, the effect of finance on income inequality is greater in countries with weak collective bargaining, few labor protections and shareholder corporate governance. Overall, the results indicate the importance of national institutions in the relationship between finance and inequality.","[Roberts, Anthony] Calif State Univ Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA; [Kwon, Roy] Univ La Verne, La Verne, CA USA",California State University System; California State University Los Angeles; University of La Verne,"Roberts, A (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA.",arober21@calstatela.edu,,,,,,,93,40,43,3,55,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

The analysis relies on 105 interviews with trade policy professionals in core WTO members and a conceptual distinction between thick' and thin' institutionalism to capture institutional changes in the global trade governance architecture. The WTO's thick institutionalism facilitates institutionalized interactions among members of the trade policy community that are essential for transparency and dialogue and the rule of law character of the trade regime. It secures the continued belief of trade policy professionals in the WTO's centrality in trade governance. The thin institutionalism of the network of preferential agreements spells the return to a la carte forms of trade governance and benefits those with the technical and political capacity to successfully navigate the fragmented governance architecture. Ongoing institutional transformations shift global trade governance away from rules-based back to more power-based forms.","[Trommer, Silke] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Trommer, S (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England.",silke.trommer@manchester.ac.uk,,"Trommer, Silke/0000-0001-9719-8065",Australian Research Council [120101634],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"This project was supported by the Australian Research Council (Discovery Grant 120101634).

Information obtained from a systematic review of published literature and clinicians was used to construct an algorithm depicting the management of nocturia in these three countries. This enabled an estimation of (1) annual levels of healthcare resource use, (2) annual cost of healthcare resource use, and (3) annual societal cost arising from presenteeism and absenteeism attributable to nocturia in each country. In an average year, there are an estimated 12.5, 1.2, and 8.6 million patients a 20 years of age with nocturia in Germany, Sweden, and the UK, respectively. In an average year in each country, respectively, these patients were estimated to have 13.8, 1.4, and 10.0 million visits to a family practitioner or specialist, similar to 91,000, 9000, and 63,000 hospital admissions attributable to nocturia and 216,000, 19,000, and 130,000 subjects were estimated to incur a fracture resulting from nocturia. The annual direct cost of healthcare resource use attributable to managing nocturia was estimated to be approximately a,notsign2.32 billion in Germany, 5.11 billion kr (a,notsign0.54 billion) in Sweden, and A 1.35 pound billion (a,notsign1.77 billion) in the UK. The annual indirect societal cost arising from both presenteeism and absenteeism was estimated to be approximately a,notsign20.76 billion in Germany and 19.65 billion kr (a,notsign2.10 billion) in Sweden. In addition, in the UK, the annual indirect cost due to absenteeism was an estimated A 4.32 pound billion (a,notsign5.64 billion). Nocturia appears to impose a substantial socioeconomic burden in all three countries.

This paper is intended to fill that gap. First, we built up a dynamic model of a consumer's problem of utility maximization in the presence of a nonlinear price schedule embedded in an MSA. Second, the model was implemented using data from a 2-year MSA pilot program in China. The estimated price elasticity under MSAs was between -0.42 and -0.58, i.e., higher than that reported in the literature. The relatively high price elasticity suggests that MSAs as an insurance feature may help control costs.

This means that the economic importance of European beech is expected to increase. The economic potential of a tree basically consists of the stem as well as the economically viable wood volume in the crown. Due to the high morphological variability of European beech crowns, taper models are often not satisfactory for predicting the economically viable wood volume arising from crowns. Prediction models with a higher precision are recently still lacking. Aim of this study is thus the development of prediction model for the economically viable crown wood volume of European beech trees. We determined the distribution of the wood volume in the crown over the branch diameters using the multistage 'randomized branch sampling' method (RBS). The tree-specific wood volume distribution on the branch diameters were used to cluster all sampled trees into 3 groups. Additionally, we developed a method able to distinguish between economically viable and unviable crown branches. Basing on the RBS measurements as well as revenues and processing costs, we modeled the economically viable wood volume from the crown for each tree. To calculate the wood volume under bark, we parameterized a bark thickness function from disk samples of the trees. We showed that the European beech crowns could be clustered into 3 groups differing in their wood volume distribution. The economically viable wood volume in the crown significantly depended on this grouping parameter as well as diameter at breast height (DBH). By contrast, the total amount of wood in the crown only depended on DBH. The differing viable wood volumes in the crowns were thus explained by different wood distributions and not by differing total crown wood volume. To make the results applicable in practice forestry, the modelling results were used to develop a regression formula able to predict the economically viable wood volume in the crown depending on the DBH and the crown type. As the crown type can also be predicted via measurable tree covariates, the regression model of the viable wood volume in the crown can be used as a support tool for the management of European beech stands. Sensitivity analysis quantifies how harvest revenues and costs translate into different viable tree volume. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The question is whether the WTO Appellate Body will recognize bilateral political agreements (such as under Free Trade Agreements, FTAs) that modify WTO obligations between two parties. In addressing this question, the Appellate Body decision in Peru-Additional Duty on Imports of Certain Agricultural Products is important. The decision addressed the availability of defenses under FTAs in WTO disputes, as well as under public international law generally. After critically assessing the decision, we set forth a series of judicial and political choices for addressing the interaction of WTO and FTA rules going forward. In particular, we contend that clear modifications of WTO commitments under an FTA should be recognized by WTO panels as a defense, but subject to the FTA itself complying with WTO requirements under GATT Article XXIV. The case is important not only for trade specialists, but generally for policymakers and scholars of global governance in a world of fragmented international treaties.","[Shaffer, Gregory] Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Law, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Winters, L.

Utilizing data obtained from a natural experiment where some students were able to see their grades prior to teacher evaluations, and to investigate possible sources of bias, we empirically analyzed the role of information (such as the actual grade students received in their current course and their previous grade point average), and the average grade of the course, on the student evaluation of teaching. Because bias is sensitive to the accuracy of grade information, the randomized data examined in this paper are a valuable source for estimating both self-directed and peer-directed bias. We identify the existence of the two kinds of biases and demonstrate that the influence of peer-directed bias tends to increase after the accurate information on the course grade is revealed.","[Cho, Donghun] Hallym Univ, Dept Econ, Gangwon Do 200702, South Korea; [Cho, Joonmo] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 110745, South Korea",Hallym University; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Cho, J (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 110745, South Korea.",hooncho@hallym.ac.kr; trustcho@skku.edu,,,Hallym University Research Fund [HRF-201501-010],Hallym University Research Fund,"We presented this paper at the 2014 Annual Conference held by the Korea Labor Institute and Korean Labor Economic Association.

In this paper we present a comparative study of FT to assess regional variety in nine countries in Asia: China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Laos and Vietnam, using data covering the years 1960-2010. This study's examination of changes in forest area demonstrates that Korea and Japan achieved FT before the 1980s, and that China, Vietnam, India and the Philippines achieved FT more recently, while Indonesia, Malaysia and Laos still experience forest cover decline. Economic development pathway and state forest policy pathway are most common in these nine countries. The globalization pathway is also found to contribute to FT, primarily in countries that are net importers of forest products. The land use intensification pathway is not identified in any of the nine countries. This study also observed that four countries (China, Vietnam, India and the Philippines) tend to achieve FT at relatively low income levels, which may point to the significance of state intervention in the region's countries via forest protection laws, national forest planning and afforestation programs.

Seasonal variation in time of sunset is used to distinguish evasive behavior from daily routines on board. Using data from surveillance flights above the Dutch part of the North Sea during 1992-2011, we provide evidence for a sudden increase in illegal discharges after sunset across the year.

However, most of what is known about the effect of diseases comes from laboratory experiments. Using a farm-level data set containing sea lice infestation counts for all Norwegian salmon farms over an 84-month period, we empirically investigate the biological and economic impacts of observed levels of infective lice. Sea lice, a common ectoparasitic copepod of salmonids, have been shown to reduce fish growth and appetite and cause substantial costs to salmon farmers worldwide. Our results suggest that the percent of total biomass growth lost per production cycle due to average infestations varies from 3.62 to 16.55%, despite control, and depends on farm location. Using a discrete harvesting model, we simulate the economic impact on farm profits over typical cycles. An average infestation over a typical central region spring-release cycle generates damages of US$0.46 per kg of harvested biomass, equivalent to 9% of farm revenues. We estimate that lice parasitism produced US$436m in damages to the Norwegian industry in 2011.","[Abolofia, Jay; Wilen, James E.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Asche, Frank] Univ Florida, Inst Sustainable Food Syst, POB 10570, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Asche, Frank] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, POB 10570, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Asche, Frank] Univ Stavanger, Stavanger, Norway; [Wilen, James E.] Giannini Fdn, Davis, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Universitetet i Stavanger,"Abolofia, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",jayabolofia@gmail.com; Wilen@primal.ucdavis.edu; FrankAsche@ufl.edu,"Asche, Frank/AAG-9920-2020","Asche, Frank/0000-0002-1540-9728","Josh Abbott; Atle Guttormsen; Norwegian Research Council (CT) [216114, 234121]; Giannini Foundation",Josh Abbott; Atle Guttormsen; Norwegian Research Council (CT); Giannini Foundation,"The authors thank Josh Abbott, Atle Guttormsen, two referees, and Editor-in-Chief Marty Smith for helpful comments and the Norwegian Research Council (CT #216114 and CT #234121) and the Giannini Foundation for financial support.",,40,196,200,6,97,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

Currently, empirical literature on term structure models is relatively scarce for CESEE economies due to the degree of financial market development and, consequently, the limited market data availability. Therefore, our approach contributes to this line of research by estimating the model using term structure data starting from 2011 and comparing the results with public information on term premia published by the Federal Reserve. We find that the term premium estimated for Romania generally follows international dynamics, signaling a high degree of sensitivity to external events, with several episodes of diverging behavior largely explained by internal factors. Finally, we analyzed the ways in which the term premium can been used for macro-financial purposes. In this regard, we investigated the manner in which the information set carried by the evolution of term premium can been exploited for predictability of the industrial production, CPI and private credit, as proxies for the business cycles, monetary policy stance and financial cycle/macroprudential stance.","[Alupoaiei, Alexie; Altar-Samuel, Adam] Romanian Amer Univ, Bucharest, Romania; [Kubinschi, Matei] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Alupoaiei, A (通讯作者)，Romanian Amer Univ, Bucharest, Romania.",,"Kubinschi, Matei/IAO-1252-2023","Kubinschi, Matei/0000-0002-3938-1168; Altar, Adam/0000-0001-5469-4528","Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research, CNCS - UEFISCDI [PN-II-RU-TE-2014-2499]","Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research, CNCS - UEFISCDI","This work was supported by a grant of the Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research, CNCS - UEFISCDI, project number PN-II-RU-TE-2014-2499 entitled Coordinating Monetary and Macroprudential Policies.",,11,0,0,0,4,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Analyzing data from 2006 to 2015, the study identifies the co-integration relationship between the spot market price and 1-6-, 9- and 12-month futures contract prices. With exception of the 12-month maturity futures price, the unbiasedness hypothesis is shown to hold, thus evidence of risk neutrality and efficiency among the co-integrated pairs. Further, it is evident that the spot price provides leadership role in the price discovery function for the 1-, 2- and 6-months futures contract. On the contrary, the 3-, 4-, 5-, 9- and 12-months futures contracts provide the expected leadership role in the price discovery function, a case that supports a matured market that can be considered a necessary price risk management tool. The mixed finding is an indication of a maturing or near matured futures market. Analysis of the term structure of futures volatilities reveal that the shorter the length of the futures contract, the more volatility there is. This is because salmon prices exhibit short-term cyclical and seasonal patterns like other agricultural commodities. As such, salmon producers will be better off hedging in far month futures contracts, ceteris paribus.","[Ankamah-Yeboah, Isaac; Nielsen, Max; Nielsen, Rasmus] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Sci, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Ankamah-Yeboah, I (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Fac Sci, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",iay@ifro.ku.dk,"Ankamah-Yeboah, Isaac/O-3944-2019; Nielsen, Rasmus/P-4322-2014; Nielsen, max/F-4544-2015","Ankamah-Yeboah, Isaac/0000-0003-4587-8311; Nielsen, Rasmus/0000-0001-7357-6965;",,,,,67,29,31,0,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

Specifically, we use data from competitive auctions to estimate the effect that land-use regulation protecting endangered caribou in the Canadian province of Alberta has on the price producers pay for the right to extract oil. We exploit a regression discontinuity design to evaluate how prices differ along regulation boundaries that constrain resource development. The auction format and the regulation discontinuity allow us to measure the total cost of the regulation. We find that producers pay 24% less on average for oil leases that are regulated and that the total. net present value cost of the regulation exceeds $1.15 billion for leases sold between 2003 and 2012, all of which is borne by the government.

Making use of a simple Spence-Dixit entry model entry game in the presence of homogeneous goods, this paper studies the possible anticompetitive effect of the adoption of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in the form of consumer friendliness( i.e. firms' attention to consumers' welfare). It is shown that, when the market becomes contestable, the incumbent can endogenously select to adopt CSR to hamper to a greater extent the potential entrant, regardless of its choice to engage in CSR activities. In other words, CSR can become a strategic barrier to entry. More precisely, when entry is considered, the incumbent's choice to follow CSR reduces the sunk cost thresholds that block and deter the entrant's market access, and remarkably shrinks the relevant area of the parameters set in which the incumbent accommodates entry. In other words, market entry is relatively more blockaded and deterred in an industry with CSR. However, it is also shown that, if the fixed costs are sufficiently small, embracing reasonably low CSR rules is a dominant strategy for the entrant which, in such a way, improves its profitability. These findings open a new view of CSR rules and seem to provide a plausible explanation of the empirical evidence that firms following CSR rules are increasingly present in several industries. Moreover, this assertion seems to support the sentiment of the participants in public and academic debates, in which a large majority express the opinion that CSR can give companies a competitive advantage, and social responsibility is a real business issue.","[Buccella, Domenico; Wojna, Michal] Kozminski Univ, Dept Econ, Warsaw, Poland",Kozminski University,"Buccella, D (通讯作者)，Kozminski Univ, Dept Econ, Warsaw, Poland.",buccella@kozminski.edu.pl; michwoj@kozminski.edu.pl,"Buccella, Domenico/F-8981-2019","Buccella, Domenico/0000-0002-9594-0630",,,,,30,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,149,159,,,,,,11,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426857700015,0

With a renewed interest in Max Weber's work, particularly his seminal essay, The protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism, scholars such as Arjun Appadurai and Jens Beckert have analysed calculative devices intrinsic to long-term accounting. Appadurai highlights the charismatic figure of the financial player who speculates on uncertainty, the same realm of uncertainty that in Beckert's work becomes intelligible through the creation of market fictions. In this paper, I instead explore calculation as it unfolds in bazaars selling contraband and pirated electronic goods. Based on an ethnographic account of Delhi's Lajpat Rai market, Palika Bazaar, and Nehru Place, I argue that calculation in the pirate bazaars is of a short-term nature and oriented to an embedded economic rationality that is closely entangled with the longue duree of everyday life. Rather than future-oriented fictions, small-scale traders employ moral stories and piracy-related discourses to meet day-to-day survival needs.","[Deka, Maitrayee] Univ Milan, Dept Social & Polit Sci, Milan, Italy",University of Milan,"Deka, M (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Dept Social & Polit Sci, Milan, Italy.",maitrayee.deka@unimi.it,,,research project P2PValue - European Commission [610961],research project P2PValue - European Commission,"This work was partially supported by the research project P2PValue, funded European Commission [grant agreement 610961].",,36,4,5,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

Global sourcing is one of the most important strategic challenges for enterprises, which to reduce costs have shifted their procurement activity, from the local suppliers to suppliers in countries so-called low-cost. However, the global sourcing process is full of difficulties and risks, often overlooked, that does not always translate into savings of purchasing total costs. The methodology used is based on a comprehensive view of the supply chain which, theoretically shareable, it is rather difficult to implement because of its evolutionary dynamics and the different objectives, often conflicting, of the actors involved. The construction of adequate basics, and systems of knowledge and coordination of the principles governing the management of processes and measurement of operational performance mechanisms are now widely recognized as a performance measurement system, and a significant competitive advantage. The results allow a company to analyze the trend had in the past, and be an instrument for the definition of future improvement targets. Thus, it is important to define a measuring system for monitoring, coordinate, control and identify responsibilities by providing for internal and external risks of individual decision-making processes inherent in a complex situation such as the Supply Chain.","[Dragulanescu, Irina Virginia] Dimitrie Cantemir Christian Univ, Fac Tourism & Commercial Management, 90A Dezrobirii St, Constanta 900234, Romania; [Androniceanu, Armenia] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 Piata Romana,1st Dist, Bucharest 010374, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Dragulanescu, IV (通讯作者)，Dimitrie Cantemir Christian Univ, Fac Tourism & Commercial Management, 90A Dezrobirii St, Constanta 900234, Romania.",dirvimail@yahoo.com; armenia.androniceanu@man.ase.ro,"Dragulanescu, Irina Virginia/IAO-8199-2023; Androniceanu, Armenia/AAC-4697-2020",,,,,,12,2,2,1,5,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,695,702,,,,,,8,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ2BZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418819000078,0

The study used the following methods: a diagnostic survey, a document analysis, desk research. The interview was conducted in the third quarter of 2016. The study verified two hypotheses: 1) LAGs are organizations with growing resource potential and the scope of impact on the development processes of the region, especially in the area of stimulating the integration process of sectors (cross-linking); 2) bureaucracy is still the main barrier to the functioning and implementing the strategic / statutory objectives of LAGs. The assessment of the operation of LAGs in the perspective of 2014-2020, as compared to 2007-2013, indicates their growing role in influencing the processes of local and regional development. This role is reflected in the growth of the resource potential of the organisations and the high effectiveness of LAGs. LAGs insufficiently focus on creating various network links. Bureaucracy is still the main barrier to the effectiveness of achieving the objectives. In the current term, the LDS objectives seem to be the objectives common to all interest groups that constitute these organizations.

Unfortunately, the purchase was funded by a consortium of lenders using multiple currencies and leaving owners open to exchange rate risk.

Maximum seigniorage is generated at a high rate of money growth when dollarization is mild. However, under a high degree of dollarization seigniorage declines sharply when the money growth rate is high. Accordingly, seigniorage can be increased by de-dollarizing the economy through lowering the money growth rate. This finding implies that the post-2013 price stabilization may be a result of the restriction on printing of money with the aim of increasing seigniorage. This finding also recognizes that the North Korean authorities have little room for maneuver on monetary policy under the conditions of widespread dollarization.","[Jung, Seung-Ho; Kwon, Ohik; Mun, Sung Min] Bank Korea, Econ Res Inst, Seoul 04531, South Korea",Bank of Korea,"Kwon, O (通讯作者)，Bank Korea, Econ Res Inst, Seoul 04531, South Korea.",okwon@bok.or.kr,"Jung, Seungho/E-9049-2017","Jung, Seungho/0000-0001-7699-3158",,,,,30,2,2,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

In spite of numerous researches focusing on forecasting bankruptcy using traditional statistics techniques (e.g. discriminant analysis and logistic regression) and early artificial intelligence models (e.g. artificial neural networks), there is a trend for transition to machine learning models (support vector machines, bagging, boosting, and random forest) to predict bankruptcy one year prior to the event. Comparing the performance of this with unconventional approach with results obtained by discriminant analysis, logistic regression, and neural networks application, it has been found that bagging, boosting, and random forest models outperform the others techniques, and that all prediction accuracy in the testing sample improves when the additional variables are included. On the other side the prediction accuracy of old and well known bankruptcy prediction models is quiet high. Therefore, we aim to analyse these in some way old models on the dataset of Slovak companies to validate their prediction ability in specific conditions.

The uncertainity of analysis arises when more than one person is answering the questions.

We find an increase in higher value products and associated revenue, as well as consolidation of catch on larger vessels, vessels taking longer trips, and those catching more per trip. Overall, we estimate that the program led to a measureable increase in fishing profits, mainly due to movement toward higher-value products.

Knowledge management is the key factor in achieving this goal and consequently in a development of a successful organization. This approach to handling organisation's knowledge assets includes various elements and processes and has several supportive infrastructure elements, one of them being information technology. Implementation of knowledge management nowadays implies, or is even unimaginable without the use of at least some of this technology. Because of its importance, there is a wealth of information technology solutions for knowledge management aimed at various purposes and types of organizations, covering some aspects or offering integrated solution. This paper gives an overview of literature covering the research of use of information technology for knowledge management. It also gives a presentation of available information technology according to knowledge management processes related to knowledge creation, acquisition, storage, sharing and application, as well as according to other criteria, such as size of the organization and information technology aspects. Described elements for information technology categorisation are put into mutual relation. Various possibilities and benefits that information technology provides for knowledge management, and taking into account combination of aforementioned criteria should guide the knowledge management system development in an organization.

Responsibility for damage is a liability in which one party is obliged to repair the damage to the other party, and the other is the first to claim damages. The assumptions of liability for damage have been determined by the legal theory and are five assumptions such as subjects responsibility for damage, the harmful action of a perpetrator, damage, causality between harmful actions and damage and unlawfulness. It is also important to point out two criteria for determining liability for damage such as liability on the basis of guilt and accountability based on the criterion of causality. The state as a participant in legal proceedings, at the same time the regulator of the legal formation, must bear the responsibility for the work of their bodies, just as the legal person is responsible for the damages of their employees.

Scope of state subsidies and higher life standards provide better position of legal entity in the eyes of society and every individual - consumer. Financial system of legal entities will be more complex if there is a solid demand for their goods and services, i.e. if legal entity has better market position with respect to competition.

Prices in all markets are found very inflexible, with own-price flexibilities on -0.200 to -0.917, or -0.419 on average, revealing the option of expanding global production and export without inducing a substantial price reduction. Consumers in all markets except Latin America evaluate Pangasius as a necessary good, indicating that the Pangasius industry is relatively little affected by recessions and booms in the world economy. The major markets are substitutes for each other; therefore, if demand at one market region is reduced, the presence of substitution leads suppliers to find other markets.

Analysis of local resources, their evaluation and proficient use contribute to the ability of businesses to implement creative ideas, to introduce new technologies and raise the competitiveness of the existing products, which are the key preconditions for regional development and the mission of smart specialisation. The aim of this research was to carry out an evaluation of the available environmental resources in Vidzeme region and their exploitation in order to identify the unnoticed options for smart development of the region. For this reason, the authors carried out analysis of strategic planning documents, focus group interviews, grouping and analysis of data and information. As the result, the authors identified the VPR potential and possibilities of utilization of environmental resources for the provision of smart development of the region.

These practices aim at reducing the number of bad medicines available on the market, especially in countries where pharmaceutical regulation is still weak. But they have been accused of serving the interests of Big Pharma by reinforcing intellectual property instead of promoting better quality medicines. Based on a study of the controversies provoked by anti-counterfeiting laws and devices, this paper analyses anti-counterfeiting politics and shows: (a) the aim of this mode of government is to discriminate between medicines in order to regulate the value attached to distribution processes and (b) the tensions and contradictions which characterize anti-counterfeiting discourses and practices. As such, a central characteristic of pharmaceutical markets is the shift of value conflicts towards circulation and distribution rather than production. The securitization of pharmaceutical flows, rather than being in addition to the production of pharmaceuticals, emerges as a new disputed way of producing economic value, legality and social legitimacy for globalized technical commodities such as medicines.","[Quet, Mathieu] CEPED IRD, Paris, France",Universite Paris Cite,"Quet, M (通讯作者)，CEPED IRD, Paris, France.",mathieu.quet@gmail.com,,,,,,,33,5,5,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

Through an analysis of the articulation and interaction of medical, cultural, political, and market discourses, the author shows how these have been mobilized within a network of actors and institutions in ways that govern the economic life of opioid products. Dramatic transformations in the domain of pain management have coincided with shifting attitudes toward drug use in popular culture and transformations in health and regulatory policy to orchestrate the materiality of an enormous market for opioid products and make intelligible the problem of a nationwide 'epidemic' of opioid use and abuse.","[Sherman, Melina] Univ Southern Calif, Annenberg Sch Commun & Journalism, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA",University of Southern California,"Sherman, M (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Annenberg Sch Commun & Journalism, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA.",melinash@usc.edu,,"Sherman, Melina/0000-0001-9867-5337",,,,,61,4,5,2,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

J,"Zhou, WH; Xi, JF",,,,"Zhou, Weihuan; Xi, Junfang",,,China's Liberalization of Legal Services Under the ChAFTA: Market Access or Lack of Market Access for Australian Legal Practices,JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This article explores China's commitments to liberalizing legal services under the recently concluded China - Australia Free Trade Agreement (ChAFTA). While China's ChAFTA commitments extend beyond its commitments on legal services under the World Trade Organization and under most of China's other Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), we argue that the degree of liberalization under the ChAFTA has been over-stated. The ChAFTA does not create additional market access for Australian legal practices as it merely recognizes the existing practice in the Chinese market and the same market access granted to Australia has been extended to all other foreign legal practices by initiatives launched in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone. Further, the ChAFTA fails to lift the major regulatory barriers to foreign legal practices in China. Consequently, Australian law firms will continue to compete with other foreign law firms in the same regulatory environment. China is likely to continue to unilaterally liberalize its legal services market via the free trade zones; but such liberalization is likely to be applied to all foreign legal practices. Towards this end, the benefits that the ChAFTA would bring to Australian legal practices are likely to be two-fold: (1) increased business opportunities in cross-border transactions, and (2) strengthened confidence in doing business in China.","[Zhou, Weihuan] UNSW Australia, Fac Law, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Xi, Junfang] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Xi, Junfang] UNSW Australia, Fac Law, Chinese Int Business & Econ Law CIBEL Initiat, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Zhou, WH (通讯作者)，UNSW Australia, Fac Law, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",weihuan.zhou@unsw.edu.au; jfxi@sjtu.edu.cn,"Zhou, Weihuan/HDM-5765-2022",,SJTU-UNSW Collaborative Research Fund on the project titled 'The China-Australia Free Trade Agreement: Implications for Australian Services Suppliers and China's Services Sectors',SJTU-UNSW Collaborative Research Fund on the project titled 'The China-Australia Free Trade Agreement: Implications for Australian Services Suppliers and China's Services Sectors',"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the SJTU-UNSW Collaborative Research Fund on the project titled 'The China-Australia Free Trade Agreement: Implications for Australian Services Suppliers and China's Services Sectors'.

Fewer are optimistic. Taking a pragmatic stance, this paper seeks to identify certain key threats associated with the proliferation of dangerous technologies, giving voice to those in the literature on different sides of the debate. Novel literature is considered that suggests that innovations in the discovery, or research process itself, may hold the key to developing certain collaborative capabilities that can amplify collective intelligence. These capabilities are discussed together with their potential to meet the challenges associated with the proliferation of dangerous technologies. Testable propositions are derived from literature, and four technological scenarios are developed for analysis. Certain key challenges are identified and discussed in relation to each of the technological scenarios. In doing so, what are hopefully useful insights are derived for how changes can be made in the present to help avoid meeting the fates described by certain of these scenarios.","[Callaghan, Chris William] Univ Witwatersrand, Knowledge & Informat Econ, Human Resources Res Agcy, Sch Econ & Business Sci, 1 Jan Smuts Ave, ZA-2000 Braamfontein, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Callaghan, CW (通讯作者)，Sch Econ & Business Sci, Private Bag 3, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.",chris.callaghan@wits.ac.za,"Callaghan, Chris/T-2476-2017","Callaghan, Chris/0000-0002-6554-8363",,,,,51,16,17,0,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,DEC,2018,104.0,,,,,,100,116,,10.1016/j.futures.2018.08.001,0.0,,,17,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,HD5RG,32226096.0,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452587000010,0

Our empirical strategy focuses on lottery winners in an individual fixed-effects framework and hence the variation of winnings arises from within-individual differences in small versus large winnings. The results indicate that lottery winners with larger wins are more likely to choose private health services than public health services from the National Health Service. The positive effect of wins on the choice of private care is driven largely by winners with medium to large winnings (win category 500 pound [or US$750]; mean = 1,922.5 pound [US$2,893.5], median = 1,058.2 pound [US$1,592.7]). There is some evidence that the effect of winnings vary by whether individuals have private health insurance. We also find weak evidence that large winners are more likely to take up private medical insurance. Large winners are also more likely to drop private insurance coverage between approximately 9 and 10 months earlier than smaller winners, possibly after their winnings have been exhausted. Our estimates for the lottery income elasticities for public health care (relative to no care) are very small and are not statistically distinguishable from zero; those of private health care range from 0 to 0.26 for most of the health services considered, and 0.82 for cervical smear.","[Cheng, Terence C.] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Costa-Font, Joan; Powdthavee, Nattavudh] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Powdthavee, Nattavudh] Warwick Business Sch, Coventry, W Midlands, England",University of Adelaide; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Warwick,"Cheng, TC (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",terence.cheng@adelaide.edu.au,"Powdthavee, Nattavudh/K-7230-2019; Cheng, Terence C/IQW-2710-2023; Costa-i-Font, Joan/C-9609-2013","Costa-i-Font, Joan/0000-0001-7174-7919; Powdthavee, Nattavudh/0000-0002-9345-4882",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish; NIA NIH HHS [R01 AG040640] Funding Source: Medline; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,39,7,10,0,68,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",2332-3493,2332-3507,,AM J HEALTH ECON,AM.

The reform shortened the higher secondary education track by one year. As the overall curriculum required for graduation was held constant, this led to an increase in instruction hours in the remaining school years. The reform was introduced at different points in time across federal states, providing us with a difference-in-difference setup for analysis. Based on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP), our results imply that the reform significantly reduced adolescents' self-rated mental health status. The overall effect on the Mental Component Summary Score (MCS) is about a quarter of a standard deviation. Examining MCS sub-dimensions, we find detrimental effects of the reform on vitality and on emotional balance.

Due to high treatment cost and possible severe side effects subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) is not indicated in all patients. Nevertheless, reported treatment rates seem to be low. This study aims to analyze the effects of increasing treatment rates of SCIT in respiratory allergy in terms of costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).MethodsA state-transition Markov model simulates the course of disease of patients with allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma and both diseases over 10years including a symptom-free state and death. Treatment comprises symptomatic pharmacotherapy alone or combined with SCIT. The model compares two strategies of increased and status quo treatment rates. Transition probabilitiesare based on routine data. Costs are calculated from the societal perspective applying German unit costs to literature-derived resource consumption. QALYs are determined by translating the mean change in non-preference-based quality of life scores to a change in utility. Key parameters are subjected to deterministic sensitivity analyses.ResultsIncreasing treatment rates is a cost-effective strategy with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 3484Euro/QALY compared to the status quo. The most influential parameters are SCIT discontinuation rates, treatment effects on the transition probabilities and cost of SCIT. Across all parameter variations, the best case leads to dominance of increased treatment rates while the worst case ICER is 34,315Euro/QALY. Excluding indirect cost leads to a twofold increase in the ICER.ConclusionsMeasures to increase SCIT initiation rates should be implemented and also address improving adherence.","[Richter, Ann-Kathrin; Wasem, Juergen; Biermann-Stallwitz, Janine] Univ Duisburg Essen, Inst Hlth Care Management & Res, Thea Leymann Str 9, D-45127 Essen, Germany; [Klimek, Ludger] Ctr Rhinol & Allergol, Wiesbaden, Germany; [Merk, Hans F.] Univ Clin RWTH, Clin Dermatol & Allergol, Aachen, Germany; [Muelleneisen, Norbert] Asthma & Allergy Ctr, Leverkusen, Germany; [Renz, Harald] Philipps Univ, Inst Lab Med & Pathobiochem, Mol Diagnost, Marburg, Germany; [Wehrmann, Wolfgang] Dermatol Clin Prof Wehrmann Dr Rodder Wehrmann &, Munster, Germany; [Werfel, Thomas] Hannover Med Sch, Dept Dermatol & Allergy, Div Immunodermatol & Allergy Res, Hannover, Germany; [Hamelmann, Eckard] Ruhr Univ, Protestant Hosp Bielefeld, Childrens Ctr Bethel, Bochum, Germany; [Hamelmann, Eckard] Ruhr Univ, Allergy Ctr, Bochum, Germany; [Siebert, Uwe; Sroczynski, Gaby] UMIT Univ Hlth Sci Med Informat & Technol, Inst Publ Hlth Med Decis Making & Hlth Technol As, Hlth Serv Res & Hlth Technol Assessment, Dept Publ Hlth, Hall In Tirol, Austria; [Siebert, Uwe] Harvard Med Sch, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Radiol, MGH ITA, Boston, MA USA; [Siebert, Uwe] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Boston, MA USA","University of Duisburg Essen; RWTH Aachen University; RWTH Aachen University Hospital; Philipps University Marburg; Hannover Medical School; Ruhr University Bochum; Ruhr University Bochum; UMIT - Private University for Health Sciences, Medical Informatics & Technology GmbH; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard Medical School; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

The questionnaire included clinical and demographic characteristics, volume and cost of MS-related resource use, work participation, income, government financial support, and disability status.ResultsThe mean annual total economic costs for the patients and their families were Euro11,603. Indirect costs accounted for 66% and were lower for women than for men. The direct costs were nearly identical for men and women. The costs increased up to Expanded Disability Status Scale score 6 except for steps between 3 and 4 where it remained nearly constant. The costs reduced from EDSS 6 to 8, and increased from 8 to 9. Lifetime costs ranged from Euro24,897 to Euro70,021 for patients with late disease onset and slow progression, and between Euro441,934 and Euro574,860 for patients with early onset and rapid progression.ConclusionThe economic costs of MS impose a heavy burden on the patients and their families.

The empirical analysis is carried out for three time periods (1995, 2001 and 2010) which characterise different stages of the transition process. Our results suggest that the relationship between market size and the number of firms differs both across industries and across periods. In particular, we find that pharmacies, as the only completely liberalised market in our dataset, experience the largest change in competitive behaviour during the transition process.

Even holding land use constant, ecosystem service provision may change through time due to climate change. This paper develops an auction mechanism that implements an optimal solution for providing ecosystem services through time with multiple landowners who have private information about the net benefits of alternative uses of their land. Under the auction, each landowner has a dominant strategy to truthfully reveal their private information. With this information a regulator can then implement the optimal landscape pattern, which maximizes the present value of net benefits derived from the landscape, following the rules of the auction mechanism.

Understanding the assault on the public sector,CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF REGIONS ECONOMY AND SOCIETY,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,,SUBPRIME MORTGAGE; AUSTERITY; POLITICS; CRISIS; RETRENCHMENT; REVENGE; SERVICE; GENDER; RISE; RACE,"This article explores the 'shrinking state', the potential erosion of the state from its customary intervention in regulating economic growth and promoting redistribution and the overall weakening of the state as an institution in local/regional affairs. State retreat may be seen in the withdrawal of finance, services and staff as well as the failure to increase these resources to match growing needs, both of which are referred to as 'retrenchment' or, in the European case, 'austerity'. The erosion of the state as an institution is visible in underfunded social programmes, a smaller public sector, weakened regulatory structures, foregone infrastructure projects, public assets sales and continued privatization. This article argues that the 'shrinking state' both produces and is a product of a restructured social contract between government and citizens and the private sector that has transformed regions and localities. Although we have not seen wholesale state decline, there have been gradations of state change, especially in qualitative markers such as shifts in state functions, scales of activity, constituencies served and private sector involvement in governmental affairs. These changes, in turn, have led to shifts in state capacity and policy orientation that leave populations bereft of needed public services, increased inequality across geographic areas and sociodemographic groups, and political effects such as the growth of right-wing populism.","[Lobao, Linda] Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, 2021 Coffey Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Gray, Mia] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Downing Pl, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England; [Cox, Kevin] Ohio State Univ, Dept Geog, 1036 Derby Hall,154 North Oval Mall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Kitson, Michael] Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Cambridge; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Cambridge,"Lobao, L (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, 2021 Coffey Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",lobao.1@osu.edu; Mia.Gray@geog.cam.ac.uk; cox.13@osu.edu; mk24@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,96,74,77,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

It was noted that many offers are made for some areas but few or none are made for many other areas. As such, a significant number of the timber volumes remains unsold. However, the combination of areas to form bundles can provide economy of scale that is not seen otherwise. We highlight some issues regarding the current allocation system and we analyse the effectiveness of different bundling systems in maximizing government revenues and enhancing bidders' competitiveness. We use actual forest data to evaluate different rules and strategies for the creation and allocation of partial and full bundles. Our results suggest that the use of the option of bundling forests areas makes the auction process more beneficial to the majority of stakeholders: Government revenues are increased; the bidding companies are more likely to obtain the desired volumes and pay less for harvesting and equipment relocation; and greenhouse gas emissions are reduced.","[Ronnqvist, Mikael; D'Amours, Sophie; Carle, Marc-Andre; Azouzi, Riadh] Univ Laval, FORAC Res Consortium, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Carle, Marc-Andre] TELUQ, Quebec City, PQ G1K 9H6, Canada",Laval University; University of Quebec; Universite TELUQ,"Azouzi, R (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, FORAC Res Consortium, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",mikael.ronnqvist@gmc.ulaval.ca; sophie.damours@gmc.ulaval.ca; mcarle@teluq.ca; riadh.azouzi.1@ulaval.ca,"Azouzi, R./AAF-6471-2019; Ronnqvist, Mikael/S-9045-2017","Azouzi, R./0000-0002-7597-6214; D'Amours, Sophie/0000-0003-3278-4949; Ronnqvist, Mikael/0000-0002-1940-6129",Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada [RDCPJ 437426-12]; Canada Research Chairs [950-231157],Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Canada Research Chairs(Canada Research ChairsCGIAR),Financial support from the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (Grant # RDCPJ 437426-12) and the Canada Research Chairs (Grant # 950-231157) are gratefully acknowledged.

The aim of this paper is to investigate differences between measures of subjective well-being and of perceived capabilities in terms of their correlation with dimensions of health-related quality of life using panel data concerning a sample of 293 breast cancer and melanoma patients. Regression analyses suggest that the measures capture quite different aspects of the patients' welfare. Differences in the correlation with dimensions of health also seem consistent with the underlying notions to which these measures refer.

Previous research has strived to solve this puzzle by way of distinguishing between two competing logics which operate within those associations: one logic focusing on the relationship between the member company and the association, a second bringing to bear the relationship between the association and the environment. While in much of this literature the first (membership) logic is sacrificed to the advantage of the second, I argue that members' interests are protected by way of establishing an elaborated set of rules. Such rules guard the association's ports of entry, resolve conflict among members and between members and leadership, activate and emphasize certain interests but also block the associations access to confidential business information, thus insulating parts of business interests from collective representation.","[Behrens, Martin] WSI Hans Bockler Fdn, Dusseldorf, Germany",,"Behrens, M (通讯作者)，WSI Hans Bockler Fdn, Dusseldorf, Germany.",Martin-Behrens@boeckler.de,,,,,,,59,11,11,1,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

However, it may also result in mental health problems such as stress and burnout. The acceleration discourses and dispositifs such as ICT systems have resulted in automatized and accelerated work processes making work more intensified and stressful. The pace of internal and external communication in organizations has also increased, resulting in information overload. The enablers of this acceleration, namely the ICT workers, experience also acceleration. The subjective experience of acceleration as a source of stress for ICT workers has been overlooked in the burnout research. Using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) and mobilizing concepts from critical theory, cybernetics, and discourse theory, this paper presents a systemic perspective on acceleration and ICT worker burnout. The participants have experienced acceleration as a constant time pressure, work intensification, hyperconnectivity, frequent organizational changes, short-termism, and rapid pace of technological change. Consequences were stress, burnout, and work family conflicts. They felt alienated and dehumanized at work. There were some significant differences between French and Norwegian groups' experiences, revealing the intimate link between temporality and culture.","[Evenstad, Solveig Beyza Narli] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, SIC Lab, Nice, France; [Evenstad, Solveig Beyza Narli] Inland Norway Univ Appl Sci, Lillehammer, Norway",Universite Cote d'Azur; Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences,"Evenstad, SBN (通讯作者)，Inland Norway Univ Appl Sci, Lillehammer, Norway.",solveig.evenstad@inn.no,"Evenstad, Solveig Beyza Narli/E-3817-2014","Evenstad, Solveig Beyza Narli/0000-0001-7768-2335",,,,,54,11,12,1,24,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,OCT,2018,103.0,,,,SI,,61,72,,10.1016/j.futures.2018.03.013,0.0,,,12,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,GX1MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447481900007,0

However, a large literature across disciplines finds that extrinsic incentives, once removed, may crowd out intrinsic motivation on subsequent, similar tasks. We conduct a field experiment where students, parents, and tutors are offered incentives designed to encourage student preparation for a high-stakes state standardized test. The incentives reward performance on a separate low-stakes preparatory assessment designed to measure the same skills as the high-stakes test. Performance on the high-stakes test itself, however, is not incentivized. We find substantial treatment effects on the incented tests but no effect on the non-incented test. We also find suggestive evidence that the incentives crowd out intrinsic motivation to perform well on the non- incented test, but this effect is only temporary.

One potential accelerating factor for this phenomenon during recent years is the Internet, which offers different kinds of games and online applications for gambling that are faster, more attractive due to a variety of design and marketing options, less costly and potentially more addictive than terrestrial gambling opportunities. However, the contributing role of the Internet for problematic gambling has not been analyzed sufficiently so far and remains inconclusive. The current study is based on a representative sample with 15,023 individuals from Germany. With a new concept of assessing online gambling with its relative fraction of total gambling activities and a control-function approach to account for possible endogeneity of online gambling, we estimate the impact of online gambling on gambling behavior while additionally controlling for a rich set of important covariates, like education, employment situation and family status. The results show that, on average, replacing 10% of offline gambling with online gambling increases the likelihood of being a problematic gambler by 8.8-12.6%. This increase is equivalent to 139,322 problematic gamblers and 27.24 million a,notsign per year of additional expenditures in the German health sector.

Forest ownership can both create and maintain a strong motive for developing the forest holding and its surroundings. Decisions made by non-industrial private forest (NIPF) owners can therefore be expected to influence population development in the local communities. This paper addresses forest owners' migration propensity, and whether forest ownership influences migration to and from the municipality where the forest holding is located. Comparing the non-forest owners to the group of local NIPF owners, we found that the latter are more sedentary. Forest owners living in their forest municipalities seldom move out- about a third annually compared to others in the same age group. When moving, about half of absentee forest owners select their forest municipality as their destination and thus become local forest owners. Although private forest ownership significantly contributes to population development in small, remote rural municipalities, policies for local and rural development rarely acknowledge the potential private forest owners represent for economic and population development in rural areas.","[Westin, Kerstin; Holm, Einar] Umea Univ, Dept Geog & Econ Hist, Umea, Sweden",Umea University,"Westin, K (通讯作者)，Umea Univ, Dept Geog & Econ Hist, Umea, Sweden.",kerstinwestin@umu.se,,"Westin, Kerstin/0000-0002-6539-7673","Swedish Research Council Formas [2011-1702]; Umea University programme Mobility, Transformation and Regional Growth [UMU-300-2054-12]","Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas); Umea University programme Mobility, Transformation and Regional Growth","This work was supported by the Swedish Research Council Formas under Grant 2011-1702, and by the Umea University programme Mobility, Transformation and Regional Growth, under grant UMU-300-2054-12.",,51,2,2,1,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,SEP,2018,94.0,,,,,,11,20,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.06.003,0.0,,,10,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GP0VG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440528900002,0

However, the improvement in certification rates corresponds to a change of about 0.2-0.3% of a standard deviation in teacher quality per year and we do not find evidence that the bonus resulted in detectible effects on student test achievement.","[Cowan, James; Goldhaber, Dan] Amer Inst Res, 1000 Thomas Jefferson St NW, Washington, DC 20007 USA; [Goldhaber, Dan] Univ Washington, Ctr Educ Data & Res, 3876 Bridge Way N,Suite 201, Seattle, WA 98103 USA",American Institutes for Research; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Cowan, J (通讯作者)，Amer Inst Res, 1000 Thomas Jefferson St NW, Washington, DC 20007 USA.",jcowan@air.org,,"Goldhaber, Dan/0000-0003-4260-4040","Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1088331]; National Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research (CALDER) through Institutes of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education [R305C120008]","Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); National Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research (CALDER) through Institutes of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education","This study was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, through grant #OPP1088331 to the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, and by the National Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research (CALDER), funded through grant #R305C120008 to the American Institutes for Research from the Institutes of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education.

Due to the various roles and meanings that forests play in the region, it becomes urgent to understand how forestry companies disclose their (alleged) corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities. This work aims at identifying which CSR themes are more often disclosed - by companies, - and verifying geographical pattems'according to their heackfuarters - location, in a region where studies on the subject are scarce. A grid of CSR themes enabled the analysis of the website contents of 37 forestry sector firms operating in the CB. Companies were divided in three geographical regions, according to the location of their headquarters: West, Africa, and Asia. The results suggest that the companies value timber certification and prefer to focus on disclosing environmental themes related to their operations. Education and health are the most disclosed themes, in line with contractual obligations. There is a clear relation between the disclosure and the geographical origin of the companies: Western companies disclose more than their Asian and African counterparts. The near-absence of disclosure around human and workers' rights by Asian companies is notorious.","[Colaco, Rui; Simao, Joao] Univ Aberta, Dept Social Sci & Management, R Escola Politecn 141-147, P-1269001 Lisbon, Portugal; [Simao, Joao] Univ Lisbon, CAPP Ctr Publ Adm & Publ Policies, R Almerindo Lessa, P-1300663 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Aberta; Universidade de Lisboa,"Colaço, R (通讯作者)，Univ Aberta, Dept Social Sci & Management, R Escola Politecn 141-147, P-1269001 Lisbon, Portugal.",rbcolaco@gmail.com; joao.simao@uab.pt,"ARIAS, ANA/L-9659-2019","Simao, Joao/0000-0002-7274-8160",Portuguese national funds through FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [UID/CPO/00713/2013]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [UID/CPO/00713/2013] Funding Source: FCT,Portuguese national funds through FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"This work was supported by Portuguese national funds through FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, under project UID/CPO/00713/2013.

In particular, it seeks to understand how specific judgment devices become dominant in resolving uncertainty within these markets. Building on Karpik's seminal theory, we argue that institutional environments (e.g. government regulations, political economic factors, the level of informality within business environments) as well as the level of expertise of consumers, co-determine which devices come to be used in new markets. Empirically, we focus on the emerging market for contemporary art in China. While auctions and auction prices are widely used in valuing contemporary art in China, this is highly illegitimate in international art markets. We argue that auctions act as a judgment device in China because of strong government backing, because other validating organizations, such as museums and art critics, are seen as untrustworthy, and because auctions send strong, easily interpretable signals to novice collectors.","[Kharchenkova, Svetlana] Leiden Univ, Leiden, Netherlands; [Kharchenkova, Svetlana; Velthuis, Olav] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; University of Amsterdam,"Kharchenkova, S (通讯作者)，Leiden Univ, Leiden, Netherlands.;Kharchenkova, S (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",s.s.kharchenkova@hum.leidenuniv.nl,,,VIDI grant of the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO),VIDI grant of the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"This work is part of the larger research project Globalization of High Culture, financed by a VIDI grant of the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO).

Why would a leader do this? We argue that political leaders can gain from such agreements because of the signals they send to their public. The public are less likely to blame leaders for adverse economic conditions when they have implemented sound economic policies, such as signing agreements designed to liberalize trade and prevent a slide into protectionism. In hard economic times, leaders - especially those in democratic environments - may find that trade agreements are a useful way to reassure the public. Since majorities in many countries around the world view trade favorably, leaders may see agreements that prevent them from adopting protectionism as a way to maintain support. We evaluate this argument by analyzing preferential trade agreements (PTAs) formed since 1962. We find that, on average, democratic countries are more likely to form PTAs during hard economic times. We also find that democratic leaders who sign PTAs during downturns enjoy a longer tenure than their counterparts who do not sign such agreements.","[Mansfield, Edward D.] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Milner, Helen V.] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",University of Pennsylvania; Princeton University,"Mansfield, ED (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",emansfie@sas.upenn.edu,,,,,,,85,11,14,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JUL,2018,17.0,3,,,,,371,403,,10.1017/S1474745617000428,0.0,,,33,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,GO8GA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440323800001,0

Our article addresses whether willingness to pay for a QALY (WTP-Q) is sensitive to the size of the health differences and the probability for improvement. We use data from a contingent valuation survey based on 1400 respondents conducted in the spring of 2014.

Such supports are climate friendly if the renewables are already competitive against fossil fuels. But if the renewables are not yet competitive, the climate change impacts are often ambiguous and are sensitive to capacity constraints of renewables production and to the fossil fuel market structure. If the renewables do not have capacity constraints, then the subsidies are subject to the Green Paradox under perfect competition, but might be climate friendly under monopoly. Supports for capacity constrained renewables under perfect competition lead to more current fossil fuel supply but delay fossil fuel exhaustion time, and these effects are reversed under monopoly. Our results highlight the importance of considering the long-term effects on fossil fuel supply as well as capacity constraints and market power in designing renewable energy policies and evaluating their carbon footprints.

We overcome this limitation by validating several performance-task measures of teacher conscientiousness based upon the effort that teachers exert while completing a survey. We conduct our analysis using the Measures of Effective Teaching Longitudinal Database where teachers were randomly assigned to their classrooms in the second year of the study. We overcome issues of noncompliance by exploiting the random assignment in an instrumental variables approach to estimate the causal impacts of teachers on their students' outcomes during the second year of the MET project. We find suggestive evidence that measures of teacher survey effort capture important dimensions of teacher quality. These measures present small but significant correlations with classroom-observation measures and principal ratings of teacher quality and are predictive of student cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes. Moreover, survey-effort measures capture teacher effects on students that are not necessarily captured by other available measures of teacher quality.","[Cheng, Albert] Harvard Univ, Program Educ Policy & Governance, 79 John Kennedy St,Taubman 361, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Arkansas, 219B Grad Educ Bldg, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",Harvard University; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Cheng, A (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Program Educ Policy & Governance, 79 John Kennedy St,Taubman 361, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",albert_cheng@hks.harvard.edu,,,,,,,54,14,19,3,27,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,1873-7382,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

Over the past two decades, policy strategies including the federal No Child Left Behind Act and alternative pathways to teaching, as well as changes in the broader labor market, have altered the context in which academically skilled college graduates choose whether to enter teaching, and, if so, where to teach. Using data from 1993 to 2008, we find that schools nationwide are recruiting a greater share of academically skilled college graduates into teaching, and that increases in teachers' academic skills are especially large in urban school districts that serve predominantly nonwhite students. On the other hand, the increase in the share of academically skilled teachers coincides with the lower likelihood of nonwhite teachers being employed. Once teaching, nonwhite teachers report substantially lower job satisfaction than other teachers. The issue of how to recruit and support an academically skilled and diverse teacher workforce remains pressing.","[Master, Benjamin] RAND Corp, Arlington, VA 22202 USA; [Sun, Min] Univ Washington, Coll Educ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Loeb, Susanna] Stanford Univ, Ctr Educ Policy Anal, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",RAND Corporation; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Stanford University,"Sun, M (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Coll Educ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",bmaster@rand.org; misun@uw.edu; sloeb@stanford.edu,,"Loeb, Susanna/0000-0003-1854-8843",Smith Richardson Foundation; National Science Foundation [DRL-1506494]; Direct For Education and Human Resources; Division Of Research On Learning [1506494] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Smith Richardson Foundation; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Education and Human Resources; Division Of Research On Learning(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)),"The authors acknowledge the support of the Smith Richardson Foundation.

Logistic regressions were run to test the impact of diabetes and its complications on the probability of being afraid health limits work and being a formal volunteer. The longitudinal sample for the former outcome includes 53,631 observations, clustered in 34,393 individuals, aged 50-65 years old whereas the latter consists of 45,384 observations, grouped in 29,104 individuals aged 65 and above across twelve European countries taken from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, from 2006 to 2013. Diabetes increased the probability of being afraid health limited work by nearly 11% points, adjusted by clinical complications, and reduced the likelihood of being a formal volunteer by 2.7% points, additionally adjusted by mobility problems. We also found that both the probability of being afraid health limits work and the probability of being a formal volunteer increased during and after the crisis. Moreover, having diabetes had a larger effect on being afraid health limits work during the year 2010, possibly related to the financial crisis. Our findings show that diabetes significantly affects the perception of people regarding the effects of their condition on work, increasing the fear that health limits their ability to work, especially during the crisis year 2010, as well as the participation in volunteering work among retired people.","[Rodriguez-Sanchez, B.; Alessie, R.

If resource users care about the welfare of others, they may be unwilling to respect property rights regimes that lead to unfair or inequitable outcomes. We explore in a series of laboratory experiments whether it is possible to undermine the efficacy of property rights solutions through the allocation process. We find that both the extent to which property rights are enforced and how they are allocated significantly affect extraction and compliance. Our findings suggest that one of the most popular allocation methods is suboptimal: we observe that occasional enforcement and the proportional allocation of property rights is dominated by no enforcement and the equal or inverse allocation of property rights. Our results support the view that allocation matters for property rights solutions to the commons problem. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

I examine a policy reform that occurred in England in academic year 2007/2008, which provided free transport to low socio-economic status (SES) students to schools between 2 and 6 miles away from home only, but not to closer schools. Using confidential panel school micro data, providing information on the postcode of both schools and students' residence, I find strong evidence of a decline in the probability of attending schools closer than 2 miles. Conversely, the decrease in the cost of travelling affects negatively the quality of the school attended. Consistent with the predictions of a simple theoretical model, results suggest that the negative estimates on quality are driven by students who are willing to trade quality for savings in transport costs. This mechanism is reinforced by school over-subscription combined with distance-based admission criteria, which de facto limits choice to low quality institutions.","[Masi, Barbara] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ & Econ Hist, Edifici B,Campus Bellaterra, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Masi, B (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ & Econ Hist, Edifici B,Campus Bellaterra, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",barbara.masi@uab.cat,,,,,,,57,2,3,0,9,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,1873-7382,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

I demonstrate that combining diverse alternatives into a single outside option can result in distorted parameter estimates and misleading predictions. To evaluate the practical importance of how outside options are treated, I use data on the Florida spiny lobster and stone crab fisheries to compare a discrete choice model that explicitly accounts for individuals' ability to target both species with one that includes stone crab alternatives in the generic outside option. I find that parameter estimates and predictions for the lobster fishery depend heavily upon whether stone crab alternatives are explicitly accounted for. In addition, I conduct a series of Monte Carlo experiments, which demonstrate that the sign and magnitude of differences in predictions between models are complex functions of the characteristics of the empirical environment. Together, these results highlight the importance of carefully considering the composition of outside options when estimating discrete choice models and making predictions based on the estimates.

A systematic review of the literature associated with the long-term consequences of four key outcomes from the Building Blocks trial, specifically, low birth weight, smoking during pregnancy, interval to subsequent pregnancy and A&E attendance or inpatient admission was conducted. These factors were guided by the funders, the Department of Health, as being of particular interest in the UK context. Relevant studies were identified from a number of sources including large databases, reference checking and citation searching. The search yielded 3665 papers, 43 of which were considered appropriate for inclusion. Of these, 29 were relating to smoking during pregnancy, 13 to low birth weight, 0 to A&E attendances during early childhood and 1 to short (< 2 years) interval to subsequent pregnancy. Consistent associations were found between maternal smoking during pregnancy and the effects this has on children's health, educational attainment and likelihood of engaging in problem behaviour and criminal activity in later life. Low birth weight was also found to impact on children's long-term health and cognitive development. Subsequent pregnancies within two years of the previous birth were linked with increased likelihood of pre-term birth and neonatal death. Only minimal evidence was identified regarding the consequences of a short interval to second pregnancy and of child A&E and outpatient attendances. Given that these outcomes have been identified by the UK Department of Health as of particular interest for UK benefit, investment of research in these areas is recommended to establish a clearer picture of both short and long-term consequences.","[Bell, Kerry; Corbacho, Belen; Ronaldson, Sarah; Torgerson, David] Univ York, Dept Hlth Sci, York Trials Unit, ARRC Bldg, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Richardson, Gerry] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Robling, Michael] Cardiff Univ, Ctr Trials Res, Cardiff CF14 4YS, S Glam, Wales",University of York - UK; University of York - UK; Cardiff University,"Bell, K (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Hlth Sci, York Trials Unit, ARRC Bldg, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",Kerry.Bell@york.ac.uk; Belen.Corbacho@york.ac.uk; Sarah.Ronaldson@york.ac.uk; Gerry.Richardson@york.ac.uk; David.Torgerson@york.ac.uk; roblingmr@cardiff.ac.uk,"Torgerson, David/L-4566-2019","Torgerson, David/0000-0002-1667-4275; Bell, Kerry Jane/0000-0001-5124-138X; Ronaldson, Sarah Jane/0000-0001-8321-786X",Policy Research Programme in the Department of Health [006/0060],Policy Research Programme in the Department of Health,This in an independent research commissioned and funded by the Policy Research Programme in the Department of Health (reference 006/0060).

The environmental policies developed for NAFTA were predominantly concerned with addressing hypothetical concerns such as industry flight, pollution havens, downward harmonization, and conflicts between environmental laws and trade regime rules. These policies have endured and served as the template for subsequent US trade agreements. Twenty-five years on, however, research has shown that the actual effects of trade liberalization on the environment are not as drastic or far-reaching as originally thought. Thus, the inclusion of extensive environmental policies within trade agreements in general, and NAFTA in particular, may no longer be justified. Rather, there is a need to update the policy framework for NAFTA to focus on building the institutional capacity of its trading partners where it is most needed in conjunction with the inclusion of a small set of core environmental policies focused on a conflict of rules.","[Allen, Linda J.] Amer Publ Univ Syst, Environm Policy & Econ, Sch Sci Technol Engn & Math, Charles Town, WV 25414 USA",American Public University System,"Allen, LJ (通讯作者)，Amer Publ Univ Syst, Environm Policy & Econ, Sch Sci Technol Engn & Math, Charles Town, WV 25414 USA.",,,,,,,,56,2,2,0,1,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

We conclude that the use of the procedures is not advocated if classical inference is to be employed in the final selected model, while the procedures can potentially be useful for predictive purposes in some situations. The findings we have obtained are in agreement with similar studies available in the literature and have important implications for the practice of data analysis.

It starts from the dual premises that it is necessary to recognize and value as important the economic, social, and environmental contributors to economic welfare and desirable for ecological and feminist economists to collaborate in moving toward a sustainable future. The study examines the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), formulated and developed by environmental-ecological economists, as a potentially useful measure that responds to both feminist and ecological economic concerns by making visible unpaid care labor and the environment. As an accounting framework that applies the monetary imputation approach, the GPI is objectionable to some ecological and feminist economists. Reviewing debates among feminist and ecological economists, this study argues that the goals and potential objections of both groups may be addressed by complementing GPI with a narrative approach in a plural and conditional policy-input process.","[Berik, Gunseli] Univ Utah, Econ, 332 South 1400 East,Rm 244, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Berik, G (通讯作者)，Univ Utah, Econ, 332 South 1400 East,Rm 244, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",,,,,,,,83,11,10,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Social networks are recognized as a popular and widely used marketing tool hence they present different information about the product and the brand to various market segments. Specifically for these media, every contact with the brand via social network does not necessarily mean that the user is also an actual or a potential buyer. Taking into account the dominance of Facebook usage among others social networks in Croatia, this paper aims to understand the primary motives driving the Facebook users to be connected with the brand. The research methodology includes a questionnaire-based study on a sample of 207 Facebook users. The results point out that the main motivation attribute is to have real-time information about product and events related to the product. In addition, some study observations show that there is a significant statistical positive correlation between benefits of being informed of competition and social interactions and information as motive, as well as the respondents' engagement in social networks positively affects self-esteem.","[Bilic, Ivana] Univ Split, Fac Econ Business & Tourism, Split, Croatia; [Dzepina, Milena Jelic] Solar Projekt Doo, Split, Croatia; [Tankovi, Ana Cuic] Univ Rijeka, Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management, Rijeka, Croatia",University of Split; University of Rijeka,"Bilic, I (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Fac Econ Business & Tourism, Split, Croatia.",ibilic@efst.hr; milenajelic87@gmail.com; anact@fthm.hr,"Bilić, Ivana/D-6348-2017; Čuić Tanković, Ana/I-9211-2016","Bilić, Ivana/0000-0002-9617-6611; Čuić Tanković, Ana/0000-0002-4383-684X",,,,,20,0,0,0,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,386,394,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO8KK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000527683300043,0

The results of the study reveal that both prices exhibit a common stochastic trend and their spread have co-integrating properties. The hypothesis stating that they equally quickly revert to the long-run equilibrium relationship is rejected. An increased conditional volatility of their returns is observed during the crisis and after that a slightly decreasing albeit very close to unity their conditional correlation coefficient. Nevertheless, a constant conditional correlation hypothesis (CCC-MGARCH) is rejected.

Solution of this situation will take place, among others, through the stands of pioneer species, including birch (Betula pendula Roth). But it is also available to grow the birch up to the felling age. In such a case a question about the utilization of birch raw wood in the Czech Republic occurs, because it has an impact on the prices of birch raw wood. The article deals with the analysis of possibilities of use of birch raw wood, prices of its assortments and a comparison with beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). On the one hand, there are no extensive capacities to process the birch raw wood into products with higher added value. On the other hand, the prices of birch raw wood are lower than in the case of beech, and because of that, for a range of products the processing of birch wood might be an interesting alternative in relation to beech.","[Dudik, Roman; Palatova, Petra; Riedl, Marcel] Czech Univ Life Sci, Dept Forestry & Wood Econ, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, Prague, Czech Republic; [Boruvka, Vlastimil] Czech Univ Life Sci, Dept Wood Proc, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Dudík, R (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci, Dept Forestry & Wood Econ, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, Prague, Czech Republic.",ro.dudik@gmail.com,"Riedl, Marcel/AAU-5030-2021; Dudík, Roman/AAK-9261-2020; Palátová, Petra/AAD-2523-2019; Borůvka, Vlastimil/J-7001-2019","Riedl, Marcel/0000-0003-4087-3722; Borůvka, Vlastimil/0000-0002-2559-5712; Palatova, Petra/0000-0002-1697-7284","National Agency for Agricultural Research of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic [QJ1530032]; Grant service Forests of the Czech Republic [3/2016, 43170/9010/9017]",National Agency for Agricultural Research of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic; Grant service Forests of the Czech Republic,"The authors are grateful for the grant was supported by the National Agency for Agricultural Research of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic (projects No. QJ1530032) and by the Grant service Forests of the Czech Republic, state enterprise (projects No. 3/2016, internal No. 43170/9010/9017).",,9,3,3,0,2,FAC FORESTRY BELGRADE UNIV,BELGRADE,"KNEZA VISESLAVA 1, BELGRADE, 11070, SERBIA",,,978-86-7299-277-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,90,95,,,,,,6,"Economics; Engineering, Manufacturing; Forestry",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Forestry,BM4XC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000464293200010,0

Although politically connected directors have a significant role in the approval of PEPs, they are more likely to reduce the monitoring effects and increase agency problems, which lead to increased cost of PEPs and reduced proceeds from PEPs.

However, in terms of sustainable economic development, the population aging is a matter of concern for the whole world. In many European countries, including Russia and the Czech Republic, politicians use pro-natalist policy for the purpose of fertility stimulation and further deceleration of the population aging. The reduction in the number of children (fertility decline) and the increase in the number of elderly (increasing longevity) are two of the main factors causing the aging of the population. Further growth of life expectancy in Russia and the Czech Republic will accelerate the pace of the population aging, which would make pro-natalist policy even more relevant. This article deals with current pro-natalist policy in the Russian Federation and the Czech Republic and also provides options to enhance its effectiveness. The purpose of the study is to assess the existing tools of pro-natalist policy; to develop its more effective options which are framed by the need to decrease the speed of the population ageing in Russia and the Czech Republic.","[Gokova, Olga; Kiseleva, Albina] Dostoevsky Omsk State Univ, Dept Reg Econ & Terr Management, Lickiewicz Sq 1, Omsk 644077, Russia",Dostoevsky Omsk State University,"Gokova, O (通讯作者)，Dostoevsky Omsk State Univ, Dept Reg Econ & Terr Management, Lickiewicz Sq 1, Omsk 644077, Russia.",capri484@yandex.ru; albkis@mail.ru,"Киселева, Альбина/AAO-3871-2021; Gokova, Olga/AGO-5630-2022","Киселева, Альбина/0000-0002-6999-2955;",,,,,12,0,0,0,4,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,502,511,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400050,0

The Russian model of tax revenue distribution has the following features: First is delineation of powers to the taxes collection and fixing them for certain taxes. Second is the normative division between budgets of different levels of income from specific types of taxes levied at uniform rates throughout the territory. Third is joint use of the tax base. Thus, the current mechanism for generating revenues of Regional and local budgets directly depends on the decisions made by the higher budget level, since their volume depends on the size of types of taxes transferred and the allocations norms to the respective budgets. The analysis of tax revenues has made it possible to identify the problems of Regional budgets formation. Thus, the joint use of corporate profit tax bases and the ability of federal center to influence the change in such an element as the tax rates has had a significant impact on regional budgets' revenues. In addition, the functioning of consolidated groups of taxpayers in calculating the corporate income tax resulted in significant losses in regional budgets' revenues. All the above facts, as well as the provision of other preferences for taxpayers, form budget losses in the falling income form. The study which has been made gives us a possibility to formulate concrete proposals for reducing such falling revenues of regional budgets, in particular, by improving the budget and tax legislation.","[Gorshkova, Natalia Valeryevna; Dorzdeev, Alexander Vladimirovich; Ksenda, Victoria Mikhailovna] Volgograd State Univ, Inst Econ & Finance, Volgograd, Russia",Volgograd State University (VOLSU),"Gorshkova, NV (通讯作者)，Volgograd State Univ, Inst Econ & Finance, Volgograd, Russia.",GorshkovaNV@volsu.ru; dorzhdeev_av@volsu.ru; KsendaVM@volsu.ru,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-514-6,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,39.0,,,,,,188,193,,,,,,6,Business; Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BO4YG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000515721900041,0

Efficiency estimated with the use of these methods is rarely used for the assessment of joint-stock companies. There are three main goals of the research. Firstly, it aims to verify whether there is a statistical valid dependence between operating efficiency of joint-stock companies in Poland and their return rates on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. The second aim of the research is to point variables which should be used to estimate operating efficiency of companies in chosen industries. The other aim is to verify if an investor may benefit from information about operating efficiency of joint-stock companies when building an investment portfolio.

There is a distinction in accounting treatment of each type of lease. Significant differences are observed in financial statements of lessee. According to IAS 17, if there is a contract about the operating lease the lessor recognize the asset in lease in its financial statement of financial position, while the lessee recognizes only the costs of rent in its income statement (but not the assets in lease and financial liabilities related to lease during lease period). If there is a contract about the finance lease, the lessee recognizes the assets in lease and financial liabilities related to lease in its financial statement of financial position. Many of financial statements users have highlighted disadvantages of accounting model for operating lease, primarily because there are not evident financial liabilities during whole lease period in the statement of financial position of a lessee. Therefore, the financial statements of a lessee are not representing faithfully its financial position as well lessees' indebtedness is not appropriate presented. In order to enhance the accounting model for leases, in January 2016 the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued a new accounting standard IFRS 16 Leases that will become effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 (IFRS 16 will replace IAS 17). New IFRS 16 implement unique accounting model for all leases in financial statements of a lessee. Changes in lease accounting are focused on better and comprehensive presentation of accounting information related to leases in financial statements. The implementation of new accounting model will influence on the coverage of information presented in financial statements, and consequently on financial ratios of a lessee. The goal of this paper is to investigate and analyse key effects which the implementation of IFRS 16 and new accounting model for lease will have on financial statements. The main consequences and effects of implementation of IFRS 16 are analyzed through the case study.","[Hladika, Mirjana; Valenta, Ivana] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Hladika, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia.",mhladika@efzg.hr; ivalenta@efzg.hr,"Hladika, Mirjana/I-1152-2018",,,,,,14,0,0,1,19,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,255,263,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO8KK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000527683300028,0

Private label OTC drugs have been sold on the Czech market since 2013. Taking their brief historic overview into consideration, their advantage is a lower price compared to OTC brand drugs. A lower price should produce a greater benefit over time in the period of an increasing CPI, especially the CPI of categories with the highest weight. To discover if there is a relation between the OTC drug category and some of the highest weight categories, a linear correlation analysis among CPI variables was used. Although the results indicate that the CPI of OTC drugs correlates with the CPI of some of the categories with the highest weight, it is not a general rule applicable to all categories. The inverse relation appears in the categories of communication, transport, prescription drugs, food and non-alcoholic beverages and furnishings, household equipment and routine maintenance of the house. According to these results, consumers tend to pay less for the OTC drugs in the periods of time when they pay more for the categories mentioned above. Contrarily, a correlation with miscellaneous goods and services, alcoholic beverages and tobacco, restaurants and hotels, education, clothing and footwear and recreation and culture exists. After linking these results with the weight of individual categories, the results confirmed that the inverse relationship shows up in the category of food and non-alcoholic beverages and transport category and vice versa mainly in the category of alcoholic beverages and tobacco. However, considering the success of the private label products in other categories private label drugs have potential on the Czech market regardless if there is an increase in CPI or not.","[Loubalova, Eva] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Loubalová, E (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic.",Eva.loubalova@seznam.cz,,,Internal Grant Agency of FaME,Internal Grant Agency of FaME,The author would like to thank the Internal Grant Agency of FaME for providingfinancial support to carry out this research.

As HE undergoes a process of marketisation, and the teaching and research activities of academics are increasingly measured and scrutinised, the contemporary academy appears to be suffused with anxiety. Coupled with pressures facing all staff, 34% of academic employees are currently working on a fixed-term contract and so must contend with the multiple forms of uncertainty associated with their so-called 'casualised' positions. While anxiety is often perceived as an individualised affliction for which employees are encouraged to take personal responsibility, the article argues that it should be conceptualised in two ways: firstly, as a symptom of wider processes at work in the neoliberalising sector; and secondly, as a lactic' of what Isin [(2004). The neurotic citizen. Citizenship Studies, 8 (3), 217-235] refers to as 'neuroliberal' governance. The article concludes by proposing that the figure of the 'neurotic academic' is emblematic of the contradictions facing the contemporary academy.","[Loveday, Vik] Goldsmiths Univ London, Dept Sociol, London SE14 6NW, England",University of London; Goldsmiths University London,"Loveday, V (通讯作者)，Goldsmiths Univ London, Dept Sociol, London SE14 6NW, England.",v.loveday@gold.ac.uk,,,British Academy [SG142753],British Academy,This work was supported by the British Academy [SG142753].,,71,93,96,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

Second, experiments on different perspectives are performed to probe the relationship between variables and the accuracy of the classifier. Third, we use the classifier to predict the weekly news.

Standard econometric models often fail to take into account non-seasonal cyclicality present in some of the series under consideration. In particular in many cases the models either assume mean-reversion (so the forecast paths stabilize at some value) or a random-walk type behaviour (so the forecast paths are determined by the last observation available). In other words, it is not easy to obtain forecasts that reveal future turning points (so are capable of forecasting of out-of-sample deviations from mean).In order to deal with the issue we make use of Bayesian deterministic cycle models based on Flexible Fourier type representation in order to analyse dynamic behaviour of FAO food price indexes. We focus on prediction of individual year-on-year growth rates in horizons ranging from one to twenty four months ahead. As the purpose of the paper is to analyse performance of density forecasts, we investigate log-predictive score as well as continuous ranked probability score. We find a clear pattern of fluctuations in dairy prices and a bit less-evident cyclical-like fluctuations in meat prices, so the deterministic-cycle models are relevant for the series.","[Mazur, Blazej] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Econometr & Operat Res, Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Mazur, B (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Econometr & Operat Res, Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",blazej.mazur@uek.krakow.pl,"Mazur, Błażej/V-3905-2018","Mazur, Błażej/0000-0001-5096-5175","National Science Centre, Poland [2017/25/B/HS4/02529]","National Science Centre, Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","This research was supported by the research grant 2017/25/B/HS4/02529 financed by the National Science Centre, Poland.",,13,1,1,1,3,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",2545-1227,,978-83-65907-20-2,SOC ECON MODEL FOREC,,,2018,1.0,,,,,,286,295,,10.14659/SEMF.2018.01.29,0.0,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BQ1LQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000576774700029,0

The mechanisms necessary to ensure clusters successful functioning as territorial systems are highlighted. It is proved that any cluster shows its highest efficiency in cases when the participants interacting with each other in the processes of exchange and distribution of resources and conditions demonstrate cooperation, while in the process of production of cluster gross product they demonstrate competition.

Taking Germany and an empirical study about its parliament as an example, current political discourse on growth is shown to be predominantly governmental, ornamental, dogmatic, and - most importantly - 'inert' (i.e., unresponsive to individual MP's convictions). It is made plausible that these features are linked to the suppression of growth's character as a political option that was historically configured and chosen to mitigate distributional conflicts. Thus, redistribution forms part of the growth discourse's 'political unconscious.' If this were true, a key for greater political impact of growth critique would lie in the combination with issues of inequality and redistribution, rather than only with concerns about the environment or a better quality of life.","[Rivera, Manuel] IASS, Berliner Str 130, D-14467 Potsdam, Germany",,"Rivera, M (通讯作者)，IASS, Berliner Str 130, D-14467 Potsdam, Germany.",manuel.rivera@iass-potsdam.de,"Rivera, Manuel/HKO-7765-2023","Rivera, Manuel/0000-0003-1224-3010",,,,,64,6,6,0,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,JAN,2018,95.0,,,,,,1,10,,10.1016/j.futures.2017.09.002,0.0,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,FV6VZ,,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424721500001,0

In Italy, public sector reform processes tend to follow a legalistic and juridical view to change leading to hybridization between traditional administrative culture and managerial culture. Public sector management reform following a legalistic perspective is leading to process of change in which new values drawn from managerial principles and administrative principles drawn by law based tradition and legalistic culture tend to emerge and orient innovation and change. The study relies on the analysis of literature to understand the dynamics of change and reform within public sector with regards to public sector management reform and public employment reform in the Italian public sector.

The results indicate that education, secure property rights, internet access, participation in organizations, commercialization methods, government instruments, understanding of credit, and social learning promote innovation decisions.

Using data from the Annual Survey of Industrial Firms (ASIF) during 1999-2007, this article examines whether credit allocation impacts Chinese firms' productivity under financial imperfection. Our results show that the size of credit market has no influence on Chinese firms' total factor productivity (TFP), while allocating more credit to non-SOEs significantly promotes firm TFP. Our further analysis shows that firms which are less subsidized, smaller, more external financially dependent, and more labor intensive are affected more by credit allocation.

This article extends the original work by accounting for guessing and provides adjusted estimators using the existing disaggregated values. Further, Monte Carlo simulations of the adjusted learning type estimates are provided.

Each of the distinguished substantive types of motivation is differentiated according to several subtypes, depending on the combination of selected motivations. In accordance with this, the following subtypes of pure motivation were formed: physiological, personal, social. The mixed types of motivation include such subtypes as socio-personal, physical-social, physical-personal and uniform. The most numerous group of respondents identified the leading motivations for parenting as personal growth and self-realization in parenthood. The obtained data was compared with the results of a survey of childless youth about the motivation for parenthood. For the majority of future parents, the main motivation for the birth and upbringing of a child is self-preservation in children (mostly physical, to a lesser extent - intellectual), ensuring survival and security through the formation of social and family ties. Motivations of personal development and the prestige of parenthood are secondary for potential parents. This once again shows how much ideas about parenting differ from the real experience of it.","[Voroshilova, Anzhelika] Ural Fed Univ, Mira St 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia",Ural Federal University,"Voroshilova, A (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, Mira St 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia.",a.i.voroshilova@urfu.ru,"Voroshilova, Anzhelika/E-4184-2019","Voroshilova, Anzhelika/0000-0003-4022-9742",Russian Federation [NSh-3429.2018.6],Russian Federation(Russian Federation),"The article is processed as one of the outputs of the research project Fertility and parenting in Russian regions: models, invigoration strategies, forecasts, supported by the President of Russian Federation, project no.

This study estimated the cost-effectiveness of palivizumab prophylaxis versus placebo, in Spain, from the societal perspective, using a novel cost-effectiveness model reflecting evidence-based clinical pathways. Methods: A decision-analytic model, combining a decision tree structure in the first year and a Markov structure in later years, was constructed to evaluate the benefits and costs associated with palivizumab versus no prophylaxis among children with CHD. In the first year of the model, children were at risk of mild (i.e. medically attended, MA-RSV) and severe (hospitalized, RSV-H) RSV infection. The impact of delayed corrective CHD surgery due to RSV infection and the consequence of performed surgery despite severe infection were considered. In later years, patients were at risk of developing asthma and allergic sensitization as sequelae of RSV infection. Input data for the model were derived from the pivotal clinical trial and systematic literature reviews. Indirect costs included parental absence from work and nosocomial infections. In agreement with Spanish guidelines, costs and effects were discounted at 3%. Results: Over a lifetime horizon, palivizumab prophylaxis yielded 0.11 and 0.07 additional quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and life years (LYs), respectively, at additional costs of (sic) 1,693, resulting in an ICER of (sic) 15,748 per QALY gained and (sic) 24,936 per LY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the probability of palivizumab prophylaxis being cost-effective at a (sic) 30,000 per QALY threshold was 92.7%. The ICER remained below this threshold for most extreme scenario analyses. Conclusions: The model demonstrated that palivizumab prophylaxis results in more QALYs than no prophylaxis in children with CHD. Palivizumab prophylaxis was shown to be a cost-effective health care intervention according to the commonly accepted standards of cost-effectiveness in Spain (ICER below the threshold of (sic) 30,000 per QALY).","[Schmidt, Ralph] Pharmerit Int Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Zimmerstr 55, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Majer, Istvan] Pharmerit Int Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Garcia Roman, Natalia] AbbVie, Dept Med, Madrid, Spain; [Rivas Basterra, Alejandra] AbbVie, Govt Affairs & Market Access, Madrid, Spain; [Grubb, ElizaBeth] AbbVie, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Chicago, IL USA; [Medrano Lopez, Constancio] Gregorio Maranon Univ Hosp, Pediat Cardiol, Madrid, Spain",AbbVie; AbbVie; AbbVie; General University Gregorio Maranon Hospital,"Schmidt, R (通讯作者)，Pharmerit Int Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Zimmerstr 55, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",rschmidt@pharmerit.com,,"Grubb, ElizaBeth/0000-0002-5378-3307; MEDRANO-LOPEZ, CONSTANCIO/0000-0003-4097-2448",AbbVie,AbbVie(AbbVie),"Financial support for this study was provided by a grant from AbbVie.

We examine this hypothesis using longitudinal data from 2002-03 through 2005-06. Our identification strategy relies on the fact that as NCLB was phased in, states had some latitude in designating which grades were to count for purposes of a school making adequate yearly progress. We compare the mathematics achievement distribution in a grade before and after it became a high-stakes grade. We find in general no evidence that gains were concentrated on students near the proficiency standard at the expense of students scoring much lower, though there are inconsistent signs of a trade-off with students at the upper end of the distribution.","[Ballou, Dale; Springer, Matthew G.] Vanderbilt Univ, Peabody Coll, Nashville, TN 37203 USA",Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University Peabody College,"Ballou, D (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Univ, Peabody Coll, Nashville, TN 37203 USA.",dale.ballous@vanderbilt.edu; matthew.g.springer@vanderbilt.edu,,"Springer, Matthew/0000-0001-9759-0999",Smith-Richardson Foundation; National Center on School Choice at Vanderbilt University,Smith-Richardson Foundation; National Center on School Choice at Vanderbilt University,"We thank the Northwest Evaluation Association for providing data for this study and the Smith-Richardson Foundation and the federally funded National Center on School Choice at Vanderbilt University for research support.

Using unawareness between degrees obtained abroad versus Australia as instrument for undertaking the assessment, I find substantial wage improvements when foreign qualifications are assessed in both cross-sectional and panel estimations. This result is not solely attributable to selection, as this would imply an unrealistic shift in the distribution of unobserved characteristics among assessed and not-assessed migrants. Adding a local signal to foreign education emerges as effective policy to improve the transferability of human capital and migrants' economic assimilation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this regard, the economics literature has focused on the role of financial constraints as a cause of these observed differences in educational choices. Our knowledge of potential effects of other constraints regarding university education is more limited. We investigate the causal relationship between information and educational expectations using data from a German randomized controlled trial in which students in high schools were given information on the benefits of as well as on different funding possibilities for university education. We find that the provision of information increases intended college enrollment for students from a non-academic family background, both two to three months and one year after the intervention. In contrast, it leads students from academic backgrounds to lower their enrollment intentions in the short run. However, this effect does not persist. Our results suggest that educational inequality can be reduced by providing students from non-academic families with relevant information. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We explore two particular burial practices; the long-term disposal of industrial and toxic waste in deep geological repositories and the sequestration of carbon and greenhouse gases in soil. Across these practices, we argue that subsurface appears as a repository for both the sacred and profane remains of environmental pasts and the hopes for an ecological modernity.

My analysis operationalizes Alfred Nordmann's call for a 'forensics of wishing', a variety of technology assessment which scrutinizes the politics of anticipation in technoscience. Using scientific articles and reports as primary sources I trace the uptake and contestation of, bold claims made by atmospheric scientist Paul Crutzen a decade ago. In 2006, Crutzen called for dedicated research on stratospheric albedo enhancement as a method to cool the planet. A back-of-the-envelope calculation invoking the eruption of the Mount Pinatubo volcano as a case to be mimicked served to illustrate the method. In the paper, I concentrate on the reception of this idea by fellow climate scientists. Besides fundamental objections being made to Crutzen's climate paradigm, less idealized models appeared to produce much less promising calculations. The initial claims however kept reappearing as well and continue to exert influence as idealized models take the idea further. Speculation thus continues to be an important driver of the research. In the conclusion, I discuss aspects of the worldview underlying the proposal, drawing on environmental humanities literature on the human condition in the Anthropocene. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Several authors attribute this empirical result to the development of ecotourism in protected areas. We thus argue that the gap between the theory and existing empirical results is partly explained by the fact that most theoretical models do not account for a productive activity on protected land. Therefore, we develop a theoretical model in which conservation allows developing an alternative sector and show that the relationship between conservation and welfare is U-shaped. We test this theoretical prediction using Nepalese data and find that conservation combined with ecotourism is indeed positively related to local welfare. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Many of those businesses have demonstrated innovation in the sphere of non-timber forest products (Nt7Ps), although these products had been neglected in the past, and their potentials are still underestimated. Therefore, our aim was to get a better understanding of the innovation processes behind three case studies in selected SEE countries (Slovenia, Serbia and FYR Macedonia). For the purpose of this research, we conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with people responsible for the selected innovation cases in three NIFP-based enterprises. The interviews revolved around questions related to the idea and product development, the firm foundation, the supporting and hindering factors and the actors and their roles in the entire process of business development. To understand the framework conditions, we interviewed representatives of the organizations that were in charge of supporting innovation and business development. The results show that several national policy programs (e.g., in the fields of SMEs, forestry and nature protection) form a framework for supporting Nibl's innovation. However, in all the selected countries, there were no policies specifically tailored for NIVPs. An analysis showed that these innovations were developed solely by the owners and their personal ideas, and most information and financing came from the businesses themselves. The innovation systems in the selected countries did not significantly contribute to the development and running of the businesses. The lessons provided by these cases can be significant for strengthening existing NTFP-related innovation systems and fostering their effectiveness in the future.","[Zivojonovic, Ivana; Weiss, Gerhard; Ludvig, Alice] European Forest Inst, Cent East & South East European Reg Off EFICEEC E, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Nedeljkovic, Jelena; Nonic, Dragan] Univ Belgrade, Fac Forestry, Kneza Viseslava 1, Belgrade 11030, Serbia; [Stojanovski, Vladimir] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Vienna, Austria; [Japelj, Anze] Slovenian Forestry Inst, Vecna Pot 2, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Stojanovski, Vladimir] Univ SS Cyril & Methodius Skopje, 16ta Makedonska Birgada 1, Skopje 1000, North Macedonia","University of Belgrade; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; Slovenian Forestry Institute; Saints Cyril & Methodius University of Skopje","Zivojonovic, I (通讯作者)，European Forest Inst, Cent East & South East European Reg Off EFICEEC E, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.",ivana.zivojinovic@efi.int,"Zivojinovic, Ivana/C-6830-2019; Stojanovski, Vladimir/CAJ-5117-2022; Nedeljković, Jelena/A-5992-2015; Ludvig, Alice/ABF-3048-2020","Zivojinovic, Ivana/0000-0001-9900-7066; Stojanovski, Vladimir/0000-0002-7893-7261; Nedeljković, Jelena/0000-0002-2957-5620; Ludvig, Alice/0000-0003-1323-2276; Japelj, Anze/0000-0002-7361-0710; Nonic, Dragan/0000-0001-8848-5943; Nedeljkovic Trailovic, Jelena/0000-0002-9813-8176","European Union Seventh Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration [311919]","European Union Seventh Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration(European Union (EU))","The research was undertaken within the STARTREE project (Multipurpose trees and non-wood forest products: a challenge and opportunity) and has been funded by the European Union Seventh Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration under grant agreement No. 311919.

WC and BMI were entered as continuous variables and obesity as binary variables defined using both WC and BMI. I used multivariate models controlling for a set of covariates. The association of WC with employment was of greater magnitude than the association between BMI and employment. I reran the analysis using conventional instrumental variables methods. The IV models showed significant impacts of obesity on employment; however, they were not more pronounced when WC was used to measure obesity, compared to BMI. This means that, in the IV models, the impact of fat mass on employment did not depend on the measure of fat mass.","[Kinge, Jonas Minet] Norwegian Inst Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth & Inequal, Pb 4404 Nydalen, N-0403 Oslo, Norway; [Kinge, Jonas Minet] Univ Oslo, Dept Hlth Management & Hlth Econ, Oslo, Norway",Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH); University of Oslo,"Kinge, JM (通讯作者)，Norwegian Inst Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth & Inequal, Pb 4404 Nydalen, N-0403 Oslo, Norway.;Kinge, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Dept Hlth Management & Hlth Econ, Oslo, Norway.",jonas.minet.kinge@fhi.no,,"Kinge, Jonas/0000-0002-2789-6113",Norwegian Research Council [250335/F20],Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),"I would like to acknowledge the project The burden of obesity in Norway: morbidity, mortality, health service use and productivity loss funded by the Norwegian Research Council through Grant 250335/F20.

By using two case studies of informal economic practices that originated in socialist-era societies and continue to the present day in modified forms, we critique the notion that sharing economies are significantly novel in form or logic, other than technologically. We draw attention to the variety of informal economy practices to discuss how they may be socially embedded or disembedded. The main focus on global technological leveraging of productivity and connectivity in sharing economy practices would suggest that many aspects are akin to disembedded forms of informality.

This paper argues that explanations for job polarization also explain layoffs after private equity buyouts. Buyouts reduce agency problems, which triggers automation and offshoring. Using rich employer-employee data, we show that buyouts generally do not affect unemployment incidence. However, unemployment incidence doubles for workers in less productive firms who perform routine or offshorable job tasks. Job polarization is also much more marked among workers affected by buyouts than for the economy at large.","[Olsson, Martin; Tag, Joacim] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Stockholm, Sweden; [Olsson, Martin] Inst Evaluat Labour Market & Educ Policy IFAU, Uppsala, Sweden",Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Tåg, J (通讯作者)，Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Stockholm, Sweden.",martin.olsson@ifn.se; joacim.tag@ifn.se,"Tåg, Joacim/ABA-3239-2020; Buttree, Matthew/JSK-8811-2023","Tåg, Joacim/0000-0002-4924-2479;",Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation; Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation; NASDAQ OMX Nordic Foundation; Vinnova,Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation; Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation; NASDAQ OMX Nordic Foundation; Vinnova(Vinnova),"We are grateful to the Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation, the Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation, the NASDAQ OMX Nordic Foundation, and Vinnova for financial support.

Using the automotive industry as a comparative case study, this article compares industry policy in three demographic and geographic giants of the region: China, India and Indonesia. China's dominant position has benefited from a highly interventionist' industry policy which places strict conditions on foreign carmakers in joint ventures. This policy has also influenced the emergence of a thriving domestic industry, with state-owned enterprises leading the way. While India has also emerged as a major auto producer, its industry policy has moved away from the joint venture model since the 1990s, with fully foreign-owned operations now playing a much bigger role. In contrast, Indonesia retains a version of the joint venture model while local industry is dominated by Japanese capital. The record of industry policy in these countries challenges the idea that more liberal' economic systems lead to stronger domestic industries or firms.","[Barnes, Tom] Australian Catholic Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Australian Catholic University; Australian Catholic University - Melbourne Campus,"Barnes, T (通讯作者)，Australian Catholic Univ, Inst Relig Polit & Soc, Level 6,215 Spring St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",tom.barnes@acu.edu.au,,"Barnes, Tom/0000-0002-3768-7905",,,,,44,4,5,5,28,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Prior to 2001, undocumented students in the United States faced high out-of-state tuition costs at public colleges and universities. From 2001 to 2014, twenty-one states passed in-state tuition policies, reducing the average cost of college by more than half for these students. To the extent that teens are forward-looking and aware that lower tuition increases the likelihood of attending college, this price reduction should decrease the incidence of risky behavior during adolescence among the undocumented. Exploiting the variation in timing of in-state tuition policies across states and using Mexican foreign-born non-citizenship as a proxy for undocumented status, I find that these policies increase college enrollment by about 1.2 percentage points (12% of the sample mean), decrease high school dropout incidence by about 5 percentage points for female youth (27% of the sample mean), and decrease the likelihood of first birth before age 20 by 2 percentage points (9% of the sample mean).

To determine a beneficial approach in both economic and environmental aspects, carbon sequestration and emissions caused by forest-thinning activities can be traded. However, previous research on forest planning has not considered a detailed and sophisticated calculation for forest thinning and carbon sequestration. Hence, this study proposes a spatial forest-thinning planning problem involving carbon sequestration and emissions, which determine forest-thinning schedules over a planning period so that the total thinned timber volume over the period and the revenue from carbon sequestration and emissions can be maximized under certain spatial constraints. For this research, we first created a novel mathematical programming model, which can generally solve only small-scale problems. Therefore, this study also proposes an improved simulated annealing heuristic approach (ISA), which iteratively searches for a near optimal solution with two improved designs: a spatial local search operator and a neighborhood search scheme. The simulation results obtained using 300 forestland instances revealed that the proposed ISA can achieve better results through the proposed spatial local search operator, and run more efficiently through the proposed neighborhood search scheme. In addition, the decision regarding carbon sequestration and emissions was verified to be clearly advantageous for the cycling and sustainability of forest resources. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

ES represents a prime example of an issue that merits more in-depth analysis. In this study, we (I) evaluate the views of the general public on the importance of forests contributing to different ES; (II) determine the public's need for information on the impact of forest sector businesses on ecosystems; and (Ill) assess how responsibly the public believes that forest sector companies act in relation to their impacts on ecosystems. A structured questionnaire using a 5-point Likert-scale was made available as an online survey targeting respondents from four European countries (Austria, Germany, Finland and Slovenia) in each national language and English. Between May and September 2015, 219 responses were received and analyzed using descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis, t-test, and ANOVA. Respondents showed high levels of agreement for items accounting for regulating and supporting ES. Information needs on forest sector business impacts were found to be high, whereas there was much greater division about the level of perceived forest sector responsibility. Regarding the public perception of forest ES, three dimensions were identified: primary ES, consumable ES, and social cohesion related ES. Some relationships between the respondents' socio-demographic characteristics and the three dimensions of ES were uncovered: for example, Consumable ES are more important for female respondents and those who do not derive income from the forest sector.

For example, Delphi studies often ask expert participants to assign probabilities to particular future outcomes. Similarly, while some scenario planners reject probability, others insist that assigning probabilities to scenarios is required to make them meaningful. Formal modelling and forecasting methods often also employ probability in one way or another. The paper questions this widespread use of probability as a device for considering the future, firstly showing that objective probability, based on empirically observed frequencies, has some well-known drawbacks when used for this purpose. However, what is less-widely acicnowledged is that this is also true of the subjective probability used in, for example, Delphi. Subjective probability is less distinct from objective probability than proponents of its use might imply, meaning it therefore suffers from similar problems. The paper draws on the foundations of probability theory as set out by Kolmogorov, as-well-as the work of Keynes, Shackle, Aumarm, Tverslry and Kahneman, and others, to reassert the essential distinction between risk and uncertainty, and to warn about the dangers of inappropriate use of probability for considering the future. The paper sets out some criteria for appropriate use.","[Derbyshire, James] Middlesex Univ, CEEDR, London NW4 4BT, England",Middlesex University,"Derbyshire, J (通讯作者)，Middlesex Univ, CEEDR, London NW4 4BT, England.",j.derbyshire@mdx.ac.uk,,,,,,,53,20,20,0,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,APR,2017,88.0,,,,,,43,54,,10.1016/j.futures.2017.03.011,0.0,,,12,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,EX0WT,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402942200004,0

This study examines the cost effectiveness of a secondary prevention intervention in primary care in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland over 6 years. An economic evaluation, based on a cluster randomised controlled trial of 903 patients with heart disease, was conducted 4.5 years after the intervention ceased to be delivered. Patients originally randomised to the control received usual practice while those randomised to the intervention received a tailored care package over the 1.5-year delivery period. Data on healthcare costs and quality adjusted life expectancy were used to undertake incremental cost utility analysis. Multilevel regression was used to estimate mean cost effectiveness and uncertainty was examined using cost effectiveness acceptability curves. At 6 years, there was a divergence in the results across jurisdictions. While the probability of the intervention being cost effective in the Republic of Ireland was 0.434, 0.232, 0.180, 0.150, 0.115 and 0.098 at selected threshold values of a,notsign5000, a,notsign15,000, a,notsign20,000, a,notsign25,000, a,notsign35,000 and a,notsign45,000, respectively, all equivalent probabilities for Northern Ireland equalled 1.000. Our findings suggest that the intervention in its current format is likely to be more cost effective than usual general practice care in Northern Ireland, but this is not the case in the Republic of Ireland.","[Gillespie, Paddy; Murphy, Edel] Natl Univ Ireland, JE Cairnes Sch Business & Econ, Univ Rd, Galway, Ireland; [Smith, Susan M.] Royal Coll Surg, Dept Gen Practice, Dublin, Ireland; [Cupples, Margaret E.] Queens Univ Belfast, Dept Gen Practice & Primary Care, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Cupples, Margaret E.] Queens Univ Belfast, UKCRC Ctr Excellence Publ Hlth Res NI, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Byrne, Molly] Natl Univ Ireland, Sch Psychol, Galway, Ireland; [Murphy, Andrew W.] Natl Univ Ireland, Sch Med, Galway, Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Royal College of Surgeons - Ireland; Queens University Belfast; Queens University Belfast; Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway,"Gillespie, P (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, JE Cairnes Sch Business & Econ, Univ Rd, Galway, Ireland.",paddy.gillespie@nuigalway.ie,"Smith, Susan M/D-1872-2012; Gillespie, Paddy/C-6642-2015","Smith, Susan M/0000-0001-6027-2727; Murphy, Andrew/0000-0001-5549-8246; Cupples, Margaret/0000-0002-4248-9700; Byrne, Molly/0000-0001-8900-4320; Gillespie, Paddy/0000-0001-6297-9478",Health Research Board,Health Research Board,"This study was funded by the Health Research Board.

At the start of 2005, the financing system of Dutch hospitals started to be gradually changed from a closed-end budgeting system to a non-regulated price competitive prospective reimbursement system. The gradual implementation of price competition is a 'natural experiment' that provides a unique opportunity to analyze the effects of market competition on hospital behavior. We have access to a unique database, which contains hospital discharge data of diagnosis treatment combinations (DBCs) of individual patients, including detailed care activities. Difference-in-difference estimates show that the implementation of market-based competition leads to relatively lower total costs, production volume and number of activities overall. Difference-in-difference estimates on treatment level show that the average costs for outpatient DBCs decreased due to a decrease in the number of activities per DBC. The introduction of market competition led to an increase of average costs of inpatient DBCs. Since both volume and number of activities have not changed significantly, we conclude that the cost increase is likely the result of more expensive activities. A possible explanation for our finding is that hospitals look for possible efficiency improvements in predominantly outpatient care products that are relatively straightforward, using easily analyzable technologies. The effects of competition on average cost and the relative shares of inpatient and outpatient treatments on specialty level are significant but contrary for cardiology and orthopedics, suggesting that specialties react differently to competitive incentives.","[Krabbe-Alkemade, Y.

Along with conventional econometric techniques we have addressed the issue of cross section dependence and used Westerlund (2007) panel cointegration test which is robust against cross section dependence and heterogeneity for detecting the presence of panel cointegration.

This paper quantifies the well-being losses that African American women derive from their occupational sorting. The reduction of segregation was indeed accompanied by well-being improvements, especially in the 1960s and 1970s. Regarding the role that education has played, this study highlights that it was only from 1990 onward that African American women with either some college or university degrees had lower segregation (as compared with their peers) than those with lower education. Nevertheless, the well-being loss that African American women with university degrees derived in 2010 for being segregated from their peers in education was not too different from that of African American women with lower education.","[Alonso-Villar, Olga; del Rio, Coral] Univ Vigo, Dept Econ Aplicada, Fac Econ, Campus Lagoas Marcosende S-N, Vigo 36310, Spain",Universidade de Vigo,"Alonso-Villar, O (通讯作者)，Univ Vigo, Dept Econ Aplicada, Fac Econ, Campus Lagoas Marcosende S-N, Vigo 36310, Spain.",ovillar@uvigo.es; crio@uvigo.es,"del Rio, Coral/M-5560-2019; Alonso-Villar, Olga/K-4348-2014","del Rio, Coral/0000-0002-3173-3624; Alonso-Villar, Olga/0000-0002-7355-0279","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2013-46516-C4-2-R, ECO2010-21668-C03-03, ECO2011-23460]; Xunta de Galicia [CN2012/178, GRC 2015/014]; FEDER",Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); Xunta de Galicia(Xunta de Galicia); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government),"This paper was partially elaborated while the authors were Visiting Scholars at the Department of Economics at Portland State University.

Persaud builds upon the macroprudential programme to advocate a role for regulators in shepherding risk throughout the financial system. Ricks rejects the direction taken by post-financial crisis regulation, offering a blueprint that addresses the panic-prone nature of money creation in shadow banking. This review article provides a reading of their books which demonstrates how their evaluations of the global financial crisis shape their policy prescriptions. It also suggests that although their blueprints are valuable thought-experiments they have a number of lacunae which economic sociologists and political economists can help fill. In particular, I argue that questions concerning regulatory epistemology, the politics of regulatory reform, and simplicity versus complexity in regulatory rule-making might orient a productive empirical and conceptual research agenda.","[Coombs, Nathan] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Coombs, N (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",nathan.coombs@ed.ac.uk,"Coombs, Nathan/JFS-9473-2023","Coombs, Nathan/0000-0002-7319-1181",Leverhulme Trust [ECF-2014-304],Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),This work was supported by the Leverhulme Trust [grant number ECF-2014-304].,,37,2,3,3,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

To continue the industry growth, price risk management is an essential part in creating successful projects and sustainable business operations. This research uses trade data on fish and invertebrate prices, and evaluates the relative price uncertainty from farmed and captured products. Moreover, we consider a set of species groups (fish, invertebrates), species' families (e.g., Salmonidae, white fish and crustaceans), and individual species (e.g., salmon, seabream and prawns), and evaluate their price volatility over time using Value-at-Risk (VaR). The results indicate that the introduction of aquaculture production to a species' total supply will reduce price volatility. Consequently, incentives and regulations should support research and development of new aquaculture species.","[Dahl, Roy Endre] Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ & Risk Management, NO-4036 Stavanger, Norway",Universitetet i Stavanger,"Dahl, RE (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ & Risk Management, NO-4036 Stavanger, Norway.",roy.e.dahl@uis.no,,"Dahl, Roy Endre/0000-0002-1874-795X",,,,,41,18,18,0,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

In the first part, we examine spillover effects in stock markets. Estimating the Global Vector Autoregressive (GVAR) model, we find that spillover effects from emerging Asia became large in the post Global Financial Crisis (GFC) period. However, we also find that most of the spillover effects were from shocks in the manufacturing sector rather than from those in the financial sector. This implies that the spillover effects increased in the post GFC period because of increased manufacturing sector's shocks in emerging Asia. In the second part, we examine spillover effects across different foreign exchange rates. As in the stock markets, spillover effects from emerging Asia became large in the foreign exchange markets in the post GFC period. In particular, our high frequency data analysis suggests that an exchange rate policy change by the the People's Bank of China (PBC) had positive spillover effects on most of the advanced currencies in the post GFC period. The empirical results imply that the impact of Chinese shocks has been rising in the global financial markets.","[Fukuda, Shin-ichi] Univ Tokyo, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan; [Tanaka, Mariko] Musashino Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Fukuda, S (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Fac Econ, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",sfukuda@e.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,"JSPS KAKENHI [26285044, 15K13003]; Center for Advanced Research in Finance (CARF) in the University of Tokyo; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K13003, 26285044, 17K18557] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Center for Advanced Research in Finance (CARF) in the University of Tokyo; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work was supported by the JSPS KAKENHI [26285044 and 15K13003] and by the Center for Advanced Research in Finance (CARF) in the University of Tokyo.,,21,5,5,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Indeed, the 1883 Paris Convention and the 1886 Berne Convention are commonly considered the first instances of international economic regulation. Hence, although the negotiation and adoption of the Agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) at the WTO and the inclusion of Intellectual Property (IP) rights among the ;investments' often covered under international investment agreements seem to have taken some by surprise, this convergence appeared inscribed in the genealogy of the subject. Many scholars have already paid attention to the relationship between trade, IP and investment, but the 'technical' issues that litigation in investment arbitration of IP rights (regulated at the national, regional and international level) might generate have apparently gone unnoticed. This article argues that further integration between the two regimes at the dispute settlement level is not desirable in practice for technical reasons. IP law and governance are highly fragmented and allocated among different fora at the international level. This situation is also reflected in the lack of agreement among states on several IP issues. The litigation of IP rights in investment disputes adds to this fragmentation instead of diminishing it and it appears as an attempt to unduly circumvent the discussions of IP questions taking place in intergovernmental fora.","[Gagliani, Gabriele] Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy",Bocconi University,"Gagliani, G (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy.",gabriele.gagliani@unibocconi.it,,,,,,,66,2,2,1,5,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The authors determine the most important problems related to unstable development of a depressive region under the influence of crisis and develop recommendations and offer a proprietary model for provision of sustainable development of a depressive region under the conditions of crisis. As a result of the research, the authors specify the notion of stability as to depressive region and improve classification of region in the context of their capability to opposing and overcoming the crisis. The authors have come to the conclusion that specifics of crisis in depressive region consists in the fact that unlike other regions, they are not capable to exist independently and overcome consequences of crisis, being in deep recession.","[Isalova, Marzhanat; Gadzhieva, Umugani; Gereyhanova, Hellas; Buttaeva, Saida; Bogdanova, Indira] Dagestan State Tech Univ, Makhachkala, Russia",,"Isalova, M (通讯作者)，Dagestan State Tech Univ, Makhachkala, Russia.",Is-mar@mail.ru; Malika1704@mail.ru; Khalimbekov01@mail.ru; buttaeva.saida@rambler.ru; dani.bm09@gmail.ru,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1431-1933,,978-3-319-45462-7; 978-3-319-45461-0,CONTRIB ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,451,460,,10.1007/978-3-319-45462-7_44,0.0,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BI1WG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406973000044,0

Originally, accounting scandals and misleading financial reports were the main reason to demand greater transparency. Subsequently, besides investors a number of other stakeholders started to communicate their information expectations towards companies' publications. To meet the demand for greater transparency a variety of new approaches to corporate reporting have been proposed. In particular, annual reporting has been stimulated to integrate an ever growing extent of non-financial disclosures. Thus environmental, social, governance and integrated reporting are broadly promoted. The disclosures are intended to create a context for financial reports and let the stakeholder gain a more comprehensive view of organization's performance and impacts made in different areas. The evolution of corporate disclosures has been driven on multiple levels. Initially non-governmental moves (associations, standard-setters) played a major role in the process, what resulted in numerous frameworks, guidelines and recommendations created. Afterwards, lawmakers, in acceptance of the growing demand for transparency, started to introduce legal obligations regarding corporate reporting. Currently, non-financial reporting is partially regulated and simultaneously companies are encouraged to apply frameworks voluntarily. The aim of this paper is to investigate the progress in increasing corporate transparency on a sample of biggest Polish listed companies through years 2001-2013. Firstly, key motives for greater transparency are described in relation to corresponding types of corporate reporting. Then, different types of researched companies' disclosures are examined. To observe changes in transparency level a disclosure measure was created and employed to analyse annual reports content. Quantified results provided some interesting insight into types of information organizations were ready or reluctant to disclose and how those decisions changed over time.","[Jedrzejka, Dariusz] Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, Dept Banking, Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Jedrzejka, D (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, Dept Banking, Lodz, Poland.",dariusz.jedrzejka@uni.lodz.pl,,"Jedrzejka, Dariusz/0000-0002-5512-1788",,,,,28,1,1,1,7,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,439,447,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426857700047,0

But according to Mitchel Dean the idea on contrary is not a contractual bond between individual and state for promotion of human rights and spirit of wellbeing inherent in commercial pursuits of happiness. According to Foucault Liberalism have a lovehate relation with freedom. Although it believes in limited intervention of state in private sphere of activity, to Foucault it is a bio-power. With its individualizing techniques it breaks human bonds from collectivity. But its procedures are totalizing in nature as it not only regulates the domain of conscious but also sub-conscious converting humans into utilitarian wealth producing beings. The inherent flaws in liberalism as identified by Marx as well as Foucault are its capacity to operate on limited scale. Since its inception in age of Enlightenment, liberalism creates global milieus of economic circulation. To him, liberalism is a form of bio-power relying on individualizing techniques that transform humans into wealth producing utilitarian beings, and totalizing procedures creating an integrated world order transforming the multitude of societies into a singularity of consumer global society. The prime supposition of study is that liberalism is a form of Governmentality that creates world orders. It has passed through different phases since age of colonialism, when using the strategy of lebensraum and physical annexation first global milieu was crafted and multitude of spaces operated as singularity. Employing the Foucauldian tool of genealogy as diagnostic of present, paper aims to evaluate the diverse impacts of liberal Governmentality on different spaces. It will also employ Foucault various concepts like Power/knowledge to understand the working of liberal discourses.","[Nawaz, Rafida] Bahauddin Zakariya Univ Multan, Multan, Pakistan",Bahauddin Zakariya University,"Nawaz, R (通讯作者)，Bahauddin Zakariya Univ Multan, Multan, Pakistan.",,"Nawaz, Rafida/ABB-5771-2020","Nawaz, Rafida/0000-0002-6715-5440",,,,,5,0,0,0,5,"MASTERS INT CONSULTANCY RES PUBL, MIRDEC",KUCUKCEKMECE,"CINARLICESME SK, NO 21-13, KUCUKCEKMECE, ISTANBUL PK-34303, TURKEY",,,978-605-82290-3-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,59,64,,,,,,6,Area Studies; Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BJ5TI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426276100006,0

The Central and Eastern European countries, which were eventually supposed to unite into federation, were thought of as a potential barrier separating Moscow from Berlin. Lack of agreement in the matter, followed by the outbreak of World War II, put the end to these plans, but the idea of creating a coalition in this region was reborn over a year ago in Dubrovnik, Croatia. There, on 25th-26th August, 2016, on the forum of the Three Seas nations, a declaration of cooperation was signed, which laid the conceptual foundation of the possible future shape of the union. The declaration was key since it was signed by officials representing all twelve nations which are to be part of the possible alliance. The Three Seas Initiative was then described as an informal platform from which to gain political support and organize action towards specific projects, both on the scale of the entire region and transboundary, strategic to countries involved in energy, transport, digital communication and economic policies within Central and Eastern Europe. In the time of Germany's political domination of the European Union and the Russian Federation's aggressive imperialistic aspirations, the old initiative from the interwar period has gained new reasons for its development. It also received strong political support from the president of the United States Donald Trump during his visit in Warsaw, Poland, in July 2017. Presently, the Three Seas is but a handful of socio-political and economic projects to be realized in the near future. In the face of increasing tensions and open conflicts within the European Union, however, the intended cooperation initiative may soon become and institutionalized reality with the paramount goals of shifting the balance of power and changing the geopolitical situation in Europe.","[Przygoda, Miroslaw] Univ Warsaw, Fac Management, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Przygoda, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Management, Warsaw, Poland.",miroslawprzygoda@wp.pl,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,657,673,,,,,,17,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426857700071,0

The concept of entropy has been frequently utilized to evaluate the quantity and influence of information offered by the data under analysis. The methodology is based on the construction of a composite indicator, represented by the weighted sum of the indicators taken into account. The weights assigned to the indicators selected to perform the analysis stand as measure of significance for each factor involved in the construction of the composite indicator. The results obtained using the present methodology are very similar to official international rankings, confirming the reliability and accuracy of this approach. In terms of economic insight, we compute an efficiency index as the ratio of the outcome value obtained and the mean value for the corresponding 10 years time span of Research and Development (R&D) expenditure in Higher Education sector for every country. The results obtained using this approach reveal that some countries with lower research score succeed to publish papers at much lower costs than developed countries in R&D sector.","[Serban, Florentin] Univ Bucharest, Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Doctoral Sch Math, Dept Appl Math, Bucharest, Romania; [Serban-Oprescu, Anca-Teodora] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Modern Languages & Business Commun, Bucharest, Romania; [Serban-Oprescu, George-Laurentiu] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Econ Doctrines & Commun, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; University of Bucharest; Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Serban, F (通讯作者)，Univ Bucharest, Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Doctoral Sch Math, Dept Appl Math, Bucharest, Romania.",florentin.serban@csie.ase.ro; teodora.oprescu@rei.ase.ro; george.serban@economie.ase.ro,"Serban, Florentin/C-7105-2012; Şerban-Oprescu, George/U-6347-2019","Serban-Oprescu, George Laurentiu/0000-0002-7614-6298","Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI [PN-H-RU-TE-2014-4-2905]","Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI","This work was supported by a grant of the Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI, project number PN-H-RU-TE-2014-4-2905.",,15,2,2,0,9,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Combined with the current economic slowdown and the transformation in the structure of the economy, the transition in China's monetary policy framework is inevitable. It is interesting to see whether recent changes in monetary policy are reflected in the credit market. As the official liberalized retail interest rates are still unreliable and limited, we use the shadow banking interest rate as an alternative. We then aim to determine the extent to which market-based shadow banking interest rates can capture monetary policy intentions by estimating an EGARCH (exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity) model. As the major participants in shadow banking are price-sensitive small- and medium-size enterprises, which contribute more to economic growth than price-insensitive state-owned enterprises, our results provide useful policy implications for future transition and conducting monetary policy.","[Zhang, Shen; Wan, Jing] Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, 92 Weijin Rd, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China",Tianjin University,"Wan, J (通讯作者)，Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, 92 Weijin Rd, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",wanjing.tju@gmail.com,,"Zhang, Shen/0000-0003-1146-3708",,,,,12,4,4,4,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Performing a procurement operation in accordance with the principles of GPP and sustainability means making sure that the goods and services purchased have made the smallest impact on the environment and a positive social effect. Accordingly, the choice of food products also plays a large role in reducing environmental impacts and contributing to the health of the population. In Rezekne municipality, GPP criteria for food procurement are not used or it is done very rarely; therefore, the opinions of the local government/parish administrations about the use of GPP of food and barriers to it have to be examined in Rezekne municipality. The present research study continues and supplements the previous ones. The research aim is to examine the use of GPP of food in Rezekne municipality. The research found that the local government of Rezekne municipality did not procure food for local institutions in a centralised way; every civil parish administration did it for the institutions located in their territories. The parish administrations procured 70% of food for the institutions located in their territories in a decentralised way. The dominant principle for identifying the winner of any procurement tender was the lowest price principle, while the selection of the most economically advantageous bids was based on such GPP criteria as quality and environmental friendliness.

The root cause of the crisis can be traced back to the collapse of the Bretton Woods System in August 1971, and the failure to design an equitable and inclusive global financial and economic governance architecture consistent with the changed global economic realities. The vacuum was quickly taken up by the neoliberal orthodoxy that pushed the agenda of wholesale liberalisation, resulting in unprecedented domination of speculative finance capital and multinational corporation-led globalisation. This has seen falling share of wages in national income, growing wealth concentration, rising income inequality and ballooning of household debts.

The future of a symbiotic planet,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Gaia's adaptation; Gaia's evolution; Gaia's reproduction; Symbiosis; Biophora,BIODIVERSITY; EVOLUTION; DAISYWORLD,"Life affecting first the development of the planetary environment, which, in turn, affects the future evolution of life in a coevolutionary way is a well-established idea now. Nevertheless, with the proposal of the Gaia hypothesis, there has been widespread criticism of some of its elements. Most critiques are related to teleology, the absence of natural selection at a universal scale, and the absence of planetary reproduction. Even if some of the problems concerning the rationale of this hypothesis have been resolved, it is not clear whether Earth can be considered a unit of selection and, therefore, Gaia can adapt according to Darwinian evolution. After Lovelock and Margulis, Gaia has been considered a symbiotic planet composed of biotic (the biosphere) and abiotic (the geosphere-atmosphere) interacting with and coevolving elements. Here, I took into consideration the main concerns raised on the Gaia hypothesis and I analysed them following a logic-deductive reasoning together with thought experiments, sometimes adopting analogical arguments. I propose why and suggest how, a Gaian system, considered as a symbiotic planet composed by biotic (the biosphere) and abiotic (the geosphere-atmosphere) interacting and coevolving elements, should be considered alive in an evolutionary sense. I argue that, without invoking teleology, so without any foresight or planning, a Gaian planet can be considered the same as a coevolutionary system analogous to a multicellular body: a super-unit of selection. I describe different situations according to which Gaia is able to reproduce and to transfer her planetary genome to other uninhabited or inhabited planets. Then I show that Gaia can face exclusion-competition-coexistence states depending on the fitness of her biota compared to those of the other reproducing biospheres. This demonstrates that Gaia can reproduce and evolve in competition-cooperation with other planets. Some deep implications arise from these pieces of evidence in the light of the recent discovery of a new solar system with Earth-like planets.","[Gatti, Roberto Cazzolla] Tomsk State Univ, Biol Inst, Tomsk, Russia; [Gatti, Roberto Cazzolla] Purdue Univ, Forest Adv Comp & Artificial Intelligence FACAI L, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources FNR, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Tomsk State University; Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Gatti, RC (通讯作者)，Tomsk State Univ, Biol Inst, Tomsk, Russia.;Gatti, RC (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Forest Adv Comp & Artificial Intelligence FACAI L, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources FNR, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",robertocazzollagatti@mail.tsu.ru,"Cazzolla Gatti, Roberto/ABD-7380-2021","Cazzolla Gatti, Roberto/0000-0001-5130-8492",,,,,60,5,5,1,21,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,DEC,2018,104.0,,,,,,91,99,,10.1016/j.futures.2018.07.010,0.0,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,HD5RG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452587000009,0

In a model with rational and fully informed consumers, this question is straightforward. There is disagreement, however, about whether consumers are rational and fully informed, and the literature offers little practical guidance about what approach the FDA should use if they are not. In this paper, we outline the history of the FDA's recent attempts to regulate cigarettes and other tobacco products and how they have valued foregone consumer surplus in cost-benefit analyses. We advocate replacing the approach used in most of this literature, which first calculates health gains associated with regulation and then offsets them by some factor reflecting consumer surplus losses, with a more general behavioral public finance framework for welfare analysis. This framework applies standard tools of welfare analysis to consumer demand that may be biased (that is, not necessarily rational and fully informed) without requiring specific assumptions about the reason for the bias. This framework would require estimates of both biased and unbiased consumer demand; we sketch an agenda to help develop these in the context of smoking. The use of this framework would substantially reduce the confusion currently surrounding welfare analysis of tobacco regulation.","[Levy, Helen G.] Univ Michigan, Inst Social Res, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Levy, Helen G.; Norton, Edward C.; Smith, Jeffrey A.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Norton, Edward C.] Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Smith, Jeffrey A.] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, NBER, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Smith, Jeffrey A.] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Levy, HG (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Inst Social Res, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Levy, HG (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",hlevy@umich.edu,", Edward/AAQ-1719-2021; Norton, Edward C/B-2211-2009",", Edward/0000-0003-4555-0631;",NIH [5R03CA182990]; NIA [K01AG034232],NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NIA(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge funding for this project from NIH grant number 5R03CA182990 and, for Levy, from NIA grant number K01AG034232.

The local state has undergone substantial restructuring, driven by major budget reductions from central government. Hitherto, few studies of austerity in the UK have considered the interplay of national and local policies. We contribute a fine-grained spatial analysis of local authority budgets, highlighting their socioeconomically and geographically uneven impacts. We identify substantial variations between authorities in terms of funding, local tax-base, fiscal resources, assets, political control, service-need and demographics. We argue that austerity has actively reshaped the relationship between central and local government in Britain, shrinking the capacity of the local state, increasing inequality between local governments and exacerbating territorial injustice.","[Gray, Mia; Barford, Anna] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England; [Gray, Mia; Barford, Anna] Univ Cambridge, Ctr Business Res, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England; [Gray, Mia; Barford, Anna] Girton Coll, Huntingdon Rd, Cambridge CB3 0JG, England",University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge,"Gray, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England.;Gray, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Ctr Business Res, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England.;Gray, M (通讯作者)，Girton Coll, Huntingdon Rd, Cambridge CB3 0JG, England.",pmg27@cam.ac.uk; ab423@cam.ac.uk,,,Cambridge Political Economy Society Trust; British Academy; Canada-UK Foundation,Cambridge Political Economy Society Trust; British Academy; Canada-UK Foundation,"This research was supported by funding from the Cambridge Political Economy Society Trust, the British Academy, and the Canada-UK Foundation.",,77,221,233,13,70,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

Combining the two canonical models of Barrett (2003) and Rabin (1993), I find that 1) the empty coalition is always stable; 2) the grand coalition is stable if reciprocity preferences are sufficiently strong; 3) if a minority of countries are not reciprocal, a majority coalition can still be stable, if reciprocity is sufficiently strong and widespread; and 4) there is also a stable minority coalition, if costs are moderate and the number of countries is not too small. The latter coalition is weakly larger than the maximum stable coalition with standard preferences, but barely improves on welfare, and is characterized by negative sentiments. The analysis illustrates that although models of reciprocity tend to be complex, the context of a specific applied game may reduce this complexity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This paper offers insights, grounded in the bee colonies natural evolution, to manage this detailed complexity or variety. Variety balances between the nectar foraging and storage operations of the honey bee colony are important for its growth and survival. If there is an optimal variety balance between foragers and storers, their work capacities will be matched and the two operations will function at maximum efficiency. Foragers sense variety imbalances by observing significant deviations from the normal mean levels of the queuing delay experienced when they unload their nectar to the food storers. If there is a short delay, they perform waggle dances to recruit additional foragers but, if there is a long delay, they perform tremble dances to recruit additional storers. These signals reallocate labour to rebalance the system. In addition, algedonic signals are used to recruit or inhibit workers in emergencies. This study shows how a self-organising system can sense and correct variety imbalances without any metasystemic intervention or design.","[Foss, Richard Anthony] Nat Syst Dev, Aylsham, England; [Espejo, Raul] Syncho Res, Lincoln, England",,"Foss, RA (通讯作者)，Nat Syst Dev, Aylsham, England.",richardafoss@outlook.com; r.espejo@syncho.org,,"Foss, Richard/0000-0002-6547-3613",,,,,66,0,0,1,28,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,OCT,2018,103.0,,,,SI,,115,122,,10.1016/j.futures.2018.07.008,0.0,,,8,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,GX1MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447481900012,0

Those adjustments are translated into health outcomes by an epidemiological model and climate outcomes using life-cycle analysis coefficients. The application to France and Finland compares the impacts of promoting fish consumption to those of urging consumers to decrease their consumption of meat. For the same relative change, raising fish consumption generates more health benefits than decreasing meat consumption, and produces climate benefits as well. Promoting fish consumption is also highly cost-effective and should be prioritized over measures targeting meat consumption.

With this approach, we challenge Faustmann's assumption of stable conditions saying that the current situation of costs, prices and yield will stay constant for an infinite time in the future. This paper outlines the historical triggers of forest harvesting operations, i.e. the introduction of the one-man chainsaw and harvester and forwarder based fully mechanized timber harvesting systems between the early 20th century and the early 21st century using the example of German forestry. Furthermore, we analyze and discuss productivity changes due to technical innovations also in the context of labor costs and timber price changes. We show that technical innovations are not the major determinant of the LEV because significantly increasing labor costs are an opposing factor on efficiency gains due to technical productivity. Moreover, we discover that timber price developments originally assumed as marginal condition have the biggest effect on the LEV throughout the last century. As a result, we sensitize for the issue that Faustmann's assumption of stable conditions does not satisfy the peculiarities of a continuously developing forest economy.","[Mueller, Fabian; Hanewinkel, Marc] Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Chair Forestry Econ & Forest Planning, Tennenbacherstr 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Müller, F (通讯作者)，Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Chair Forestry Econ & Forest Planning, Tennenbacherstr 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",fabian.mueller@ife.uni-freiburg.de; marc.hanewinkel@ife.uni-freiburg.de,"hanewinkel, marc/E-5639-2011","hanewinkel, marc/0000-0003-4081-6621",,,,,66,5,6,2,23,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,OCT,2018,95.0,,,,,,46,56,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.07.009,0.0,,,11,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GT2VC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000444357400007,0

Systematic Evidence from Thousands of Innovations,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,health innovation; quality-adjusted prices,COST-EFFECTIVENESS,"Medical innovations have improved treatment for many diseases but have simultaneously raised spending on health care. Many health economists believe that technological change is the major factor driving the growth of the health-care sector. Whether quality has increased as much as spending-that is, whether new innovations raise or lower quality-adjusted prices in health care-is a central question for both positive and normative health-care analysis. We do a systematic analysis of the impact of technological change on quality-adjusted prices, with over 6,000 comparisons between innovations and incumbent technologies. We observe each innovation's price and quality, as well as the price and quality of an incumbent technology treating the same disease. We find that the innovations' quality-adjusted prices are higher than the incumbents' for about two-thirds of innovations. Nevertheless, we argue that quality-adjusted prices may fall or rise over time depending on the effect of competition on incumbents' prices over time. A 4-percent price decline due to competition would offset the cross-sectional price difference for a majority of indications. We discuss the conditions particular to health care that may cause increases in quality-adjusted prices over time rather than decreases as experienced in many other industries.","[Hult, Kristopher J.] Charles River Associates Inc, Boston, MA USA; [Jaffe, Sonia] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Philipson, Tomas J.] Univ Chicago, Becker Friedman Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Philipson, Tomas J.] Univ Chicago, Irving B Harris Grad Sch Publ Policy Studies, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Charles River Associates; University of Chicago; University of Chicago; University of Chicago,"Jaffe, S (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",spj@uchicago.edu,,"Jaffe, Sonia/0000-0001-8924-0294",Becker Friedman Institute's Health Economics Initiative at the University of Chicago,Becker Friedman Institute's Health Economics Initiative at the University of Chicago,"We are thankful to Casey Mulligan, session attendees at the University of Chicago, Tufts University, Bates White Life Sciences Conference, ASHEcon 2016, and participants at the BFI Health Sector and the Economy Conference for comments, and to the Becker Friedman Institute's Health Economics Initiative at the University of Chicago for financial support and the CEA Registry for data support.

We provide evidence from a lab experiment that participants interacting in a dynamic game of common pool resource extraction reduce their cooperation on efficient levels of resource extraction when given the possibility to appropriate the resource at some cost, i.e. through conflict. Theoretically, cooperation is achievable via the threat of punishment strategies, which stop being subgame perfect in the presence of conflict. Accordingly we argue that the observed reduction of cooperation in the game's early stages in the lab is a consequence of participants (correctly) anticipating the use of appropriation when resources become scarce.

I conducted a field experiment with two restaurants to test if nudging can increase the consumption of vegetarian food. At the treated restaurant, the salience of the vegetarian option was increased by changing the menu order and enhancing the visibility of the vegetarian dish. The other restaurant served as a control. Daily sales data on the three main dishes sold were collected from September 2015 until June 2016. Results show that the nudge increased the share of vegetarian lunches sold by on average 6 percentage points, and that the treatment effect increased over time. The change in behavior is partly persistent, as the share of vegetarian lunches sold remained 4 percentage points higher after the intervention ended than before the experiment The intervention reduced GHG emissions from food sales by around 5 percent (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Since the 10th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Conversion on Climate Change in 2009, HWP have been required to be included in forest management as an additional carbon pool in national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory reports. China is the largest consumer of end-use HWP and the largest importer of primary HWP in the world. Thus, the carbon stocks and emissions of China's HWP must be accurately assessed for evaluating their contribution to the climate change mitigation potential of global HWP. We developed an analysis framework by using Stock-Change Approach to estimate China's HWP carbon stocks/emissions from a life-cycle perspective, which covers three HWP life-cycle stages, namely, manufacture, end use, and end-of-life disposal. Using this framework, we produced the first-ever life-cycle carbon budget for HWP consumed by China in the period 1900-2015, based on a comprehensive analysis of China-specific data. From 1900 to 2015, total wood fiber input to the HWP carbon system in China was estimated to be 8049 teragrams of carbon dioxide-equivalent (Tg CO2-eq). Of the total wood fiber input, discarded mill residue, in-use HWP, and HWP disposed of at solid waste disposal sites retained 513, 3284, and 659 Tg CO2-eq of carbon, respectively, with the remaining 3591 Tg CO2-eq of wood carbon released back to the atmosphere. Of the total emission, combustion and decomposition of mill residue, burning of fuelwood, and combustion and decomposition of retired HWP accounted for 36.5%, 24.6%, and 38.9%, respectively. Landfill methane emissions were estimated to be 780 Tg CO2-eq after considering the global warming potential of this greenhouse gas. The net HWP carbon stocks, the sum of the carbon retained by discarded mill residue and the carbon stocks of HWP in use and in landfills, minus landfill methane emissions, increased from 297 Tg CO2-eq in 1950 to 4456 Tg CO2-eq in 2015.","[Zhang, Xiaobiao; Yang, Hongqiang] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yang, Hongqiang] Nanjing Univ, Ctr Yangtze River Deltas Socioecon Dev, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiaobiao; Yang, Hongqiang] State Forestry Adm, Res Ctr Econ & Trade Forest Prod, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jiaxin] Minist Nat Resources & Forestry, Ontario Forest Res Inst, 1235 Queen St East, Sault Ste Marie, ON P6A 2E5, Canada",Nanjing Forestry University; Nanjing University; Ministry of Natural Resources & Forestry,"Yang, HQ (通讯作者)，159 Longpan Rd, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",yhqnfu@gmail.com; jiaxin.chen@ontario.ca,"Yang, Hongqiang/AAV-2376-2021","Yang, Hongqiang/0000-0002-6598-2936; Zhang, Xiaobiao/0000-0003-2799-7595",Key Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China [14AJY014]; China Ministry of Education (MOE) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences [13YJAZH114]; Doctorate Fellowship Foundation of Nanjing Forestry University [163060108],Key Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); China Ministry of Education (MOE) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences; Doctorate Fellowship Foundation of Nanjing Forestry University,"This study was supported by the Key Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 14AJY014), the China Ministry of Education (MOE) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences (Project No. 13YJAZH114), and the Doctorate Fellowship Foundation of Nanjing Forestry University (Project No. 163060108).

Decisions about forest policies and management are determined by individual and societal groups' interests and values, and have economic, social, and political dimensions. Over the past few decades, a fast growing and diversifying research programme on forest governance, harnessing a number of social science disciplines, has endeavoured to understand these dimensions. In this light, the International Union of Forest Research Organisations (IUFRO) Division 9 Unit 09.05 (Forest Policy and Governance) organised an international scientific conference on Forest-related policy and governance: Analyses in the environmental social sciences in late 2016. This conference aimed to be the global scientific hub for forest-related social sciences research, including studies on forest-related empirical fields, both rural and urban. It took stock of the latest scientific advancements in the fields of forest-related policy analyses, as well as wider forest governance studies from various social scientific disciplines. Based on this stock-taking exercise across a number of forest-focused social science disciplines, this paper reviews selected contributions to this conference, which were compiled into this special issue, and identifies research trends and potential fields for future research in the forest-related social sciences.","[Maryudi, Ahmad] Univ Gadjah Mada, Fac Forestry, Yogyakarta, Indonesia; [Nurrochmat, Dodik R.] Bogor Agr Univ, Fac Forestry, Bogor, Indonesia; [Giessen, Lukas] Goettingen Univ, Chair Grp Forest & Nat Conservat Policy, Gottingen, Germany; [Giessen, Lukas] Bonn Off, European Forest Inst, Bonn, Germany",Gadjah Mada University; Bogor Agricultural University,"Maryudi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Gadjah Mada, Fac Forestry, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.",ahmad_maryudi@ugm.ac.id,"Giessen, Lukas/JUV-6402-2023; Maryudi, Ahmad/T-8029-2019; Nurrochmat, Dodik Ridho/GPK-2336-2022","Maryudi, Ahmad/0000-0001-5051-7217; Nurrochmat, Dodik Ridho/0000-0002-4876-8612",,,,,56,27,29,0,33,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,JUN,2018,91.0,,,,SI,,1,4,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.02.007,0.0,,,4,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GG5VL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432763700001,0

We argue that, to mobilize and engage donors, the American Friends groups have to strike a balance between maintaining the 'entre-soi' and exclusiveness (by relying on a narrow spectrum of social capital) and reaching out to other people from different worlds, countries and groups of elites (by using a broad spectrum), especially since their transnational feature makes it more difficult for them to raise funds.","[Monier, Anne] ENS, EHESS, Paris, France",Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS),"Monier, A (通讯作者)，ENS, EHESS, Paris, France.",anne.monier@ens-lsh.org,,,,,,,27,7,7,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

This overuse both increases costs and lowers quality of care and is thus a major concern in the healthcare industry. The study first examines the impact of prenatal care utilization on cesarean delivery rates. It then determines whether socioeconomic status affects the use of prenatal care and thereby influences the cesarean delivery decision. Using exclusive French delivery data over the 2008-2014 period, with multilevel logit models, and controlling for relevant patient and hospital characteristics, we show that women who do not participate in prenatal education have an increased probability of a cesarean delivery compared to those who do. The study further indicates that attendance at prenatal education varies according to socioeconomic status. Low socioeconomic women are more likely to have cesarean deliveries and less likely to participate in prenatal education. This result emphasizes the importance of focusing on pregnancy health education, particularly for low-income women, as a potential way to limit unnecessary cesarean deliveries. Future studies would ideally investigate the effect of interventions promoting such as care participation on cesarean delivery rates.","[Milcent, Carine] French Natl Ctr Sci Res, Paris Jourdan Sci Econ, Paris, France; [Zbiri, Saad] Versailles St Quentin Univ, EA 7285, Montigny Le Bretonneux, France",Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; Universite Paris Saclay,"Zbiri, S (通讯作者)，Versailles St Quentin Univ, EA 7285, Montigny Le Bretonneux, France.",saad.zbiri3@uvsq.fr,,"Milcent, Carine/0000-0002-9367-2716; Zbiri, Saad/0000-0001-7059-0577",,,,,56,29,31,1,4,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

A more moderate complication-related impact on resource use and reimbursement was found for acute kidney injury (additional reimbursement: a,notsign5963, p < 0.001; extra length of stay: 7.92 days, p < 0.001; ventilation > 48 h: OR 6.93, p < 0.001) as well as for stroke (additional reimbursement: a,notsign4125, p < 0.001; extra length of stay: 4.68 days, p < 0.001; ventilation > 48 h: OR 5.73, p < 0.001). Pacemaker implantations, in contrast, were associated with comparably small increases in reimbursement (a,notsign662, p = 0.006) and length of stay (3.54 days, p = 0.006) and no impaired likelihood of mechanical ventilation more than 48 h (OR 1.22, p = 0.156). Interestingly, these complication-related consequences remain mostly unchanged after baseline risk-adjustment. Post procedural complications such as bleeding events, acute kidney injuries and strokes are associated with increased resource use and substantial amounts of additional reimbursement in Germany, which has important implications for decision making outside of the usual clinical sphere.","[Kaier, Klaus; Vach, Werner; Hehn, Philip] Univ Freiburg, Ctr Med Biometry & Med Informat, Fac Med, Stefan Meier Str 26, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Kaier, Klaus; Bode, Martin; Zirlik, Andreas; Zehender, Manfred; Reinoehl, Jochen] Freiburg Univ, Dept Cardiol & Angiol 1, Ctr Heart, Freiburg, Germany; [Reinecke, Holger] Univ Hosp Muenster, Div Vasc Med, Dept Cardiovasc Med, Munster, Germany; [Naci, Huseyin] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Social Policy, LSE Hlth, London, England; [Frankenstein, Lutz] Heidelberg Univ, Dept Cardiol, Pulmonol, Angiol, Heidelberg, Germany; [Bode, Martin] Osnabruck Univ Appl Sci, Fac Business Management & Social Sci, Osnabruck, Germany",University of Freiburg; University of Hamburg; University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf; University of Freiburg; University of Munster; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Kaier, K (通讯作者)，Univ Freiburg, Ctr Med Biometry & Med Informat, Fac Med, Stefan Meier Str 26, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany.;Kaier, K (通讯作者)，Freiburg Univ, Dept Cardiol & Angiol 1, Ctr Heart, Freiburg, Germany.",kaier@imbi.uni-freiburg.de,"Zirlik, Andreas/A-6400-2011; Kaier, Klaus/B-4227-2009; Vach, Werner/F-2512-2011","Zirlik, Andreas/0000-0001-6290-3297; Kaier, Klaus/0000-0003-0837-6945; Vach, Werner/0000-0003-1865-8399",,,,,22,7,8,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

We detect an inverted U-shaped relationship between temperature and TFP and show that it primarily drives the temperature-output effect. Both labor- and capital-intensive firms exhibit sensitivity to high temperatures. By mid 21st century, if no additional adaptation were to occur, we project that climate change will reduce Chinese manufacturing output annually by 12%, equivalent to a loss of $39.5 billion in 2007 dollars. This implies substantial local and global economic consequences as the Chinese manufacturing sector produces 32% of national GDP and supplies 12% of global exports. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of the research is to identify migration expectations of young people, to predict their impact on the labor market in the region and to identify methods of regulating these processes. The hypothesis of research is that one of the methods of regulation migration processes can be career guidance, which is understood as a continuous process of professional self-determination in the transformation of division and cooperation of labor in industrial revolution context. The first level involves a general assessment of the state of migration processes. At the second stage, the main methods are questionnaires, interviews and focus groups. The objects of the study were students of 11 classes from Omsk schools. The research reveals that the main issues of migration expectations of young people relate to aspects of education, employment, labor market.

The two types of pollution interact in the abatement cost function of the polluting firms through economies or diseconomies of scope. They are regulated by distinct entities, potentially with different instruments that are designed according to some specific agenda. We show that the choice of regulatory instrument and the timing of the regulations matter for efficiency. Emissions of the local pollutant are distorted if the regulators anticipate that trans boundary pollution will later be regulated through emission caps. The regulation is too stringent with diseconomies of scope, and not enough with economies of scope. In contrast, we obtain efficiency if the transboundary pollutant is regulated by emission taxes or tradable emission permits provided that the revenue from taxing emissions are redistributed to the countries in a lump-sum way and that the initial allocation of tradable emission permits is not linked to abatement costs.

The voluntary nature of the system implies that some fishermen adopted the CCS and others did not, generating in the latter a natural control group for evaluating the effect of the regulation. We used the stochastic frontier model to estimate technical inefficiency and a difference-in-difference approach to identify the effect of the regulatory change on the performance of vessels that joined the CCS, while controlling for the behavior of the vessels that remained in the common pool system. The introduction of cooperative catch shares in the sardine and anchovy fishery reduced technical efficiency in the vessels that adopted the CCS, on average. However, the impact on fisherman's technical efficiency was heterogeneous depending on the characteristics of the fishermen's organization. This suggests that the way in which fishermen organized affected their performance. Organizations that showed evidence of cooperation among members improved the technical efficiency of its members' vessels.","[Chavez Estrada, Gloria Angelica] Univ Agr Ecuador, Fac Ciencias Agr, POB 09-04-100, Guayaquil, Ecuador; [Quiroga Suazo, Miguel Angel; Dresdner Cid, Jorge David] Univ Concepcion, Dept Econ, Res Nucleus Environm & Nat Resource Econ, Casilla 160-C, Concepcion, Chile; [Quiroga Suazo, Miguel Angel; Dresdner Cid, Jorge David] Interdisciplinary Ctr Aquaculture Res INCAR, Concepcion, Chile",Universidad de Concepcion,"Estrada, GAC (通讯作者)，Univ Agr Ecuador, Fac Ciencias Agr, POB 09-04-100, Guayaquil, Ecuador.",gachavez@uagraria.edu.ec; mquirog@udec.cl; jdresdne@udec.cl,,"Quiroga, Miguel/0000-0002-7773-5764; Chavez Estrada, Gloria Angelica/0000-0002-5139-6928","Scientific Millennium Initiative, Chilean Ministry of Economics, Promotion, and Tourism [NS 100007]; [CONICYT/FONDAP/15110027]","Scientific Millennium Initiative, Chilean Ministry of Economics, Promotion, and Tourism;","We thank two anonymous referees and the journal's editor for comments on previous versions of this article.

National experiences show that there are some incentives for a country to move toward data localization. Some of the localization measures may be consistent with the current state of free-trade agreements such as the World Trade Organization's General Agreement on Trade in Services. Even international trade agreements on the horizon, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership and Trade in Services Agreement, allow some room for data localization. Drawing the fine line between prohibited and permitted data localization measures should wait for the future development of case law and state practice. Non-violation of the current international agreements, however, does not guarantee the best policy. Data localization tends to cause Galapagos syndrome, in which a short-term comfortable life in isolation leads to long-term extinction. This is particularly true in the market for electronic commerce, which is by its nature global rather than local. Data localization is a temporary abnormal phenomenon that occurs in a transient situation in which internet service providers fail to meet their social responsibility toward the community where the customers exist and incipient cooperation among national legal authorities fails to tackle the trans-border problems effectively.","[Chung, Chan-Mo] Inha Univ, Sch Law, Incheon, South Korea",Inha University,"Chung, CM (通讯作者)，Inha Univ, Sch Law, Incheon, South Korea.",cmc@inha.ac.kr,,,INHA UNIVERSITY Research Grant,INHA UNIVERSITY Research Grant,This work was supported by an INHA UNIVERSITY Research Grant.,,27,6,7,0,4,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

A better understanding of the mutual links between individual EU countries and the UK will allow us to learn more about the possible implications of Brexit for individual EU economies but also the potential consequences of Brexit for the UK. Analysing the economic implications of Brexit is particularly important from Slovakia's point of view, as the turnover of foreign trade with the United Kingdom has almost doubled over the past 10 years.

In this regard, the objectives of the paper are to establish an understanding of both the capital market in Romania and what it means to include companies in the MSCI-Morgan Stanley International Index. In this respect, the hypothesis of the research is that Romania has the potential to upgrade to the Emergent Market status given that at least three companies meet the minimum requirements, including those related to the Annual Traded Value Ratio proposed by the MSCI. Following a technical analysis using the MSCI methodology, it was found that the hypothesis is confirmed as three companies meet the ATVR target of at least 15%, such as Romgaz, Banca Transilvania, BRD Group Societe Generale except for OMV-Petrom, which only reached 12.62%. The company needs 19% of the total volume of the total stock market to bring the ATVR level to at least 15%, or USD 1,017,050,098. It can also be said that BRD Group Societe Generale should increase the Free Float market capitalization by 1.0534% that should reach the minimum required by MSCI USD, 763mln. By increasing offer through listing more companies on the Bucharest Stock Exchange and increasing demand through attracting retail investors, trade volumes will grow consistently. Also deepening the financial market, liquidity increases facilitating the decreasing of trade interests and prices leading the Romanian capital market a little bit less expensive. Data was collected from Bucharest Stock Exchange, Trading Statistics section, and daily reports. The methodology has two stages. As a first stage we establish the Annual Traded Value Ratios for 12 months (ATVR 12M) and ATVR for 3 months (ATVR 3M) for each company. The companies are Romgaz, OMV-Petrom, Banca Transilvania, and BRD-Group Societe Generale and the study case in the paper was be OMV-Petrom. During the analysis was elaborated by taking into consideration the MSCI Methodology. The second stage of calculations includes we find out what is the percentage of the total Market Volume that would lead key MSCI OMV-Petrom to increase its ATVR to 15%-minimum level imposed.","[Fleanta, Simona; Anghel, Lucian Claudiu] Natl Sch Polit & Adm Studies, 30 A Expozitiei Blvd,Sect 1, Bucharest 012104, Romania",National University of Political Studies & Public Administration (SNSPA) - Romania,"Fleanta, S (通讯作者)，Natl Sch Polit & Adm Studies, 30 A Expozitiei Blvd,Sect 1, Bucharest 012104, Romania.",simona-maria.fleanta@student.facultateademanagement.ro; lucian.anghel@student.facultateademanagement.ro,"Anghel, Lucian Claudiu/AAP-9604-2021",,,,,,28,0,0,0,1,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,180,189,,,,,,10,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200016,0

One of the reasons for this growth is an extensive usage of big data, since with a growing number of observations, the probability of outlier presence also rises. With an outlier presence, it is highly recommended to work with robust methods because standard methods are not able to deal correctly with outliers, and, consequently, standard estimates are usually biased. Autoregressive process AR(p) is well known and widely used in statistics and economical modelling. It is very important to estimate parameters of this model correctly, and we show the suitability of robust methods for this task. We present several robust methods and compare them with a standard method using a simulation study.

Drawing from the field of cultural studies, Hardin and Rottinghaus (in their 2015 article, Introducing a cultural approach to technology in financial markets) advocate for a cultural studies of finance, which emphasizes the critical consideration of the co-constructive nature of financial technologies and cultures. This paper builds off that provocation using the concept of 'rhetorical closure' (as described by Pinch and Bijker in 2012) to explore how industry media aimed at derivatives developers, traders, and investment bankers worked to define the meanings of new financial technologies. Using critical discourse analysis, this study examines how credit default swaps (CDSs) were presented in the financial industry media in the years 1995-2007, and how this framing contributed to the politics of these artifacts. It finds that the financial industry media produced a discourse about CDSs using multiple overlapping frames that overgeneralized the success of CDSs from narrowly specific evidence and applied constant competitive pressure to adopt new financial technologies. These discourses implicitly encouraged the rapid adoption and broad application of CDSs, thus helping to (re)produce a financial culture in which self-interest and short-term gains were prioritized.","[Forelle, Michelle C.] Univ Southern Calif, Commun Dept, Annenberg Sch Commun & Journalism, 3502 Watt Way, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Forelle, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Commun Dept, Annenberg Sch Commun & Journalism, 3502 Watt Way, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",forelle@usc.edu,,,International Balzan Prize Foundation,International Balzan Prize Foundation,This work was supported by International Balzan Prize Foundation.,,41,1,1,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

The main properties in time domain and frequency domain for proposed nonlinear stochastic cycle model were shown. The amplitude and phase of such cycle are stochastic and are directly defined by the amplitude and phase components. Extensions to multivariate case are possible. Our proposition gives an alternative for the popular stochastic cycle model, which can be reduced to linear ARMA model. For statistical inference, we do not need to use Kalman filter to compute the likelihood function, if we use state space models with single sources of error. However, the extension to the classical state space model with few sources of error is possible.

In 2015 all the above mentioned core countries formed Eurasian Economic Union with the inclusion of Armenia and Kyrgyz Republic. Statistical analysis shows that Customs Union had a significant impact on regional trade. Internal trade boosted during 2011-2012 and then tended to decline due to slow-down of Russian economy. Russian economic decline negatively impacted on regional growth and trade. Thus, objective of this paper is to determine the impact of Customs Union on regional trade with application of gravity model. By using data for the period of 2000-2015, we show that impact of Customs Union on regional trade was negative, but insignificant. These results can be explained by the structural problems of the regional economy, unfavorable external conditions, low level of economic diversification and a short period of the Customs Union functioning.","[Mukhamediyev, Bulat; Khitakhunov, Azimzhan] Al Farabi Kazakh Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Alma Ata, Kazakhstan",Al-Farabi Kazakh National University,"Mukhamediyev, B (通讯作者)，Al Farabi Kazakh Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Alma Ata, Kazakhstan.",bmukhamediyev@gmail.com; xit8_89@mail.ru,"Mukhamediyev, Bulat/P-5157-2014; Khitakhunov, Azimzhan/AAS-4417-2020","Mukhamediyev, Bulat/0000-0002-1490-302X;",,,,,23,3,3,0,10,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-67916-7; 978-3-319-67915-0,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,299,310,,10.1007/978-3-319-67916-7_19,0.0,,,12,Area Studies; Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL4TI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450786500019,0

The research is specifically focused on identifying the perceptions of human resources specialists regarding the use of popular online social networks in searching for talent, to investigate whether the use of special job recruitment platforms and human resources management platforms are useful for these endeavors. Within this research both perceived advantages and disadvantages of using online social networks as tools towards reaching the desired job are presented. From a methodological perspective, the research uses qualitative methods. The semi-structured interview was used for human resources professionals with more than 7 years of experience within the field, and with less experienced specialists. The research sample consisted of 12 participants between 23 and 45 years old. Considering the digitalization of human resources processes and the expansion of online social networks use within the recruitment and selection processes, the herein paper proceeds in exploring the nuances that appear in a competing environment. The interview analysis revealed that human resources professionals start developing a PR (public relations) and marketing mind-set considering the challenges that they are faced with in attracting a relevant pool of candidates on social media, but are also constrained by the limits imposed by the HR (human resources) norms within the organization. The HR professionals from our sample suggested that they are also getting involved in researching the online platforms where candidates spend most of their time and their efforts combined with the marketing objectives should reach desired results, when possible. The research findings are relevant for human resources activities and management considering the challenges these professionals face in understanding and grasping the new digital technologies.","[Novac, Carmen; Ciochina, Raluca Silvia] Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blvd,Sect 1, Bucharest 012104, Romania",National University of Political Studies & Public Administration (SNSPA) - Romania,"Novac, C (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blvd,Sect 1, Bucharest 012104, Romania.",carmen.novac@comunicare.ro; raluca.ciochina@comunicare.ro,"Ciochina, Raluca Silvia/GMX-2522-2022",,,,,,30,0,0,5,27,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,470,479,,,,,,10,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200041,0

The Republic of Croatia's legislation has completely harmonized this with the European one and in particular with the Anglo-American system in which types of liability had always been in place. The responsibility of a legal entity is founded on its individual (responsible) person and accepting the model of implemented liability with the theory of identification because the person responsible is identified with the legal entity and their acts and omissions are considered to be the acts/omissions of the legal entity. In Croatian legal criminal theory, a range of disputable issues of this type of liability have notionally been defined. An example of this is the circle of individual and legal entities liable which our court practice mainly accepts. However, research into the processing and structure of criminal acts of legal entities point to the fact that inquests and investigations of legal entities are lengthy; that a large number of reports are rejected because the informers are individual or legal entities who believe they are injured parties in a legal-civil way; that the court criminal policy towards legal entities is substantially different from the legislative; that the security measures are very rarely applied, just like confiscation of pecuniary gain and so on. Also, less legal entities are criminally reported than responsible individuals in these legal entities, which can be explained by the fact many legal entities have ceased to exist or by the fact a legal entity has several responsible persons. The structure of the acts of legal entities most commonly appearing in court practice shows that they are in particular from the area of white-collar crime. That is, mainly reported is fraud in business, abuse of trust in business, tax or customs evasion and so on. Then come acts against employment relations and social insurance, against the environment, against safety in general, against property, document forgery, against intellectual property and so on. Research into the judicature uncovers the existence of a kind of gap between normative solutions and their application in court practice.","[Radanovic, Nina Misic] Univ Split, Univ Dept Forens Sci, Rudera Boskovica 33, Split, Croatia",University of Split,"Radanovic, NM (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Univ Dept Forens Sci, Rudera Boskovica 33, Split, Croatia.",nina.misic.radanovic@unist.hr,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,225,234,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO8KK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000527683300024,0

One of the most important problems in construction is a problem of efficiency growth of machinery assets (machines, plant, means of transport and equipment) utilization. And if before it was to use machines as much as possible to get a rise in productivity, then now construction companies have enough equipment and need more assessment of its efficiency, based on degree provision definition. Besides, taking into account last foreign-policy developments there is a high relevance of import substitution issue in domestic production, including construction. That is why there is a high significance of production and delivery of domestic machines that can provide independent process execution and technological development. Provision of construction sites with machinery has a row of important special aspects for such a big country as Russia. In Europe, the vast majority of construction projects with the exception of the Alpine region are located in a habitable and populated area where there is a good infrastructure. In Russia, on the contrary, the majority of construction projects is pioneering and builds up infrastructure. It takes some particular machine independence during the service life of the production facilities. The complexity of delivery of replacement parts, service teams and maintenance vehicles to constructions sites increases the risk of wasted time that leads to the decline of machine train economic indicators and construction lags. That is why in Russia there has been a priority in favor of repairable systems when there has been a maintenance capability in construction sites. The second feature of Russian construction machinery is the mobile character of connection between actual maintenance cost and estimated maintenance cost. Since Russian pricing is based on unit costs then technical recourses included into them are taken into account in the cost estimates. Estimated cost in its turn determines first contract cost in any tender. The practice of fixed price contract implementation does not make it possible for construction companies to take into account economic operational features of their own fleet of construction machinery. The goal of the research is to determine how parameters of equipment configuration affect the estimated cost, industry-specific and national economic indicators. The research is based on methods of retrospective statistical analysis with a representative selection of production figures. It made it possible to synthesize multiplying indicators that characterize being provided with construction equipment.","[Soloviov, Viacheslav; Poltava, Alexander; Vlasov, Alexander] Russian Univ Transport, 9b9 Obrazcova St, Moscow, Russia; [Rustamova, Irada] Russian New Univ, 9b9 Obrazcova St, Moscow, Russia",Russian University of Transport; Russian New University,"Soloviov, V (通讯作者)，Russian Univ Transport, 9b9 Obrazcova St, Moscow, Russia.",S35681@yandex.ru; Espados@yandex.ru; alessandro.vlasov@mail.ru; irada@inbox.ru,"Rustamova, Irada/AAV-6380-2020","Rustamova, Irada/0000-0001-9379-2542",,,,,9,0,0,0,0,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,36,45,,,,,,10,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200003,0

A common strategic trend in these policies has been the tendency to attempt to increase access to medicines through price reduction, achieved by weakening patent protection. This paper, using the policy that has recently been adopted by the East African Community (EAC) member states as a case study, demonstrates the inappropriateness of this strategy. The core argument is that weakening patent protection will hinder further research and invention, which are necessary to ensure the availability of medicines. For developing countries, especially those in Africa, such as the EAC member states, the problem is aggravated by the fact that pharmaceuticals, due to commercial considerations, have already ignored investing in developing medicines for diseases predominant in these countries, hence the need to strengthen rather than weaken, patent protection.","[Soyeju, Olufemi] Univ Pretoria, Int Dev Law Unit, Ctr Human Rights, Fac Law, Pretoria, South Africa; [Wabwire, Joshua] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England",University of Pretoria; University of Oxford,"Soyeju, O (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Int Dev Law Unit, Ctr Human Rights, Fac Law, Pretoria, South Africa.",femi.soyeju@up.ac.za; wabwirejoshua@yahoo.com,,"Oluyeju, Olufemi/0000-0001-9748-3798",,,,,64,6,6,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JAN,2018,17.0,1,,,,,145,168,,10.1017/S1474745617000143,0.0,,,24,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,GA4CM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428277200006,0

Using the provincial panel data during the following period 1995-2010, we find robust evidence that central transfer (measured as the ratio of net central transfer to budgetary expenditure for each province) has a significant, negative effect on the fiscal capacity of a province (the sum of budgetary and extra-budgetary incomes as a percentage of GDP). Therefore, when the central government favors the poor provinces in central transfers (the common pool problem), the rich provinces expand their extra-budgetary income more to avoid predation by the central government, which helps increase the fiscal capacity and thus the market-preserving behavior of the rich provinces. Our result helps explain China's success, which has strong policy implications for other transitional economies.","[Sun, Meng] Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [He, Qichun] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Central University of Finance & Economics,"He, QC (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Econ & Management Acad, Econ, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",heqichun@cufe.edu.cn,,", Qichun/0000-0001-7643-3150",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in China [SKZZX2013034],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in China,Meng Sun thanks the financial support from the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. SKZZX2013034) in China.,,29,5,5,3,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

How are mundane queues made to constitute markets in settings where they performed anti-markets? The paper looks at this problem through ethnomethodology, which sees queuing as the prime example of how social-moral order is produced by participants of situations. Queues appear out of thin air, and can be analyzed as a 'designed enterprise' of small utterances and bodily gestures, accomplishing ordinariness. The paper rethinks how this theoretical approach can gauge the properties of 'invisible lines' in automated queues, and broadens its scope by framing queuers as objects of organizational control, and queues as not purely social but socio-technical accomplishments. Based on the observation of a digital waiting system in Hungarian banking, the paper shows how automated queue management changes the temporality and accountability between individuals and organizations, and reorders post-socialist banking as distinctly market-based service. Personal-physical lines are replaced with material 'governance pairs', which not only assess but rather format customers' financial needs. Market economy, as produced in mundane automation ties together an obscure order for service customers with total accountability for bank employees' performance.","[Vargha, Zsuzsanna] Univ Leicester, Sch Business, 213 Ken Edwards Bldg,Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Vargha, Zsuzsanna] ESCP Europe Business Sch, Management Control Dept, Paris, France",University of Leicester; heSam Universite; ESCP Business School,"Vargha, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Sch Business, 213 Ken Edwards Bldg,Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",zv8@leicester.ac.uk,"Vargha, Zsuzsanna/ABH-2955-2021","Vargha, Zsuzsanna/0000-0002-1578-6531",Columbia University,Columbia University,This work was supported by Columbia University: [Grant Number Harriman Institute PepsiCo Research and Travel Fel].,,56,2,2,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

Thanks to this, we can estimate not only the overall growth or decrease in the construction industry in the Czech Republic in the following period, but we can also estimate the structure of the companies in terms of their size, turnover and volume of sales.","[Vochozka, Marek] Inst Technol & Business, Okruzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice 37001, Czech Republic","Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice","Vochozka, M (通讯作者)，Inst Technol & Business, Okruzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice 37001, Czech Republic.",vochozkam@email.cz,"Vochozka, Marek/L-3154-2019","Vochozka, Marek/0000-0001-9923-7814",,,,,11,2,2,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,1874,1883,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400186,0

Brand positioning has received significant interest as a process that allows objectified gauging of customers' brand perceptions as compared to direct rivals. One of the most commonly used tools for graphically visualising the competitive perceptual spot of a brand in the mind of the customer is positioning maps. This paper aims to present some techniques for designing such maps with an emphasis on some ethical aspects of modern branding.

Our outcome measures are the standardized test scores from the national exams on the subjects of Danish, English, Mathematics, and Science administered by the Danish Ministry of Education. Our results indicate that fetal exposure to Ramadan is likely to have a negative impact on the achievement scores of Muslim students, especially among females. Our analysis further reveals that the estimated relationship is stronger among children with a relatively low socioeconomic background. Our findings lend support for the importance of interventions designed to assist economically disadvantaged women during pregnancy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Existing explanations of the rise of the VAT tend to emphasize the effects of international and economic factors, with domestic processes largely assumed to be apolitical. In this article, I take an alternative approach and theorize about the domestic political foundations of adoption. In particular, I apply existing theories of the relationship between welfare state generosity and regressive taxation to develop hypotheses about VAT adoption. I test the hypotheses using an event history approach and data on VAT adoptions in 22 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries from 1960 to 2012. Using a variety of model specifications, I find strong support for the effects of corporatism and, to a lesser extent, proportional representation on early VAT adoption. Conversely, I find no support for the proposition that welfare state generosity or left-wing government partisanship facilitated early adoption.","[Helgason, Agnar Freyr] Univ Iceland, EDDA Ctr Excellence, Gimli G-201,Saemundargotu 2, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland",University of Iceland,"Helgason, AF (通讯作者)，Univ Iceland, EDDA Ctr Excellence, Gimli G-201,Saemundargotu 2, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.",afh@hi.is,"Helgason, Agnar Freyr/J-9301-2019","Helgason, Agnar Freyr/0000-0001-8733-019X",,,,,42,12,12,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

In this article, the authenticity of the scenario planning of the 'Local Governments of the Future' program is questioned. It is found that the 'Local Governments of the Future' program's scenario planning is not a real scenario planning but, instead, a continuation of the neoliberal discourse by hegemonic stakeholders that seek to 'close' the future.

It outlines arguments that gig' or digital work is not a new phenomenon but a resurgence of older, unregulated labour extraction methods and outlines the need for a more nuanced way of measuring the dimensions of job insecurity and their corrosive effects. In foreshadowing potential policy approaches to addressing the regulatory deficit surrounding gig economy work, it argues for an eclectic approach to using and strengthening legislation designed to safeguard the rights of consumers and providers of services, including contractors, and regardless of employment status. Finally, it foreshadows a study of how a successful union movement respond to the gig economy - negotiation with a digital platform to bring advertised hourly pay rates into line with the minima set within the industrial relations system for employment in the relevant industries.","[Flanagan, Frances] United Voice, 303 Cleveland St, Redfern, NSW 2016, Australia",,"Flanagan, F (通讯作者)，United Voice, 303 Cleveland St, Redfern, NSW 2016, Australia.",fnflanagan@googlemail.com,,"Flanagan, Frances/0000-0002-3401-1918",,,,,1,15,16,3,96,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

We explore what community engagement in fire management might contribute, and how policy conditions enable or constrain deliberative practices in fire management in two very different countries, Sweden and Australia. In Sweden, burning is gradually emerging on foresters' and nature conservationists' agendas, whereas in Australia, prescribed burning has been practiced and debated on a relatively broad scale for some time. Both countries rely much on technical expertise, while merging this with local knowledge in transformative processes in which conflicts and difference have a place could enhance the quality of the debates.

First, we put it in the context of earlier debates on the impact of technology on the employment structure and job quality, discussing the difficulties of the concept of routine used in this new literature and its operationalization. Then, using our own operationalization of tasks, we argue that routine tasks are not associated with skills in the non-linear polarized way predicted by the discussed hypothesis, nor to the observed cases of job polarization in Europe in 19952007. Routine and cognitive task content are similarly (albeit in reverse) linked to the relative expansion of higher-paid occupations recently observed in most European economies. This suggests that the occupational effects of Routine-and Skill-Biased technical change are similar, and that the phenomenon of job polarization observed in some European countries is not primarily the result of technological factors.","[Fernandez-Macias, Enrique; Hurley, John] European Fdn Improvement Living & Working Condit, Wyattville Rd, Dublin 18, Ireland",,"Fernández-Macías, E (通讯作者)，European Fdn Improvement Living & Working Condit, Wyattville Rd, Dublin 18, Ireland.",efe@eurofound.europa.eu,"Hurley, John/C-8051-2017; Fernandez-Macias, Enrique/ABA-3150-2020","Fernandez-Macias, Enrique/0000-0002-1087-2369",,,,,27,52,52,1,62,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

However, concrete mechanisms of neoliberal resilience are yet to be elaborated. This article elaborates such mechanisms by incorporating Amable's notion of institutional hierarchy into Mahoney and Thelen's gradual institutional change theory. In doing this, it provides a dynamic and politically grounded framework to analyze institutional resilience. Neoliberalism is maintained over time because dominant social blocs defend those policies and institutions that they perceive as more favorable to their interests (high-hierarchy institutions), while allowing degrees of freedom in those that matter less (low-hierarchy institutions). Four mechanisms account for the resilience of high-hierarchy institutions: marginal adjustment, solidification, accommodation and compromise. I explore the potential of this framework by comparing the trajectory of two related policy domains, exchange rates and industrial policy, in countries with a long history of neoliberal policymaking: Chile and Estonia.","[Madariaga, Aldo] Univ Andres Bello, Escuela Sociol, Republ 276, Santiago, Chile",Universidad Andres Bello,"Madariaga, A (通讯作者)，Univ Andres Bello, Escuela Sociol, Republ 276, Santiago, Chile.",aldomadariaga@gmail.com,,"Madariaga, Aldo/0000-0002-1219-8355",,,,,69,20,22,1,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

I show that prior to the policy, for every ten poor students who score college-ready on the ACT or SAT, there are an additional five poor students who would score college-ready but who take neither exam. I use a difference-in-differences strategy to estimate the effects of the policy on postsecondary attainment and find small increases in enrollment at four-year institutions. The effects are concentrated among students less likely to take a college entrance exam in the absence of the policy and students in the poorest high schools. The students induced by the policy to enroll persist through college at approximately the same rate as their inframarginal peers.

Comparisons reveal that independent for-and non-profit charter schools locate in similar markets and serve similar student bodies, whereas for-profits belonging to a network locate in lower income, denser, and more Hispanic areas. Bearing out the concerns of parents and policymakers, regression estimates indicate that, among independent charters, for-profits spend less per pupil on instruction and achieve lower student proficiency gains. By contrast, among charter schools belonging to a network, for-profits spend approximately 11% less per pupil, but expenses on student instruction are not being cut. The estimates, which control for differences across schools in student composition and other characteristics, imply that an equivalent level of per pupil expenses purchases about 0.03 sigma higher student proficiency at network for-profit charter schools.

However, spinal surgery using these techniques is expensive and has a significant impact on the budgets of hospitals and Healthcare Systems. While reusable and disposable instruments for laparoscopic interventions have been studied in literature, no specific information exists regarding instrument kits for lumbar arthrodesis. The aim of the present study was to perform a complete health technology assessment comparing a disposable instrument kit for lumbar arthrodesis (innovative device) with the standard reusable instrument. Methods: A prospective and observational study was implemented, by means of investigation of administrative records of patients undergoing a lumbar arthrodesis surgical procedure. The evaluation was conducted in 2013, over a 12-month time horizon, considering all the procedures carried out using the two technologies. A complete health technology assessment and a multi-criteria decision analysis approach were implemented in order to compare the two alternative technologies. Economic impact (with the implementation of an activity based costing approach), social, ethical, organisational, and technology-related aspects were taken into account. Results: Although the cost analysis produced similar results in the comparison of the two technologies (total cost equal to (sic)4,279.1 and (sic)4,242.6 for reusable instrument kit and the disposable one respectively), a significant difference between the two instrument kits was noted, in particular concerning the organisational impact and the patient safety.

Summer heat can negatively affect student learning, as previous studies have shown that high temperatures in laboratory settings have a negative effect on cognitive abilities. For this analysis, the test scores of five different cohorts were combined with city-level daily temperature data. To control for unobserved heterogeneity, the test scores of students within the same school were compared over time (school-fixed effects estimation). Summer heat negatively affected student test scores. Specifically, an additional day with a maximum daily temperature exceeding 34 degrees C (93.2 degrees F) during the summer, relative to a day with a maximum temperature between 28 degrees C (82.4 degrees F) and 30 degrees C (86 degrees F), decreased the scores of math and English tests by 0.0042 and 0.0064 standard deviations, respectively. No significant effects were found on the reading test scores. In addition, these effects were larger in relatively cooler cities, but did not differ based on gender. Finally, the previous year's summer also had negative effects on the current year's test scores. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This article focuses attention on State Forest Enterprises (SFEs) based in Europe. They manage state-owned forest areas, which amount to more than 40% of all forest cover in the EU and hence their performance influences the development of the whole sector, maintaining forest resources stability and productive potentials. This should be done through stakeholders' inclusiveness etc., so it is necessary to monitor their activities and further impacts. The common way to do this is through reporting practices. Information disclosed in reports can provide insights into the level of transparency, accountability and openness. Thus, this article aims to analyse the reporting systems of SFEs in terms of sustainable forest management and corporate responsibility. We used content analysis, sustainability metrics and a set of indicators to assess and analyse patterns and structure of disclosed information in the reports of selected SFEs. Results revealed much diversity in approaches towards the implementation of sustainability standards. It is suggested that the adoption of a common scheme for periodic reporting will allow communication to a wider public and comparative analysis of SFEs on a large scale. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This turn is being legitimized with reference to how algorithms are allegedly more rational and efficient than human traders, and less prone to emotionally motivated decisions. We argue that although HFT does not render humans irrelevant, it is leading to a reconfiguration of both the ideal trading subject and the human-machine relations. Drawing on interviews with and ethnographic observations of high-frequency traders, as well as HFT 'how to' books, we analyze the subjectivity and self-techniques of the ideal high-frequency trader. We demonstrate that these traders face the challenge of avoiding emotional interference in their algorithms and that they deploy a set of disciplinary self-techniques to curb the importance of emotional attachment.","[Borch, Christian; Lange, Ann-Christina] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Polit & Philosophy, Porcelaenshaven 18A, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Borch, C (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Polit & Philosophy, Porcelaenshaven 18A, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",cbo.mpp@cbs.dk,,"Borch, Christian/0000-0001-8217-5880",'Crowd Dynamics in Financial Markets' Sapere Aude Grant from the Danish Council for Independent Research,'Crowd Dynamics in Financial Markets' Sapere Aude Grant from the Danish Council for Independent Research,This work was supported by a 'Crowd Dynamics in Financial Markets' Sapere Aude Grant from the Danish Council for Independent Research.,,73,38,39,1,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Under such a program, institutions would be required to pay for a portion of the student loans among which their students defaulted. I examine the predicted institutional responses under a variety of possible penalties and institutional characteristics using a straightforward model of institutional behavior based on monopolistic competition. I also examine the impact of a risk sharing program on overall economic efficiency by estimating the returns to scale for undergraduate enrollment (as well as other outputs) among each of ten educational sectors. My estimates suggest that a risk-sharing program would induce only a modest tuition increase, with considerable heterogeneity across sectors. Two different penalty structures are analyzed in the context of the model, and alternative institutional responses such as tuition discounting and credit rating students are discussed.

The fiscal consolidation imposed by the European Union on highly indebted countries was based on the assumptions of so-called expansionary austerity. However, the reality so far provides proof to the contrary, and the results outlined in this article support the opposing view of a self-defeating austerity. Based on a model of the input-output relations of the productive system, an unemployment rate/budget balance trade-off equation is derived, as well as the impact of a strong fiscal consolidation based on social transfers and the notion of a neutral budget balance. An application to the Portuguese case confirms the huge costs of a strong fiscal consolidation, both in terms of unemployment and social policy regress. The conclusion is that too much consolidation in anyone year makes consolidation more difficult in the following year.

The paper reviews these causes and factors during the periods before India experienced forest transition and after it experienced forest transition, which happened during the 1980s. Causes and forces that caused deforestation and forest degradation were forest exploitation for timber, an increased population that sought agricultural land, economic modernization through expansion of agricultural production, forest dependence and related forest exploitation, and even forest conversion when forest land became notified and thus forest owners lost rights to derive benefits from forests. Causes and factors that reduced deforestation and forest degradation and resulted in forest recovery, included agricultural intensification, government policies, private tree and forest production and smallholder and community forestry. Multiple forest transition pathways can be signaled as having contributed to forest transition pathways in India.

In prior decisions under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Article III:4, the AB correctly rejected protectionist rules that unnecessarily encumbered consumer choice, while adversely effecting conditions of competition for imports. In US-COOL, however, the AB formalistically transposed such GATT jurisprudence into TBT analysis, equating private action in compliance with neutral, transparency-promoting labeling rules to private action in compliance with capricious, opacity-inducing distribution rules. This article argues that, while GATT NT-jurisprudence should enlighten analysis under the TBT, WTO adjudicators should not allow exporting Members' perceived entitlement to trade volumes which may well be premised on continued opacity and uninformed consumer choice - to interfere with importing Members' origin-neutral regulations.

Non-industrial private forest (NIPF) ownership is the dominant ownership group in the southern US, but little is understood about landowners' willingness to manage forests for carbon sequestration. This study examines NIPF landowner willingness to delay final timber harvest for additional carbon sequestration despite unknowns about positive or negative impacts to profitability that result from carbon price fluctuations. Survey data from 735 landowners in the southern United States were used to estimate a probit model analyzing their participation behavior. Landowner willingness to participate in carbon sequestration practices was 55%, 25%, and 16% when such practices were more profitable, revenue neutral or less profitable than timber management only, respectively. Although many landowners would require a significant monetary incentive to participate in carbon sequestration, others would participate with little or ho incentive. Those having recreational goals for their property were the most likely group to participate in carbon sequestration. Management changes (i.e., management plan and verification requirements) and carbon revenue were the two most important determinants of their probability of participation. In summary, this study provides a better understanding of the relationship between landowner participation and socioeconomic details, sequestration program attributes, attitudes, and behaviors. Designing education, incentive, and assistance programs that align with landowners' recreational goals would result in a low-cost carbon sequestration policy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This research supplements, through implementing strategic interaction, earlier research analyzing one player at a time. The first two players distribute funds between preventing and treating diseases. The population reacts by degree of risky behavior which may cause no disease, disease contraction, recovery, sickness/death. More funds to prevention implies less disease contraction but higher death rate given disease contraction. The cost effectiveness of treatment relative to prevention, country specific conditions, and how the international community converts funds compared with the policy maker in a country, are illustrated. We determine which factors impact funding, e.g. large probabilities of disease contraction, and death given contraction, and if the recovery utility and utility of remaining sick or dying are far below the no disease utility. We also delineate how the policy maker and international community may free ride on each other's contributions. The model is tested against empirical data for 43 African countries. The results show consistency between the theoretical model and empirical estimates.

This study is based on the data acquired through the nation-wide public opinion survey carried out in Latvia in March 2016 (n 1009), covering pro-environmental behavior practice and personal value orientations. The initial findings reveal that people are concerned about the environmental problems and at least half of them are willing to reduce their environmental impact. However, as it is clear from the majority of related studies during the past decades, these concerns and good intentions rarely lead to real pro-environmental behavior. This paper investigates the link between values, current household behavior patterns, environmental impact and willingness to act pro-environmentally. The key conclusion is that values have a slight positive correlation with current (carbon footprint) as well as intended (Willingness to Act Index) pro-environment behavior and it brings us closer to the understanding of underlying motivations behind household behavior; however, results from the regression analysis clearly indicate that values explain only small part of our pro-environmental behaviors.

Through an analysis of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, this article illustrates the strategic appropriation of evidence-based medicine (narratives and practices) that pharmaceutical companies have undertaken to enhance the value of their products. While governments are concentrated on the measurement of costs and efficiency (cost-effectiveness), companies attempt to find the threshold of effectiveness that supports their estimation of value. I have called such mode of calculation, price-effectiveness. Pharmaceutical companies engage in different ways with CEA in devising their own price strategies. First, CEA is used as an instrument to raise HPV vaccines as a matter of interest for health authorities. Second, companies produce models to maximise the effectiveness of their products. Third, the expense side of CEA has opened an opportunity to represent some conditions as diseases in order to increase the potential value of the vaccine, expressed in a higher price. Debates and practices of pricing offer a unique opportunity to trace how particular forms of quantification have become the common ground in the demonstration of value in healthcare and the adaptation of companies.","[Castaneda, Oscar Javier Maldonado] Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies Technol & Social Change, Linkoping, Sweden",Linkoping University,"Castañeda, OJM (通讯作者)，Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies Technol & Social Change, Linkoping, Sweden.",oscar.maldonado.castaneda@liu.se,"Maldonado, Oscar/J-7026-2019; Maldonado, Oscar/U-8609-2017","Maldonado, Oscar/0000-0002-0142-3625; Maldonado, Oscar/0000-0002-0142-3625",European Research Council [263657]; European Research Council (ERC) [263657] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"This work was supported by the European Research Council [grant number 263657], Project: Prescriptive Prescriptions.

It finds that all women groups seek to optimize their remunerated work allocation throughout their life cycle, although women's labor behaviors vary depending on educational levels. The rising trend of women's labor force participation is expected to continue; its implications at the intensive margin are ambiguous and depend on how women conciliate paid work with household responsibilities - especially women with less education.

IFRS have gained world-wide recognition with more than 100 countries require public companies to use IFRS. However, in spite of the growing popularity of IFRS the implementation and usage of IFRS still varies largely across countries and seems not very popular in Estonia. The present research examines the main reasons why large and medium sized companies in Estonia are not willing to voluntary adopt IFRS. The authors conducted a survey among large and medium Estonian companies. The main findings of the research suggest that costs of transition to IFRS outweigh the benefits, which in most cases are not that significant and recognized by companies. It was also noted that the audit fees are higher for the reports prepared in accordance with IFRS than compared to the ones prepared under local GAAP. Based on the results of the research it may be concluded that currently Estonian companies do not see IFRS as the number one in their priority list and would prefer to report under local GAAP.","[Grigorjan, Anna; Gurvits, Natalja; Nikitina-Kalamae, Monika] Tallinn Univ Technol, Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology,"Gurvits, N (通讯作者)，Tallinn Univ Technol, Tallinn, Estonia.",natalja.gurvits@ttu.ee,"Gurvitš-Suits, Natalie/GWB-9557-2022",,,,,,39,0,0,0,4,ANGLO-AMER UNIV,PRAHA 1,"LETENSKA 5, PRAHA 1, 118 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-906585-4-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,196,206,,,,,,11,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393100015,0

David Harvey is more specific and cites 1979 as the dawn of the new era [2005, The New Spirit of Capitalism, Verso, London]. This paper seeks to build on this scholarship of the changing spirit of capitalism and read it through the development of the heroic figure of the American imagination, through the representation of the capitalist hero. Its aim is to situate the figure of the capitalist hero in the post-crash era and ultimately to understand the seductive power of the new capitalism that enables it to thrive. My thesis is that the seductive power of the new capitalism can be understood as an oscillation between revulsion and awe, we are both morally repulsed by the venality of capitalism yet also captivated by it. Revulsion and awe are at the core of the libidinality of the new capitalism and can be seen through the representation of the heroic object of the capitalist imagination.","[Hancock, David] Buckinghamshire New Univ, Soc & Hlth, High Wycombe, Bucks, England",Buckinghamshire New University,"Hancock, D (通讯作者)，Buckinghamshire New Univ, Soc & Hlth, High Wycombe, Bucks, England.",dchancock@gmx.com,,,,,,,53,4,4,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

The results provide evidence that, while liberalization may initially increase the probability of a crisis, the prospect of a crisis drops dramatically at higher levels of financial openness.

The two-stage methodological approach was applied to analyse a problem. The first stage includes the formulation of an analytical tool in the form of an international trade model based on the model of comparative advantage whose outputs are transformed into the language of the game theory apparatus and presented by a payoff matrix. Based on the payoff matrix, the relevant analyses are then performed in the second stage. In analogy with market reality, two elementary game strategies were analysed - the strategy of cooperation and the myopic strategy. It has been shown that the cooperation based on the cartel model of two firms is to a certain extent an adequate description of the behaviour model of two co-trading countries provided that the input assumptions of game theory are not significantly violated. The article explains why the foreign trade cartel is economically beneficial to all citizens of the trading countries unlike the cartel of companies operating within the same market, where the companies take key advantage from cooperation at the expense of consumer welfare.","[Haskova, Simona] Sch Expertness & Valuat, Inst Technol & Business, Okrzzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice 37001, Czech Republic","Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice","Hasková, S (通讯作者)，Sch Expertness & Valuat, Inst Technol & Business, Okrzzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice 37001, Czech Republic.",haskovas@post.cz,"Hašková, Simona/N-3667-2019","Haskova, Simona/0000-0002-4971-7972",,,,,16,0,0,0,0,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2261-2424,,,SHS WEB CONF,,,2017,39.0,,,,,,,,1008.0,10.1051/shsconf/20173901008,0.0,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL5MQ,,"gold, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452181300008,0

Currently published scientific contributions mainly highlight the importance of brand innovation in selected sectors of national economies abstracting from innovation perceptions due to the national socio-psychological profile. This is the reason why universally applicable theory of innovation in scope of brand value building and managing is missing. The lack of the theory can be removed by identification of importance of innovation attributes as brand value sources in context of market specifics. So, the aim of this paper is to provide such an identification and to verify existence of divergences between foreign theory and domestic practice.

To identify the impact of external factors on financial stability of construction companies correlation and regression analysis for years 2007-2015 were used. This research was carried out in two main steps. Firstly was explored the influence of three important macroeconomic variables: real gross domestic product (CDP), inflation rate and unemployment rate on profitability (ROA, ROE) and liquidity (Current Ratio) ratios of construction industry in the country overall and, as a second step, on financial stability of the company Metrostav in particular. The company was chosen as one of the most successful construction companies operated in the Czech Republic. Results of correlation and regression analysis are presented in four separated tables.

It does so by exploring the different ways in which journalists at Valor Economico, the leading economic newspaper in Brazil, compete and cooperate in the production of news. Valor is a paradigmatic case for discussing valuation practices in newsmaking since its institutional promise is to produce news of value. How, if at all, do Valor journalists embrace the promise of producing news that generates value? Elaborating on Stark's (2009. The sense of dissonance. Accounts of worth in economic life. Princeton University Press) idea of dissonance, it is contended that different orders of worth collide and cooperate within Valor newsroom. Moreover, journalists engage in a variety of valuation practices through which these orders of worth are shaped, defined, and refined, reflecting different understandings of economy and society, and different conceptions of what journalism is good for. I argue that Valor's direction intentionally fosters a plural space of value dissonance in order to improve the quality of news reporting. I emphasise, however, that these dissonances are only productive against a larger background of consonance about what actually there is to disagree about. The article is based on a seven-month ethnography of Valor's newsroom in Sao Paulo between 2013 and 2015.","[Undurraga, Tomas] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Sociol Dept, Santiago, Chile; [Undurraga, Tomas] UCL, Dept Sci & Technol Studies, London, England",Universidad Alberto Hurtado; University of London; University College London,"Undurraga, T (通讯作者)，Univ Alberto Hurtado, Sociol Dept, Santiago, Chile.;Undurraga, T (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Sci & Technol Studies, London, England.",tundurraga@uahurtado.cl,,"Undurraga, Tomas/0000-0003-4267-5826",European Research Council under the European Union/ERC [283754]; Chilean Government through Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) via Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico [FONDAP/15130009]; European Research Council (ERC) [283754] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council under the European Union/ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); Chilean Government through Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) via Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico; European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"This research has received funding from the H2020 European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)/ERC grant agreement No. 283754.

The existing multilateral rules embodied in the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Measures are increasingly being supplemented by a series of bilateral and multilateral agreements. Unlike debates surrounding intellectual property rights, the negotiations concerning SPS rules in preferential trade agreements are rarely analysed in a systematic and detailed manner. The article uses the SPS Chapter negotiated for purposes of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA) as a model for the future of SPS governance and compares it to the existing disciplines under the SPS Agreement. While the future of the TPPA in its current iteration may be in doubt, the US has clearly posited its SPS Chapter as a blueprint for future SPS governance. While the SPS Chapter contains some procedural advances in SPS governance, its substantive rules - or lack thereof - are not only at odds with the existing SPS regime; they exhibit a flawed understanding of scientific enquiry and how to deal with the uncertainty inherent therein.","[Wagner, Markus] Univ Warwick, Sch Law, Law, Warwick, England",University of Warwick,"Wagner, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Sch Law, Law, Warwick, England.",m.wagner@warwick.ac.uk,"Wagner, Markus/GZB-1978-2022","Wagner, Markus/0000-0002-3919-8945",,,,,91,9,9,0,5,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

It is shown that there exists evidence in favor of capitalskill complementarity on the full sample of China. When we test its regional differences, we find no evidence in favor of capital-skill complementarity in the central and western regions, but strong evidence in the eastern region. Further study finds that, the capital-skill complementarity exists in the threshold effect. Thus, we argue that the original differences of capital-skill complementarity are relative to the economic development. These results reveal that the low-income region (such as the central and western regions) tends to allocate their capital to complement their abundance of unskilled labor but not skilled labor, but the middle-income region (such as the eastern region) shows just the opposite trend. In short, this article provides some new evidences for the nonlinearity of capital-skill complementarity and supports the viewpoint on transitory phenomenon of capital-skill complementarity.","[Wang, Ren] Chongqing Technol & Business Univ, Coll Finance, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Ma, Hongqi] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Bldg 14,Unit 10,502,2 Yongkang Alley, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chongqing Technology & Business University; China Agricultural University,"Ma, HQ (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Bldg 14,Unit 10,502,2 Yongkang Alley, Beijing, Peoples R China.",hongqi_ma@126.com,,,,,,,28,2,2,3,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The research has shown that the issues of education for sustainable development in rural areas do concern the youths, especially in the environmental aspect. The students notice the presence of these issues, they appear to have a certain level of environmental awareness and some of the aspects of sustainable development. It is necessary to constantly broaden children's, youths' and their teachers' educational capabilities, including study of responsibility for the environment and sustainable development of rural areas.","[Wielewska, Izabela; Prus, Piotr] UTP Univ Sci & Technol Bydgoszcz, Bydgoszcz, Poland; [Gliniak, Maciej] Agr Univ Krakow, Krakow, Poland; [Sobczyk, Wiktoria] AGH Univ Sci & Technol Krakow, Krakow, Poland",Bydgoszcz University of Science & Technology; Agricultural University Krakow; AGH University of Krakow,"Wielewska, I (通讯作者)，UTP Univ Sci & Technol Bydgoszcz, Bydgoszcz, Poland.",izabel2000@wp.pl,"Prus, Piotr/L-6034-2019; Gliniak, Maciej/M-1155-2019; Sobczyk, Wiktoria/D-5076-2018","Prus, Piotr/0000-0002-4447-4019; Gliniak, Maciej/0000-0002-2244-1726; Sobczyk, Wiktoria/0000-0003-2082-9644",,,,,20,4,4,1,8,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-261-3,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2017,,45,,,,,250,257,,,,,,8,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BI1NY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406530100030,0

Three different models are presented: a fully open economy, a closed economy and an economy where selected prices are exogenously determined. The reaction in terms of land allocation occurs in an intuitive manner only in the case of certain market conditions. In more complex situations, no general prediction of the land use change is possible. The introduction of policy programmes to boost forestry has different effects in open and partially open economies. Therefore, the different channels by which the prices of goods and factors determine the allocation of land are identified. This approach allows for the formulation of specifications permitting a grouping of economies with different market structures into classes with equal land allocation patterns.","[Deegen, Peter; Halbritter, Andreas] Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Environm Sci, Professorship Forest Policy & Forest Resource Eco, D-01735 Dresden, Tharandt, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden,"Deegen, P (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Environm Sci, Professorship Forest Policy & Forest Resource Eco, D-01735 Dresden, Tharandt, Germany.",deegen@forst.tu-dresden.de; halbritter@forst.tu-dresden.de,,,,,,,19,2,2,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,DEC,2018,97.0,,,,,,122,131,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.09.014,0.0,,,10,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,HE0KP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452955800013,0

This paper looks to understand how the breadth and depth of participation of different types of actors, most particularly civil society, compares between these initiatives and in what ways the structure of the governance arrangement and/or the focus of commodities may influence this participation. The paper presents findings from an assessment study on the dynamics of participation of civil society actors in REDD + and FLEGT processes in four countries of Central and Western Africa: Cameroon, Ghana, Liberia and the Republic of Congo. Building on key civil society participation literature, a questionnaire tool was developed and applied in these countries. The analysis is drawn from interviews based on the questionnaire tool, some in-depth interviews and secondary research. The study finds that there is a growing recognition of civil society participation in national policy making of forest governance in the four countries, and a majority of the civil society organisations are participating in REDD+ and FLEGT processes. The quality and degree of their participation (that can range from informing to empowering) however, varies between FLEGT and REDD+ (i.e. FLEGT being more accommodative than REDD+), among a diversity of these actors and the studied countries. The difference in participation between REDD+ and FLEGT is related to the design of these two processes, the general lack of time and financial investment and the technical nature of REDD+ consultations. Moreover, FLEGT has been more inclusive and participatory right from the beginning whereas participatory spaces are generally lacking in REDD+ process, most particularly in its initial stages. As REDD+ and FLEGT processes are being consolidated in these countries and worldwide, this paper provides several avenues of interventions needed to address gaps on participation, such as strengthening participatory platforms, addressing representation deficit for community groups and focusing on capacity building of civil society actors.","[Satyal, Poshendra] Univ East Anglia, Global Environm Justice Grp, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"Satyal, P (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Global Environm Justice Grp, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",p.satyal@uea.ac.uk,,"Satyal, Poshendra/0000-0003-3503-5011",European Union; University of East Anglia,European Union(European Union (EU)); University of East Anglia,"Financial assistance for this study was provided through a grant from the European Union and the University of East Anglia.

The two main methods for estimating this output, namely the human capital and the friction cost method, lead to very different results, particularly for cases of long-term absence, which makes the choice of method a critical dilemma. Two hidden assumptions, one for each method, are identified in this paper: for human capital method, the assumption that had the accident not happened the individual would remain alive, healthy and employed until retirement, and for friction cost method, the assumption that any created vacancy is covered by an unemployed person. Relevant adjustments to compensate for their impact are proposed: (a) to depreciate the estimates of the human capital method for the risks of premature death, disability or unemployment and (b) to multiply the estimates of the friction cost method with the expected number of job shifts that will be caused by a disability. The impact of these adjustments on the final estimates is very important in terms of magnitude and can lead to better results for each method.","[Targoutzidis, Antonis] Hellen Inst Occupat Hlth & Safety ELINYAE, 26th October Str 90, Thessaloniki 54628, Greece",,"Targoutzidis, A (通讯作者)，Hellen Inst Occupat Hlth & Safety ELINYAE, 26th October Str 90, Thessaloniki 54628, Greece.",ant_targo@hotmail.com,,,,,,,14,5,5,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

We characterize the drivers for non-uniform optimal taxes stemming from the interaction of household heterogeneity with social preferences. Quantitatively assessing the case of price-based CO2 emissions control in the U.S. economy, we find that uniform emissions pricing is approximately optimal when social concerns are defined over inequity induced by the environmental tax. The deviation from uniform emissions pricing, however, becomes non-negligible when pollution tax rebates deviate much from optimal transfer schemes or when social concerns are defined over both policy-induced impacts and inequity unrelated to environmental policy. Our results are robust to a number of model extensions including the stringency of the environmental target, downstream vs. upstream taxation, pre-existing distortionary taxes, and parametric uncertainty in firms' and households' equilibrium tax responses.

When a successful project has distinct private and public benefits, a publicly-funded subsidy may be warranted to induce a pilot project, a full project, or both. We draw on insights about the value of experimentation for entrepreneurship and raising private capital to derive insights about when subsidizing projects or pilots is more efficient.

In this context, our article provides a theoretical analysis of these management modes of pension obligations, based on a comprehensive review of existing practice and regulation. The latter are still inconsistent with the individual savings model that has been fostered by international institutions, including the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) Board. According to our frame of analysis, a variety of viable modes of pension management exists and may be acknowledged. Overcoming the received opposition between defined contribution and defined benefit systems, our approach elaborates a model of pension management with a view to clarifying and improving pension protection, that is, the assurance of continued provision of pension payments at their agreed levels under viable alternative modes of pension management. The definition of financial sustainability depends on the pension management mode that is applied. With the help of this model, we further develop policy recommendations for accounting and prudential regulations concerning pension obligations.","[Biondi, Yuri] Univ Paris Dauphine PSL, CNRS, IRISSO, Paris, France; [Biondi, Yuri] ESCP Europe, Labex ReFi, Paris, France; [Sierra, Marion] Univ Paris 09, PSL Res Univ, Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; heSam Universite; ESCP Business School; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine,"Biondi, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Dauphine PSL, CNRS, IRISSO, Paris, France.;Biondi, Y (通讯作者)，ESCP Europe, Labex ReFi, Paris, France.",yuri.biondi@gmail.com,,,,,,,84,1,1,1,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Applying the modified framework to the US market for shrimp, the pass-through elasticity of the import price into the domestic price was found to be less than one, as predicted by theory when domestic and imported versions of a good are imperfect substitutes. Among the supply and demand shifters included in the model, the most important variables to affect the domestic price are exchange rate and the price of diesel fuel. The pass-through elasticities for diesel fuel (0.38) and exchange rate (0.55) are almost as large as for import price (0.60). This suggests changes in exchange rates and fuel prices are not to be overlooked as important drivers of the domestic price.

This paper analyzes the spillover effects of charter schools on traditional public school (TPS) students in New York City. I exploit variation in both the timing of charter school entry and distance to the nearest charter school to obtain credibly causal estimates of the impacts of charter schools on TPS student performance, and I am among the first to estimate the impacts of charter school co-location. I further add to the literature by exploring potential mechanisms for these findings with school-level data on per pupil expenditures (PPE), and parent and teacher perceptions of schools. Briefly, I find charter schools significantly increase TPS student performance in both English Language Arts and math, and decrease the probability of grade retention. Effects increase with charter school proximity and are largest in TPSs co-located with charter schools. Potential explanations for improved performance include increased PPE, academic expectations, student engagement, and a more respectful and safe school environment after charter entry. The findings suggest that more charter schools in New York City may be beneficial at the margin, and co-location may be mutually beneficial for charter and traditional public schools.","[Cordes, Sarah A.] Temple Univ, Coll Educ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Cordes, SA (通讯作者)，Temple Univ, Coll Educ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",sarah.cordes@temple.edu,,"Cordes, Sarah/0000-0003-4355-0806",Spencer Foundation [201100049],Spencer Foundation,"I thank Amy Ellen Schwartz, Leanna Stiefel, Ingrid Gould Ellen, Sean P.

By leveraging a unique set of Chilean administrative panel data, I examine a natural experiment created by a change in the performance standard used to incentivize the reduction of particulate matter in the atmospheric emissions of stationary pollution sources in the Santiago Metropolitan Region. I find that the absolute standard drove 21% less emissions cleanup than did the relative standard. I also demonstrate how sharp heterogeneity in responses to the change in standards is predictable based on an ex-ante identifiable type-categorization, which leads to the broadly-applicable conclusion that stricter regimes drive more compliance actions when imposed via an absolute performance standard compared to a relative standard. The extension of this framework provides a general means of anticipating whether an absolute or relative performance standard will drive higher rates of compliance actions in other settings.

However, so far, very little is known about the temporal aspects of such instruments. This article explores the temporal ordering of the future in three prominent instruments of anticipatory policy advice: Strategic Environmental Assessment, Technology Assessment and Foresight. Based on 25 cases of SEA, TA, and Foresight processes in Austria, the article first presents the specific time horizons that are applied in the instruments. Time horizons in anticipatory policy advice frequently span around 10-20 years and have an upper limit of 50 years into the future. In a second step, the article explores and discusses how the chosen time horizons explicitly and implicitly base on varying time scales that are related to the subject matter, epistemic considerations, human experiences, political aspects, and spatial contexts. Owing to these time scales, multiple dynamics of limiting and expanding the future in time are to be found in anticipatory policy advice. Overall, the article illustrates that the tendency to shorten time horizons prevails, contradicting the very purpose of instruments of anticipatory policy advice.","[Bauer, Anja] Alpen Adria Univ Klagenfurt, Dept Sci Technol & Soc Studies, Sterneckstr 15, A-9020 Klagenfurt, Austria; [Bauer, Anja] Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Technol Assessment, Vienna, Austria",University of Klagenfurt; Austrian Academy of Sciences,"Bauer, A (通讯作者)，Alpen Adria Univ Klagenfurt, Dept Sci Technol & Soc Studies, Sterneckstr 15, A-9020 Klagenfurt, Austria.;Bauer, A (通讯作者)，Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Technol Assessment, Vienna, Austria.",anja.bauer@aau.at,"Bauer, Anja/X-5362-2019","Bauer, Anja/0000-0003-2197-1925",,,,,46,7,7,0,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,AUG,2018,101.0,,,,,,36,45,,10.1016/j.futures.2018.06.002,0.0,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,GO1CS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439683600004,0

In 2013-2014, experts of the Hungarian Ministry of Defense applied a strategic foresight method to identify potential threats and opportunities for 2015-2030 period. This work led them to anticipate the broad trends that lead to the European migration crisis and a more confrontative Russian foreign policy. However, in retrospect the methods used were not specific enough about the time frame of these potential outcomes, nor did the Hungarian analysts believe their findings strongly enough. These results generated a lively debate among Hungarian defense experts about how the foresight method could be improved. This paper contributes to this effort by introducing a three-step diagnostic method for foresight processes that applies different analytical frameworks developed in the foresight literature. The first step leverages Voros' foresight framework, the second step utilizes Rafael Popper's categories of analysis, and step three evaluates the root causes of problems experienced in the foresight study. The paper concludes that the Hungarian foresight process was a so-called shallow foresight exercise because the organizational mindset of the Hungarian Ministry of Defense oriented the analysts narrowly towards intelligence methods.","[Nemeth, Bence] Kings Coll London, Def Studies Dept, Swindon SN6 8LA, Wilts, England; [Dew, Nicholas; Augier, Mie] US Navy, Postgrad Sch, Grad Sch Business & Publ Policy, 1 Univ Circle, Monterey, CA 93943 USA",University of London; King's College London; United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; Naval Postgraduate School,"Nemeth, B (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Def Studies Dept, Swindon SN6 8LA, Wilts, England.",bence.nemeth@kcl.ac.uk; ndew@nps.edu; meaugier@nps.edu,"Nemeth, Bence/AAP-4635-2021","Nemeth, Bence/0000-0001-9452-1197",,,,,36,9,10,2,16,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,AUG,2018,101.0,,,,,,92,102,,10.1016/j.futures.2018.06.014,0.0,,,11,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,GO1CS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439683600009,0

The paper defines the concept of distributional risk, proposes a framework surrounding the phenomenon and explores their utility in an analysis of distributional decisions in eight Vietnamese communities that participate in a national forest PES program. This program shares a distributional principle with many PES schemes worldwide, paying out on a per hectare basis, implying that the biggest forest owners get most. Up till now, the communities successfully counterbalance this consequence by asserting the village level as the de facto distributor, able to apply their own principles of justice and partially reframing the disbursements as remuneration for work done for the forest rather than forest ownership. We recommend to legally institutionalize this practice, reaping other advantages as well, such as reduced transaction cost.","[Duong, Ngoc T.

However, a policy-policy conflict exists between the desire to increase the utilization of bio based renewable resources and the desire to protect and conserve biodiversity. Increasing forest harvest levels to meet the needs of the bioeconomy may conflict with biodiversity protection and ecosystem services provided by forests. Through an optimization framework, we examined trade-offs between increasing the extraction of timber resources, and the impacts on biodiversity and non-wood ecosystem services, and investigated possibilities to reconcile trade-off with changes in forest management in 17 landscapes in boreal forests. A diverse range of alternative forest management regimes were used. The alternatives varied from set aside to continuous cover forestry and a range of management options to reflect potential applications of the current management recommendations. These included adjustments to the number of thinning, the timing of final felling and the method of regeneration. Increasing forest harvest level to the maximum economically sustainable harvest had a negative effect on the habitat suitability index, bilberry yield, deadwood diversity and carbon storage. It resulted in a loss in variation among landscapes in their conservation capacity and the ability to provide ecosystem services. Multi-objective optimization results showed that combining different forest management regimes alleviated the negative effects of increasing harvest levels to biodiversity and non-wood ecosystem services. The results indicate that careful landscape level forest management planning is crucial to minimize the ecological costs of increasing harvest levels.","[Eyvindson, Kyle; Repo, Anna; Monkkonen, Mikko] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland; [Repo, Anna] Finnish Environm Inst, Climate Change Programme, Mechelininkatu 34a,POB 140, FI-00251 Helsinki, Finland",University of Jyvaskyla; Finnish Environment Institute,"Eyvindson, K (通讯作者)，Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland.",kyle.j.eyvindson@jyu.fi,"Eyvindson, Kyle/AET-7358-2022; Mönkkönen, Mikko/A-2821-2011; Repo, Anna/JRR-9080-2023","Eyvindson, Kyle/0000-0003-0647-1594; Monkkonen, Mikko/0000-0001-8897-3314; Repo, Anna/0000-0001-9708-2847",Academy of Finland [275329]; Kone Foundation [46-10588],Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Kone Foundation,"We are grateful to the Academy of Finland (proj. #275329) and the Kone Foundation (proj. # 46-10588) for funding.

However, the region is now faced with large areas of spruce plantations that will reach harvest maturity within the next 25 years. Due to the poor infrastructure in the region, the current challenge is to harvest the maturing spruce plantations at an acceptable cost. Hence, there is considerable interest both from the forest sector and politicians to invest in infrastructure that can provide the basis for profitable forest sector development in coastal Norway. This paper presents a mathematical optimization model for timber transportation from stump to industry. The main decision variables are location of quays, upgrade of public road links, the length of new forest roads, and when the investments should happen. The main objective is to provide decision support for prioritization of infrastructure investments. The optimization model is combined with a dynamical forest resource model, providing details on available volumes and costs. A case study for coastal Norway is presented and solved to optimality. The instance includes 10 counties comprising more than 200 municipalities with forest resources, 53 possible new quays for timber export and 916 public road links that also can be upgraded. Compared with a no investment case, the optimal solution improved the objective by 23%. The study shows that consistent, informative and good analyses can be performed to evaluate trade-offs, prioritization, time and order of investment, and cost saving potentials of infrastructure investments in the forest industry. The solution seems reasonable based on present infrastructure and state of the forest.","[Flatberg, Truls; Norstebo, Vibeke S.] SINTEF Technol & Soc, POB 4760 Torgarden, N-7465 Trondheim, Norway; [Bjorkelo, Knut; Astrup, Rasmus; Sovde, Nils Egil] Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res NIBIO, POB 115, N-1431 As, Norway",SINTEF; Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research,"Flatberg, T (通讯作者)，SINTEF Technol & Soc, POB 4760 Torgarden, N-7465 Trondheim, Norway.",Truls.Flatberg@sintef.no; Vibeke.S.Norstebo@sintef.no; knut.bjorkelo@nibio.no; rasmus.astrup@nibio.no; nils.egil.sovde@nibio.no,,"Flatberg, Truls/0000-0002-5914-6122",,,,,21,5,5,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,JUL,2018,92.0,,,,,,202,209,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.04.008,0.0,,,8,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GJ9UI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000435750000020,0

The responsible for the Natura 2000 sites management must organise stakeholders' involvement in the decision-making process to balance the objectives of nature conservation with the social and economic interests. The aim of this paper is to investigate public participation process in the implementation of Nature 2000 network in Slovakia. After a stakeholder analysis, 16 stakeholders participated in the survey. The data were collected through the administration of face-to-face questionnaire. The stakeholders' involvement was assessed considering: obstacles and opportunities of Natura 2000 for human activities and level of participation. The results show that Natura 2000 network is considered an opportunity for human activities by the stakeholders because it could be an economic support for the private owners, a marketing tool to promote eco-tourism, and an instrument to improve the ecosystem services. Conversely, some stakeholders consider Natura 2000 network an obstacle due to the potential restrictions for agricultural and forestry activities. Concerning the participatory process, the results point out that public actors have been involved through the co-decision, while the other categories of stakeholders have been involved at different levels (collaboration or information), demonstrating in any case the willingness to follow a participative approach. According to the surveyed stakeholders, the short time of implementation of the Habitats Directive after the accession of Slovakia to the EU precluded from more thoughtful communication and participation strategies.

They are the unmodified property tax, the site value tax, the flat property tax, as well as the gross and net forest productivity taxes. Under the assumption of backward tax shifting, all of the taxes result in lower land expectation values. If the tax does not affect the optimal harvest age empirically, then the value of the standing timber remains the same with or without taxation. When a forest property tax, such as an unmodified property tax, shortens the optimal harvest age, it will also affect the value of the standing timber.","[Chang, Sun Joseph] Louisiana State Univ, Agr Ctr, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Chang, SJ (通讯作者)，Louisiana State Univ, Agr Ctr, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",xp2610@lsu.edu,,,McIntire-Stennis Cooperative State Research program [14-JV-11330143-102]; USDA Forest Service [14-JV-11330143-102]; Forest Service,McIntire-Stennis Cooperative State Research program; USDA Forest Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service); Forest Service(Natural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service),Research supported in part by the McIntire-Stennis Cooperative State Research program and USDA Forest Service Joint Venture Agreement 14-JV-11330143-102.

The aim of this study was to develop a new cost-of-illness method in order to assess the specific and nonspecific costs of diabetes from a public payer perspective. Using medical and administrative data from the major French national health insurance system covering about 59 million individuals in 2012, we identified people with diabetes and then estimated the economic burden of diabetes. Various methods were used: (a) global cost of patients with diabetes, (b) cost of treatment directly related to diabetes (i.e., 'medicalized approach'), (c) incremental regression-based approach, (d) incremental matched-control approach, and (e) a novel combination of the 'medicalized approach' and the 'incremental matched-control' approach. We identified 3 million individuals with diabetes (5% of the population). The total expenditure of this population amounted to a,notsign19 billion, representing 15% of total expenditure reimbursed to the entire population. Of the total expenditure, a,notsign10 billion (52%) was considered to be attributable to diabetes care: a,notsign2.3 billion (23% of a,notsign10 billion) was directly attributable, and a,notsign7.7 billion was attributable to additional reimbursed expenditure indirectly related to diabetes (77%). Inpatient care represented the major part of the expenditure attributable to diabetes care (22%) together with drugs (20%) and medical auxiliaries (15%). Antidiabetic drugs represented an expenditure of about a,notsign1.1 billion, accounting for 49% of all diabetes-specific expenditure. This study shows the economic impact of the assumption concerning definition of costs on evaluation of the economic burden of diabetes. The proposed new cost-of-illness method provides specific insight for policy-makers to enhance diabetes management and assess the opportunity costs of diabetes complications' management programs.","[de Lagasnerie, Gregoire; Aguade, Anne-Sophie; Denis, Pierre; Fagot-Campagna, Anne; Gastaldi-Menager, Christelle] Natl Hlth Insurance CNAMTS, Strategy & Res Dept, 50 Ave Pr Andre Lemierre, F-75986 Paris 20, France",,"Gastaldi-Menager, C (通讯作者)，Natl Hlth Insurance CNAMTS, Strategy & Res Dept, 50 Ave Pr Andre Lemierre, F-75986 Paris 20, France.",christelle.gastaldi-menager@cnamts.fr,,,,,,,31,32,33,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

While methods for establishing causal impacts are prevalent, less attention has been paid to explaining the mechanisms through which the causal relationship came to be. Understanding mechanisms is crucial for designing policies that foster the mechanisms that achieve the intended objectives of marine reserves and mitigate the mechanisms that do not. We estimate the treatment effect of a large marine reserve on the net earnings of a commercial fishery using difference-in-differences and synthetic-control designs, and decompose the treatment effect into its constituent mechanisms through structural equation modeling. We find minimal evidence that closing the marine reserve to fishing had a significant economic cost for the industry; however, several counteracting mechanisms are critical for explaining the effect and for generalizing to other settings.

Within Nordic countries such as Finland it has particular influence on the use of natural resources. Family forest owners own 61% of the forested land in Finland and 80% of the industrial roundwood purchased comes from these forest owners. Thus how private forest owners approach climate change is of high national economic and ecological importance. In order to understand family forest owners' perspectives on climate change in their own forests, qualitative interviews along walks through the owner's forests were conducted. Analysis of the conversations during these walks highlighted that forest owners discussed the phenomenon without prompting more often than hypothesized. Additionally, forest owners were less certain as to the causes of changes observed in their forests, mostly willing to take advice from professionals, and economically-driven in their response. For those forest owners who did express concern regarding climate change, they were at a loss for ways their efforts could make a meaningful difference. The prevalent uncertainty among forest owners calls for guidance from authority. Policy practices should make an effort to combine monetary incentives along with climate change focused forest management practices. Additionally, forest owner's reliance on the advice and expertise of forestry professionals should be utilized when pursuing climate-motivated forest management.","[Laakkonen, Anu; Zimmerer, Rebekah; Kahkonen, Tanja; Hujala, Teppo; Takala, Tuomo; Tikkanen, Jukka] Univ Eastern Finland, Sch Forest Sci, Yliopistokatu 7, FI-80100 Joensuu, Finland; [Zimmerer, Rebekah] Univ Massachusetts Amherst, Dept Environm Conservat, 160 Holdsworth Way Amherst, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Hujala, Teppo] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Biobased Business & Ind, POB 16200, FI-00076 Aalto, Finland; [Laakkonen, Anu; Kahkonen, Tanja; Tikkanen, Jukka] Oulu Univ Appl Sci, POB 222, FI-90101 Oulu, Finland",University of Eastern Finland; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Aalto University; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); University of Oulu,"Laakkonen, A (通讯作者)，Univ Eastern Finland, Sch Forest Sci, Yliopistokatu 7, FI-80100 Joensuu, Finland.",anu.laakkonen@uef.fi; rebekaz@student.uef.fi; tanja.kahkonen@uef.fi; teppo.hujala@uef.fi; tuomo.takala@uef.fi; jukka.tikkanen@uef.fi,"Kähkönen, Tanja/F-9648-2011","Hujala, Teppo/0000-0002-7905-7602; Laakkonen, Anu/0000-0002-6384-7773; Kahkonen, Tanja/0000-0002-7764-992X",EU-Seventh Framework Project (TESS-Towards European Societal Sustainability) [603705],EU-Seventh Framework Project (TESS-Towards European Societal Sustainability),"The data collection for this study was funded by the EU-Seventh Framework Project (TESS-Towards European Societal Sustainability, 603705).

This research tries to deconstruct the role of participation in the creation of a spatial plan for Nature Park Medvednica - Croatian nationally protected forest area and a Natura 2000 site. As the spatial planning process lasted for more than thirty years, this historical perspective allows for an assessment of the participation practices with respect to changing socio-political factors. The research design is rooted in Grounded Theory (GT), where data collection and analysis evolved in parallel until theoretical saturation occurred. Data sources include 51 interviews, meeting minutes and recordings from six public hearings, historical records, project documentation and expert studies focusing on Medvednica. The theory defined in this study links participation practices to its socio-economic framework, the outcomes of the spatial planning and the perceptions on the role of actors who took part in it all performed through the lenses of the proposed 15 assumptions and 46 formal hypotheses. The test of this theory will be its future replication in different circumstances, fields and cultural settings. Results show a strong role of general socio-political factors affecting the design of spatial planning, which in turn shapes the role of participation. The most important general contextual factors include level of centralization of the state administration, level of urbanization and the culture of participation in decision-making processes, which was mostly exercised in the first process. In the last fifteen years, the participation in spatial planning for Nature Park Medvednica was mostly exercised as a legislative requirement while having very limited effect on the actual plan, and had a symbolic importance by legitimizing the urbanization process of the once forested area.","[Lovric, Natasa; Lovric, Marko] European Forest Inst, Joensuu, Finland; [Konold, Werner] Albert Ludwig Univ, Freiburg, Germany",,"Lovric, N (通讯作者)，EFI, Bioecon Programme, Yliopistokatu 6, Joensuu 80100, Finland.",natasa.lovric@efi.int,"Lovrić, Nataša/D-5639-2017","Lovrić, Nataša/0000-0002-5107-9260; Lovric, Marko/0000-0002-7729-4743",,,,,74,12,12,0,36,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,FEB,2018,87.0,,,,,,20,34,,10.1016/j.forpol.2017.11.003,0.0,,,15,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,FU1WK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423640000003,0

The entrepreneurial risk is determined by the influence of external (objective) and internal (subjective) factors. The risk control includes several stages and the first of them is the qualitative analysis of all the possible risk factors. In the article the entrepreneurial risks were analyzed which were isolated according to the indices of the economic activity conducted in the regions by entrepreneurs. Their problems and limitations are shown; the main ways of risks reduction and the directions of their regulation in the Volgograd region are suggested as well. In the paper it is shown that in the Volgograd region the commercial, economic and managerial risks (budget implementation, high government debt and its growth in prospect) are significant. The industrial risks are very high due to a high wear and tear of the fixed capital. In the region the enterprises belonging to the fuel and power complex are in a better situation. They are in the top ten of tax payers and investors. Large investment projects were started in the chemical industry. The highest risks have the enterprises of the wholesale and retail enterprises, construction firms. The significant risks are traditionally typical of agricultural enterprises but they benefit from the government support together with the enterprises of the chemical industry. Among the basic directions of the regulation of entrepreneurial risks isolated from the point of view of risk types a priority direction for the Volgograd region due to poor social and economic conditions for the entrepreneurship is the development the diversification the regional economy.","[Buyanova, Marina E.] Volgograd State Univ, Inst Econ & Finance, Chair Econ Theory World & Reg Econ, Volgograd, Russia; [Mikhaylova, Nataliya A.] Volgograd State Univ, Inst Management & Reg Econ, Chair Govt & Municipal Adm, Volgograd, Russia",Volgograd State University (VOLSU); Volgograd State University (VOLSU),"Buyanova, ME (通讯作者)，Volgograd State Univ, Inst Econ & Finance, Chair Econ Theory World & Reg Econ, Volgograd, Russia.",buyanovam@volsu.ru; korish.m@volsu.ru,"Buyanova, Marina/AGO-2726-2022; Mikhaylova, Nataliya Aleksandrovna/AAD-2700-2022","Mikhaylova, Nataliya Aleksandrovna/0000-0002-3747-3587",,,,,5,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-514-6,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,39.0,,,,,,635,640,,,,,,6,Business; Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BO4YG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000515721900129,0

The idea is to find a relationship between specific instruments of the EU's agricultural policy and the assumptions of the adopted paradigms, and thus formulate certain general application premises and solutions in three areas: justification for the support of the agricultural sector, the problem of income deprivation of agricultural producers, and the change of the industrial-technological development model, predominant in agriculture, into sustained development. In light of the presented discussion, the occurrence of the following three economic CAP premises was confirmed: the need for financial support for the agricultural sector, the drainage of agricultural producers in the food supply chain, and the superiority of sustainably developed agriculture over industrial agriculture. As a result, recommendations concerning common agricultural policy after 2020 were given. The most important ones include: maintaining as high a level of support for agriculture as possible at an EU level, maintaining the system of direct subsidies as the most important instrument of equalising agricultural income, limiting unequal distribution of payments among small and large farms, enhancing the position of the farmer in the food chain, implementating a mandatory risk management instrument, and establishing an 'environmental budget' financing public goods.","[Czyzewski, Andrzej] Univ Zielona Gora, Fac Econ & Management, Podgorna 50, PL-65246 Zielona Gora, Poland; [Stepien, Sebastian] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Fac Econ, Al Niepodleglosci, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland",University of Zielona Gora; Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Czyzewski, A (通讯作者)，Univ Zielona Gora, Fac Econ & Management, Podgorna 50, PL-65246 Zielona Gora, Poland.;Stepien, S (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Fac Econ, Al Niepodleglosci, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland.",sebastian.stepien@ue.poznan.pl,,"Czyzewski, Andrzej/0000-0002-6233-6824; Stepien, Sebastian/0000-0001-9475-8418",,,,,31,0,0,1,11,Warsaw Univ Life Sciences Pr,Warsaw,"Nowoursynowska 166, Warsaw, POLAND",,,978-83-7583-802-2,,,,2018,,,,,,,154,161,,10.22630/ESARE.2018.1.21,0.0,,,8,Development Studies; Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Geography,BO1TN,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000502413100021,0

In addition, the area of cultivation of both potatoes and sugar beet was systematically decreasing, which was partially compensated by the improvement in crops.

Then, we investigated the relationship between investment behavior rigidity, escalation of commitment and disposition effect. The results summarized as follows: first, investors are exhibited disposition effect and escalation of commitment in securities trading; second, sex, education, duration of securities trading, and investment amount did not affect the disposition effect and escalation of commitment; and third, there is a positive correlation between investment behavior rigidity and escalation of commitment.

Therefore the respective understandings of a meaningful work and of healthy work has to be elaborated, to develop the underlying interpretations of subjectivity, in order to propose a perspective for empirical investigations of health-oriented working conditions. It is argued that a proactive thematization of meaningful work (e. g the individual attributions of meaningful work as well as the practices of making work meaningful) is closely related to work-engagement and well-being. A holistic view of these constructs enables a comprehensive understanding of meaningful work and creates further starting points for future research work in Organizational Development (OD) or Human-Resources (HR) Management. The study was carried out as a review of general and relevant science literature as well as scientific publications researched in common journal-databases. The results show, that meaningfulness can be seen as a core, which interconnects different constructs. Therefore, meaningfulness is closely linked to work-engagement. The more meaningfulness employees perceive in their daily work, the more motivated they are performing on a higher level. Meaningfulness is also linked to the Sense of Coherence (SoC), a coping capacity of employees to deal with everyday life stressors. SoC refers to an individual's generalized perception of environmental stimuli. Thus, if an employee has a high level of sense of coherence he/she experiences work more meaningful and tends to have good coping strategies handling stressors. Meaningfulness has also a connection to wellbeing. By losing the meaningfulness at work, typical symptoms of burnout can be observed. It is argued, that creating meaningfulness at work is essential for positive work outcomes and healthy employees.","[Hager, Frank W.] Univ Latvia, Fac Econ & Management, Raina Bulvaris 19, LV-1586 Riga, Latvia; [Hager, Frank W.] Geltendorfer Str 15, D-86316 Friedberg, Germany",University of Latvia,"Hager, FW (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Fac Econ & Management, Raina Bulvaris 19, LV-1586 Riga, Latvia.;Hager, FW (通讯作者)，Geltendorfer Str 15, D-86316 Friedberg, Germany.",info@mitarbeiterdiagnostik.de,,"Hager, Frank W./0000-0002-7268-7564",,,,,98,3,4,1,19,TOMAS BATA UNIV ZLIN,ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7454-730-0,,,,2018,,,,,,,76,94,,10.7441/dokbat.2018.08,0.0,,,19,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM6FI,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000466529800008,0

These methods' main problem is how to solve the non-standard inaccuracies evoked by uncertainty of the input data that are brought into a problem. A rational approach to limit this uncertainty is provided by probabilistic models in the case that these data can be assigned by means of their distribution function. These cases are restricted by a historically short observation period on which the accuracy of the distribution of input values in a newly considered investment can build. In situations, where this distribution cannot be estimated reliably, a fuzzy approach is more appropriate tool that approximates the unknown distribution of input values by an even distribution over the interval of their possible values. Within the mutual comparison the both approaches are presented. The conditions of their application are discussed in view of the economic efficiency of long-term projects estimation and their benefits and shortcomings are presented using a specific example.","[Haskova, Simona] Vysoka Skola Tech & Ekon Ceskych Budejovicich, Okruzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice 37001, Czech Republic","Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice","Hasková, S (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Tech & Ekon Ceskych Budejovicich, Okruzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice 37001, Czech Republic.",haskovas@post.cz,"Hašková, Simona/N-3667-2019",,,,,,11,1,1,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,553,562,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400055,0

After studying a sample of listed family and nonfamily firms in Chile, we find that families take a conservative approach to debt and financial risk exposure. We test the hypothesis that family firms restrict the use of debt in order to avoid the monitoring role of creditors, which could limit their enjoyment of the private benefits of control. In keeping with this hypothesis, we find a U-shaped relationship between leverage and the degree of pyramidal ownership that is more pronounced among family firms than nonfamily firms. We do not find any evidence that is consistent with the hypothesis that family-controlled firms have low leverage ratios due to their access to internal capital markets. In fact, conversely, we find that listed family firms provide more loans to related companies than comparable nonfamily firms.","[Jara, Mauricio; Nunez, Paula] Univ Chile, Business Dept, Sch Econ & Business, Santiago, Chile; [Pinto-Gutierrez, Cristian] Univ Connecticut, Finance Dept, Sch Business, 2100 Hillside Rd,Unit 1041, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",Universidad de Chile; University of Connecticut,"Pinto-Gutiérrez, C (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Finance Dept, Sch Business, 2100 Hillside Rd,Unit 1041, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",cpintogu@tulane.edu,"Jara, Mauricio/HHN-5573-2022; Pinto-Gutierrez, Christian/GXF-4273-2022","Jara, Mauricio/0000-0001-6339-3794; Pinto-Gutierrez, Christian/0000-0002-7981-4968",,,,,50,7,7,0,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The vulnerability of food supply chains to fraud/adulteration is growing as a result of globalisation, which is expanding the scope and scale of the incidence of food fraud/adulteration. Both the intentional and unintentional adulteration of food can lead to a public health threat, and cause severe economic consequences. Meat and meat products are the most common targets for adulteration in Poland and the EU. Since meat and meat products hold a key position in food production and consumption in Poland, it is in both the industry's and government's interests to eliminate adulteration in the meat supply chain. The methodological approach was to first review the literature to define and outline the challenge of food adulteration, and then to build a database on the basis of IJHARS decisions regarding adulterated meat and meat products, and to analyse them in detail. An analysis of the data revealed that most cases infringed Article 7.1(a) of Regulation (EU) 1169/2011 on the provision of food information to consumers concerning fair information practices.","[Kowalska, Aleksandra] Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Fac Econ, Lublin, Poland",Maria Curie-Sklodowska University,"Kowalska, A (通讯作者)，Pl Marii Curie Sklodowskiej 5, PL-20031 Lublin, Poland.",aleksandra.kowalska@umcs.lublin.pl,"Kowalska, Aleksandra/ABA-6546-2020","Kowalska, Aleksandra/0000-0003-3854-951X",,,,,24,2,2,1,6,Warsaw Univ Life Sciences Pr,Warsaw,"Nowoursynowska 166, Warsaw, POLAND",,,978-83-7583-803-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,37,44,,10.22630/ESARE.2018.2.3,0.0,,,8,Development Studies; Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Geography,BO1TO,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000502418600003,0

The article focuses on presenting the most important results of the research, concentrating specifically on collecting cost information and methods used for calculating the cost of production and the topics of cost control. The conducted analysis showed that in the most cases, respondents chose traditional solutions in the field of collecting cost information and cost control, and mostly the large enterprises utilized the newer techniques.","[Makowska, Ewa; Banaszkiewicz, Aleksandra] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Fac Econ Sci & Management, Ul Gagarina 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Makowska, E (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Fac Econ Sci & Management, Ul Gagarina 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",ewa.makowska@umk.pl; aleksandra.banaszkiewicz@umk.pl,"Banaszkiewicz, Aleksandra/AAI-1092-2020","Banaszkiewicz, Aleksandra/0000-0002-8923-0771; Makowska, Ewa/0000-0003-0947-8804",,,,,15,1,1,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,1146,1155,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400114,0

It presents the development of a process improvement project that implements both methodologies. Lean Layout improves processes by increasing visibility of the processes' flow and 5S methodology organises the workplace to increase productivity and reduce waste. The process improvement project follows DMAIC methodology and utilises Lean Management tools such as 5S inspections and Time Measurement Sheets. The influence on process output value and the difficulty to develop a solution determine an action plan to eliminate process deficiencies. Initial 5S inspections reveal several non-conformities with the workplace standards. Analysis tools such as Ishikawa diagram and the action plan relate these process problems with the shop floor layout. Poor results in 5S inspections thus determine arguments for developing Lean Layout methodology. This paper provides an analysis of the current problems of the given production line, the root causes of problems and a specific proposal for its improvement. Specifically, this project combines 5S and Lean Layout methodologies and investigates their relationship and impact on process improvement. The same framework is applicable in other organisations both in and outside the automobile industry.","[Otenslegrova, Pavla; Martinez, Felipe] Univ Econ, Namesti W Churchilla 1938-4, Prague 13067 3, Zizkov, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Otenslégrová, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Namesti W Churchilla 1938-4, Prague 13067 3, Zizkov, Czech Republic.",xotep00@vse.cz; felipe.martinez@vse.cz,"Martinez, Felipe/O-2838-2015","Martinez, Felipe/0000-0002-8271-3391",,,,,8,0,0,1,6,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,1296,1305,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400128,0

Assessment of quality of life main indices is a subject of study of both federal statistical agencies and several expert organizations. However, an adequate measurement of these indicators is confronted with information and methodological problems, which include: the incompatibility of methods of measurements in Soviet Union and modern Russian statistics; incomplete pools of data associated with various negative processes, administrative reforms and institutional changes in the Russian economy; partial loss of historical statistical data. This determines the inability to use time series models of economic indicators to identify the main development patterns, and the resulting trends are limited and not reliable enough. Furthermore, most methods have applicability limits and do not work with incomplete or noisy data. Therefore, it is proposed to use neural network technologies and intelligent information systems developed on their basis as alternative approach for solving semistructured and unformalized problems of analyzing the quality of life, as well as constructing forecasting models. A comparative analysis of the researches of Russian and foreign authors on the problems of assessment and constructing a integral indicator of the quality of life of the population is carried out. The author proposes an assessment model, as well as the results of a neural network construction, and an economic interpretation of the obtained results.","[Petrova, Elena] Volgograd State Univ, Inst Management & Reg Econ, Volgograd, Russia",Volgograd State University (VOLSU),"Petrova, E (通讯作者)，Volgograd State Univ, Inst Management & Reg Econ, Volgograd, Russia.",ea_petrova@mail.ru,,,,,,,16,1,1,1,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-514-6,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,39.0,,,,,,157,161,,,,,,5,Business; Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BO4YG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000515721900034,0

A published cohort-based Markov model was used to perform the analysis estimating the lifetime direct medical costs associated with the management of the pathology and the quality adjusted life years gained by patients. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results. SOF + RBV for 16 weeks was excluded from the analysis due to the significant lower effectiveness, compared with SOF + RBV for 24 weeks (51% vs 79%). DCV + SOF + RBV would increase QALYs and costs in all the comparisons: the ICERs obtained comparing DCV + SOF + RBV for 12 and 16 weeks with SOF + RBV for 24 weeks (reference scenario) are 38,572 a,notsign/QALY and 16,436 a,notsign/QALY, respectively, both below the 40,000 a,notsign/QALY threshold identified by the Italian Health Economics Association. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results.

The purpose of this study is to analyse the models used in agriculture in the European Union (EU). To reach these purposes, the following research tasks were set: (1) to analyse the theoretical aspects of simulation modelling; (2) to explore the key agricultural simulation models employed in the EU. The research found that simulation modelling is often used in agriculture by policy makers.

Based on the indicator of the level of investment sufficiency, it was established that, in the period under review, the level of investment adequacy in the country is less than the established `threshold' value, which indicates a shortage of investment funds. The study analysed the dynamics of investment attraction in agriculture. It was found that the main source of financing for investment is own funds of enterprises and organizations. However, they are too insufficient to ensure the intensive development of the economy. An analysis of growth dynamics of the total volume of investment in agricultural enterprises per 100 ha of agricultural land and their financial provision was carried out. Research showed that the increase in the value of fixed assets is more intensive than the increase in the inflow of investment in fixed assets, which indicates additional sources of growth in the value of fixed assets. It was noted that the potential sources of investment resources should be the funds of foreign investors, which currently stand at an extremely low growth level. A number of negative factors influencing the process of attracting foreign direct investment were identified.

This study is the first to comprehensively and at a large scale (14 European countries) measure the social inequalities in the number of natural teeth (an informative oral health marker) in the over 50-year-old population and to investigate the extent to which such inequalities are attributable to dental service use. Using Wave 5 of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, which included internationally harmonized information on over 50,000 individuals across 14 European countries, we calculated Gini and Concentration indices (CI) as well as the decompositions of CIs by socioeconomic factors. Sweden consistently performed the best with the lowest inequalities as measured by Gini (0.1078), CI by income (0.0392), CI by education (0.0407), and CI by wealth (0.0296). No country performed the worst in all inequality measures. However, unexpectedly, some wealthier countries (e.g., the Netherlands and Denmark) had higher degrees of inequalities than less-wealthy countries (e.g., Estonia and Slovenia). Decomposition analysis showed that income, education, and wealth contributed substantially to the inequalities, and dental service use was an important contributor even after controlling for income and wealth. The study highlighted the importance of comprehensively investigating oral health inequalities. The results are informative to policymakers to derive country-specific health policy recommendations to reduce oral health inequalities in the older population and also have implications for oral health improvement of the future generations.","[Shen, Jing] Newcastle Univ, Inst Hlth & Soc, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Listl, Stefan] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Qual & Safety Oral Care, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Listl, Stefan] Heidelberg Univ, Translat Hlth Econ, Heidelberg, Germany",Newcastle University - UK; Radboud University Nijmegen; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Shen, J (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Inst Hlth & Soc, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England.",jing.shen@newcastle.ac.uk,"Listl, Stefan/S-7600-2017","Listl, Stefan/0000-0002-8176-3397",Wellcome Trust [2014/16],Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust),"The work was conceived during Dr. Jing Shen's research visit to Heidelberg University, Germany.

The process of permanent shrinking of labour resources and changes occurring in their structure (for example ageing) are the result of demographic transformations in the EU-28. Estimated Pearson correlation coefficient (rxy), in the group of EU-28 states, between the general unemployment rate (15-64 years) and the unemployment rate of people aged 50-64 showed correlation of almost linear nature (0.985).

We also evaluate the welfare implications of alternative restrictive trade policies relevant to the softwood lumber trade dispute. Simulation results from a mixed complementary problem model calibrated using positive mathematical programming reveal that a 26.75% CVD and AD tariff curtails Canadian lumber shipments to the U.S. by 4.9 million cubic meters (m(3)), reduces Canada's market share in the U.S. by nearly 5%, and encourages the U.S. domestic lumber industry to produce an additional 2.6 million m(3). The government tax revenue and the U.S. producers' gain clearly outweigh the loss incurred by U.S. consumers. However, Canadian producers have an economic incentive to voluntarily reduce their share of the U.S. market by voluntarily restricting exports and capturing quota rents. Additionally, the foreign exchange rate has the ability to alter the effects of protectionist policies.","[Johnston, Craig M.

The Forestry Modules' detailed and systematic approach can help ensure that contributions of forest and wild products are not underestimated in national figures. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A total of 295 studies were identified, of which 20 were included. The average quality score was 0.720 on a 0-1 scale. All studies were performed in high- and middle-income countries, using a 3rd-party payer perspective and randomized clinical trials to measure effectiveness. Sitagliptin, saxagliptin and vildagliptin had an ICER below 25,000 a,notsign/QALY, as second-line and as add-ons to metformin, in comparison to sulfonylureas. When compared with sitagliptin, liraglutide (GLP-1 receptor agonist) had an ICER of up to 22,724 a,notsign/QALY for the 1.2-mg dosage, and up to 32,869 a,notsign/QALY for the 1.8-mg dosage. Insulin glargine was dominant when compared with sitagliptin. According to the WHO threshold applied to the country and year of each study, DPP-4 inhibitors were highly cost-effective as second-line, as add-ons to metformin, in comparison with sulfonylureas. More recent therapies (GLP-1 receptor agonists and insulin glargine) were highly cost-effective in comparison to DPP-4 inhibitors. These results were obtained, however, on the basis of a limited number of studies, relying on the same few clinical trials, and financed by manufacturers. Further independent research is needed to confirm these findings.","[Baptista, Alexandre] Univ Lisbon, Fac Med, Unit Epidemiol, Fac Med Lisbon, Edificio Egas Moniz,Av Prof Egas Moniz, P-1649028 Lisbon, Portugal; [Teixeira, Ines; Romano, Sonia] Natl Assoc Pharm Grp, Ctr Hlth Evaluat & Res CEFAR, R Marechal Saldanha 1, P-1249069 Lisbon, Portugal; [Carneiro, Antonio Vaz] Univ Lisbon, Univ Lisbon, Fac Med, Ctr Evidence Based Med CEMBE, Av Prof Egas Moniz, P-1649028 Lisbon, Portugal; [Perelman, Julian] Univ Nova Lisboa, Escola Nacl Saude Publ, Ave Padre Cruz, P-16005605 Lisbon, Portugal; [Perelman, Julian] Univ Nova Lisboa, Ctr Invest Saude Publ, Ave Padre Cruz, P-16005605 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Baptista, A (通讯作者)，Univ Lisbon, Fac Med, Unit Epidemiol, Fac Med Lisbon, Edificio Egas Moniz,Av Prof Egas Moniz, P-1649028 Lisbon, Portugal.",alexcalaca@hotmail.com,"Vaz-Carneiro, António/L-8026-2013; Teixeira, Inês/GWU-8441-2022; Perelman, Julian/B-4350-2013","Teixeira, Ines/0000-0003-3873-7158; Perelman, Julian/0000-0001-6634-9000; Romano, Sonia/0000-0002-2055-0996",,,,,43,8,8,1,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

We study whether formalization of indigenous communities' land rights affects the rate of deforestation in both the short and medium terms. Beginning in 1995, the Government of Brazil formalized the rights of several hundred indigenous communities whose lands cover more than 40 million hectares in the Amazon region and provided support for these rights' enforcement. We study the program's impacts using a long time series of satellite-based forest cover data. Using both plausibly exogenous variation in the timing of formalization and matched samples of treated and comparison communities, we find no effect of these protections on satellite-based greenness measures. This is true even for communities that received support for surveillance and enforcement of these rights. Notably, we observe low counterfactual rates of deforestation on communities' lands between 1982 and 2010, suggesting that indigenous land rights programs should not uniformly be justified on the basis of their forest protection, at least in the medium term.

The period is characterized by a major health insurance reform in 2006 to provide health insurers with more incentives and tools to compete, and to provide consumers with a more differentiated choice of products. Prior to the reform, in the period 1995-2005, we find a low number of switchers, between 2 and 4% a year, modest average total switching gains of 2 million euros per year and short-term health plan price elasticities ranging from -0.1 to -0.4. The major reform in 2006 resulted in an all-time high switching rate of 18%, total switching gains of 130 million euros, and a high short-term price elasticity of -5.7. During 2007-2015 switching rates returned to lower levels, between 4 and 8% per year, with total switching gains in the order of 40 million euros per year on average. Total switching gains could have been 10 times higher if all consumers had switched to one of the cheapest plans. We find short-term price elasticities ranging between -0.9 and -2.2. Our estimations suggest substantial consumer inertia throughout the entire period, as we find degrees of choice persistence ranging from about 0.8 to 0.9.","[Douven, Rudy] CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, The Hague, Netherlands; [Douven, Rudy; Schut, Frederik T.] Erasmus Univ, IBMG, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Katona, Katalin; Shestalova, Victoria] Dutch Healthcare Author, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Shestalova, Victoria] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Katona, Katalin] Tilburg Univ, TILEC, Tilburg, Netherlands",CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tilburg University,"Douven, R (通讯作者)，CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, The Hague, Netherlands.;Douven, R (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, IBMG, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",R.Douven@cpb.nl,"Schut, Frederik/D-2823-2013","Schut, Frederik/0000-0002-5748-5403",,,,,39,8,8,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

With increasing demand for timber for the construction and furniture industry, the Vietnam Government is seeking to encourage growers to increase the rotation age of plantations and produce higher quality timber so that it can meet its 2020 furniture export targets. Progress on this goal is however slow, with growers unsure about the financial case for increasing rotation age. Using a case study of the Ben Hai State Forestry Company (SFC), we compare financial returns from acacia plantations by the rotation ages of 5, 6 and 10 years. The 5 year rotation is for the sole purpose of producing woodchips whilst 6 and 10 year rotations produce both timber and woodchips. Results show that all three types of plantation produce positive returns but the return from 10 year rotation plantations (in terms of NPV and IRR) is much higher than those of others. By increasing the rotation age by 1 year (6 years total) and 5 years (10 years total) from the common practice of 5 years, the net present values from the modelled plantations would increase by about 1.57 times and 4.24 times respectively. The reasons why smallholder grower are not responding to these apparent higher present values and policies that would promote long rotation age plantations are discussed.","[Maraseni, Tek Narayan; Cockfield, Geoff] Univ Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia; [Hoang Lien Son; Hung Vu Duy] Vietnamese Acad Forest Sci, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Tran Dai Nghia] IPSARD, Hanoi, Vietnam",University of Southern Queensland,"Maraseni, TN (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia.",Maraseni@usq.edu.au,,"Cockfield, Geoff/0000-0002-0776-3313; Maraseni, Tek/0000-0001-9361-1983",Australian Centre for International Agriculture Research [ADP/2014/047],Australian Centre for International Agriculture Research,"This study was funded by Australian Centre for International Agriculture Research (Project No: ADP/2014/047).

Today, many industrial sectors are governed by a variety of overlapping instruments that are usually analysed separately rather than as a collective. In this paper, we make the case for analysing such codes as a collective, given that is how they are experienced from the perspective of users and how, ultimately, they achieve their governance objectives. Drawing on an exhaustive database of all related governance instruments, we present an overview of the Tasmanian forestry code complex with regard to harvesting-related forest operations, highlighting how public and private instruments relate to each other and intersect. Three key findings from the study are (a) the critical importance of Tasmania's Forest Practices Code as a master code, which sits at the centre of the State's Forest Code Complex with regard to harvesting; (b) the role that company management plans play in mediating between Tasmanian and international codes such as those endorsed by the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification and the Forest Stewardship Council; and (c) the utility of the code complex concept for comparative analyses of resource management.","[Gale, Fred; Baker, Thomas] Univ Tasmania, ARC Ctr Forest Value, Hobart, Tas, Australia",University of Tasmania,"Gale, F (通讯作者)，Univ Tasmania, Sch Social Sci, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",Fred.Gale@utas.edu.au; Thomas.Baker@utas.edu.au,"Gale, Fred Peter/A-2591-2010","Gale, Fred Peter/0000-0001-6759-6759; Baker, Thomas/0000-0002-3344-5300","University of Tasmania's Institute for the Study of Social Change under its Governance, Activism and Social Licence Flagship","University of Tasmania's Institute for the Study of Social Change under its Governance, Activism and Social Licence Flagship","This research has been supported by a grant from the University of Tasmania's Institute for the Study of Social Change under its Governance, Activism and Social Licence Flagship.

In this article, we report work in progress to systematically investigate the norms and values of PNS through a structured review. An archive of 397 documents was collected, including documents that contribute to the endeavour of ameliorating science advice practices from a PNS perspective. Action and structure-oriented viewpoints are used as complementing perspectives in the analysis of the ethos of PNS. From the action perspective we study how prototypes of norms and values are reflected upon in negotiations of normative issues relating to science advice. From the structural perspective we study how interrelated prototypes of norms and values are presupposed in prescriptions, proscriptions, and goals for science advice practices. Through this analysis we identify a plurality of interrelated prototypes of norms and values. Finally, we propose an acronym that integrates the analysed plurality of norms and values. As a mnemonic and communicative devise we call this ethos TRUST (Transparency, Robustness, Uncertainty management, Sustainability, and Transdisciplinarity) and propose TRUST as a nexus for future reflective negotiations of ambivalences in post-normal practices of science advice.

In order to limit leakage, governments consider supporting domestic trade-exposed firms by subsidizing their investments in abatement technology. The suppliers of such technologies tend to be less than perfectly competitive, particularly when both emissions regulations and advanced technologies are new. In this context of twin market failures, we consider the relative effects and desirability of subsidies for abatement technology. We find a more robust recommendation for upstream subsidies than for downstream subsidies. Downstream subsidies tend to increase global abatement technology prices, reduce pollution abatement abroad and increase emission leakage.

Forest transition is a well-recognized global phenomenon, which has been studied and explained in well elaborated forest transition theory. Forest transition has been observed in over 30 countries, and it has been a trend in multiple countries in Asia. Forest transition is most relevant for the Anthropocene narrative, as it suggests that forest cover decline may eventually be followed by a forest cover increase at the global scale. The paper reviews evidence of forest transition in eight Asian countries and juxtaposes this with global forest cover trends. In Asia countries like China, India, Japan, Philippines, South Korea, and Japan and Vietnam are among the countries that have experienced an increase in the area under some kind of tree cover. Complex interplays of forest cover, population growth, economic development, demand for forest goods and services and governance effectiveness are the driving forces of forest transition. While it is not possible to extrapolate Asia's forest transition to the global scale, the Asian experience makes it possible to make statements on possible global forest cover scenarios. Ultimately, forest transition theory in general, and the experience of forest transition in Asia also support the concept and related narrative of the Anthropocene. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In our two-period setup, the level of environmental harm in the second period depends on first-period harm when cleanup was incomplete. Under strict liability, in the first period, firms with a positive probability of going out of business before the second period have inadequate prevention and cleanup incentives. The fundamental disconnect between private incentives and social optimality cannot be remedied by using a multiple of harm as the level of compensation. Under negligence with a causation requirement, incentive problems remain; however, under negligence without such a requirement, first-best incentives may emerge, and using a multiple of harm as the level of compensation can ensure the efficient solution.

Because enrollment in MA is optional, conventional observational estimates of the program's impact are potentially subject to selection bias. To address this issue, we use a discontinuity in the rules governing MApayments to health plans that gives greater payments to plans operating in counties in metropolitan statistical areas with populations of 250,000 or more. The sharp difference in payment rates at this population cutoff creates a greater incentive for plans to increase the generosity of benefits and therefore enroll more beneficiaries in MA in counties just above versus just below the cutoff.

This incentive scheme provides financial incentives that reward the overall performance of a practice, not individual effort. Consequently, an important question is how the QOF may affect contractual choices, quality provision and doctor mobility in the primary healthcare labour market. The paper provides a simple theoretical model that shows that the introduction and further strengthening of the scheme may have induced practices to compete for the best doctors and modified their choices in terms of contractual agreements with practitioners. We test the implications of this model using a linkage between Doctors Census data and practices' characteristics from 2003 to 2007. We use linear multilevel models with random intercept and we account for sample selection. We find that after the introduction of the QOF efficient doctors are more likely to become partners and mobility among doctors has increased. The strengthening of the scheme in 2005 is associated with an increase in the quality of primary care and a reduction in access to the market for new doctors.","[Fichera, Eleonora] Univ Manchester, Manchester Ctr Hlth Econ, Jean McFarlane Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Pezzino, Mario] Univ Manchester, Econ, Arthur Lewis Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester; University of Manchester,"Pezzino, M (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Econ, Arthur Lewis Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",mario.pezzino@manchester.ac.uk,,"Pezzino, Mario/0000-0001-9620-7660; Fichera, Eleonora/0000-0002-4729-0338",NIHR [RMOFS 2012/07]; MRC Early Career Fellowship in Economics of Health [MR/K021583/1]; Medical Research Council [MR/K021583/1] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [MR/K021583/1] Funding Source: UKRI,NIHR(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); MRC Early Career Fellowship in Economics of Health(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"We are grateful to participants to the Nordic Health Economists' Study Group (NHESG) meeting in Reykjavik 2014 and the European Association for Research in Industrial Economics (EARIE) in Milan 2014 for helpful comments and suggestions.

We employ 5-minute closing prices for the companies included in STOXX600 and build a methdological framework that allows the computation of simple differences between the Cornish-Fisher VaR and the standard normal distribution VaR dynamics. These differences account for the amount of risk that is generated by the non-normality of the distribution of log-returns, more precisely the part that is spurred by the skewness and kurtosis indicators. These measures are synthesized at industry bevel and submitted to a causality analysis. Our approach allows us to pinpoint possible inter-industry spillover effects and we find the industries that have the propensity to inject risk in the system via a Granger-causuality test.","[Albu, Lucian Liviu; Lupu, Radu; Calin, Adrian Cantemir] Romanian Acad, Inst Econ Forecasting, Bucharest, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences,"Calin, AC (通讯作者)，Romanian Acad, Inst Econ Forecasting, Bucharest, Romania.",cantemircalin@ipe.ro,"Lupu, Radu/AAZ-5907-2020; Calin, Adrian Cantemir/A-3378-2016; Albu, Lucian Liviu/C-4524-2011; Lupu, Radu/H-4389-2014; Albu, Lucian-Liviu/N-1468-2014","Calin, Adrian Cantemir/0000-0002-6928-9725; Lupu, Radu/0000-0002-2231-1753; Albu, Lucian-Liviu/0000-0001-8097-227X",,,,,21,1,1,1,5,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

General perceptions of cultural speed-up frame understandings of organisational life, against this backdrop of data analytics are presented as a potential solution to the need to speed-up and keep-up with the competition. As a result, it is argued that notions of speedy analytics are central to the spread and intensification of dataled decision-making, governance and ordering processes. The promises of real-time knowing are one means by which organisational speed and agility are seen to be achievable. The result is the pushing back of the limits of datafication. This article is concerned with the power of the data analytics industry and the powerful ways in which this industry presents and projects properties and promises onto data and data analytics. It suggests that this industry taps into, cultivates and then attempts to deploy the wider rationality of a need for speed.","[Beer, David] Univ York, Dept Sociolog, York, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Beer, D (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Sociolog, York, N Yorkshire, England.",david.beer@york.ac.uk,,,,,,,26,17,17,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

The ongoing debate about legalization has focused on sex workers' agency and choice, and on the role of stigma in shaping the supply of and demand for sex work. Building on the analysis advanced by contributions to this special issue, this study contends that theoretical and policy debates about sex work are dominated by false dichotomies of agency and stigma. It argues that the relationship between stigma and agency operates along a continuum of contractual arrangements that underpins a high degree of segmentation in the industry. The higher the stigma, the lower tends to be the agency. Current policies toward sex work therefore need reconsideration - especially mounting support for criminalization of clients, which, by increasing stigma, is likely to detract from the agency and the well-being of sex workers, however unintentionally.","[Bettio, Francesca] Univ Siena, Dept Econ & Stat, Siena, Italy; [Della Giusta, Marina] Univ Reading, Dept Econ, Reading, Berks, England; [Di Tommaso, Maria Laura] Univ Turin, Dept Econ & Stat Cognetti de Martiis, Turin, Italy; [Di Tommaso, Maria Laura] Coll Carlo Alberto, Via Real Coll 30, I-10024 Turin, Italy",University of Siena; University of Reading; University of Turin; Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Bettio, F (通讯作者)，Univ Siena, Dept Econ & Stat, Siena, Italy.",francesca.bettio@unisi.it; m.dellagiusta@reading.ac.uk; marialaura.ditommaso@unito.it,"Della Giusta, Marina/AGM-2970-2022","Della Giusta, Marina/0000-0003-3959-4451; BETTIO, Francesca/0000-0002-7106-156X",Collegio Carlo Alberto,Collegio Carlo Alberto,"We would like to thank the contributors and referees of the papers included in this special issue for their valuable and accurate work, and for patiently handling many rounds of revisions to the papers: it is thanks to their efforts and perseverance that this volume has such interesting and through coverage of the field.

Utopia of egalitarianism was based on the ideal of equality. Equality as a principle of value or social organization became popular only after the French Revolution. In almost all societies present and past, there were inequalities in every sphere of life. In the 19th and 20th century, there were certain feelings, firstly, it was thought that ' inequality' is not natural but is a social creation, which has gained wide acceptance around the world. Secondly, it was felt that social inequality is not universal in nature, which meant that in the past, there were certain social conditions, which treated people according to their profession or occupation. Thirdly, 'private property' was the cause of social inequality. Finally, social inequality is anti-human and antisocial and a form of human rights abuse. After independence, The First Backward Classes Commission was set up on 29th January 1953 and submitted its report on 30th March 1955. The Second Backward Class Commission was appointed to identify the socially and educationally backward classes, which is popularly known as Mandal Commission. The Commission identified 3,743 castes as Other Backward Classes and 2,108 as Depresses Backward Classes that are inadequately represented in Government services. The Mandal Commission estimated that 52 percent of total population of India as Other Backward Classes. The Commission recommended 52 per cent reservation for OBCs in proportion to their population. In August 1990, The Prime Minister Sri Vishwanath Pratap Singh implemented the proposals of Mandal Commission. There was protest again the implementations of Mandal commission recommendation in government jobs. The Supreme Court gave the verdict in the favor of implementation and reservations for OBCs in governmentjobs. It insured the 27 percent reservations for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in Governmentjobs. In 2006, the UPA Government and Human Resource Development (HRD) Minister implemented 27 percent reservation for OBCs in Higher Educational Institutions funded by central government. The Government decided to reserve 27 percent seats for OBCs in Educational Institutions. There was a huge protest against it but Supreme Court of India gave the verdict in the favor of reservations for OBCs and instructs the Government to exclude the 'creamy layer' so that only poor among the OBCs could get the benefits from the reservation policy.",,,,,,,,,,,96,0,0,0,2,"MASTERS INT CONSULTANCY RES PUBL, MIRDEC",KUCUKCEKMECE,"CINARLICESME SK, NO 21-13, KUCUKCEKMECE, ISTANBUL PK-34303, TURKEY",,,978-605-82290-3-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,103,130,,,,,,28,Area Studies; Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BJ5TI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426276100010,0

It is determined by international and national legislation. As regards land degradation risks and their prevention, the Law on Land Management has come into force on 1 January 2015, which defines the notion of land and soil degradation requiring local governments to depict such territories in their planning documents as well as land owners to prevent their lands from degradation. However, in spite of the law, land and soil degradation identification criteria have not been approved in Latvia, there is neither relevant degradation classification system, nor regulations of the procedure how to identify and evaluate the current degree of land degradation and its possibility, how to determine measures for soil degradation prevention. The aim of the research was to work out scientifically grounded recommendations for the procedure of identification of land and soil degradation, classification and evaluation of degradation processes in Latvia, which could serve as the basis for the design of the regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers in the framework of the Law on Land Management.

It is the aspect that deals with the negative effects of the existing legal framework (which is constantly changing, resulting in the fact that laws with only few amendments are very rare, which does not really respect terminology nor the essence of particular constitutional provisions, in which consolidated text of a law is a rarity even if it has been changed more than ten times, in which there are cases of legal amendment although the law has not been applied yet, cases in which the Constitutional court repeals the entire law which has not come into force yet, numerous cases where entire parts of law are changed by other laws thus creating a false image of what is, or is not in force, cases in which the law in its text as an existing court appoints the one that did not exist at the time of appointment, nor in the years thereafter, which in its text stipulates the prohibition of court protection even though it is contrary to the explicit provision of the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia....). However, it is also about case law (including administrative court practice) that is not only mutually uncoordinated but also very unpredictable. Both have the same effect on the legal certainty (and on the rule of law, because these are the two basic pillars of any legal state and two main goals of every country that wants to become legal) which is one of the preconditions for any investment interest.

With the growth of aquaculture, fish oil became a valuable feed component. Its value increased further as the belief in the health benefit of Omega-3 opened the market for direct human consumption through nutritional supplements. Strong demand, limited supply growth and weaker substitution between Omega-3 and Omega-6 has led to diverging trends between fish oil and vegetable oil prices, with fish oil now a premium oil product. We also investigated how the salmon aquaculture industry has responded to the challenge of rising fish oil prices. Concerted effort in nutrition and feed research is shown to have allowed a reduction in the share of fish oil in feed from around 25% in the early 2000s to around 12% today. This substitution effort has allowed salmon production to grow without using substantially more fish oil.","[Misund, Bard] Univ Stavanger, Sch Business, Stavanger, Norway; [Oglend, Atle; Pincinato, Ruth Beatriz Mezzalira] Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway",Universitetet i Stavanger; Universitetet i Stavanger,"Oglend, A (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway.",atle.oglend@uis.no,"Misund, Bård/J-8720-2016","Misund, Bård/0000-0001-7069-5707; Pincinato, Ruth/0000-0002-8320-680X",Norwegian Research Council,Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),The authors would like to thank the Norwegian Research Council for financial support.,,31,18,18,4,33,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

The EU measure is remarkable insofar it incorporates an international soft-law instrument, the Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals from CAHR Areas, and makes it mandatory for EU importers. Importers are under a mandatory obligation to engage in supply chain due diligence to avoid dealing in conflict minerals, and thus regulating upstream entities. This contribution assesses the relation between such a regulatory strategy and provisions of WTO law. It assesses whether the EU bears responsibility for possible detrimental impact stemming from the incorporation of the OECD Guidance and from the delegation of certain regulatory tasks to economic operators. Subsequently, it evaluates the status under international law of the OECD Guidance, and discusses whether its status can justify possible detrimental impact stemming from the EU regime.","[Partiti, Enrico] TMC Asser Inst, European & Int Law, The Hague, Netherlands; [Van der Velde, Steffen] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Van der Velde, Steffen] TMC Asser Inst, EU Law, The Hague, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Partiti, E (通讯作者)，TMC Asser Inst, European & Int Law, The Hague, Netherlands.",e.partiti@asser.nl; s.van.den.velde@asser.nl,,"Partiti, Enrico/0000-0003-0089-2371",,,,,33,7,7,1,10,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Some suggestions for design discipline construction are put forward: 1. Attach importance to information input to enhance image memory and comprehension, and attach importance to the study of the form, quality and effective input of such information in order to improve the efficiency of information absorption efficiency; 2. pay attention to the characteristics of spiritual life when the subconscious mind or creative thinking is active, and carry out the research on the way of thinking training in design discipline; 3.

The proposed methodology is based on meme theory (Dawkins, 1976) in the context of Berlo's (1960) theory of the communication model and is focused on the decomposition of photograph contents into groups of single memes. The memes are present at different frequency. Some of them might influence the behaviour of social network users. Meme is defined as a single meaning, expressed in diversified form (text, graphic, sound, etc.). Each photo, shared in social networks is the conglomeration of memes. To extract memes from the content of photographs, the assumptions of the model of destination image formation according to Baloglu and McCleary (Baloglu, McCleary 1999) were used (i.e. groups of memes connected with: hotel; local cultural heritage and environment). Simultaneously, each photograph has two types of planes, i.e. manifest and latent. Both could be decomposed using the same tool. The analysis of the presence frequency of different memes on both planes in the context of user activities (i.e. 'likes', posting comments and sharing content) provides information about the memes or group of memes influencing user behaviours. Quantitative and qualitative social network content analysis are the main scientific methods of the study. Due to the initial character of the study only 206 photographs shared on Facebook fan pages of eight hotels were collected and analysed. The hotels were located in Warsaw. Based on the analysis of Spearman correlation coefficient and from the perspective of the manifest content of the analysed photographs it could be stated that the memes connected with the expression of hotel personnel positive feelings play the main role in the activation of users' behaviours. Excessive representation of memes connected with hotels interiors did not reveal positive connections with the on-line activities of recipients.","[Stepaniuk, Krzysztof] Bialystok Tech Univ, Fac Engn Management, Tarasiuka 2 St, PL-16001 Kleosin, Poland",,"Stepaniuk, K (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Fac Engn Management, Tarasiuka 2 St, PL-16001 Kleosin, Poland.",k.stepaniuk@pb.edu.pl,"Stepaniuk, Krzysztof/Q-2738-2018","Stepaniuk, Krzysztof/0000-0003-4071-1053",,,,,22,0,0,1,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,182,191,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426857700018,0

In this study, the import demand of wood products in Japan and China between 1995 and 2013 by product type and source is assessed using the translog cost function and cointegration analysis. Wood products are classified into three main types by the degree of processing and transformation on wood fiber: roundwood, sawnwood, and wood-based panels. The own-price elasticities are overall inelastic, but they can become very elastic for some source-differentiated products (e.g., sawnwood import by Japan and roundwood import by China from the United States). Clear substitutability across product types and supplying sources is identified. Wood products with a different degree of processing or from different sources can be substituted with each other when they are used by wood-utilizing industries in the importing countries. The substitute relation will continue to present both opportunities for economic development and challenges for global environment protection. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Results associated with the import component of the model appear satisfactory, with negative own-price elasticities and positive cross-price elasticities (implying substitutability among import sources). Many of the cross-price elasticities, however, were small.

Using US health survey microdata from 1999 to 2012, this paper measures how border-crossing opportunities affect the smoking deterrence achieved by a cigarette tax increase. I estimate by two-way fixed-effects regression that a $1 state cigarette tax increase decreases the smoking rate by an additional 0.64 percentage points for each dollar of cigarette tax in the nearest lower-tax state. However, each successive $1 tax increase decreases the smoking rate by 0.43 fewer percentage points than the last. I show that the signs of these terms can be theoretically derived without parametric assumptions. I observe that, as both home and nearest lower taxes rose from 1999 to 2012, the mean effectiveness of a home state tax increase remained roughly constant over the period. My results imply that the lowest-tax states are those with the greatest power to reduce the national smoking rate.","[Bishop, James M.] Inst Def Anal, Alexandria, VA 22311 USA",,"Bishop, JM (通讯作者)，Inst Def Anal, Alexandria, VA 22311 USA.",bishop@ida.org,,,,,,,36,3,4,0,93,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",2332-3493,2332-3507,,AM J HEALTH ECON,AM.

This shift is small compared with the higher likelihood that the cheaper fuel is chosen among college-educated relative to less schooled subjects.

Identification is achieved via individual fixed effects and by distinguishing between secondary school peers who attended the same primary school as the individual and those who did not. Estimates of peer effects are based on the new peers, whose primary school achievement could not have been affected by the individual. The results provide strong evidence for the existence of peer effects, with small but positive and statistically significant effects from having higher-achieving peers on average and from having a higher proportion of very high achieving peers.

We present two case studies based on the experience of the authors in promoting active learning in two large-class undergraduate modules in Introductory Macroeconomics and Descriptive Inorganic Chemistry at the University of East Anglia. Both case-studies are based on a flipping model with in-class active learning delivered through peer instruction. However, the experience of each author differs in the way the teaching approach was introduced and integrated with additional pedagogies to meet specific needs of the student population, as well as the desired learning outcomes for both modules. In the Introductory Macroeconomics case-study, we discuss how combining peer instruction with a self-assessment component can support the development of students' metacognitive skills. In the Descriptive Inorganic Chemistry case-study, we demonstrate that peer instruction questions can be co-designed in partnership with students to foster engagement and challenge misconceptions. We argue that peer instruction can be used as an effective, scalable, and easily adaptable active learning pedagogy in many different learning environments. Reflecting on our experience, as well as the student voice, our concluding discussion considers: (i) the importance of careful question design, (ii) the role of audience response technologies, as well as (iii) present and future challenges to the promotion of active learning approaches in Higher Education.","[Arico, Fabio R.] Univ East Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Lancaster, Simon J.] Univ East Anglia, Sch Chem, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia; University of East Anglia,"Aricò, FR (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.;Lancaster, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Sch Chem, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",F.Arico@uea.ac.uk; S.Lancaster@uea.ac.uk,,,University of East Anglia,University of East Anglia,"The authors are grateful for the support of The University of East Anglia and the counsel of Neil Ward, Adam Longcroft and Helena Gillespie.

They result in multiple dimensions of economic, social, and cultural prosperity in forest-dependent economies, and as such they constitute an important strategy for fostering prosperity. However, SMFEs face a number of barriers and challenges, including inhospitable or incompatible regulatory environments, difficulties achieving economies of scale, and insufficient access to technical and financial capacity to overcome these issues. Through a comprehensive literature review of scholarly research published on the subject of SMFE failures and successes, our study addressed the following question: what political, economic, and socio-cultural conditions are needed for SMFEs to thrive? In answering this question, we identified and characterized twelve (12) emergent critical success factors (CSFs) of enabling business environments: macroeconomic setting, regulatory frameworks, forest law enforcement, tenure and ownership rights, management and land use planning rights, markets, natural capital, financial capital, forest management capacities, business management capacities, organizational capacities, and clustering. The integrative enabling environment framework proposed in our study can be used as a tool by practitioners seeking to promote SMFEs through programs of support or policy reforms. By considering the various CSFs that act as the foundation for successful SMFE development, the efficacy of forest-dependent livelihood interventions aiming to achieve prosperity around the world can be meaningfully enhanced.","[Badin, Olivia Sanchez] Yale Univ, Yale Sch Management, Yale Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 165 Whitney Ave, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Hajjar, Reem] Oregon State Univ, Forest Ecosyst & Soc, 321 Richardson Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Kozak, Robert] Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",Yale University; Oregon State University; University of British Columbia,"Badin, OS (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Yale Sch Management, Yale Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 165 Whitney Ave, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",olivia.sanchez@yale.edu; reem.hajjar@oregonstate.edu; rob.kozak@ubc.ca,,"Sanchez Badini, Olivia/0000-0002-7360-0299; Hajjar, Reem/0000-0003-0219-7313",Insight Development Grant of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [430-2012-0158]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship,Insight Development Grant of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship,"This work was funded by an Insight Development Grant of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (430-2012-0158), an Undergraduate International Research Award from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (awarded to OSB), and a Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship (awarded to RH).",,122,54,57,1,43,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,SEP,2018,94.0,,,,,,35,45,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.06.005,0.0,,,11,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GP0VG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440528900006,0

This study compares two highly gendered and racially segmented labour markets, home-based family day care workers and garment homeworkers. The comparative cases examine the broader trends of migration, production and consumption that reinforce gender and racial stereotypes, and discourses that underpin representations that women workers are ideally suited to such work. We theorise the gender and racialised inequalities of homework based on the literature on invisibilisation and social reproduction to explore the vulnerable position of migrant women and the consequences of having limited options, such as legal and social protections and any capacity to collectively organise. Our analysis examines the roles and responses of institutions and conceptualises the socio-political factors that affect the characterisation of homework as non-work or as self-employed entrepreneurial activities. By mapping the differing regulatory trajectories of these two groups of homeworkers in terms of regulation and representation, we find both similarities and differences.

The vast majority of lives that are lost and affected by natural disasters are from poor areas in developing countries. We examine the post-disaster recovery of the households in rural Bangladesh that were affected by Cyclone Aila from 2009 to 2010. Exploiting exogenous variations in households' exposure to the disaster within the village, we provide empirical evidence of resource sharing within the households' informal network of neighbors and relatives to assist in recovery from the natural disaster. We find a household's own exposure to the disaster had no significant effect on its investment and income; however, exposure to a household's network had a significant effect on household investment and income two years and six months after the cyclone. We find that informal resource sharing within a household's network crowded out the household's need to purchase formal insurance against disasters. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, these methodological strategies are oftentimes not well described in published accounts. This is particularly evident in the growing body of work that relies on document analysis. In an effort to address this shortcoming, this article introduces a typology for the use of documents in qualitative inquiry and examines and analyses how researchers make use of and-report on the study-of documents in qualitative inquiry involving forests. The analysis is underpinned by a systematic review of the literature, covering the period from January 2007 to June 2017. When applying our typology to the results of the analysis, we find that most studies use a triangulation approach for the study of documents. We further find that there are untapped opportunities for engaging more deeply with documents in terms of object of research, in which closer attention is paid to the role and function of documents within specific forest contexts. We further emphasize that there are untapped opportunities for more detailed reporting of methods, aimed at enhancing understanding of qualitative methods in a field marked by interdisciplinary research efforts. This review serves as useful resource for encouraging the application and discussion of qualitative research methods, and document analysis in particular, as a tool to leverage the study of pressing, interdisciplinary issues surrounding the world's forests.","[Siegner, Meike; Hagerman, Shannon; Kozak, Robert] Univ British Columbia, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Siegner, M (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",meike.siegner@alumni.ubc.ca,,,,,,,66,13,37,1,12,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,JUL,2018,92.0,,,,,,128,135,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.05.001,0.0,,,8,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GJ9UI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000435750000013,0

However, the unsatisfactory impacts of the scheme lead to both parties reassessing the value of the partnership schemes. This article explores local communities' willingness to remain in or opt-out of the partnership schemes designed to grow pulpwood in Indonesia, and investigates their preferences for accepting the modified contract attributes. The contract attributes include contract length, labor participation, insurance, training, road improvement and income. A choice experiment approach was used to estimate preferences of 287 smallholders, of which half were participating with the timber industry under Company-Community Partnership schemes. The results show that a bundle of the contract attributes that could increase local communities' utility are provision of road improvement, higher expected income, and higher timber production insurance. Greater incentives are required to compensate smallholders' loss of utility due to longer contract length and monitoring planted areas. The preferences vary significantly depending on smallholders' participation status in the scheme but not land tenure status. The continuity of the partnership schemes is challenged by a significant number of respondents always rejecting the contract option. The implication of the findings is that designing a bundle of contract attributes focusing on a promotive social safeguard approach likely keeps the participating smallholders in the schemes.","[Permadi, Dwiko B.] Univ Gadjah Mada, Fac Forestry, Forest Management Dept, Yogyakarta, Indonesia; [Burton, Michael; Pandit, Ram] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Environm, Perth, WA, Australia; [Race, Digby] Univ Sunshine Coast, Trop Forests & People Res Ctr, Maroochydore, Qld, Australia; [Walker, Iain] Univ Canberra, Fac Hlth, Sch Psychol & Counselling, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Gadjah Mada University; University of Western Australia; University of the Sunshine Coast; University of Canberra,"Permadi, DB (通讯作者)，Jl Agro Bulaksumur 1, Sleman, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.",dbpermadi@ugm.ac.id,"Permadi, Dwiko/V-9182-2019; Walker, Iain/G-5457-2010; burton, michael/A-9541-2009","Permadi, Dwiko/0000-0002-9975-9468; Walker, Iain/0000-0002-1020-5873; burton, michael/0000-0003-4213-4093; Pandit, Ram/0000-0003-4053-5694",Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) [FST/2009/015]; School of Agricultural and Resource Economics at the University of Western Australia [JAF ACI1200036]; John Allwright Fellowship-Australia Award [UWA: PG10100054],Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR)(Australian Ctr Intl Agr Res); School of Agricultural and Resource Economics at the University of Western Australia; John Allwright Fellowship-Australia Award,"The authors would like to sincerely thank the many smallholders who willingly participated in this study.

Results reveal that resource persons of the three stakeholder groups perceive the positive aspects of JFM to outweigh the negative aspects. In addition, favorable institutional setup received the highest overall factor score for strength. Inadequate enforcement of the management plans is the weakness with the highest score and the overall priority score for weaknesses was highest for resource persons from the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development (MESD). On the other hand, better community relations received the highest overall factor for opportunities while uncertainty in decision making at higher levels was perceived as the most important threat to JFM in the Ziro province of Southern Burkina Faso.

In the process, the AB raised interesting questions about what it means to be a Non-Market Economy (NME) in the WTO. While NME status has traditionally led to large dumping margins, the AB approach in this case may lessen the consequences for China. Among other things, the case raises the interesting and important question of how pervasive the taint of NME status may be when calculating margins.

This empirical study brings in a dynamic element, exploring how and why participation change as policies evolve. Two Norwegian policy cases serve to contrast participation by environmental organisations (ENGOs) and forest owner organisations (FOs) over time. The policy arrangement approach (PM) is used as analytical framework, first, to explore changes in coalitions, rules of game, power constellations, and discourses for each of the policy cases. Second, an Initial exploration is offered on how changes in the PM dimensions affect the assessments of 'what's in it for me' for ENGOs versus FOs. The results indicate that when standards for sustainable forest management are implemented, the value for ENGOs to participate in standard revision is decreasing, while in forest protection, the ENGOs chose to participate in a coalition requesting more money for voluntary protection, even after being excluded from identifying interesting areas for protection. Combining evolving policies and participation based on 'what's in it for me' help explain why participation changes over time. The findings provide alternative perspectives on former work presenting continued participation as a challenge and important messages related to future forest policy analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Given that the exceptional method was the only method under which the AB had not definitively rejected zeroing, this dispute may have hammered the last nail in the coffin of zeroing. Or, maybe not. The AB did not address a key issue, namely: What is the evidentiary standard that an investigating authority must meet in order to have legitimate recourse to W-T? In addition, the AB's suggested approach to aggregating dumping amounts across targeted and non-targeted groups may produce zeroing-like outcomes even if the authority does not resort to zeroing. It seems inevitable that future disputes will be required to address these issues, since history shows that at least some investigating authorities are gearing towards using this methodology ad nauseam.

This article aims at an appraisal of network governance in Swiss forest policy by uncovering its current structure and by describing the experiences in terms of legitimacy and concerning how this is perceived by the actors involved. Although network governance is common in Switzerland, as an early coordination of stakeholders is required due to strong veto points later in the political process, more progressive participatory procedures have recently been introduced to these networks. Based on expert interviews and a social network analysis derived from an online survey, we confirm that the core of the Swiss forest policy network includes only a handful of actors. These actors are relatively satisfied with the current approach and some of them decline a further strengthening of participatory elements. Particularly the forest economic as well as the actors representing the sub national jurisdictions (cantons) are well connected with other actors from forest industry, but still they perceive their influence as not being adequate. The environmental NGOs, in contrast, judge their influence more positively, albeit they coordinate mostly with each other and with the national administration. Although the networks do not engage legislative actors very closely at the time of analysis, probably because forest policy reform has already settled the more fundamental questions, the forest policy network nonetheless seems well embedded in the democratic process.

After distilling two major drivers we construct a future compass in order to conceive of four futures of relations between the EU and Ukraine. Our scenarios aim to challenge deep-rooted assumptions on the EU's neighbourhood with Ukraine: How will the politico-economic challenges in the European countries influence the EU's approach towards the East? Will more EU engagement in Ukraine contribute to enduring peace? Does peace always come with stability? Which prospects does the idea of Intermarium have? Are the pivotal transformation players in Ukraine indeed oligarchs or rather small- and medium-sized entrepreneurs? After presenting our scenarios, we propose indicators to know in the years to come, along which path future relations do develop. By unearthing surprising developments we hope to provoke innovative thoughts on Eastern Europe in times of post truth societies, confrontation between states and hybrid warfare.","[Davydchyk, Maria] Robert Bosch Ctr Cent & Eastern Europe, St Petersburg, Russia; [Davydchyk, Maria] Deutsch Gesell Auswartige Polit eV, German Council Foreign Relat, Cent Asia, D-10787 Berlin, Germany; [Mehlhausen, Thomas] Univ Potsdam, Neuen Palais 10, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Priesmeyer-Tkocz, Weronika] European Acad Berlin, Bismarckallee 46-48, D-14193 Berlin, Germany",University of Potsdam,"Mehlhausen, T (通讯作者)，Univ Potsdam, Neuen Palais 10, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany.",davydchyk@dgap.org; mehlhaus@uni-potsdam.de; wpt@eab-berlin.eu,,,,,,,29,2,2,1,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,MAR,2018,97.0,,,,SI,,35,46,,10.1016/j.futures.2017.06.004,0.0,,,12,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,GA7AD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428485900005,0

In all three cases, globalisation and European integration were blamed for higher immigration and pressure on public services, deindustrialisation and job losses, and the attack on traditional values by cosmopolitan elites supported by traditional centre parties that have been unable or unwilling to control those processes. While election analysts seek to explain voting behaviour with socio-demographic characteristics of individuals, individual voting preferences also depend on the geographical context in which decisions are made. This article thus examines how long-term, regional structural economic changes, the varying impact of the Great Recession on the rise of and recovery from regional unemployment and current regional economic conditions, such as unemployment and welfare benefit losses, affect regional vote shares. In addition to those economic conditions, we examine the impact of immigration and urban size on populist vote shares. We show that regions with low, but rising immigrant shares, old industrial regions, smaller regions, those whose labour markets were exposed more and recovered less from the Great Recession, and those with high unemployment rates and benefit losses exhibited higher populist vote shares. These results are largely consistent across the three case study countries.","[Essletzbichler, Jurgen; Disslbacher, Franziska; Moser, Mathias] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Econ Geog & GiSci, Dept Socioecon, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Essletzbichler, J (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Econ Geog & GiSci, Dept Socioecon, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria.",juergen.essletzbichler@wu.ac.at; franziska.disslbacher@wu.ac.at; mathias.moser@wu.ac.at,"Disslbacher, Franziska/AAB-6016-2021","Disslbacher, Franziska/0000-0003-0191-0404; Essletzbichler, Jurgen/0000-0002-2680-3691; Moser, Mathias/0000-0002-9619-0384",WU Small Scale Projects scheme [11000416],WU Small Scale Projects scheme,"We thank Maria Reyero for her assistance in compiling data for the US and Anna Stelzer for her assistance in compiling the data set for Austria.

To overcome such limitations, we designed a hospital-based study for measuring the levels and factors of OOPE on maternity care for hospital births by its detailed components. Methods: Data were collected from women for non-complicated deliveries 24-h before the survey and complicated deliveries 48-h prior to the survey at the hospital settings in Uttar Pradesh, India during 2014. The simple random sampling design was used in the selection of respondents. Bivariate analyses were used to estimate mean expenditure on Antenatal care services (ANCs), Delivery care and Total Maternity Expenditure (TME). Multivariate linear regression was employed to examine the factor associated with the absolute and relative share of expenditure in couple's annual income on ANCs, delivery care, and TME. Results: The findings show that average expenditure on maternal health care is high ($ 155) in the study population. Findings suggest that factors such as income, place, and number of ANCs, type, and place of institutional delivery are significantly associated with both absolute and relative expenditure on maternity care. The likelihood of incidence of catastrophic expenditure on maternity care is significantly higher for women delivered in private hospitals (beta = 2.427, p < 0.001) compared to the government hospital (beta = 0). Also, it is higher among caesarean or forceps deliveries (beta = 0.617, p < 0.01), deliveries conducted on doctor advise (beta = 0.598, p < 0.01), than in normal deliveries (beta = 0) and self or family planned deliveries (beta = 0). Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that the OOPE on maternity care for hospital births reported in this study is much higher as it was collected with a better methodology, although with smaller sample size. Therefore, ongoing maternity benefit scheme in India in general and Uttar Pradesh in particular need to consider the levels of OOPE on maternity care and demand-side and supply-side factors determining it for a more effective policy to reduce the catastrophic burden on households and help women to achieve better maternity health outcomes in poor regional settings like Uttar Pradesh in India.","[Goli, Srinivas; Moradhvaj] JNU, SSS, CSRD, Room 102, New Delhi, India; [Rammohan, Anu] Univ Western Australia, Discipline Econ, M251,35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Goli, S (通讯作者)，JNU, SSS, CSRD, Room 102, New Delhi, India.",srinivasgoli@mail.jnu.ac.in,"Goli, Srinivas/J-7238-2012","Goli, Srinivas/0000-0002-8481-484X; Rammohan, Anu/0000-0002-9062-4508","research funds of Western Australian University, Australia","research funds of Western Australian University, Australia","A small grant of A$ 3000 for the field work was received by Professor Anu Rammohan from research funds of Western Australian University, Australia.",,51,25,25,0,7,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

While surprisingly large numbers of people unthinkingly renounce such of their privacy as remains for trifles, the idealistic hopes of early pioneers and freedom-loving 'netizens' remain largely unfulfilled. Benign notions such as 'cyber democracy' and the 'information superhighway' have all but disappeared. In place of these optimistic hopes and projections there's a growing sense of uncertainty, disillusion and, in some cases, fear. Those driving various components of the IT revolution claim new benefits and highlight examples of successful implementation - email, tablets, health innovations and so on. Yet, despite these obvious successes, it's hard to avoid the fact that many IT practices are powerfully disposed in favour of the interests of corporations, innovators and entrepreneurs. This enquiry takes the form of three separate but interrelated papers and has two main purposes. The first paper seeks to account for the underlying polarity between the promoters of high-tech 'solutions' and those who view the world differently. Drawing on a sample of literature including informed journalism it begins by outlining key assumptions (including that technology is 'not merely stuff' and 'new technologies are ambiguous'). It then outlines aspects of the territory through a critical review several key works. Some general conclusions provide starting points for the second and third articles.","[Slaughter, Richard A.] Foresight Int, POB 793, Indooroopilly, Qld 4068, Australia",,"Slaughter, RA (通讯作者)，Foresight Int, POB 793, Indooroopilly, Qld 4068, Australia.",rslaughter@ozemail.com.au,,,,,,,27,10,10,0,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,FEB,2018,96.0,,,,,,115,123,,10.1016/j.futures.2017.12.006,0.0,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,FX4EB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426024400010,0

In the name of 'shareholder value', the various forms of value generated by companies (such as 'trade credit') tend to be increasingly transformed into liquid forms of money that are easily distributable to shareholders ('cash flows'). Describing this phenomenon as an example of what anthropologists of money call 'conversion', this paper highlights how such a conversion process was necessary for the historical development of 'shareholder value' policies in corporate finance. Considering documentary sources and interviews with consultants, auditors, and private equity fund managers involved in 'cash flow' optimisation practices, this paper details this conversion phenomenon and shows how it has relied on the historical elaboration of specific metrological, technical, legal, and moral norms.","[Bourgeron, Theo] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Polit & Social Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Bourgeron, T (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Sch Polit & Social Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",tbourger@exseed.ed.ac.uk,,"Bourgeron, Theo/0000-0002-6414-1975",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J500136/1]; Economic and Social Research Council [1638456] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by Economic and Social Research Council [grant number ES/J500136/1].,,43,2,3,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

I suggest that this effect captures retail investor overreaction to unexpected signals, because online search frequency reflects the efforts made by investors to obtain firm-specific knowledge. The effect is particularly strong in stocks with high information uncertainty (high analyst dispersion, big past earnings surprises, low analyst coverage, and large trading volume), whose intrinsic values are difficult or costly for investors to estimate. Online search frequency as a direct indicator of retail investors' reaction to signals also sheds light on the idiosyncratic volatility (IVOL) puzzle. I find that this puzzle is more pronounced in high-search-frequency subsamples and disappears in low-search-frequency subsamples. Further evidence shows that high search frequency strengthens the negative IVOL effect in stocks with positive signals but weakens this effect in stocks with negative signals. I suggest that the IVOL puzzle in the Chinese market can be partially explained as a reversal following overreaction to positive signals by retail investors.","[Chen, Jiaqi] Renmin Univ China, Hanging Adv Inst Econ & Finance, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,"Chen, JQ (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Hanging Adv Inst Econ & Finance, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",2008200120@ruc.edu.cn,"chen, jia/JDW-7660-2023",,,,,,39,2,3,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The objective is to assess the relative importance of cost, demand and monetary shocks in driving the exchange rate in Poland. A two-country and two-good New Keynesian open economy model as developed by Engel and West (2006) is used as a theoretical framework. A Bayesian SVAR model with Markov switching heteroscedasticity is used in empirical part. The structural shocks are identified on the basis of the changes in volatility and named with reference to the sign restrictions derived from the economic model. We identify two regimes/states: one with high volatility and the other featuring low volatility. Estimated impulse response functions are in line with the theoretical model though uncertainty is rather large. The main finding is that the contribution of cost and demand shocks to exchange rate variability is about 50 percent in normal times implying that the flexible exchange rate acts as a shock absorber. In turbulent times monetary shocks dominate the exchange rate variability, but their impact on a real economy is short-lived. This undermines the claim that the exchange rate flexibility is dangerous due a shock-propagating nature of the exchange rate.","[Dabrowski, Marek A.] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Macroecon, Ul Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland; [Kwiatkowski, Lukasz; Wroblewska, Justyna] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Econometr & Operat Res, Ul Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics; Cracow University of Economics,"Dabrowski, MA (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Macroecon, Ul Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",marek.dabrowski@uek.krakow.pl; lukasz.kwiatkowski@uek.krakow.pl; eowroble@cyf-kr.edu.pl,"Dąbrowski, Marek A./V-2257-2018; Wróblewska, Justyna/AAA-8421-2020","Wróblewska, Justyna/0000-0002-9789-2601; Dabrowski, Marek A./0000-0003-3079-1811",,,,,9,1,1,0,1,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",2545-1227,,978-83-65907-20-2,SOC ECON MODEL FOREC,,,2018,1.0,,,,,,90,99,,10.14659/SEMF.2018.01.09,0.0,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BQ1LQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000576774700009,0

However, with the high degree of market integration for similar species, one would also expect substantial volatility spillover. In this paper, we investigate the price volatility relationship between seafood from aquaculture and fisheries. Using trade data from 1990 to 2016, we assess both size and direction of volatility spillover over time, allowing us to evaluate the relative importance of both production techniques on seafood price volatility. Our results show a time-varying relationship as the level and direction of volatility spillover changes. Still, our results indicate that wild markets typically transmit price uncertainty to aquaculture markets, thus increasing the volatility in aquaculture markets. In addition, our results indicate that it requires a substantial (negative) supply shock to aquaculture production to shift volatility spillover from aquaculture to wild. These results add to previous studies confirming that prices of aquaculture products are less volatile than those of wild products and, in general, reduce volatility in seafood markets.","[Dahl, Roy Endre; Jonsson, Erlendur] Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ & Risk Management, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway",Universitetet i Stavanger,"Dahl, RE (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ & Risk Management, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway.",roy.e.dahl@uis.no,,"Dahl, Roy Endre/0000-0002-1874-795X",,,,,59,9,10,1,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

We study a tax increase on one pollutant where the other faces a tax or permit policy. Our solutions highlight key parameters and welfare effects with gains from abatement plus positive or negative co-benefits from other pollutants in the covered and uncovered sectors. We demonstrate several ways taxes and permits differ. First, the change in taxed pollutant depends on whether the other pollutant faces a tax or permit policy. Also, only with a tax on the other pollutant can a co-benefit arise. The sign of co-benefits depends on the sign of cross-price elasticities and on whether the other pollutant's price is above or below marginal damages. Finally, the other pollutant's tax or permit policy also affects emissions in the uncovered sector (leakage).

We test four hypotheses drawn from prevalent claims made in the academic and policy-facing literatures: (1) that the volume of participation in the Public Forum is determined by the ebb and flow of WTO-centred trade politics, with participation levels peaking during moments of crisis and falling away during times of stasis; (2) that the stalling of the multilateral trade agenda has led to business interests turning away from the WTO; (3) that the participation of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in the Public Forum is also sensitive to the rhythms of trade politics; and (4) that governments -particularly those from the global North -have begun to lose interest in the WTO and shifted attention to other arenas. We find support for hypotheses one and three but not for two and four. We subsequently analyse whose voices are heard at the Public Forum and find that there has been a narrowing of the arena of trade debate over time.","[Hannah, Erin] Univ Western Ontario, Kings Univ Coll, Dept Polit Sci, London, ON, Canada; [Scott, James] Kings Coll London, Int Polit Econ, Dept Polit Econ, London, England; [Janzwood, Amy] Univ Toronto, Polit Sci & Environm Studies, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Wilkinson, Rorden] Univ Sussex, Global Polit Econ, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Wilkinson, Rorden] Univ Sussex, UK Trade Policy Observ, Brighton, E Sussex, England",Western University (University of Western Ontario); University of London; King's College London; University of Toronto; University of Sussex; University of Sussex,"Hannah, E (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, Kings Univ Coll, Dept Polit Sci, London, ON, Canada.",ehannah2@uwo.ca; amy.janzwood@gmail.com; james.m.scott@kcl.ac.uk; Rorden.Wilkinson@sussex.ac.uk,"Janzwood, Amy/ABE-7308-2020","Janzwood, Amy/0000-0003-4636-657X; Scott, James/0000-0003-3296-0375; Wilkinson, Rorden/0000-0002-0883-8081",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC),Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)CGIAR),"The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC).

We show that solar geoengineering is a substitute for emissions abatement; optimal policy includes less abatement, by up to eight percentage points, and has a lower carbon price, by up to fifteen percent, than recommended by models that ignore solar geoengineering. However, it is an imperfect substitute, since it reduces temperature without reducing atmospheric or ocean carbon concentrations. Carbon concentrations are higher but temperature is lower when allowing for solar geoengineering. Ignoring geoengineering in climate models can lead to welfare losses of up to 4 percent of GDP. Uncertainty over climate sensitivity leads to more abatement and solar geoengineering, while uncertainty over solar geoengineering damages leads to less geoengineering. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The research concerns the years 2001 - 2016 with particular consideration of the years 2013 - 2016. The profitability ratios used in this article with respect to both banks and enterprises are ROA and ROE. The Net Interest Margin (NIM) was used for banks only and the Net Turnover Profitability (NTP) for non-financial enterprises. In the conducted analysis dynamics indicators of the used profitability ratios were applied. Lower financial profitability of the banking sector in relation to that of non-financial enterprises observed since 2015 has not resulted from activities of banks in the environment of low interest rates only. Other important factors which should be taken into consideration when correctly interpreting the above issue include increased domestic fiscal burden in the form of a bank tax, credit recommendations of KNF(Polish Financial Supervision Authority) that complicate the involvement of financial resources of banks in lending activities, as well as growing capital and credit requirements enforced by KNF as banking supervision.","[Huterski, Robert; Huterska, Agnieszka] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Fac Econ Sci & Management, Ul Gagarina 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland; [Voss, Grazyna] UTP Univ Sci & Technol Bydgoszcz, Fac Management, Ul Fordonska 430, PL-85790 Bydgoszcz, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University; Bydgoszcz University of Science & Technology,"Huterski, R (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Fac Econ Sci & Management, Ul Gagarina 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",robhuski@umk.pl; huterska@umk.pl; gvoss@wp.pl,"Huterski, Robert/G-3837-2014; Huterska, Agnieszka/AAC-9799-2021","Huterska, Agnieszka/0000-0002-4722-2853",,,,,11,0,0,1,6,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,600,610,,,,,,11,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400060,0

It is not easy to identify variables variables that precisely map into the various factors that affect value creation through cross border mergers and acquisitions nor to pick an appropriate performance indicator because the definitions of performance vary in terms of accounting, financial and operational views. In this paper, we focused on the impact of the characteristics of the transaction on the corporate financial performance of mergers and acquisitions, which are return on investment, return on equity and Marris ratio, using data on the deals that occurred during the period 2010-2015 in Saudi Arabia. Panel data and precisely random effect method are applied to carry out empirical analysis. In this paper, we examine whether specific merger characteristics impact the M&A's performance. The results show that the performance is negatively influenced by the level of indebtedness for the 3 performance indicators and by the sectorial proximity for the return on equity. The cash level has a very slight positive impact on the 3 indicators.

The first B Corporations (the for-profit Corporations Beneficial to society) were certified in 2007. Since then 2655 companies in 60 countries around the world across 150 industries have been certified The European B Corp movement, officially launched in 2015 with 60 companies, has now grown to more than 500 B Corps. The purpose of the paper is to elaborate the motivation behind the B Corp certificate, its application process and its effects on the customers, regional economies, and employee candidates. The authors analyse the growing presence of certified B Corporations in the European Union, its distribution across EU countries, and across different industries, and debate its advantages and shortcomings. The companies reach for B Corp certificate to visibly differentiate themselves, to protect their mission and to measure and improve their social and environmental performance/impact. However, the certificate recognizability is still to be further developed, especially in countries where B Corp certification has not yet taken place. The authors elaborate the pro and contra of the certification process (its transparency, the review and verification processes, and its recertification character). The paper is based on the desk research method (secondary data used in the paper are based on B Lab statistics) and on the critical analysis approach to the theme-relevant papers and research studies. The results indicate that the value of B Corp certificate is not fully realized in the modern EU economy, mostly because of a lack of knowledge and awareness on its effects. There is also an evident lack of academic papers on this subject. This paper's aim is to fill that gap. The conclusions given in the paper could be a valuable input for future primary research.","[Lacmanovic, Sabina; Milec, Dario] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Lacmanovic, S (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula, Croatia.",sgrgor@unipu.hr; dmilec@unipu.hr,"Lacmanović, Sabina/AAV-3747-2021",,,,,,27,3,3,2,22,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,337,346,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO8KK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000527683300038,0

Using forecast error and forecast dispersion as information asymmetry variables, this study finds that the more information asymmetry the firms face, the less likely they will increase dividends. Meanwhile, the effects of information asymmetry dominate over those of catering incentives for managers to decide dividend policy. Finally, our empirical results demonstrate that the signaling theory holds when dividend yield is high or market underestimates the EPS of firms. In addition, companies use share repurchases as a substitute for dividend increases, and take retained earnings into account when making dividend policies.","[Lin, Szu-Hsien] TransWorld Univ, Dept Finance, Touliu, Taiwan; [Lai, Huei-Hwa; Hsu, Ai-Chi] Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, Touliu, Taiwan",National Yunlin University Science & Technology,"Lai, HH (通讯作者)，Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, Touliu, Taiwan.",edithlai2005@gmail.com,,,,,,,44,3,4,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Average wages are among the basic economic indices, even though they are far from ideal. It is usually observed that about two-thirds of employees do not achieve the average level of wages. In other words, the average is about a 67% quantile. The skewness of the wage distribution is one of the main reasons for this phenomenon: this distribution is skewed towards the positive (right-hand) values. This in turn is caused by high wages; there are not too many of those, but their values are far from the average. As the years go by, the distribution of wages is changed; namely, its skewness grows (that is, more high wages are observed). The question arises of what the behavior is of the quantile measures for such a wage distribution. We will mainly address the issues related to the median, but also the 10% and 90% quantiles, as well as the upper (25%) and lower (75%) quartiles.

Nowadays, economic phenomena are carried out in a very rapid and profound manner, evolution taking into account various factors such as social, political, cultural, and last but not least, those in the field of information technology and technology. Thus, when the first signs of the current crisis began to be observed, the whole world was alert in only a few hours. In the opinion of economists and monetary, financial crises appear as a manifestation of banking crises, with an impact on financial stability and collapse of financial infrastructure in the absence of central bank intervention. The economic crisis that hit the world economy in the summer of 2007 is unprecedented in the post-war economic history. Although the current crisis has many features in common with past similar recession episodes. The crisis has been preoccupied with a long period of rapid credit growth, low risk premiums, abundance of liquidity, a strong leverage, rising asset prices and bubble development in the real estate sector. Economic activity is characterized by cyclicality, with periods of decline being a normal component of an economic cycle. Crises are not a new phenomenon, but over the last 100 years, due to the acceleration of the pace of economic development and the enormous advances in technology and communications, the frequency of such phenomena has increased. Such happenings have taken place in the past (e.g. in Japan and the Nordic countries in the early 1990s, the Asian crisis in the late 1990s). However, this time is different. The current crises are global and resemble the events that led to the Great Depression of the 1930s. But only two crises remain in history due to the size of the negative impact on people's lives and the international economic system; the 1929 Great Depression and the 2008-2010 Real Estate Crisis. Although there have been more than eighty years between the two, many similarities in origin, causes and propagation can be identified. The most recent one has taken on a much stronger character, because it is now too little time since its start and the effects cannot be fully analyzed. In addition, due to technological changes and recent financial innovations, the effects were much stronger and major interventions were needed to control them. To date, the most important effect is the bankruptcy of some banking and credit institutions in the United States and the European Union, as a consequence of defaulting, especially in the real estate sector, and the recovery of claims.","[Oprisan, Oana; Nicodim, Liliana] Ovidius Univ Constanta, 1 Univ St, Constanta 900470, Romania; [Tileaga, Cosmin] Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, 17 Dumbravii St, Sibiu 550324, Romania",Ovidius University; Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu,"Oprisan, O (通讯作者)，Ovidius Univ Constanta, 1 Univ St, Constanta 900470, Romania.",oana.oprisan@yahoo.com; lilinicodim@yahoo.com; cosmin_tileaga@yahoo.com,"Tileaga, Cosmin/AAE-3079-2021; Liliana, Nicodim/AAB-5930-2021; Oprisan, Oana/GLN-4249-2022","Oprisan, Oana/0000-0001-7850-2359",,,,,12,0,0,0,2,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,265,274,,,,,,10,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200024,0

Survey data on consumers' inflation expectations for four emerging Central and Eastern European economies with an inflation targeting monetary policy regime, i.e. Romania, Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary, is used. The empirical evidence doesn't support the rationality hypothesis of inflation expectations. In case of adaptive learning approach, the results suggest that constant gain learning algorithm provides a better description of inflation expectations than the recursive least squares algorithm, a possible explanation being the fact that it allows economic agents to incorporate structural changes, frequent in emerging economies, faster. Also there is evidence that consumers from Romania and Hungary use simple models to forecast inflation, that includes only a constant and the lagged inflation as determinants, while in case of Poland and Czech Republic the best fit is obtained for models that also includes other explanatory variables.","[Pop, Raluca Elena; Roman, Mihai Daniel] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Pop, RE (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",pop_ralucaelena@yahoo.com; mihai.roman@ase.ro,"Roman, Mihai Daniel/F-6949-2016",,,,,,24,0,1,0,5,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

In business-to-business (organizational) buying, internal employees (engineers, managers, purchasers) or external consultants act as influencers. Consequently, marketers need to take these factors into account when marketing decisions are made. This is especially the case in strategic and operative sales and marketing. Another aspect that needs to be considered concerns future trends, which implicates the future relevance and role of influencers. The aim of this research is to shed some light on this issue. For this purpose, a multinational study will be conducted, whose aim is to determine the most relevant developments and highlight potential novel strategic sales and marketing opportunities. As a result, practical guidelines and a scholarly research foundation are provided, research gaps identified and proposals for future research suggested.","[Riha, David] Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic; [Stros, Michael] Univ Appl Sci & Arts Southern Switzerland, Fernfachhsch Schweiz, Uberlandstr 12, CH-3900 Brig, Switzerland; [Rihova, Elena] Skoda Auto Univ, Karmeli 1457, Mlada Boleslav 29301, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Skoda Auto University,"Ríha, D (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",david.riha@vse.cz; michael.stros@ffhs.ch; elena.rihova@savs.cz,,,,,,,19,0,0,2,11,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,1526,1535,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400151,0

Then the paper focuses on the benefits of congruence of the employee and the organisation about values and norms as well as the influence on the work behaviour of the employees resulting from individual differences and various personality traits and beliefs. The findings of this paper present several possibilities to look at work satisfaction and outline different approaches to improve the relationship between organizations and their members and various theories, how motivation can be created and functions. Furthermore, practice related approaches of various researchers to increase the motivation and satisfaction level in practise are demonstrated.","[Schiller, Thomas] Univ Econ, Prague VSE, Nam Winstona Churchilla 1938-4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Schiller, T (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Prague VSE, Nam Winstona Churchilla 1938-4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",Thomas.Schiller@IVFP.de,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,1594,1603,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400158,0

At present, the State-supported agricultural insurance conditions do not provide adequate interest among agricultural producers. The article is devoted to consideration of major aspects of agricultural insurance in the context of global transformations. We determined the reducing demand for State-supported agricultural insurance and made an attempt to systematize the causes behind this phenomenon. The study of indicators of agricultural insurance in the Volgograd region was carried out using time series analysis. Special attention is given to a new instrument in agricultural insurance such as a unified subsidy. The result of destabilizing conditions in the organization of the system of agricultural insurance in the context of granting subsidies was a radical deterioration in the market. The unadapted subsidy system has resulted in substantial agricultural insurance volumes fall. The main problems in the allocation of subsidies from the federal budget to the regions are identified.

It facilitates information tracking and improves the authenticity of accounting information, reduces the obstacles of corporate leadership to accounting supervision, and improves the quality of social auditing practice and auditing efficiency to avoid repeated supervision by government departments and to eliminate the bureaucracy of government departments.","[Wang, Jingmei] Shandong Yingcai Univ, Jinan 250100, Shandong, Peoples R China",,"Wang, JM (通讯作者)，Shandong Yingcai Univ, Jinan 250100, Shandong, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,5,0,0,2,19,FRANCIS ACAD PRESS,LONDON,"35 IVOR PL, LOWER GROUND, LONDON, NW1 6EA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-912407-98-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,350,352,,,,,,3,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BL4ID,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450418800078,0

However, due to the intrinsic complexity and non-stationary of SPI, accurate SPI prediction has been a challenge task for a longtime. Compared to a quantity of single algorithms, hybrid methods always have higher prediction accuracy. Based on the theories of genetic algorithm (GA), grey model (GM), back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and support vector regression (SVR), in this paper, two hybrid models named GA-SVR-GM and GABPNN-GM are proposed for improving the prediction accuracy of Composite Index in Shanghai Stock Exchange (SHSE) and Component Index in Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE). The SVR (or BPNN) is first used to forecast SPI and then with the obtained errors GM is constructed taking into account the different patterns that the SVR (or BPNN) cannot identify, reducing with the final errors. Moreover, in order to obtain the better forecasting results of SVR (or BPNN), the model parameters are optimized by GA. Two prediction cases of SPI are used to test the performance of the proposed hybrid models. Compared with the random walk (RW), SVR, and BPNN, the simulation results show that the GA-SVR-GM and GA-BPNN-GM consistently have the minimum statistical error of the root mean square error (RAISE), mean absolute error (NAE), and mean absolute percentage error (NAPE). Thus, it can be concluded that such improving methods are effective.","[Wang, Jujie; Que, Danfeng] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Wang, JJ (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",wjj0913@126.com; quintaqdf@gmail.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71501101,11801276, 71603128, 61502242]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20150928, BK20160974]; National Social Science Foundation of China [15CJL017, 18ZDA052, 16ZDA047]; Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research in Colleges and Universities in Jiangsu Province [2015SJB063]; Qing Lan Project; Flagship Major Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; Top-notch Academic Programs Project of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research in Colleges and Universities in Jiangsu Province; Qing Lan Project(Jiangsu Polytech Institute); Flagship Major Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; Top-notch Academic Programs Project of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions,"This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71501101,11801276, 71603128 and 61502242), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (Grant No. BK20150928 and BK20160974), the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 15CJL017, 18ZDA052 and 16ZDA047), the Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research in Colleges and Universities in Jiangsu Province (Grant No. 2015SJB063), the Qing Lan Project, the Project Funded by the Flagship Major Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions and the Top-notch Academic Programs Project of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions.",,16,5,5,1,32,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

This study shows that disadvantages in the labor market for women are the primary drivers of the gender pension gap. Among people age 60 and older, women receive about half of the amount of men's social pensions. Using the 2013 wave of China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) and the CHARLS Life History Survey of 2014, this contribution has three main findings. First, about three-quarters of the deficit in women's pensions is explained by women's lower likelihood of receiving occupational pensions, and one-third is due to smaller benefits when they do receive them. Second, the gender deficit in receiving an occupational pension can be explained by education level and employment sector. Third, among pension recipients, nearly one-third of the gender benefit gap is explained by women's fewer years of employment and lower salaries.","[Zhao, Rui] Southwest Univ Polit Sci & Law, Sch Econ, 301 Baosheng Ave, Chongqing 401120, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yaohui] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Southwest University of Political Science & Law - China; Peking University,"Zhao, R (通讯作者)，Southwest Univ Polit Sci & Law, Sch Econ, 301 Baosheng Ave, Chongqing 401120, Peoples R China.",zhaoruiwhu@gmail.com; yhzhao@nsd.pku.edu.cn,"王, 娅冰/JGE-0541-2023; sun, jiamin/JPY-2155-2023","Zhao, Yaohui/0000-0002-9252-9715","Knowledge for Change Program at the World Bank [RF-P131518-RESE-TF015161]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71603013, 71450001, 71704147, 71130002]; International Development Research Center of Canada [107579]; National Institute on Aging [R01AG037031, R03AG049144]; China Medical Board [16-249]",Knowledge for Change Program at the World Bank; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); International Development Research Center of Canada; National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); China Medical Board,"We acknowledge support from the International Development Research Center of Canada (107579), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71704147, 71450001, 71130002, 71603013), the Knowledge for Change Program at the World Bank (RF-P131518-RESE-TF015161), the National Institute on Aging (R01AG037031, R03AG049144), and the China Medical Board (16-249).

We estimate that receiving a First Class degree instead of an Upper Second increases the probability of working in a high-wage industry by fourteen percentage points, leads to three percent higher wages, and yields two percent higher annual salaries. For the comparison between Upper and Lower Seconds, the corresponding figures are ten, seven, and four. Effects are larger for males and graduates of math-intensive degree programs.

In modern cities, property development is an increasingly important accelerator, which shapes what is built and where. At the same time, the foundational economy-which meets the everyday needs of citizens for housing, utilities, food and mobility-is a stabiliser.

We use two different estimation strategies, re-weighting estimators and propensity score matching, and address the existence of selection bias. We find that this programme had a substantial positive effect on children's academic achievement: the probability of falling behind the general progress of the group declined by between 3.5 and 6.4 percentage points and mean reading scores increased by between 8.5 and 17.4% of one standard deviation: We also find that a larger exposure to the programme improves students' scores: whereas students in schools that participated in the programme for at most two years do not experience any significant positive effect, those in schools that participated for at least three years did. The programme significantly reduced the probability of belonging to the bottom part of the distribution (by between 3.2 and 7.7 percentage points) and improved mean scores (by between 8 and 21.5% of one standard deviation). Finally, we find that the impact of the programme is much stronger for students in rural schools than for students in urban schools. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Garcia-Perez, J.

This paper employs a unique provincial level panel dataset of 8 National Forest Resource Inventories and related price and investment data to estimate the effects on the forest of China's reforms of collective forestland tenure and timber prices in the 1980s. The system Generalized Method of Moments with robustness (controlling for endogeneity) and fixed effects models were used to identify the determinants of these reforms for the collective forest region of southern China. Our empirical results indicate that these two reforms jointly caused deforestation and forest degradation. As much as 13.5% of the total forest area was lost, and 14.9% of the forest volume was removed. Deforestation in the 1980s was followed with widespread negative long-term impacts on forest growth and afforested area. These policy failures suggest the important lesson that a well-conceived framework for monitoring and regulation needs to be in place for successfully implemented reforms.","[Liu, Can] Northwest Agr & Forestry Univ China, Econ & Management Coll, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Liu, Can; Liu, Hao] China Natl Forestry Econ & Dev Res Ctr, Beijing 100714, Peoples R China; [Wang, Sen] Atlantic Forestry Ctr, Canadian Forest Serv, POB 4000,1350 Regent St, Fredericton, NB E3B 5P7, Canada; [Zhu, Wenqing] China Agr Univ, Econ & Management Coll, 17 Qinghua East Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Northwest A&F University - China; Natural Resources Canada; Canadian Forest Service; China Agricultural University,"Liu, C (通讯作者)，China Natl Forestry Econ & Dev Res Ctr, Beijing 100714, Peoples R China.",sfa1sfa1sfa1@163.com,"yang, yun/IZE-1092-2023",,China Natural Science Foundation [71473053],China Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),We appreciate two peer reviewers' and the editors' valuable comments and suggestions.

The reforestation after the storms was largely conducted by private forest owners who were offered grants to support regeneration with broadleaves. The previous practices however remained largely intact, with spruce occupying 90% of the planted area. Based on qualitative interviews and applying the practice based approach this study investigates factors and motivations shaping forest owners choice of species. The analysis reveals that continued reforestation with Norway spruce was a result of path-dependencies of practices strongly supported by the species' superior profitability and a high browsing pressure on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). Risk awareness, consideration to forest aesthetics and curiosity were the main attitudinal drivers in favour of regeneration with other species than spruce. Our analysis reveals naturally regenerated birch (Betula spp.) as a viable but previously overlooked pathway to increased species diversity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

I use a smooth maximum score estimator model, North Carolina data, and the state's bonus system to analyze how teachers and schools change matching behavior in response to accountability pressure. Schools under a high degree of accountability pressure match with teachers who are better at raising test scores. Estimation with a control year sample (when pressure was absent) bolsters these findings.

Opponents argue this may undermine the efficiency of ecosystem service provision and poverty reduction should be addressed with separate policies. However, many developing country governments are unable to implement such policies. In such cases, from an economic perspective, the preferences of buyers of ecosystem services should count. This paper addresses with a case study a particular group of buyers, citizens in developed countries, who pay to protect public environmental goods in developing countries through donations. Based on the case study of Malagasy spiny forest conservation, we conduct a choice experiment to elicit the preferences of citizens of Cottbus, Germany, for inclusion of distributive goals in PES design.

In this study, we examine the disparities in health insurance predictors and investigate the impact of drug use (alcohol abuse/dependence, nicotine dependence, and illicit drug abuse/dependence) on lack of insurance across different race and income groups. To perform the analysis, we used insurance data (8057 uninsured and 28,590 insured individual adults) from the National Surveys on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH 2011). To analyze the likelihood of being uninsured we performed weighted binomial logistic regression analyses. The results show that the overall prevalence of lacking insurance was 19.6 %. However, race differences in lack of insurance exist, especially for Hispanics who observe the highest probability of being uninsured (38.5 %). Furthermore, we observe that the lowest income level bracket (annual income <$20,000) is associated with the highest likelihood of being uninsured (37.3 %). As the result of this investigation, we observed the following relationship between drug use and lack of insurance: alcohol abuse/dependence and nicotine dependence tend to increase the risk of lack of insurance for African Americans and whites, respectively; illicit drug use increases such risk for whites; alcohol abuse/dependence increases the likelihood of lack of insurance for the group with incomes $20,000-$49,999, whereas nicotine dependence is associated with higher probability of lack of insurance for most income groups.

However, the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and resource utilization and costs in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is largely unknown. We examined resource utilization and cost data for 53,224 patients undergoing CABG in Ontario, Canada over a 10-year period between 2002 and 2011. Data for costs during hospital admission and for a 1-year follow-up period were derived from the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, and analyzed according to pre-defined BMI categories using analysis of variance and multivariate models. BMI independently influenced healthcare costs. Underweight patients had the highest per patient costs ($50,124 +/- $36,495), with the next highest costs incurred by morbidly obese ($43,770 +/- $31,747) and normal weight patients ($42,564 +/- $30,630). Obese and overweight patients had the lowest per patient costs ($40,760 +/- $30,664 and $39,960 +/- $25,422, respectively). Conversely, at the population level, overweight and obese patients were responsible for the highest total yearly population costs to the healthcare system ($92 million and $50 million, respectively, compared to $4.2 million for underweight patients). This is most likely due to the high proportion of CABG patients falling into the overweight and obese BMI groups. In the future, preoperative risk stratification and preparation based on BMI may assist in reducing surgical costs, and may inform health policy measures aimed at the management of weight extremes in the population.","[Johnson, Ana P.] Queens Univ, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Parlow, Joel L.; Milne, Brian; Thorpe, Joelle B.] Queens Univ, Kingston Gen Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol & Perioperat Med, 76 Stuart St, Kingston, ON K7L 2V7, Canada; [Johnson, Ana P.; Whitehead, Marlo; Xu, Jianfeng; Rohland, Susan] Queens Univ, Inst Clin Evaluat Sci Queens, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",Queens University - Canada; Queens University - Canada; Queens University - Canada,"Parlow, JL (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Kingston Gen Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol & Perioperat Med, 76 Stuart St, Kingston, ON K7L 2V7, Canada.",parlowj@queensu.ca,"Xu, Jianfeng/P-6421-2016",,Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) - Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (MOHLTC),"Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) - Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (MOHLTC)(Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, Ontario)","The authors are grateful to Shahriar Khan for his help with statistical analyses.

We will show that it is a very cost-effective way to build refuges, and viable solutions exist for various budgets and timeframes. Nuclear submarines are surface independent, and could provide energy, oxygen, fresh water and perhaps even food for their inhabitants for years. They are able to withstand close nuclear explosions and radiation. They are able to maintain isolation from biological attacks and most known weapons. They already exist and need only small adaptation to be used as refuges.

With regard to the legal findings, the Panel followed the established jurisprudence in this area, and found a number of violations of the Safeguards Agreement. With regard to the economics, we delve more deeply into the economic and political background of the safeguards investigation. Ukraine was hit by the economic crisis shortly after its WTO accession that significantly liberalized import tariffs on passenger cars. Next, we offer a de novo look at the injury and causation issues in this case, and discuss the challenges of an industry reliant on offshored production that sees a safeguard as a mechanism to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) for production. We conclude with an assessment of the operation of the WTO's safeguards regime, along with some tentative suggestions for reform. Overall, our examination of the economic analysis by the investigating authority and the legal review by the WTO Panel raises questions about particular aspects of the domestic and WTO processes, but concludes that the system worked well in this case.","[Gnutzmann-Mkrtchyan, Arevik] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Hannover, Germany; [Lester, Simon] Cato Inst, Washington, DC 20003 USA",Leibniz University Hannover,"Gnutzmann-Mkrtchyan, A (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Hannover, Germany.",mkrtchyan@mak.uni-hannover.de; slester@cato.org,,,,,,,16,5,5,0,3,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2017,16.0,2,,,,,227,251,,10.1017/S1474745616000525,0.0,,,25,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,EQ6NA,,"Bronze, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000398197500005,0

In both baseline OLS models and in models with individual fixed effects, more serious ill-health events, somewhat surprisingly, generally have only weak effects on hours worked. At the same time, their effect on the extensive margin of labor supply is substantial. Moreover, when combining the effects on both the intensive and extensive margins, the effect of illness on hours worked increases considerably for a range of conditions. In addition, for most part of the age distribution, people with poor self-assessed health living in rural areas are less likely to stop working, compared to people living in cities. While there is no conclusive explanation for this finding, it could be related to the existence of certain barriers that prevent people with poor health from withdrawing from the labor force in order to take care of their health.","[Goryakin, Yevgeniy] Univ East Anglia, Norwich Med Sch, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Suhrcke, Marc] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England",University of East Anglia; University of York - UK,"Goryakin, Y (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Norwich Med Sch, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",y.goryakin@uea.ac.uk,"Goryakin, Yevgeniy/E-4658-2015; Suhrcke, Marc/AAE-9024-2019","Goryakin, Yevgeniy/0000-0002-3063-6099; Suhrcke, Marc/0000-0001-7263-8626",,,,,30,4,4,2,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

(2010) is used to examine forest sustainability policy in New Zealand. The country has had no comprehensive forest policy since the 1990s and indeed no longer a forest service or its equivalent Instead 'forest' preservation, policy, and monitoring functions are carried out by the Department of Conservation, Ministry of Primary Industry and Ministry of Environment. Exotic plantation forests have themselves been sold off to the private sector and some aspects of planting and harvesting are regulated by the Resource Management Act. Even in this Neo-Liberal setting, and similar to Leach et al.'s work in completely different contexts, policy responses have tended to be oriented towards 'stability' and 'resilience' types of forest sustainability. Three forest sustainability pathways are evident, directed towards preservation of indigenous biodiversity, economic development without adverse environmental impacts, and monitoring of environmental quality. In some ways the current 'New Zealand forest governance model' is an improvement on its predecessor but it seems unlikely to be mobile in a policy sense, resting as it does on the existence a relatively large area of indigenous forest and a large exotic plantation resource where the latter provides all timber needs.

We also use a regression discontinuity model to analyze hourly traffic volume data immediately before and after a flash flood warning message is issued.

The income effect is identified by exploiting the plausibly exogenous variation in the payment schedule of the rebates. Using both ordinary least squares and two-stage least squares estimators, I find that the rebates had a large and positive impact on affect, which is explained by a reduction in feelings of stress and worry.

Risk selection may threaten the quality of care for chronically ill people, and may reduce the affordability and efficiency of healthcare. Therefore, an important question is: how can the regulator show evidence of (no) risk selection? Although this seems easy, showing such evidence is not straightforward. The novelty of this paper is two-fold. First, we provide a conceptual framework for showing evidence of risk selection in competitive health insurance markets. It is not easy to disentangle risk selection and the insurers' efficiency. We suggest two methods to measure risk selection that are not biased by the insurers' efficiency. Because these measures underestimate the true risk selection, we also provide a list of signals of selection that can be measured and that, in particular in combination, can show evidence of risk selection. It is impossible to show the absence of risk selection. Second, we empirically measure risk selection among the switchers, taking into account the insurers' efficiency. Based on 2-year administrative data on healthcare expenses and risk characteristics of nearly all individuals with basic health insurance in the Netherlands (N > 16 million) we find significant risk selection for most health insurers. This is the first publication of hard empirical evidence of risk selection in the Dutch health insurance market.","[van de Ven, Wynand P. M. M.; van Vliet, Rene C. J.

In this paper we propose an innovative approach to the analysis and critique of Europe's GSCs. The aim is to explore how speculative and creative fiction offer ways of embodying, telling, imagining, and symbolising 'futures', that can provide alternative frames and understandings to enrich the grand challenges of the 21st century, and the related rationale and agendas for ERA and H2020. We identify six ways in which filmic and literary representations can be considered creative foresight methods (i.e. through: creative input, detail, warning, reflection, critique, involvement) and can provide alternative perspectives on these central challenges, and warning signals for the science policy they inform. The inquiry involved the selection of 64 novels and movies engaging with notions of the future, produced over the last 150 years. Content analysis based on a standardised matrix of major themes and sub-domains, allows to build a hierarchy of themes and to identify major patterns of long-lasting concerns about humanity's future. The study highlights how-fiction sees oppression, inequality and a range of ethical issues linked to human and nature's dignity as central to, and inseparable from innovation, technology and science. It concludes identifying warning signals in four major domains, arguing that these signals are compelling, and ought to be heard, not least because elements of such future have already escaped the imaginary world to make part of today's experience. It identifies areas poorly defined or absent from Europe's science agenda, and argues for the need to increase research into human, social, political and cultural processes involved in techno-science endeavours.

The upshot is that any trade in forestry related carbon credits is likely to involve unwarranted acts of faith. This means that, since carbon credits are a de facto fiat currency, their exchange value is likely to be unstable. Contracting requires good governance, which is often lacking. Meanwhile, parties to a contract to provide offsets for sale in carbon markets have misaligned incentives in addition to asymmetric information. This leads to a principal-agent problem that delays successful contracting and quite often leads to incompatible claims regarding the creation of carbon offsets. At worse, it results in corruption.

Unfortunately, appropriate land management is a problem for the majority of agricultural land owners, thereby adversely affecting the efficiency of resource use and increasing possibilities for the resource depletion. Constantly new solutions are searched for in Latvia to avert inefficient use of utilised agricultural areas and reduction of land as resource. Therefore, the research aim is to identify problems for agricultural land abandonment and describe adopted solutions for reduction of the abandoned land areas in Latvia. The authors have concluded that the utilised agricultural areas decrease with every year in Latvia; thus, constituting the decline of 2.78 % within six years. Land areas primarily decrease due to the abandonment and change of land use purpose. The share of unmanaged utilised agricultural areas in the total amount of agricultural land ranges from 12.97 % to 15.23 % between 2011 and 2016 reaching the peak in 2015. The major reasons for land abandonment include inefficient land management due to its low quality (soil fertility) as well as land owners lack the financial resources, time and willingness to manage the land. To avoid land degradation and decline of land resources, an additional immovable property tax rate in the amount of 1.5 % to agricultural land which is not being farmed is imposed from 2010 and from 2016 fines are applied to those landowners who leave land abandoned. The research is mainly based on the monographic descriptive method as well as the methods of data analysis and synthesis and a graphical method.","[Arika, Edite; Mazure, Gunita] Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Social Dev, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Arika, E (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Social Dev, Jelgava, Latvia.",edite.arika@inbox.lv,"Mazure, Gunita/AAA-7586-2020","Mazure, Gunita/0000-0002-3722-9437",,,,,13,0,0,0,4,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-260-6,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2017,,44,,,,,307,314,,,,,,8,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BI1NX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406529200037,0

Pharmaceutical companies often license potential drug molecules at different stages of drug development from other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies and complete the remaining of research stages before submitting the new drug application(NDA) to the food and drug administration. The asymmetric information associated with the quality of licensed molecules might result in the molecules which are less likely to succeed to be licensed out, while those with greater potential of success being held internally for development. We identify the NDAs submitted between 1993 and 2004 where new molecular entities were acquired through licensing. Controlling for other drug area specific and applicant firm specific factors, we investigate whether drugs developed with licensed molecules face higher probability of safety based recall and ultimate withdrawal from the market than drugs developed internally. Results suggest the opposite of Akerlof's (Q J Econ 84:488-500, 1970) lemons problem. Licensed molecules rather have less probability of facing safety based recalls and ultimate withdrawal from the market comparing to internally developed drug molecules. This suggests that biotechnology and small pharmaceutical firms specializing in pharmaceutical research are more efficient in developing good potential molecules because of their concentrated research. Biotechnology firms license out good potential molecules because it increases their market value and reputation. In addition, results suggest that both the number of previous approved drugs in the disease area, and also the applicant firms' total number of previous approvals in all disease areas reduce the probability that an additional approved drug in the same drug area will potentially be harmful.","[Banerjee, Tannista] Auburn Univ, Dept Econ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Nayak, Arnab] Mercer Univ, Stetson Sch Business & Econ, Atlanta, GA USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University; Mercer University,,tzb0018@auburn.edu; azn0018@gmail.com,"Banerjee, Tannista/K-1702-2014","Banerjee, Tannista/0000-0003-3137-0058",,,,,29,0,0,1,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

This paper aims to propose conceptual framework enabling detailed planning and monitoring of these costs in time. The presented framework deals with the entire life cycle of the structure, from the construction to its operation to the demolition at the end of its lifetime. Formulas enabling to estimate the individual life cycle cost items (such as construction costs, maintenance costs, repair costs and replacement costs) are proposed in order to facilitate business activities. The proposed framework has an ambition to be implemented in facility management software solutions and to be used by owners of residential buildings, office buildings or production facilities. Additionally, this solution may also be used to facilitate building life cycle costs estimation in public procurement, as a basis for estimating the environmental burden, or as a decision-making aid in selecting optimal material characteristics for newly constructed or renovated buildings.","[Biolek, Vojtech; Hanak, Tomas] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn, Brno, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,"Biolek, V (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn, Brno, Czech Republic.",biolek.v@fce.vutbr.cz; hanak.t@fce.vutbr.cz,"Hanak, Tomas/E-3948-2019","Hanak, Tomas/0000-0002-7820-6848",,,,,10,1,1,0,5,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,466,472,,,,,,7,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426857700050,0

An algorithm is used to generate all possible transitions O among the set of S. A transitional graph T has as nodes scenarios S and as arcs transitions O. Any behaviour of the model M can be described by a sequence of scenarios. A tree R, which is sub-graph of the T graph and can be taken for any qualitative forecasting, is used to evaluate probabilities of different branches of the tree.

Although trusts originated in Medieval England, they have acquired a new significance in contemporary finance by virtue of their advantages in terms of profit maximization and capital mobility. As a result, trusts have become common in contemporary structured finance for corporations, in addition to their traditional functions as estate planning and asset protection vehicles for high-net-worth individuals. This article specifies three ways in which the trust structure has facilitated the global spread of financialization: by privileging the rentier-investor within the world economy; by perpetuating a distinctively Anglo-American approach to finance internationally; and by increasing the autonomy of finance vis-a-vis the nation-state. This study shares the primarily descriptive and conceptual intent of Krippner's work on financialization, but extends it in two ways: by comparing trusts to the better-known corporate form of organizing financial activity, and by showing how private capital is implicated in the financialized economy alongside corporate wealth.","[Harrington, Brooke] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, Copenhagen, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Harrington, B (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, Copenhagen, Denmark.",bh.dbp@cbs.dk,"Harrington, Brooke/AAR-4952-2020","Harrington, Brooke/0000-0002-5741-6846",,,,,122,23,25,1,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Nevertheless, in Romania no empirical research has so far concentrated on finding techniques that identify potential intrapreneurs, especially when they themselves do not always identify as intrapreneurs. This article therefore investigates the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and volunteering attitudes based on two instruments: Individual Entrepreneurial Orientation (IEO) created by Bolton and Lane in 2012 and Helping Attitude Scale (HAS) developed by Garry Nickell. Here, the analysis demonstrates a strong correlation between entrepreneurial orientation and helping attitudes, with no significant difference between male and female respondents.

To answer this hitherto unexplored question, we adopt the system of equations developed by Dasgupta, Noe, and Wang (2011) to explicitly address possible interdependence of cash allocation decisions in unionized firms. Based on comprehensive firm-level unionization data for Korean companies from 1998 to 2008, we document that unionized firms allocate less cash to cash reserves and retirement of external financing than nonunionized firms do. More interestingly, inconsistent with previous findings, we also find that unionized firms utilize a greater portion of cash inflows to investment. This unexpected result of greater investment in unionized firms is in fact consistent with the view that employees are an important nonfinancial stakeholder who naturally cares about the long-term survival of the company; thus, they do not necessarily suppress value-increasing investments. Overall, our findings suggest that researchers need to consider cash flow sensitivities when examining interrelated cash allocation decisions.","[Lee, Woo-Jong; Yu, Kyunghwa] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Business, Seoul, South Korea; [Oh, Seungbin] Univ Wisconsin Eau Claire, Eau Claire, WI USA; [Yim, Sang-Giun] Kookmin Univ, Coll Business Adm, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Eau Claire; Kookmin University,"Yim, SG (通讯作者)，Kookmin Univ, Coll Business Adm 411, 77 Jeongneung Ro, Seoul 02707, South Korea.",yimsg@kookmin.ac.kr,,"Yu, Kyunghwa/0000-0002-1575-8186",Institute of Management Research at Seoul National University,Institute of Management Research at Seoul National University,Woo-Jong Lee appreciates the financial support by the Institute of Management Research at Seoul National University.,,36,0,0,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Currently, the agricultural sector is the second largest source of GHG emissions, accounting for 21.5% of the total GHG emissions in the country, and the key source of GHG emissions is direct nitrous oxide emissions from soil, which are largely the result of nitrogen applied. Such trends indicate that without additional measures Latvia cannot reach its GHG emission targets set internationally. In this paper, authors aim to select measures that have potential to reduce the GHG emissions from the Latvia's crop production sector by using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach. Within the hierarchical structure of decision-making process, four factor groups affecting implementation of measures were evaluated: economic, social, environmental and technological factors. The study results indicated that the potential to reduce emissions from crop production sector is limited by technology as technological factors play the most important role in the process of implementation of GHG emission-reducing measures. Study results showed that reduction of direct N2O emissions can be achieved through several alternatives from which, according to experts' rating, the most important is such GHG emission reducing measures that promote accurate management of nitrogen circulation and introduction of an organic management system.","[Lenerts, Arnis; Popluga, Dina] Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Social Dev, Jelgava, Latvia; [Rivza, Peteris] Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Informat Technol, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies; Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Popluga, D (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Social Dev, Jelgava, Latvia.",dina.popluga@llu.lv,"Popluga, Dina/AAF-8097-2019; Lenerts, Arnis/AAG-5998-2019","Popluga, Dina/0000-0002-8182-8218; Lenerts, Arnis/0000-0003-1329-918X",Government of Latvia within the National Research Programme,Government of Latvia within the National Research Programme,This research was carried out with generous funding by the Government of Latvia within the National Research Programme 2014 - 2017 project 'Value of the Latvia's ecosystem and climate dynamic impact on those - EVIDEnT' sub-project 3.2.

The mechanisms occurring in Poland's modern tourist market are similar to those that are shaping international tourism. The economic effects of tourism as well as the environmental and social determinants of its development are noticeable both in the regional and global scale of the economic sphere. In 1950 the number of arrivals was 25.3 million, while in 2011 this number increased by 980 million. It is estimated that this number may increase by 1.56 billion by 2020. The aim of the survey presented in this paper is to identify the factors that affect the development of inbound tourism to the Pomerania Province in relation to the domestic tourist traffic after 2009. In order to achieve this aim, the following method has been used: analysis of literature and source materials containing data on the level and dynamics of tourist inbound traffic to Poland, with particular consideration of the Pomerania Province. The social and economic policy of the Pomerania Province has been assessed based on the analysis of the Province's strategy documents setting its social and economic directions of operation by 2020. It has been found that not only megatrends but also factors shaped by the regional social and economic policy have a dominant influence on the development and growth of inbound tourism to the Pomerania Province. An increase in the number of accommodation and improvement of accommodation standards are factors stimulating foreign travels to Poland through Gdansk. The parallel influence of supply-related factors and factors creating an increase in demand makes that tourism development, due to favourable regional policy, is becoming an important determinant of the social and economic position of the Pomerania Province at domestic and international level.","[Marciszewska, Barbara; Studzieniecki, Tomasz; Wanagos, Marzena] Gdynia Maritime Univ, Gdynia, Poland",Gdynia Maritime University,"Marciszewska, B (通讯作者)，Gdynia Maritime Univ, Gdynia, Poland.",b.marciszewska@wpit.am.gdynia.pl; t.studzieniecki@wpit.am.gdynia.pl; m.wanagos@wpit.am.gdynia.pl,"Studzieniecki, Tomasz/Q-7351-2018; Marciszewska, Barbara/X-8540-2018","Studzieniecki, Tomasz/0000-0002-1272-0908; Wanagos, Marzena/0000-0003-2665-8444; Marciszewska, Barbara/0000-0002-7952-889X",,,,,27,3,3,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,648,656,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426857700070,0

In a significant way the attractiveness of the touristic stay is influenced by the attractiveness of the recreational offer of the place.","[Panfiluk, Eugenia] Bialystok Tech Univ, 45A Wiejska St, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Panfiluk, E (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, 45A Wiejska St, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland.",e.panfiluk@pb.edu.pl,"Panfiluk, Eugenia/T-8631-2018","Panfiluk, Eugenia/0000-0002-6204-2383",,,,,26,1,1,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,722,730,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426857700078,0

The interaction between fisheries and aquaculture is especially important for the seafood market where supply of wild and farmed fish can affect price dynamics. We examine market interactions in the French fresh sea bass and sea bream markets. We test for long-term price parity between farmed and wild products for these two species, applying a bivariate cointegration approach to market delineation. We also conduct the Law of One Price (LOP) test between price series. Our data base consists of monthly domestic price series for fish purchased by French households from 2007 to 2012. Our empirical results show that the fresh fish markets for whole wild and farmed sea bream are partially integrated, yet those for whole wild and farmed sea bass are not integrated. The substantially higher price for wild sea bass relative to farmed sea bass suggests that consumers may be more sensitive to seafood production processes when it comes to higher-value species.","[Regnier, Esther] Univ Paris 01, Paris, France; [Regnier, Esther] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Bayramoglu, Basak] Univ Paris Saclay, INRA, Econ Publ, AgroParisTech, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Paris School of Economics; Universite Paris Saclay; AgroParisTech; INRAE,"Bayramoglu, B (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Saclay, INRA, Econ Publ, AgroParisTech, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France.",Basak.Bayramoglu@grignon.inra.fr,"Bayramoglu, Basak/X-1281-2019","Bayramoglu, Basak/0000-0002-0847-5858",French National Research Agency (ANR) under CLEANER project [ANR-NT09-505778]; European Union's Seventh Framework Programme [290693 FOODSECURE],French National Research Agency (ANR) under CLEANER project(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); European Union's Seventh Framework Programme(European Union (EU)),The authors acknowledge the support of the French National Research Agency (ANR) under the CLEANER project (ANR-NT09-505778).

These foreign investments represent one of the main factors for economic development that can have positive implications for employment and growth in gross domestic product by creating jobs, boosting productivity and competitiveness, industrial specialization, transfer of sophisticated technology and providing fast access to the global market. FDI have a big part in the movement of capital across national borders and become an important source of private external finance for developing countries. There is no longer the question whether to open the doors of the national economy for foreign direct investment but what measures and strategies should be taken to attract foreign investors. Governments must have properly conceived macroeconomic policies to attract foreign direct investment, as net benefits of FDI depends, beside the comparative advantages of the host country, also from the its economic policy towards FDI. The countries from the Balkan, including Macedonia, are making great efforts to attract foreign investors, which will enable: inflow of capital, encouraging economic growth and development, renewal of outdated technology, acquisition of new managerial skills and etc. Investment inflow from abroad in these countries is much lower compared to the countries of the European Union, and because of that there is a necessity for greater activities to promote and attract foreign investors in each country with the help of government measures and policies. The primary goal of this paper is to analyze investment opportunities in Macedonia, in the context of an analysis of the benefits and opportunities arising from investment for foreign investors. The secondary goal is to evaluate and expose the real conditions for doing business in Republic of Macedonia with accent on the possibilities and the limitations that could burden the foreign investors. All of this will be supported with the results of the empirical research that was implemented in 23 companies with over 10 percent of already invested foreign capital in Republic of Macedonia.","[Rentkova, Katarina; Panevski, Darko] Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Bratislava, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Rentkova, K (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Bratislava, Slovakia.",katarina.rentkova@fm.uniba.sk; darko.panevski@st.fm.uniba.sk,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,194,204,,,,,,11,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ2BZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418819000020,0

A perfect exciter when excited in a geometrical direction, should provide a stable, single directional and distortion free vibratory movement, without generating any additional source of uncertainty. Unfortunately, this condition cannot be easily realised in real situation. Most commercial exciters experience high limitations when used during sensor calibrations. The accelerometer will be sensitive to any movements generated along its input axis when the seismic is not symmetric to the input axis. The parasitic exciter's features will undesirably affect the accelerometer's response, which may degrade calibration's accuracy. The paper will show how the exciter's total transverse motion, amongst other effects was resolved into vectors (x- and y vectors) in representing the parasitic effects that will influence the accurate calibration results of the accelerometer. These vectors were calculated and quantified as the error affecting the accelerometer results. The error was added to the results in the form of UoM contributing to the accelerometer's sensitivity results.

Not all of the authors of leading books on economic principles have named the neoclassical homo economicus, but when they have done so it is overwhelmingly in the same way. They have given him the human form of a Robinson Crusoe figure, despite the fact that his behavioural motivations and his practical conduct owe next-tonothing to Daniel Defoe's original characterisation. I suggest that the route to today's cultural familiarity with the neoclassical homo economicus instead passes through the entirely unwitting hands of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. He substituted Defoe's account of the castaway's continuing deference to prevailing social norms with his own idealised vision of how the individual might use solitude to escape the corrupting influences of modern society. It is altogether another desocialised individual also bearing the Crusoe name who has latterly shaped many of the economics textbooks' renderings of the neoclassical homo economicus.

Describing these efforts as an experiment in optimization, we outline a post-critical alternative to critiques that centre on the reductive effects of management and audit. The notion that reduction is inherently negative fails to recognize that achieving specific forms of reduction is often the reflexive aim of standardization. Rather than resisting monitoring and evaluation, the environmental consultants we study try to create a system capable of constraining their work in the right way. Focusing on this experiment in optimization allows us to redescribe audit as a varied set of practices and aspirations, embedded in standards that generate relative forms of organizational transparency and opacity. This offers a view of management as 'broken up'; as a distributed, ambient activity, variably performed by different actors using different standards.","[Winthereik, Brit Ross] Univ Copenhagen, IT, Technol Practice Grp, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Jensen, Casper Bruun] Osaka Univ, Dept Anthropol, Osaka, Japan",University of Copenhagen; Osaka University,"Winthereik, BR (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, IT, Technol Practice Grp, Copenhagen, Denmark.",brwi@itu.dk,"Winthereik, Brit Ross/JAN-4391-2023","Winthereik, Brit Ross/0000-0002-1837-2385",,,,,49,4,5,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

For this reason, credible and unbiased projections of its development are necessary, which take into account various conditions, including climate change. Agricultural modelling is widely used to assess and simulate the development of the agricultural industry; it has two key purposes: to contribute to the scientific understanding of a particular system and to analyse and project the effects of policies made and support instruments applied. The scientific literature provides a lot of information on modelling and simulation of dynamic systems. Therefore, the overall aim of the present research is to examine the key agricultural production and market forecasting models employed in the EU. To achieve the aim, the following specific research tasks are defined: 1) to analyse the theoretical aspects of simulation modelling; 2) to examine the key agricultural simulation models employed in the EU, including Latvia. The research has found that in the European Union (EU) diverse models by the approach and scope are employed for developing outlook of agriculture or its individual sectors. However, the most widely-used global and EU level models not always meet all the needs to accurately simulate the agricultural changes in the Member States level. For these reasons, in 2015 and 2016 two agriculture simulation models were developed in Latvia in order to project the potential development of agriculture and the key challenges related to climate change policies more accurately.","[Zeverte-Rivza, Sandija; Nipers, Aleksejs; Pilvere, Irina] Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Social Dev, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Pilvere, I (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Social Dev, Jelgava, Latvia.",Irina.Pilvere@llu.lv,"Pilvere, Irina/GNM-7700-2022; Zeverte-Rivza, Sandija/GLV-3922-2022","Pilvere, Irina/0000-0002-8467-1949; Zeverte-Rivza, Sandija/0000-0002-1973-6128",Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Latvia [16-100-INV16-5-000001],Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Latvia,"The research was promoted with the support of the project of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Latvia Forecasting of Agricultural Development and the Designing of Scenarios for Policies until 2050, agreement No. 16-100-INV16-5-000001.",,33,6,6,0,7,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-261-3,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2017,,45,,,,,267,274,,,,,,8,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BI1NY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406530100032,0

Sawmill production planning is a key factor for the development of this industry with serious challenges taking into account the involved interrelated tasks. Assuming a multiperiod perspective, several elements can be considered and more interesting results can be attained. The appropriate procurement of logs is an important part of the problem costs and logging can be improved if the sawmill consumption can be foreseen in advance through an integrated approach. In this work, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for the optimal multiperiod planning in sawmills is proposed. An efficient solution is obtained considering a set of cutting patters (CP) for each type of log that optimize raw material yield. As a result of this optimization, appropriate procurement, distribution policy and stock management of logs can be achieved, as well as suitable production plan along the considered periods in order to fulfil the demand, with significant impact on the sawmill performance and profitability.","[Vanzetti, Nicolas; Corsano, Gabriela; Montagna, Jorge M.] Inst Desarrollo & Diseno, RA-3657 Avellaneda, Santa Fe, Argentina; [Broz, Diego] UNaM, CONICET, FCF, Bertoni 124, Eldorado, Misiones, Argentina; [Corsano, Gabriela] Univ Nacl Litoral, Fac Ingn Quim, RA-2829 Santiago Del Estero, Santa Fe, Argentina",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); National University of the Littoral,"Montagna, JM (通讯作者)，Inst Desarrollo & Diseno, RA-3657 Avellaneda, Santa Fe, Argentina.",mmontagna@santafe-conicer.gov.ar,,"Corsano, Gabriela/0000-0002-0235-4262; Vanzetti, Nicolas/0000-0002-9589-3715",CONICET [PIP 0682]; UTN [PID EIUTIFE0003974TC],CONICET(Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)); UTN,"The authors would like to acknowledge financial support from CONICET and UTN to develop research activities through their projects PIP 0682 and PID EIUTIFE0003974TC, respectively.",,9,10,10,0,46,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,DEC,2018,97.0,,,,,,1,8,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.09.001,0.0,,,8,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,HE0KP,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452955800001,0

The models are estimated using 628 transactions data of timber auctions organized by formal forest trade centres. Ordinary Least Square is used to estimate global models while semi-parametric geographically weighted regression (SGWR) for local models. The results suggest that the local (spatial) models are better fit; the influence of all (except three) determinants varies spatially, and many determinants influence stumpage positively in some locations while negatively in others. The results show that state-owned forests receive higher prices compared to private forests and neither format of auction (sealed-bid versus open) dominates in all areas. The results highlight the importance of the context in the analysis of stumpage markets. The spatial variation in the effects of determinants across diverse natural landscapes should be incorporated in the auction design and organization across geographical areas.","[Han, Xiao; Kant, Shashi] Univ Toronto, Fac Forestry, Forest Resource Econ & Management, 33 Willcocks St, Toronto, ON M5S 3B3, Canada; [Xie, Yi] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",University of Toronto; Beijing Forestry University,"Kant, S (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Fac Forestry, Forest Resource Econ & Management, 33 Willcocks St, Toronto, ON M5S 3B3, Canada.",x.han@utoronto.ca; shashi.kant@utoronto.ca; yixie@bjfu.edu.cn,,,"Natural Science and Engineering Research Council, Canada [RGPIN 203032-13]; Social Science and Humanities Research Council, Canada [410111285]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Ministry of Education, China [2018BLED01]","Natural Science and Engineering Research Council, Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Social Science and Humanities Research Council, Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Ministry of Education, China","The authors gratefully acknowledge the permission to use the transaction dataset from the Southern Forest Tenure Trade Center in Jiangxi Province.

We use the estimated trade-off among wages, housing costs, and climate amenities to value changes in mean winter and summer temperatures. We find that households sort among MSAs as a result of heterogeneous tastes for winter and summer temperatures. Preferences for winter and summer temperatures are negatively correlated: households that prefer milder winters, on average, prefer cooler summers, and households that prefer colder winters prefer warmer summers. Households in the Midwest region, on average, have lower marginal willingness to pay to increase winter and reduce summer temperatures than households in the Pacific and South Atlantic census divisions. We use our results to value changes in winter and summer temperatures for the period 2020 to 2050 under the B1 (climate-friendly) and A2 (more extreme) climate scenarios. On average, households are willing to pay 1 percent of income to avoid the B1 scenario and 2.4 percent of income to avoid the A2 scenario. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This paper aims to describe the development of CancerCostMod, and to present the healthcare expenditure and patient co-payments for the first 12-months post-diagnosis. The base population is a census of all cancer diagnoses (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) in Queensland, Australia between 1 July 2011 and 30 June 2012 (N=25,553). Each individual record was linked to their Queensland Health Admitted Patient Data Collection, Emergency Department Information System, Medicare Benefits Schedule, and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme records from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2015. Indigenous status was recorded for 87% of participants in our base population. Multiple imputation was used to assign Indigenous status to records where Indigenous status was missing. This base population was then weighted, using a programmed SAS macro (GREGWT) to be representative of the Australian population. We adopted a national healthcare perspective to estimate the cost of cancer for hospital episodes, ED presentations, primary healthcare, and prescription pharmaceuticals. We also adopted an individual perspective, to estimate the primary healthcare and prescription pharmaceutical patient co-payments. Once weighted, our sample represents approximately 123,900 Australians (1.7% Indigenous Australians). The total healthcare system cost of all cancers during the first 12-months post diagnosis was $4.3 billion, and patient co-payments costs were $127 million. After adjusting for sex, age at diagnosis, Indigenous status, rurality, socioeconomic status, and broad cancer type, significant differences in costs were observed for population groups of interest within the first year post-diagnosis. This paper provides a more recent national estimate of the cost of cancer, and addresses current research gaps by highlighting the distribution of healthcare and individual costs by Indigenous status, rurality, and socioeconomic status.","[Bates, Nicole; Lindsay, Daniel; Watt, Kerrianne] James Cook Univ, CPHMVS, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Bates, Nicole; Callander, Emily] James Cook Univ, AITHM, Townsville, Qld, Australia",James Cook University; James Cook University,"Bates, N (通讯作者)，James Cook Univ, CPHMVS, Townsville, Qld, Australia.;Bates, N (通讯作者)，James Cook Univ, AITHM, Townsville, Qld, Australia.",Nicole.bates@my.jcu.edu.au,"Lindsay, Daniel/GPS-6965-2022; Watt, Kerrianne/G-2520-2010; Callander, Emily/M-5679-2017","Lindsay, Daniel/0000-0002-7471-3041; Watt, Kerrianne/0000-0002-2275-081X; Callander, Emily/0000-0001-7233-6804",Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship; National Health and Medical Research Council [APP1052742],"Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science); National Health and Medical Research Council(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia)","NB received a stipend for general living costs, supported by an Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship.

A fundamental problem affects almost every healthcare system: the trade-off between the need to deliver effective healthcare services and the need to control expenses and to ensure the overall sustainability of the system. This problem is a clear expression of management complexity in healthcare systems. With the purpose of searching opportunities for reconciling standardization and differentiation in healthcare management, this work aims to explore possibilities offered by technology by investigating the criticalities and potentialities of the use of 3D printing in producing personalized medications. By adopting an organizational and managerial perspective, our exploratory study focuses on the context in which basic needs and opportunities of personalization in dosage forms mainly emerge: the stage of drug prescription and delivery processes that involve doctors, patients, and pharmacists. Obstacles, risks, and advantages of personalized medicine (PM) are discussed highlighting opportunities offered by the introduction of 3D printing technologies and conditions of success in terms of both effectiveness and cost of healthcare. Key findings lead to a possible model of synthesis in which the potential revolutionary role of drug 3D printing in pharmaceutical compounding and/or manufacturing is highlighted. A 3D printing empowered compounding pharmacy is an innovation we envision to progress toward smarter and more sustainable healthcare.","[Aquino, Rita Patrizia; Saviano, Marialuisa] Univ Salerno, Dept Pharm, Pharman Interdept Ctr, Via Giovanni Paolo 2,132, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy; [Barile, Sergio] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Management, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Grasso, Antonio] Univ Salerno, Pharman Interdept Ctr, CSI IT Serv Coordinating, Via Giovanni Paolo 2,132, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy",University of Salerno; Sapienza University Rome; University of Salerno,"Saviano, M (通讯作者)，Univ Salerno, Dept Pharm, Pharman Interdept Ctr, Via Giovanni Paolo 2,132, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy.",aquinorp@unisa.it; sergio.barile@uniroma1.it; agrasso@unisa.it; msaviano@unisa.it,"Saviano, Marialuisa/C-8643-2014; Aquino, Rita P/B-4861-2011; Chan, Simmy/AAD-9046-2021","Saviano, Marialuisa/0000-0001-7566-9639; aquino, rita patrizia/0000-0002-9754-4244",,,,,126,64,66,6,41,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,OCT,2018,103.0,,,,SI,,35,50,,10.1016/j.futures.2018.03.002,0.0,,,16,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,GX1MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447481900005,0

More than 59% of the total territory of the Russian Federation is classified as forest land. However, the forest sector contributes only 1.3% to Russian gross domestic product and the Russian forest industry accounts for less than 4% of the world's forest products trade. This paper analyzes the most significant challenges facing Russian forest management including example of wood chips export to the EU and will suggest specific policy proposals that could be made in order to improve the forest management and forest transportation in Russia. Russian forestry has a lot of challenges such as lack of proper forest infrastructure, inadequate forest fire protection, unqualified personnel and unclear legislation. Most of these challenges are linked to one another and solving one problem can lead to the solution of others. The improvement of Russian forest governance is difficult and hard for policy, but without significant changes in current Russian forest management practices, forest degradation in Russia will continue to increase. The degradation of Russian forests could lead to a loss of global resources in general.","[Proskurina, Svetlana; Vakkilainen, Esa] Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Skinnarilankatu 34, Lappeenranta 53850, Finland; [Heinimo, Jussi] Mikkeli Dev Miksei Ltd, Sanunonkatu 12, Mikkeli 50130, Finland",Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT,"Proskurina, S (通讯作者)，Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Skinnarilankatu 34, Lappeenranta 53850, Finland.",svetlana.proskurina@lut.fi,"Vakkilainen, Esa/AAP-7770-2021; Proskurina, Svetlana/AAX-1030-2020","Vakkilainen, Esa/0000-0002-7472-3522; Proskurina, Svetlana/0000-0003-3295-3415",,,,,18,7,8,1,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,OCT,2018,95.0,,,,,,13,17,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.07.001,0.0,,,5,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GT2VC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000444357400003,0

Risk adjustment typically aims to predict annual costs of individuals enrolled in an insurance plan for a full year. However, partial-year enrollment is common and poses a challenge to risk adjustment, since diagnoses are observed with lower probability when an individual is observed for a shorter time. Because of missed diagnoses, risk-adjustment systems will underpay for partial-year enrollees, as compared with full-year enrollees with similar underlying health status and usage patterns. We derive a new adjustment for partial-year enrollment in which payments are scaled up for partial-year enrollees' observed diagnoses, which improves upon existing methods. We simulate the role of missed diagnoses using a sample of commercially insured individuals and the 2014 Marketplace risk-adjustment algorithm and find the expected spending of six-month enrollees is underpredicted by 19 percent. We then examine whether there are systematically different care usage patterns for partial-year enrollees in this data, which can offset or amplify underprediction due to missed diagnoses. Accounting for differential spending patterns of partial-year enrollees does not substantially change the underprediction for six-month enrollees. However, one-month enrollees use systematically less than one-twelfth the care of full-year enrollees, partially offsetting the missed-diagnosis effect.","[Ericson, Keith M.

This paper reassesses whether stated WTA welfare measures can be valid in public and private good contexts. We conduct two sets of laboratory experiments to analyze whether elicitation format, survey design and framing, and follow-up questions can generate truthful responses. For public goods, we adapt the existing WTP incentive compatibility theoretical framework to the WTA context and test the theory using an experiment involving voting. Results are consistent with the WTP literature and suggest that WTA values can be valid as long as responses have consequences for respondents. For the private good experiment, we focus on whether respondents are motivated to affect the price or the provision of the good. We find that strategic behavior is present and in the direction expected by theory. Survey framing and the use of follow-up questions can provide bounds on the value estimates. These findings raise potential concerns with the use of non-incentive compatible elicitation mechanisms in WTA contexts. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of the study is to evaluate the impact of waiting time on the costs and benefits of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for the treatment of severe aortic stenosis. Methods This is a cost-utility analysis from the perspective of the Spanish National Health Service. Results of two prospective hospital registries (158 and 273 consecutive patients) were incorporated into a probabilistic Markov model to compare quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs for TAVR after waiting for 3-12 months, relative to immediate TAVR. We simulated a cohort of 1000 patients, male, and 80 years old; other patient profiles were assessed in sensitivity analyses. Results As waiting time increased, costs decreased at the expense of lower survival and loss of QALYs, leading to incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for eliminating waiting lists of about 12,500 (sic) per QALY. In subgroup analyses prioritization of patients for whom higher benefit was expected led to a smaller loss of QALYs. Concerning budget impact, long waiting lists reduced spending considerably and permanently. Conclusions A shorter waiting time is likely to be cost-effective (considering commonly accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds in Europe) relative to 3 months or longer waiting periods. If waiting lists are nevertheless seen as unavoidable due to severe but temporary budgetary restrictions, prioritizing patients for whom higher benefit is expected appears to be a way of postponing spending without utterly sacrificing patients' survival and quality of life.","[Ribera, Aida; Ferreira-Gonzalez, Ignacio; Cascant, Purificacio] Univ Hosp Vall dHebron, Cardiovasc Clin Epidemiol Unit, Cardiol Dept, CIBERESP, Pg Vall dHebron 119-129, Barcelona 08035, Spain; [Slof, John] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Business, B2,Av Eix Cent S-N, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Ribera, Aida; Ferreira-Gonzalez, Ignacio; Serra, Vicente; Tornos, Pilar; Garcia-Dorado, David] Univ Hosp Vall dHebron, Cardiol Dept CIBERCV, Pg Vall dHebron 119-129, Barcelona 08035, Spain; [Garcia-del Blanco, Bruno; Andrea, Rut; Falces, Carlos] Univ Barcelona, Cardiol Dept, Thorax Inst, Hosp Clin,IDIBAPS, Carrer Villarroel 170, E-08036 Barcelona, Spain; [Gutierrez, Enrique] Univ Complutense, Cardiol Dept, Dept Med, Inst Invest Sanitaria Gregorio Maranon, Calle Dr Esquerdo 46, Madrid 28007, Spain; [del Valle-Fernandez, Raquel; Moris-de laTassa, Cesar] Hosp Univ Cent Asturias, Area Corazon, Unidad Hemodinam & Cardiol Intervencionista, Av Roma, Oviedo 33011, Asturias, Spain; [Mota, Pedro] Hosp Clin Univ, ICICOR, Serv Cardiol, Av Ramon y Cajal 3, Valladolid 47003, Spain; [Francisco Oteo, Juan] Hosp Puerta de Hierro, Serv Cardiol, C Manuel de Falla 1, Madrid 28222, Spain",Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERESP; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron; University of Barcelona; Hospital Clinic de Barcelona; IDIBAPS; Complutense University of Madrid; Central University Hospital Asturias; Hospital Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda,"Ferreira-González, I (通讯作者)，Univ Hosp Vall dHebron, Cardiovasc Clin Epidemiol Unit, Cardiol Dept, CIBERESP, Pg Vall dHebron 119-129, Barcelona 08035, Spain.;Ferreira-González, I (通讯作者)，Univ Hosp Vall dHebron, Cardiol Dept CIBERCV, Pg Vall dHebron 119-129, Barcelona 08035, Spain.",nachoferreira@secardiologia.es,"Ribera, Aida/GPK-8443-2022; Ribera, Aida/ABG-7455-2021; DEL VALLE, RAQUEL/AFM-9143-2022; Andrea Riba, Rut/L-2806-2019; Moris, Cesar/AAG-2018-2020; Gutierrez, Enrique/E-9249-2012; DEL VALLE FERNANDEZ, RAQUEL/GMW-9829-2022","Ribera, Aida/0000-0002-2604-6328; Ribera, Aida/0000-0002-2604-6328; DEL VALLE, RAQUEL/0000-0001-7891-2913; Andrea Riba, Rut/0000-0002-8409-5013; Moris, Cesar/0000-0002-2871-190X; Gutierrez, Enrique/0000-0002-6405-8581; DEL VALLE FERNANDEZ, RAQUEL/0000-0001-7891-2913; Oteo Dominguez, Juan Francisco/0000-0002-2641-4135; Garcia del Blanco, Bruno/0000-0002-4527-1600; Slof, John/0000-0002-0576-8161",Instituto de Investigacion Carlos III (FIS),Instituto de Investigacion Carlos III (FIS),"Financial support for this study was provided in part by a grant from Instituto de Investigacion Carlos III (FIS).

The aim of this study was to develop cross-European recommendations for the identification, measurement and valuation of resource use and lost productivity in economic evaluations using a Delphi procedure. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify European guidelines on the execution of economic evaluations or costing studies as part of economic evaluations. Guideline recommendations were extracted by two independent reviewers and formed the basis for the first round of the Delphi study, which was conducted among European health economic experts. During three written rounds, consensus (agreement of 67% or higher) was sought on items concerning the identification, measurement and valuation of costs. Results Recommendations from 18 guidelines were extracted. Consensus among 26 panellists from 17 European countries was reached on 61 of 68 items. The recommendations from the Delphi study are to adopt a societal perspective, to use patient report for measuring resource use and lost productivity, to value both constructs with use of country-specific standardized/unit costs and to use country-specific discounting rates. Conclusion This study provides consensus-based cross-European recommendations on how to measure and value resource use and lost productivity in economic evaluations. These recommendations are expected to support researchers, healthcare professionals, and policymakers in executing and appraising economic evaluations performed in international contexts.","[van Lier, Lisanne I.; van Hout, Hein P.

In 2009, the tax was modified to a feebate structure but maintained its link to CO2 intensities. Using a panel dataset to exploit the quasi-experimental tax reforms, we estimate that a 1000-NOK (125-USD) tax increment reduces new vehicle sales by 1.06-1.58%. This result yields an elasticity of average CO2 intensity to CO2 price (implied by the tax) of 0.06. With a pass through of the tax to car prices of 88%, the resulting elasticity of average CO2 intensity to average car price is 0.53. Thus, the tax significantly shifts consumers toward lower-emission vehicles.

Methods: Patients with an HCC diagnosis and one or more sorafenib prescription were identified from samples of > 3 million insured persons in each of 2012, 2013 and 2014 using the anonymised Betriebskrankenkasse health insurance scheme database. Incidence rates from 2013 were extrapolated to the German population using data from the statutory health insurance system database and Robert Koch Institute. Resource use and cost data were collected for a subset of patients with follow-up data post-sorafenib. Results: Between 1032 and 1484 patients with HCC in Germany (893-1390 publicly insured patients) were estimated as likely to be eligible for second-line therapy after sorafenib annually. For post-sorafenib analyses, 117 patients were identified with HCC, one or more sorafenib prescription and considered potentially eligible for second-line treatment, 15 of whom were alive after 12 months' follow-up. Total mean costs per patient accrued in the 12 months after sorafenib treatment ended were (sic)11,152 (hospital care, (sic)6483 [58.1%]; outpatient prescriptions, (sic)3137 [28.1%]). Conclusion: The estimated number of publicly insured HCC patients annually eligible for second-line therapy in Germany was < 1400 and mean total costs accrued in the year after completion of sorafenib therapy were approximately (sic)11,000 per patient for the German statutory healthcare system. These estimates can be used when evaluating the budgetary impact of new second-line therapies for advanced HCC in Germany.","[Clouth, Johannes] Lilly Deutschland GmbH, Med Affairs, Werner Reimers Str 2-4, D-61352 Bad Homburg, Germany; [Liepa, Astra M.] Eli Lilly & Co, Lilly Corp Ctr, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA; [Moeser, Guido] Masem Res Inst GmbH, Unter Eichen 5-G, D-65195 Wiesbaden, Germany; [Friedel, Heiko; Bernzen, Magdalena; Garal-Pantaler, Elena] Team Gesundheit GmbH, Rellinghauser Str 93, D-45128 Essen, Germany; [Trojan, Joerg] Univ Klinikum Frankfurt, Med Klin 1, Theodor Stern Kai 7, D-60590 Frankfurt, Germany",Eli Lilly; Lilly Deutschland GmbH; Eli Lilly; Goethe University Frankfurt; Goethe University Frankfurt Hospital,"Clouth, J (通讯作者)，Lilly Deutschland GmbH, Med Affairs, Werner Reimers Str 2-4, D-61352 Bad Homburg, Germany.",johannes.clouth@gmx.de,,"Garal-Pantaler, Elena/0009-0005-5285-6913",Eli Lilly and Company,Eli Lilly and Company(Eli Lilly),"This work was supported by Eli Lilly and Company, who played a role in the design of the study; collection, analysis and interpretation of the data; and preparation, review, and approval of the manuscript.",,26,5,5,0,0,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

I build a rank-order tournament model where high school students decide their level of effort and whether or not to take the college admissions test, considering how those decisions affect their future university admissions chances. Using administrative Chilean data for the 2009 college admissions process, I structurally estimate the parameters of the model. Two affirmative action policies are simulated: (a) SES-quota system, which imposes the population's socioeconomic group (SES) distribution for each university; (b) increasing the weight of high school GPA in the admission final score. These simulations support the claim that affirmative action in college admission may boost the amount of academic effort exerted by high school students. I also find that while increasing the weight of high school GPA is more effective in boosting students' academic effort in high school, the SES-quota system is more efficient in allocating the best students to the best universities.","[Grau, Nicolas] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Diagonal Paraguay 257, Santiago 1504, Chile",Universidad de Chile,"Grau, N (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Diagonal Paraguay 257, Santiago 1504, Chile.",ngrau@fen.uchile.cl,,,Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies [CONICYT/FONDAP/15130009],Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies,"I thank Diego Amador, Sina Ates, Garth Baughman, Flavio Cunha, Hanming Fang, Tzuo Hann Law, Andres Hojman, Daniel Hojman, Zehao Hu, Tomas Rau, Minchul Shin, Petra Todd, Juan Pablo Torres-Martinez and Kenneth I.

They have manufactured doubt by hiring and funding dissenting scientists, by producing and publicizing favorable scientific findings and by generally concealing their involvement in biased research. We propose a new model to study the interplay between scientific uncertainty, firms' miscommunication and public policies. The government is benevolent but populist, and maximizes social welfare as perceived by citizens. The industry can produce costly reports showing that its activity is not harmful. Citizens are unaware of the industry's miscommunication. We first characterize the industry's optimal miscommunication policy. The industry notably ceases miscommunicating abruptly when scientists' belief reaches a critical threshold. We identify a natural condition under which miscommunication is stronger under a tax on emissions than under command and control. We then analyze research funding. A populist government may support research to enable firms to falsely reassure citizens. Establishing an independent research agency helps limit the welfare losses induced by populist policies.

The primary aim is to ascertain if the market valuation of salmon farming companies can be explained by rational factors, or if there is an element of irrational exuberance behind the current all-time high salmon stock prices. In particular, we seek to uncover if a structural break has occurred in the market value formation of salmon stocks. The results suggest that a structural shift has occurred, leading to a stronger association between fundamentals and market valuations after 2012, indicating that at least some of the substantial stock price increase during 2012-2016 can be attributed to fundamental factors.","[Misund, Bard] Univ Stavanger, Business Sch, Kjell Arholmsgate 41, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway; [Nygard, Rune] Univ Coll South East Norway Business Sch, Raveien 215, N-3184 Borre, Norway",Universitetet i Stavanger; University College of Southeast Norway,"Misund, B (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, Business Sch, Kjell Arholmsgate 41, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway.",bard.misund@uis.no; rune.nygard@usn.no,"Misund, Bård/J-8720-2016; Nygard, Rune/KCR-6178-2024","Misund, Bård/0000-0001-7069-5707;",,,,,47,34,34,1,12,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

Integrating the concept of adaptive capacity within an environmental entitlement framework, this study explores whether and how community institutions can enhance the adaptive capacity of socially marginalized groups. Using the case study of a community forestry user group (CFUG) in the middle hills of Nepal, this paper shows that in the context of socio-economic heterogeneity at the wider societal level, it is unrealistic to expect CBA to work successfully for the marginalized groups, unless a concurrent attempt is made to overcome the socio-cultural drivers of marginalization. A key to addressing this is to acknowledge that interactions among different socioeconomic groups in community based institutions vary to different extents. Based on this finding, we recommend that CBA initiatives should focus on addressing the intra-community distribution of vulnerability, and be better aligned with efforts to enhance social inclusion.","[Sapkota, Prativa; Keenan, Rodney J.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Sapkota, Prativa] Resource Identificat & Management Soc, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Ojha, Hemant R.] Inst Studies & Dev Worldwide IFSD, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Sapkota, P (通讯作者)，Baldwin Spencer Bldg 113, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",prativasapkota@gmail.com,,,University of Melbourne; Australia Awards,University of Melbourne(University of Melbourne); Australia Awards,This research was supported by University of Melbourne and Australia Awards.,,72,13,14,1,19,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,JUL,2018,92.0,,,,,,55,64,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.04.001,0.0,,,10,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GJ9UI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000435750000006,0

However, questions remain about the validity of these teacher effect estimates. Leveraging the random assignment of teachers to lasses, I find that teachers have causal effects on their students' self-reported behavior in class, self-efficacy in math, and happiness in class that are similar in magnitude to effects on math test scores. Weak correlations between teacher effects on different student outcomes indicate that these measures capture unique skills that teachers bring to the classroom. Teacher effects calculated in nonexperimental data are related to these same outcomes following random assignment, revealing that they contain important information content on teachers. However, for some nonexperimental teacher effect estimates, large and potentially important degrees of bias remain. These results suggest that researchers and policy makers should proceed with caution when using these measures. They likely are more appropriate for low-stakes decisions-such as matching teachers to professional development-than for high-stakes personnel decisions and accountability.","[Blazar, David] Univ Maryland, Coll Educ, Dept Teaching & Learning Policy & Leadership, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Blazar, D (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Coll Educ, Dept Teaching & Learning Policy & Leadership, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",dblazar@umd.edu,,,"Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education [R305C090023]; Mathematica Policy Research summer fellowship; Smith Richardson Foundation","Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education(US Department of Education); Mathematica Policy Research summer fellowship; Smith Richardson Foundation","I would like to thank Martin West, Thomas Kane, Heather Hill, and anonymous reviewers for their feedback on earlier drafts.

Some pharmaceuticals and many health-related consumer goods are heavily advertised. We explore the economics of the advertising of cigarettesa heavily advertised product which is consumed by 36.5 million adults and which is linked to more than 480,000 deaths each year in the United States. Unlike previous research on cigarette advertising, we distinguish menthol from nonmenthol advertising and we use an individual-level measure of advertising exposure. These data allow us to include rich controls for individual heterogeneity. We exploit quasi-experimental variation in advertising exposure created by sharply different supply-side variation in menthol and nonmenthol advertising. The combination of rich control variables and supply-side variation provides a credible identification strategy that addresses the potential endogeneity of advertising exposure. We find strong evidence that cigarette manufacturers target their menthol advertising at certain demographic groups. Failure to control for targeting yields misleading results. We examine multiple margins of cigarette demand and find little evidence that menthol advertising in magazines expands the size of the cigarette market. Our results contribute to important current public health policy debates about possible Food and Drug Administration regulation of the advertising of menthol cigarettes and similar tobacco products.","[Kenkel, Donald; Mathios, Alan; Wang, Hua] Cornell Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Kenkel, D (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",Dsk10@cornell.edu,,,NIH [1R21DA037408-01],NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),"We gratefully acknowledge support through NIH grant 1R21DA037408-01.

A simulation study,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Adverse selection; Adverse selection spiral; Death spiral; Health insurance; Premium; Premium differentiation; Supplementary insurance,RISK EQUALIZATION; MORAL HAZARD; MARKETS; INFORMATION; DEMAND; MODEL,"Most health insurers in the Netherlands apply community-rating and open enrolment for supplementary health insurance, although it is offered at a free market. Theoretically, this should result in adverse selection. There are four indications that adverse selection indeed has started to occur on the Dutch supplementary insurance market. The goal of this paper is to analyze whether premium differentiation would be able to counteract adverse selection. We do this by simulating the uptake and premium development of supplementary insurance over 25 years using data on healthcare expenses and background characteristics from 110,261 insured. For the simulation of adverse selection, it is assumed that only insured for whom supplementary insurance is expected not to be beneficial will consider opting out of the insurance. Therefore, we calculate for each insured the financial profitability (by making assumptions about the consumer's expected claims and the premium set by the insurer), the individual's risk attitude and the probability to opt out or opt in. The simulation results show that adverse selection might result in a substantial decline in insurance uptake. Additionally, the simulations show that if insurers were to differentiate their premium to 28 age and gender groups, adverse selection could be modestly counteracted. Finally, this paper shows that if insurers would apply highly refined risk-rating, adverse selection for this type of supplementary insurance could be counteracted completely.","[van Winssen, K. P.

First, I analyze new, longitudinal data on students from a large public university in the US. Second, I investigate whether the average attendance effect varies by a student's race, gender and level of preparedness for the course. My results suggest that attending class has a positive and significant effect on exam performance. This effect is robust across specifications. Additionally, I find that the average attendance effect is not uniform across subgroups of students. Males, Non-whites, students who have completed the prerequisite class at another institution, received a lower grade in the prerequisite, taken the prerequisite a while back, or have a lower overall GPA to begin with enjoy higher returns from attending class. The results suggest a role for policies that encourage attendance, preferably through active learning techniques.","[Dey, Ishita] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University,"Dey, I (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",idey@bu.edu,,"Dey, Ishita/0009-0007-5142-5489",,,,,19,16,18,1,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1477-3880,2352-4421,,INT REV ECON EDUC,Int.

Yet there is an unintended and paradoxical energy boomerang effect, or, when decarbonizing the energy supply increases total energy use. This paradoxical outcome presupposes a particular set of social-structural conditions: the imperative to utilize energy to increase economic growth (and, thus, energy throughput) and the use of energy production itself as a capital accumulation strategy. The energy boomerang effect is likely not an outcome of alternative energy development per se, but only of alternative energy development in a particular kind of society. Economic degrowth through the collective ownership of energy systems would provide conditions conducive to containing the energy boomerang effect, or, to better realize the potential environmental gains of alternative energy converters. A degrowth society with a collectively-owned energy system would allow for a reduction in total energy use as well as a lower ratio of fossil fuel energy to alternative energy.","[Gunderson, Ryan] Miami Univ, Dept Sociol & Gerontol, 375 Upham Hall, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; [Stuart, Diana] No Arizona Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Sustainabil, Program Sustainable Communities, Big SBS West BLG 70,Rm 274, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Petersen, Brian] No Arizona Univ, Dept Geog Planning & Recreat, Program Sustainable Communities, Blg SBS West BLG 70,Rm 248, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Yun, Sun-Jin] Seoul Natl Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, 82,1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea",University System of Ohio; Miami University; Northern Arizona University; Northern Arizona University; Seoul National University (SNU),"Gunderson, R (通讯作者)，Miami Univ, Dept Sociol & Gerontol, 375 Upham Hall, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",gunderrm@miamioh.edu,,"Yun, Sun-Jin/0000-0002-0461-0151; Petersen, Brian/0000-0003-4208-441X",Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2017S1A3A2067220],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",The fourth author's contribution was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2017S1A3A2067220).,,104,23,25,3,22,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,MAY,2018,99.0,,,,,,36,44,,10.1016/j.futures.2018.03.016,0.0,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,GH7SV,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000433654600004,0

Health economists have developed a set of highly sophisticated analytical methods for assessing efficiency, but less attention has been paid to formally incorporating equity considerations into analyses. As a result, where equity is considered is often informal, ad hoc and/or simplistic. This paper is a proposal for a mechanism for formally incorporating equity within the decision process. It begins with an overview of the current literature on equity weighting. It then considers the case of a single equity domain and illustrates how this is currently applied in practice by the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. It then proposes a more comprehensive method for considering the multi-attribute equity state, where a population exhibits more than one trait considered worthy of differential weighting. Finally, the paper proposes a mechanism by which this could be applied in practice, and concludes with a discussion of the challenges for applying multi-attribute equity weighting.","[Round, Jeff] Univ Bristol, Sch Social & Community Med, Canynge Hall,39 Whatley Rd, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England; [Paulden, Mike] Univ Alberta, Sch Publ Hlth, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of Bristol; University of Alberta,"Round, J (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Sch Social & Community Med, Canynge Hall,39 Whatley Rd, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England.",jeff.round@bristol.ac.uk,"Paulden, Michael/E-2061-2016","Round, Jeff/0000-0002-3103-6984; Paulden, Mike/0000-0002-0381-5980",,,,,39,21,23,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

As tropical countries undertake REDD + readiness, vital questions arise around the equity of REDD + interventions. In particular, there has been much critique of the impact of REDD + on local forest communities, and whether these interventions serve to entrench or address existing inequalities and the structural causes of poverty. Taking Ghana's REDD + process as a case study, McDermott et al.'s (2013) 'equity framework' is used to systematically examine the contextual, procedural and distributive dimensions of equity, based on fieldwork carried out from July 2014 to March 2016. This study draws on stakeholder perspectives and document analysis to draw conclusions about the equity of Ghana's REDD + process. Our study shows that Ghana's national REDD + strategy, legal texts and documents aim to ensure that all actors, including local forest communities, are considered 'subjects of equity'. However, according to stakeholder perspectives and general forest laws and policies, there are multiple barriers to realizing the intended goals of equity. Firstly, the complex, multiple and unclear tenurial arrangements inhibit distributive equity. Secondly, uneven stakeholder knowledge and capacity hamper effective engagement in decision-maldng and limit procedural equity. Thirdly, contextual factors that are remnants of colonial structures and systems, and that serve competing political and economic interests through resource exploitation impact distributive equity. The 'equity framework' reveals that historical contextual factors impact the achievement of equity through REDD +, even with right government policies and strategies in place.","[Saeed, Abdul-Razak] Univ Reading, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Reading, Berks, England; [McDermott, Constance] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford, England; [Boyd, Emily] Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies, Lund, Sweden",University of Reading; University of Oxford; Lund University,"Saeed, AR (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Reading, Berks, England.",abdul-razak.saeed@pgr.reading.ac.uk; constance.mcdermott@ouce.ox.ac.uk; emily.boyd@lucsus.lu.se,,"McDermott, Constance/0000-0002-5238-0936; Saeed, Abdul-Razak/0000-0003-0952-2166","Commonwealth Scholarship Commission, UK [GHCS-2013-116]","Commonwealth Scholarship Commission, UK","This research was supported by the Commonwealth Scholarship CommissionGHCS-2013-116, UK, as part of a doctoral research.",,64,17,17,2,20,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,MAY,2018,90.0,,,,,,48,58,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.01.006,0.0,,,11,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GD8MK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430766300007,0

A spreadsheet model was created, allowing for a quantitative estimation of GHG emissions and operational energy use for the built environment. Building on previous qualitative descriptions of four future scenarios, the model was run to investigate what reaching the target would require in each scenario. The results can inform policy discussions and provide insights on what strategies appear to be significant, and what they entail in terms of operational energy use in 2050 and cumulated embodied emissions from investments prior to 2050. It thus appears particularly important to decarbonate the energy mix and reduce floor areas through space sharing and optimization. When emission factors for heat and electricity are very low, the climate impact of construction materials becomes an important issue, on par with operational energy use, and strategies aimed at improving construction processes or avoiding new construction gain relevance. Extensive renovation for energy efficiency exhibits in this case a tradeoff between embodied emissions from prior investments and energy use, as decreasing one means increasing the other.","[Francart, Nicolas; Malmqvist, Tove; Hagbert, Pernilla] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Kungliga Tekn Hgsk, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology,"Francart, N (通讯作者)，KTH Royal Inst Technol, Kungliga Tekn Hgsk, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",francart@kth.se; tove.malmqvist@abe.kth.se; perniila.hagbert@abe.kth.se,"Francart, Nicolas/Z-4766-2019; Hagbert, Pernilla/AAQ-5561-2021","Francart, Nicolas/0000-0001-8415-7168; Hagbert, Pernilla/0000-0001-8208-820X",Swedish Funding Agency Formas [259-2013-1842],Swedish Funding Agency Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas),Financial support from the Swedish Funding Agency Formas (259-2013-1842) is gratefully acknowledged.,,58,13,13,0,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,APR,2018,98.0,,,,,,1,18,,10.1016/j.futures.2017.12.001,0.0,,,18,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,GD8TL,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430784900001,0

High-school education was split into two phases which resulted in reduced tracking, extended general curriculum for students attending vocational training, and an attachment of a vocational context to general high-school programs. Exploiting the rules on elementary school entry and timing of the reform, we use a regression discontinuity design and pooled Labor Force Surveys 2000-2012 to analyze the effect of the reform on educational attainment and labor market outcomes. We observe heterogeneity of the effects of the reform across gender, as for males we fmd that the probability of completing high school as well as the probability of completing university education decreased, while for females we do not observe any adverse effects. We explain this heterogeneity via different selection into schooling for males and females. The reform did not positively affect individuals' labor market prospects; therefore, we conclude that the observed general-vocational wage differential is mainly driven by self-selection into the type of high school.","[Zilic, Ivan] Inst Econ, Zagreb, Croatia; [Zilic, Ivan] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Linz, Austria",University of Zagreb; Institute of Economics Zagreb (EIZ); Johannes Kepler University Linz,"Zilic, I (通讯作者)，Inst Econ, Zagreb, Croatia.;Zilic, I (通讯作者)，Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Linz, Austria.",izilic@eizg.hr,,,CERGE-EI Foundation under Global Development Network,CERGE-EI Foundation under Global Development Network,"I thank Rudolf Winter-Ebmer for numerous comments and guidance.

Using time-use surveys for the 2007-10 period, this study finds a uniform pattern across the four countries regarding the main individual-level variables related to the allocation of unpaid work. When decomposing the gender gap in hours devoted to unpaid work, most of the difference cannot be attributed to variations in observable characteristics of men and women: the unexplained part of the gap is the dominant part. Results suggest that both the strength of traditional gender roles and existing welfare architecture are relevant factors in understanding variations in how unpaid work is distributed between men and women in these four countries. The results reaffirm that powerful interventions are needed to shift gender norms about unpaid work.","[Amarante, Veronica] Econ Commiss Latin Amer ECLAC, Montevideo Off, Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Rossel, Cecilia] Catholic Univ Uruguay, Dept Social & Polit Sci, 8 Octubre 2738 Piso 4 Oficina 422, Montevideo 11200, Montevideo, Uruguay",Universidad Catolica del Uruguay,"Amarante, V (通讯作者)，Econ Commiss Latin Amer ECLAC, Montevideo Off, Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay.",vamarante@cepal.org; cecilia.rossel@ucu.edu.uy,"Rossel, Cecilia/AAJ-6641-2020","Rossel, Cecilia/0000-0003-2452-4522",,,,,89,30,30,3,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

There have been a number of efforts to examine the effects of such programs on student outcomes. Many of these fail to acknowledge the possibility of self-selection bias. Should such endogeneity exist, estimates regarding the extent to which help centers improve student performance will be biased. We examine the determinants of student participation in peer tutoring among students taking Principles of Economics, and we test for self-selection bias. Finally, we examine the factors that affect student performance in these classes over two semesters - approximately 1400 students.

A carbon-emitting exhaustible resource competes with a dirtier abundant resource and a clean backstop. A time-dependent carbon tax is set to optimally use these resources under a cap constraint over CO2 atmospheric concentration. As the cap is tightened, the dirtier resource becomes less competitive compared to the exhaustible resource (the competition effect), but the timing and duration of extraction of the exhaustible resource is modified (the timing effect). We provide analytical expressions of these effects, and determine conditions over size of reserves, pollution contents, extraction costs and demand elasticity such that the exhaustible-resource owners' profits increase as the ceiling is tightened. Calibrations for the transport and power sectors suggest that the profits of conventional-oil and natural-gas owners increase compared to a baseline without regulation for plausible carbon-ceiling values.

We rank the regions according to the technical efficiency index, determine the degree of their homogeneity and differentiation, reveal leading and outsider regions by the degree of efficiency of financial resources use in regional innovation systems. It is determined that the share of the leading regions makes 25% and the share of inefficient regions makes 53%.

By combining intrinsic job quality with job insecurity and pay the study maps out multiple potential pathways through which work may affect health and well-being. Levering longitudinal data and external information on early retirement ages allows for accounting of unobserved heterogeneity, selection bias and reverse causality. The empirical findings suggest that inequities in health correlate with inequities in job quality, though a substantial fraction of these associations reflect time-constant unobserved heterogeneity. Still, there is evidence for genuine protective effects of better jobs on musculoskeletal disorders, mental health and general health. The effect could contribute to a substantial number of avoidable disorders among older workers, despite relatively modest effect sizes at the level of individuals. Mental health, in particular, responds to changes in job quality. Selection bias such as the healthy worker effect does not alter the results. But the influence of job quality on health may be transitional among older workers. An in-depth analysis of health dynamics reveals no evidence for persistence.","[Henseke, Golo] UCL Inst Educ, London, England",University of London; University College London; UCL Institute of Education,"Henseke, G (通讯作者)，UCL Inst Educ, London, England.",g.henseke@ucl.ac.uk,"Henseke, Golo/AAP-2603-2020","Henseke, Golo/0000-0003-0669-2100","European Commission [QLK6-CT-2001-00360, RII-CT-2006-062193, CIT5-CT-2005-028857, CIT4-CT-2006-028812, 211909, 227822, 261982]; U.S. National Institute on Aging [U01 AG09740-13S2, P01 AG005842, P01 AG08291, P30 AG12815, R21 AG025169, Y1-AG-4553-01, IAG BSR06-11, OGHA 04-064]; German Ministry of Education and Research; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J019135/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/J019135/1] Funding Source: UKRI",European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); U.S. National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); German Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"I am indebted to Francis Green, Abi Palmer, Stefanie Gundert and discussants at the 36th annual IWPLMS conference and the 2015 WPEG conference for their invaluable inputs to an earlier version of the paper.

The paper provides an analysis of primary and secondary literature on TSD chapters and examines two cases based on the specific EU and US experiences. The major question is whether the EU should follow the US approach in order to strengthen the enforcement mechanism of its TSD chapters. As the case of dispute between US and Guatemala shows, the sanction-based approach has not proved as an adequate tool to address non-compliance with labour and environmental standards. On the contrary, cooperation between parties along with capacity building seems as a more relevant approach when it comes to compliance with international standards. This article argues that main challenges for enforcement of TSD chapters are related to strengthening of civil society participation, cooperation between the Parties and monitoring implementation.","[Hradilova, Katerina] Minist Ind & Trade Czech Republ, Dept Trade Policy & Int Econ Org, Prague, Czech Republic; [Hradilova, Katerina] Palacky Univ Olomouc, Dept Dev & Environm Studies, Olomouc, Czech Republic; [Svoboda, Ondrej] Minist Ind & Trade Czech Republ, Dept European & Int Law, Prague, Czech Republic; [Svoboda, Ondrej] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Law, Int law, Prague, Czech Republic",Palacky University Olomouc; Charles University Prague,"Hradilová, K (通讯作者)，Minist Ind & Trade Czech Republ, Dept Trade Policy & Int Econ Org, Prague, Czech Republic.;Hradilová, K (通讯作者)，Palacky Univ Olomouc, Dept Dev & Environm Studies, Olomouc, Czech Republic.",hradilova@mpo.cz; svoboda@mpo.cz,"Svoboda, Ondrej/K-9892-2017","Svoboda, Ondrej/0000-0002-3856-312X",Charles University,Charles University,"Serves as an officer at the Department of European and International Law of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic and teaches public international law at the Faculty of Law of Charles University in Prague as a PhD candidate.

Welcoming and friendly atmosphere to tourists was indicative of a safe and a secured destination for tourists. The display of globalization showed in the form of `glocalization' in this destination. There is a conflict between land use for agricultural purposes and tourist facilities since the predominant cash crop in this area is oil palm, hence a threat to agricultural sustainability. It is recommended that the security agents should as a matter of urgency put in place the appropriate structures in this tourist destination and farming area for safety.","[Imbeah, Nicholas] Szent Istvan Univ, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Godollo, Hungary",Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences,"Imbeah, N (通讯作者)，SZIE Hostel, Pater Karoly 1, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary.",nicholas.imbeah@tpoly.edu.gh,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,Warsaw Univ Life Sciences Pr,Warsaw,"Nowoursynowska 166, Warsaw, POLAND",,,978-83-7583-803-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,335,339,,10.22630/ESARE.2018.2.45,0.0,,,5,Development Studies; Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Geography,BO1TO,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000502418600045,0

In Kenya, Croton megalocarpus (Croton) is a prolific and widely distributed tree with such potential being currently underutilized. In support of scaling up the promising Croton value chain in Kenya, a choice experiment was designed and conducted as part of a survey with 200 rural households in four counties in the Central region of the country. The objective was to assess household preferences in planting and cultivating Croton trees for collection and selling of seeds to a growing market. Attributes for the choice model production system included seedling cost, oilseed yield, tree maturation period, labour for seed collection, and seed selling price. Results show that almost all households have Croton trees on their land and are willing to produce Croton seeds, although dear tradeoffs among the attributes exist. Seed price is the most dominant single attribute cutting across all socio-demographic characteristics. Time and labour constraints were significant for some households: farmers are more averse to longer maturation periods than non-farmers, while those already collecting seeds for the nascent industry are less concerned about the opportunity costs of time and labour than non-collectors. The results provide guidance for the development of a Croton value chain which can have positive impacts on rural livelihoods in East Africa.","[Jacobson, Michael; Shr, Yau-Huo] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Dalemans, Floris] Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; [Magaju, Christine; Ciannella, Rodrigo] World Agroforesuy Ctr, Nairobi, Kenya",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; KU Leuven,"Jacobson, M (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",mgj2@psu.edu,"Shr, Jimmy/JCO-6319-2023","Shr, Jimmy/0000-0001-6519-5396; Dalemans, Floris/0000-0002-5944-9254","World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF); International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), through the Programme for the Development of Alternative Biofuel Crops","World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF); International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), through the Programme for the Development of Alternative Biofuel Crops","This work was supported by the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF), and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), through the Programme for the Development of Alternative Biofuel Crops.",,51,8,8,3,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,JAN,2018,86.0,,,,,,76,85,,10.1016/j.forpol.2017.09.015,0.0,,,10,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,FR9VD,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000419420300008,0

Although many controllable factors would trigger consumer emotion, previous studies mainly focused on the external factors such as product attributes, store environment, and the relationship between consumption emotion and satisfaction caused by external factors. In addition, there is some discussions about the relationship between consumer emotion and user engagement behavior. Based on this, this paper has combed the relevant literature on consumer emotion and mobile social network in detail.

We document substantial variations in firms' capital structure adjustments across countries and, particularly, over time. Consistent with adjustment costs impeding firms from rebalancing their capital structures, worse market imperfections are associated with slower speeds of adjustment (SOA) and larger leverage deviations. Intertemporally, capital structure adjustment is procyclical, with SOA increasing by 0.9 percentage point for a one-percentage-point increase in GDP growth rate. The procyclicality is attributable to good macroeconomic conditions mitigating market imperfections through channels of 1) facilitating free-ride restructuring and 2) uncertainty alleviation.
