However, these initiatives cater to a small percentage of highly innovative automotive suppliers and exclude much of the traditional manufacturing base. This stands in contrast to automotive clusters in Detroit, MI; the West Midlands, United Kingdom; and Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany, where applied research collaborations target the entire supply chain. With respect to policy implications, we argue that new forms of industrial coordination emerging in competitor regions may offer critical policy lessons for Ontario on how to stem the erosion of innovation capabilities in its automotive supply base.","[Goracinova, Elena; Warrian, Peter; Wolfe, David A.] Univ Toronto, Munk Sch Global Affairs, Innovat Policy Lab, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto,"Goracinova, E (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Munk Sch Global Affairs, Innovat Policy Lab, Toronto, ON, Canada.",,"Wolfe, David A/A-9383-2008",,,,,,47,3,4,0,7,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

A crucial issue for the success of the ASEAN economic community (AEC) process,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING MARKETS,,,English,Article,,,,,,ASEAN; Convergence; Integration process,GROWTH; INCOME,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to scrutinize the economic development of ASEAN countries during the period 2000-2014 (after the crisis) with the aim of detecting the convergence and divergence of trends over this period and of providing a framework that could be used for subsequent studies in the future. Design/methodology/approach - Based on the models developed by Solow (1956) and Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1991), the authors estimate absolute and conditional beta-convergence through OLS, pooled OLS and pooled OLS with time period effect. The absolute beta-convergence can be modelled by the relationship between the log of the compound annual growth rate of GDP per capita (GDPC) (or per worker) and the initial level of GDPC (or per worker). The conditional beta-convergence is modelled by the same relationship, supplemented by other factors potentially affecting the growth. Findings - The findings indicate an average annual rate of s-convergence per annum of approximately 1 per cent, and of 0.4-0.6 per cent for beta-convergence, over the period 2000-2014. Compared to other macro-regions (e.g. the European Union), these rates of convergence among ASEAN countries are relatively low. Social implications - The ASEAN roadmap should address two interlinked challenges: the first one is to achieve coordination of the macroeconomic, institutional, legal and social policies within the area. The second one is to address the specific microeconomic drivers of each member state to achieve increased sustainable development. Originality/value - This paper identifies the contradictory results found in previous studies on ASEAN convergence and attempts to clearly determine the optimal sample, sample time period and estimation approaches to obtain sound results regarding convergence processes.","[Gugler, Philippe; Vanoli, Laura] Univ Fribourg, Ctr Competitiveness, Fribourg, Switzerland",University of Fribourg,"Gugler, P (通讯作者)，Univ Fribourg, Ctr Competitiveness, Fribourg, Switzerland.",phg88213@gmail.com,"gugler, Philippe/GYU-2243-2022",,,,,,35,6,6,0,4,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Drawing on ethics of care and theories of societal post-materialism, we develop a set of hypotheses predicting patterns of value creation across gender and countries. Using a sample of 15,141 entrepreneurs in 48 countries from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, we find that gender and cultural values of post-materialism significantly impact the kinds of value creation emphasized by entrepreneurs. Specifically, women entrepreneurs are more likely than men to emphasize social value goals over economic value creation goals. Individuals who start ventures in strong post-materialist societies are more likely to have social and environmental value creation goals and less likely to have economic value creation goals. Furthermore, as levels of post-materialism rise among societies, the relationship between value creation goals and gender changes, intensifying both the negative effect of being female on economic value goals and the positive effect on social value goals. In other words, post-materialism further widens the gender gap in value creation goals.","[Hechavarria, Diana M.] Univ S Florida, Coll Business, Ctr Entrepreneurship, 4202 E Fowler Ave, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Terjesen, Siri A.] Amer Univ, Dept Management, Washington, DC 20008 USA; [Terjesen, Siri A.] Norwegian Sch Econ, Bergen, Norway; [Ingram, Amy E.] Clemson Univ, Coll Business & Behav Sci, 139 Sirrine Hall, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Renko, Maija] Univ Illinois, Managerial Studies, MC 243,Univ Hall 2211,601 South Morgan St, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Justo, Rachida] IE Business Sch, Maria de Molina 11, Madrid 28006, Spain; [Elam, Amanda] Babson Coll, Ctr Womens Entrepreneurial Leadership, Wellesley, MA USA; [Elam, Amanda] North Carolina State Univ, Poole Coll Management, Management Innovat & Entrepreneurship Dept, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; American University; Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); Clemson University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; IE University; Babson College; North Carolina State University,"Terjesen, SA (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, Dept Management, Washington, DC 20008 USA.",dianah@usf.edu; terjesen@american.edu; amyi@clemson.edu; maija@uic.edu; rachida.justo@ie.edu; aelam@babson.edu,"Renko, Maija/X-4691-2019; Elam, Amanda/JBI-6669-2023; Justo, Rachida/M-1128-2016","Renko, Maija/0000-0003-4669-6122; Elam, Amanda/0000-0003-2248-3560; Justo, Rachida/0000-0003-2393-2786; Ingram, Amy/0000-0003-2470-4603; Hechavarria, Diana/0000-0002-3819-8206",,,,,156,125,141,8,188,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

In an experiment, it was found that while highly readable disclosures facilitate more accurate information processing for those with prior financial education, such disclosures might actually inhibit accurate processing for those without prior financial education.

We analyse nutritional outcomes within and across urban wage employees, rural households with small herds, and pastoralists with large herds. Food self-provisioning significantly affects dietary quality and quantity. Farming food crops improves the nutrient intake. In contrast, animal husbandry increases the intake of calories and nutrients from animal sources, while it decreases the intake of carbohydrates and nutrients from vegetal sources. This finding suggests household-specific market failures due to remoteness exist. Last, exposure to a weather shock does not affect households' calorie intake.","[Lehmann-Uschner, Katharina; Kraehnert, Kati] German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Kraehnert, K (通讯作者)，German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",kkraehnert@diw.de,,"Lehmann-Uschner, Katharina/0000-0001-8504-0930; Kraehnert, Kati/0000-0001-7319-9581",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01LA1126A],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This work was supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; [01LA1126A].,,37,3,4,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Using static simulation methods I find that minimum wage target efficiency is currently close to its 25-year peak-of the total monetary benefits generated by a 12% increase in the federal minimum wage, 16.8% would flow to workers in poverty. This exceeds the least target efficient year over this period by 4.7 percentage points and is only 0.6 percentage points below the peak. Furthermore, I find a very strong positive relationship between minimum wage target efficiency and the real federal minimum wage. The implication is that, from an efficiency standpoint, a good time to raise the minimum wage is when it is already high. This discovery raises the possibility that the minimum wage increases the employment of low-skilled poor individuals relative to the employment of low-skilled non-poor individuals. Moreover, this discovery may bolster the rationale for an indexed minimum wage whereby it is prevented from falling to less efficient levels.","[Lundstrom, Samuel M.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Lundstrom, SM (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",slundstr@uci.edu,,,"University of California, Irvine","University of California, Irvine(University of California System)","I am grateful to David Neumark, Marianne Bitler, Damon Clark, and Greg Duncan for helpful comments on this project.

After a detailed exposition of the scholastic theory of value, price and commutative justice, the author identifies four main subjective-value-based objections to the concept of a just price and settles them one after another. These objections are 1) an apparent self-contradiction consisting in stating a subjective nature of utility and, at the same time, equality of value in exchange; 2) how can a voluntary exchange be unjust; 3) how can a just price be found in an isolated exchange of a unique good; 4) a missing satisfactory definition of a just price. The author suggests to settle the first objection by identifying the ontological status of the objective value. Leaning on a distinction of an objective value in use (virtuositas) and subjective desirability (complacibilitas) made by Saint Bernardino of Sienna and Saint Antonino of Florence, the author asserts that while complacibilitas is a potentiality of subjective desirability resting in an individual, virtuositas is a potentiality of usefulness resting in a thing. On account of this, a following solution is suggested: a particular usefulness is not purely subjective because it does not depend on a subjective perception of an individual; it is a metaphysical accident of a thing, not a metaphysical accident of an individual; a particular usefulness is not purely objective, either, because it is a relation to an individua; thus, equality in exchange means equality of potentiality of usefulness which is not a particular usefulness but a set of all usefulnesses concealed in the potentiality of the thing, even though they have not yet been actuated. The author suggests to settle the second objection by providing a logical proof for the assertion that an exchange in which one party suffers an unjust price is not a voluntary exchange and, on the grounds of this, the author demonstrates that an unjust exchange cannot be a voluntary exchange. Finally, the author suggests a definition of a just price which is applicable to any exchange, whether a competitive price exists or not.","[Maslo, Lukas] Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Maslo, L (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,2,INTL INST SOCIAL & ECONOMIC SCI,PRAGUE,"TREBESOVSKA 2038/14, PRAGUE, 193 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87927-32-8,,,,2017,,,,,,,215,233,,10.20472/EFC.2017.007.013,0.0,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6MP,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426854900013,0

The purpose of this paper is to investigate consumer ethnocentrism, its antecedents and consequences in a developing country (South Africa) and makes recommendations to firms wishing to do business in South Africa. Design/methodology/approach - The study was conducted among a national sample of South African respondents using a structured questionnaire. The study is unique in that two samples were used, a sample of white and a sample of black respondents. By using two ethnically diverse samples, it was possible to investigate whether there are similarities and/or differences in terms of consumer ethnocentrism, its antecedents and consequences among two major ethnic groups in South Africa. Findings - The findings suggest that the antecedents of cultural openness, patriotism, individualism and a history of oppression influence consumer ethnocentrism among both black and white South Africans. It was further established that the antecedent nationalism exerts an influence on consumer ethnocentrism among white South African consumers, but not among black South African consumers. Practical implications - The results of the study are of value for South African firms as well as those further afield, when developing marketing strategies for the diverse consumer market in South Africa. Originality/value - This study adds to the existing body of knowledge on consumer ethnocentrism in an emerging market, and more specifically, among different ethnic groups in the same country.","[Pentz, Chris; Terblanche, Nic; Boshoff, Christo] Stellenbosch Univ, Business Management, Stellenbosch, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Pentz, C (通讯作者)，Stellenbosch Univ, Business Management, Stellenbosch, South Africa.",cdpentz@sun.ac.za,"Terblanche, Nic/JXL-7749-2024","Terblanche, Nic/0000-0002-8526-1562; Pentz, Chris/0000-0002-0194-9619; Boshoff, Christo/0000-0002-8340-2034",,,,,57,25,30,2,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Most researchers agree on the need of designing comprehensive mitigation strategies instead of applying isolated measures. Nevertheless, it is important to understand the specific impact and scope of each measure to look for the most effective synergies among them. In 2004, the Madrid City Council launched a plan to re-design its inner ring-road to move traffic out of the city centre. For safety reasons the planned speed limit for the full-renovated South-West section was finally reduced from 90 km/h to 70 km/h. Besides contributing to traffic safety, this strategy could also be seen as positive to the environment due to the associated reduced fuel consumption and lower emissions. However, lower speed limits have lower rates of community acceptance due to its impact on average travel times at the individual level. This paper conducts an ex-post evaluation of this speed reduction strategy to explore its environmental and traffic performance impacts. The results support the thesis that, in this velocity range, lower speed limits present important opportunities for reducing GHG and air pollution in the section affected by the measure, without substantially altering traffic performance. The implementation of the new speed limit policy produces a 14.4% and 16.4% reduction in CO2 and NOx emissions respectively, while global travel time remains virtually constant and the saturation rate decreases slightly. Besides, this cost-effective measure reveals great potential to reduce air pollution in highly populated urban areas located next to urban highways. This work provides local policy makers and city managers with useful insights regarding potential co-benefits of traffic optimization and speed reduction management to reduce mobile source emissions in urban environments.

In venture capital industry, decision to invest in a new venture has emerged as a proactive measure where certain factors are directly or indirectly involved in the investment process. This study aims to determine the factors of venture capital investment process that may influence the multi-criteria investment process of venture capitalists. Firstly, we used the exploratory factor analysis to identify and analyze the consistency of several factors that may facilitate the adoption of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques in an Indian venture capital industry. Secondly, fuzzy analytical hierarchal process (FAHP), a most suited technique for MCDM to handle the fuzziness, vagueness and multi-dimensionality, was adopted to assign the weights and prioritize the pre-defined criteria and sub-criteria. These findings indicate that venture capitalists' investment decision does not emphasize solely on entrepreneurial activities, product and market; however economic and regulatory environment also plays a significant role in the venture capitalists' investment decision-making process. The priority weight of the factors such as entrepreneur's characteristics, economic environment, product and financial constraints facilitates the relative importance of the pre-defined factors. Based on these criteria, entrepreneurs may recognize their strengths in respective criteria before approaching a right venture.","[Sharma, Anil Kumar; Dhochak, Monika] Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Roorkee, Uttar Pradesh, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Roorkee,"Sharma, AK (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Roorkee, Uttar Pradesh, India.",,"Sharma, Anil/AAV-4650-2020","Sharma, Anil/0000-0001-9809-4700",,,,,42,1,1,0,2,GLOBAL ACAD-INDUSTRIAL COOPERATION SOC-GAICS,MONTGOMERY,"C/O DR DAVID ANG, DEPT INFORMATION SYST, AUBURN UNIV MONTGOMERY, 7071 SENATORS DR, MONTGOMERY, AL 36117 USA",2518-0789,,,P INT CONF BUS INTER,,,2017,1.0,,,,,,103,120,,,,,,18,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6LT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426818700009,0

Two hypotheses will be addressed by the contribution: H1 - agricultural enterprises use the management information systems (MIS) software to support their decision making processes. This hypothesis expects the MIS usage in 35 % of agricultural enterprises. H2 - supposes the data model design according to user requirements. Based on a survey between agricultural enterprises and enterprises not focused on agricultural production, the proportion on MIS usage for data and information processing was found. The results of the survey will be analytically processed and compared to the results of survey in non- agricultural businesses performed by Vorisek (2015). Long-term investigations and connection with practice enables authors to propose the data model structure of farm management information system supporting the competitiveness of the agricultural enterprise. The situation in agricultural enterprises is very specific. Data stored in databases are used in decision making processes only occasionally. Hypothesis H1 was not filled, MIS are used only in 10 % of agricultural enterprises. The proposed data model integrates data from all activities of the agricultural business and enables further utilization of these data for increasing company competitiveness. The level of data, information and knowledge utilization in agricultural enterprises is currently very low. It is affected by the fact that the group of suppliers and customers is smaller than in other sectors and therefore the supply-demand chain is closed. The situation is also strongly influenced by the current possibilities for further processing and utilization of data and information already stored in the enterprise data sources.","[Silerova, Edita; Vanek, Jiri; Stoces, Michal; Michalek, Robert] CULS Prague, Dept Informat Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Prague, Czech Republic; [Hennyeyova, Klara] Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Informat, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia; [Pechrova, Marie] Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; Institute of Agricultural Economics & Information - Czech Republic,"Silerová, E (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Dept Informat Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Prague, Czech Republic.",silerova@pef.czu.cz; klara.hennyeyova@uniag.sk; vanek@pef.czu.cz; stoces@pef.czu.cz; pechrova.marie@uzei.cz,"Stočes, Michal/A-6126-2017; Pechrová, Marie Šimpachová/X-8982-2018; Vanek, Jiri/H-5280-2018","Stočes, Michal/0000-0001-7128-1071; Silerova, Edita/0000-0001-7289-4961; Vanek, Jiri/0000-0002-4573-5348",Internal Grant Agency [20161018],Internal Grant Agency,The knowledge and data presented in the present paper were obtained as a result of the Grant No. 20161018 of the Internal Grant Agency titled SW licences and economy impact in enterprise.,,10,1,1,0,6,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2787-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2017,,,,,,,396,403,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BJ1CL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417392400054,0

The Romanian legislation regarding the definition and classification of tourist resorts is not clear and complete. A proper and single terminology would be useful when adopted by businesses, professional organizations and federations in tourism, as well as by the ministries concerned. At present, Romania has a significant number of 100 certified tourist resorts, out of which 43 of national interest and 57 of local interest (plus other three smaller resorts that have received only the status of the spa). The most numerous are the mountain resorts (53), followed by hill and plateau resorts (28), seaside resorts (12) and plain resorts (10). Romania has a high climatic and balneological potential, proven by the existence of 59 spa and climatic resorts, 37 climatic resorts, and 6 spas. In addition, these resorts have rest and leisure functions, offering the possibility of practicing various forms of tourism. Since 2003, the State, through the Ministry of Tourism and favorable legislation, has involved more and more in programs of national interest to develop winter sports tourism, seaside or spa tourism, allocating sums to rehabilitate and revive many declining resorts. The 40 tourist resorts certified in the period 2003-2017 have had the opportunity to attract non-reimbursable financing to develop tourism infrastructure and promote themselves as tourist destinations; because most of them are small localities, tourism would contribute significantly to the welfare of local communities. This study is based on researching the bibliographic sources, the normative and legislative acts in the field, and a good knowledge of Romanian tourist resorts. This paper contributes scientifically through an appropriate definition of the tourist resort, the history of tourist resort certification and the certification criteria under the legislation in effect, a complete and up-to-date list of the certified tourist resorts in Romania, as well as a complex and combined classification of Romanian tourist resorts.","[Simoni, Smaranda] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 Piata Romana, Bucharest 010374, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Simoni, S (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 Piata Romana, Bucharest 010374, Romania.",tsmaranda@yahoo.com,"Toma, Smaranda Simoni/K-6658-2018",,,,,,13,0,0,0,1,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-269-9,STRATEGICA,,,2017,,,,,,,511,522,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0ZU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431586800039,0

The problem is that current widely applied sourcing models do not include improvement of livelihood of the producers/farmers. The present article explores the applicability of a sustainable smallholder sourcing model with a list of critical success factors, in which business objectives and corporate social responsibility perspectives are combined. To this end, the black soybean supply chain in Java/Indonesia is studied. It was found that the black soybean case can be conceptualized by the sourcing model. Most of the critical success factors were present, but also some differences were identified. The differences enable to fine-tune some critical success factors. The sustainable sourcing model can help in (re-) designing sourcing strategies to secure sustainable and more equitable supply from small-scale farmers from a business perspective.","[Sjauw-Koen-Fa, August R.; Blok, Vincent; Omta, Onno] Wageningen Univ, Sch Social Sci, Management Studies Grp, Hollandseweg 1,POB 8130, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Sjauw-Koen-Fa, AR (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Sch Social Sci, Management Studies Grp, Hollandseweg 1,POB 8130, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands.",august.sjauw-koen-fa@wur.nl,"Blok, Vincent/E-6210-2013","Blok, Vincent/0000-0002-9086-4544",,,,,53,7,7,0,15,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Megatrends are major, transformative forces that affect the global future. They have a far-reaching impact on economies, industries, societies and individuals. Today's world is in constant motion and goods, capital and labor are moving globally at a faster pace than ever, with overall energy-related issues becoming increasingly important for societies and states. Economic power is continuing to shift eastwards and it is thus of considerable interest to study energy security in the broader area of the Eastern Mediterranean and its effect on the national security of the countries located in the region. Research needs to examine whether energy security is a threat to the national security of such countries and/or an opportunity for them. In this study, the theory of economic nationalism is employed for the analysis as it emphasizes the primary importance of the state and national security, whereas realism is essentially a political ideology and mercantilism is an economic one.","[Sklias, Pantelis; Flouros, Floros] Univ Peloponnese, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Corinth, Greece; [Roukanas, Spyros] Univ Piraeus, Dept Int & European Studies, Piraeus, Greece",University of Peloponnese; University of Piraeus,"Sklias, P (通讯作者)，Univ Peloponnese, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Corinth, Greece.",pantelis@uop.gr; sroukana@unipi.gr; floros.flouros@ntualumni.org.uk,"FLOUROS, FLOROS/GSN-2716-2022; Roukanas, Spyros/V-9972-2019","FLOUROS, FLOROS/0000-0002-9389-7448; Roukanas, Spyros/0000-0001-9706-266X",University of Piraeus Research Center,University of Piraeus Research Center,The publication of this paper has been supported in part by the University of Piraeus Research Center.,,48,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-50164-2; 978-3-319-50163-5,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,6.0,,,,,,149,166,,10.1007/978-3-319-50164-2_8,0.0,,,18,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM4WA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000464091900008,0

In Latvia, this is evidenced by the growing number of companies that are participating in crowdfunding campaigns and by the government activities that are supporting this. One of the success factors of crowdfunding campaigns is the use of social media networks. The most used social media network by companies in Latvia is Facebook. Hence, it is essential to determine the differences in communication on Facebook among successful and unsuccessful crowdfunding campaigns. The aim of this paper is to conduct Facebook account analysis of all the Kickstarter crowdfunding campaigns that were published in 2015 in technology category, to determine what kind of Facebook metrics should campaigns attain to raise the possibility that their crowdfunding campaigns will be successful. To achieve the aim of the paper several research methods were applied: 1. Theoretical literature analysis to determine with Facebook metrics should be analysed; 2. Secondary data research method was applied to: a. Collect Kickstarter technology category campaign data; b. Collect data from Kickstarter campaign Facebook accounts. Statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) was used to analyse collected data. SPSS was applied for following analysis methods: 1. Correlation analysis; 2. Analysis of variance. The results of the paper were: 1. The main metrics that can indicate if crowdfunding campaign will reach its goal and be successful or not were determined; 2. Recommendations that can increase the crowdfunding campaign being successful were proposed. In practice, this paper can be used as an informational material while developing marketing strategy for crowdfunding campaigns.

Our approach consists of the estimation of the speed of real (i.e. GDP per capita) convergence and fiscal (i.e. ratio of government fiscal revenue to GDP) convergence. To compute it, we use dynamic panel data models of beta-convergence concept. We use Bayesian Shrinkage estimator and Iterative Bayesian procedure, which permit to consider countries' heterogeneity and estimate the rates of real and fiscal convergence for each country in the sample. A positive linkage between fiscal and real convergence is revealed in Croatia, Slovenia and Spain, having ones of the highest rates of fiscal convergence as well as real convergence: high rate of fiscal convergence is associated with high rate of real convergence. The opposite result is obtained for Southern EU countries (Portugal, Greece, Italy and Cyprus) having high rates of real convergence, however small rates of fiscal convergence, which has been probably reduced during debt crisis in Europe. New EU members record similar high rates of fiscal convergence connected with similar medium-high rates of real convergence. Finally, a speed of fiscal convergence is globally higher than a speed of real convergence, which could lead to more synchronized business cycles in the future.","[Tykhonenko, Anna] Univ Cote Azur, CNRS, GREDEG, 250 Rue Albert Einstein, F-06560 Valbonne, France; [Sulikova, Veronika] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Cote d'Azur; Technical University Kosice,"Tykhonenko, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cote Azur, CNRS, GREDEG, 250 Rue Albert Einstein, F-06560 Valbonne, France.",anna.tykhonenko@unice.fr; veronika.sulikova@tuke.sk,"Šuliková, Veronika/AAA-4269-2020","Šuliková, Veronika/0000-0001-6286-841X",[VEGA 1/0994/15]; [VEGA 1/0559/16],;,The paper was elaborated within the project VEGA 1/0994/15 and VEGA 1/0559/16.,,22,0,0,0,0,"TECHNICAL UNIV KOSICE, FAC ECONOMICS",KOSICE,"RAMPOVA 1731-7, KOSICE, DZUNGL A-DZUNGL A 040 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-553-2906-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,837,847,,,,,,11,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO1YB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503056700086,0

Low R&D contributes to the assessment of Slovakia as moderate innovator. The cooperation of research institutions and industry in R&D is weak. Joint interests lead companies, research institutions, and universities to collaborate on cluster platforms. The world technology companies with their subsidiaries in Slovakia have the potential to develop domestic R&D. Adequate human resources and their mobility is the necessary precondition for R&D and innovation. Slovakia is among the countries with the highest share of students studying abroad. It leads to the lack of high-quality students and university graduates in Slovakia. The dissatisfaction of researchers with the situation in the R&D sector is the risk of sustainability of the research system quality. Geographic and cross-sectoral mobility of researchers increases the transfer of knowledge. Insufficient motivational environment faces the problem of leaving talented people abroad.

US 8/07. Through microeconomic modelling of the situation with the help of valid retro data, the development of solidarity and equivalence in the ongoing pension system is analysed in detail, both before and after the so-called small pension reform of basic pension benefits carried out from 2005-2016 in the Czech Republic. The analytical calculations are focused on properly calculating retirement in accordance with Act No. 155/1995 Coll. on pension insurance, as amended, from the perspective of different situations of typified individuals with different incomes (five) and their individual replacement ratio from the perspective of the Czech pension system, which is funded on an ongoing basis. The results quantify the individual replacement rates and are analysed from the perspective of model situations where, despite the enactment of these small pension reform, a high individual replacement ratio still remains for low-income individuals compared with high-income individuals. The analysis shows that the lower the pre-retirement income is, the higher the individual pension benefit itself is in comparison with pre-retirement higher income, and the more it manifests itself in a higher rate of solidarity with the higher individual replacement ratio. Conversely, with an increase in the pre-retirement pension, the benefit income rises, but increases more slowly in relation to the pre-retirement income and the individual replacement ratio decreases significantly. Low-income individuals have a tendency to increase the nationwide replacement rate, while high-income individuals tend to reduce it. In conclusion, the paper also points out the difficulty of achieving ongoing financial sustainability of the pension system in the Czech Republic, where a considerable increase in the so-called awaited dependency ratio (per 100 people) is expected from the 2015 value of 26.6 to 47.8 in 2080 (ceteris paribus).","[Vopatek, Jiri] Vysok Skola Ekona Praze, Fak Managementu, Prague, Czech Republic",,"Vopátek, J (通讯作者)，Vysok Skola Ekona Praze, Fak Managementu, Prague, Czech Republic.",vopatek@fm.vse.cz,,"Vopatek, Jiri/0000-0003-4647-508X",,,,,17,1,1,0,8,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

The initiative provides a historic opportunity for China and over 70 related countries and regions to comprehensively deepen their economic, social, educational and cultural cooperation. Research shows that China-ASEAN cooperation in higher education is the most active one comparing to China's other regional cooperation along the Belt and Road routes in terms of the intergovernmental cooperation platform and mechanism, Student mobility and cooperative run schools. Researches also find that the China- ASEAN higher education cooperation is vital for China to demonstrate its intention. However, the cooperation also faces major challenges. The greatest internal challenge is caused by uneven development of higher education in ASEAN member countries, and the major external pressure comes from the US policy for Asia-Pacific region.

Shadow prices of greenhouse gas emissions and determinants of efficiency are investigated and the influence of different sources of productivity change is quantified. The methodological framework is based on output-oriented and enhanced hyperbolic stochastic distance functions. The balanced data panel comprises 141 arable farms located in northern Germany between the 2002/03 and 2009/10 financial years. The results show that there are potential savings of 12% or 9% of product-related emissions for the output-oriented and enhanced hyperbolic distance functions, respectively. Better soil quality and a higher proportion of grain and sugar beet in the crop rotation influence efficiency positively. In contrast, a higher percentage of organic fertilizer and a higher percentage of outsourced services have a negative influence on efficiency. Average shadow prices of greenhouse gas emissions are, depending on the distance function, from (sic)3.56 to (sic)7.12 per tonne CO2 equivalent and from (sic)1.71 to (sic)3.41 per tonne CO2 equivalent. Shadow prices show an increasing trend during the observation period. The determined positive productivity change is mainly caused by technical progress. Average efficiency changes have only a marginal impact on productivity change. Scale changes inhibit productivity progress slightly.","[Wettemann, Patrick J.

Simon Anholt, one of the leading authors in nationbranding, considers a nation brand as the most valuable asset of a country in order to acquire a competitive advantage and a strategic position in the international arena. The present paper tries to identify how the conceptual framework of nation branding developed by Anholt fits into the concrete actions taken in some countries in the Middle East. Traditionally, the nations of the Middle East have been reluctant to operate with the concepts of nation branding when compared to the Western world. However, an exception can be considered to be the Gulf Cooperation Council bloc (GCC) - a region of great wealth positioned between the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Peninsula. Even though initially these countries did not have as a purpose to create a particular nation brand, they took concrete actions for their economic development that resulted in a positive country image for some of them. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Qatar are two Middle Eastern countries that certainly acknowledged their role in the competitive global economy and recently started to apply nation-branding techniques. The cities of the UAE and Qatar were almost unknown to the world until three decades ago. Today UAE has become Middle East's strongest brand, while one of its main cities-Dubai has gained the reputation of one of the most extravagant and cosmopolitan cities in the world. At the same time, Doha is consolidating its reputation on the international sports circuit. Only recently, UAE and Qatar have developed strategies for branding attractions that individualize their image and gives an impetus to internationalization. The analysis uses Anholt's nation branding conceptual framework and will follow two directions: a) a chronological direction that looks in both countries to the different stages of economic development and associated actions that resulted in the present country images and b) a comparative direction that looks at the two countries trying to identify elements of commonality and elements of differences in the ways how their existing images have been built. The paper concludes that the two countries in the Middle East built successful country brands using initially strategies aimed mainly at economic development and later on strategies aimed specifically to country branding.","[Zeineddine, Cornelia; Nicolescu, Luminita] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 Piata Romana, Bucharest 010374, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Zeineddine, C (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 Piata Romana, Bucharest 010374, Romania.",cornelia.epuras12@gmail.com; luminicolescu@yahoo.com,"Nicolescu, Luminita/G-9427-2018","Nicolescu, Luminita/0000-0001-8029-9054",,,,,41,0,0,2,10,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-269-9,STRATEGICA,,,2017,,,,,,,573,584,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0ZU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431586800044,0

Despite the rapid development of such systems, few studies have investigated how built environment factors affect the use of public bikes at station level using trip data, taking account of the spatial correlation between nearby stations. Built environment factors are strongly associated with travel demand and play an important role in the success of public bike systems. Using trip data from Zhongshan's public bike system, this paper employed a multiple linear regression model to examine the influence of built environment variables on trip demand as well as on the ratio of demand to supply (D/S) at bike stations. It also considered the spatial correlations of PBS usage betWeen nearby stations, using the spatial weighted matrix. These built environment variables mainly refer to station attributes and accessibility, cycling infrastructure, public transport facilities, and land use characteristics. Generally, we found that both trip demand and the ratio of demand to supply at bike stations were positively influenced by population density, length of bike lanes and branch roads, and diverse land-use types near the station, and were negatively influenced by the distance to city center and the number of other nearby stations. However, public transport facilities do not show a significant impact on both demand and D/S at stations, which might be attributed to local modal split. We also found that the PBS usage at stations is positively associated With usage at nearby stations. Model results also suggest that adding a new station (with empty capacity) within a 300 m catchment of a station to share the capacity of the bike station can improve the demand-supply ratio at the station. Referring to both trip demand models and D/S models, regression fits Were quite strong with larger R-2 for weekdays than for weekends and holidays, and for morning and evening peak hours than for off-peak hours. These quantitative analyses and findings can be beneficial to urban planners and operators to improve the demand and turnover of public bikes at bike stations, and to expand or build public bike systems in the future.

This study investigated the influence of the World Food Programme's cash and food transfers on the diversity and quality of diets among recipient households in Mozambique and the implications of this for the design of systemic food assistance intentions. The study found that direct food provision improved dietary diversity, while cash enabled beneficiaries to purchase more nutritious foods and improve their diet quality. Both cash and food transfers have potential to generate demand for a variety of nutritious foods in the communities investigated through this study. Providing adequate rations of basic food with a cash portion could improve both dietary diversity and quality and stimulate demand for nutritious foods by addressing both income (purchasing power) constraints as well as stimulating demand for these foods. This demand could have a pull factor in terms of local food systems, stimulating demand not only for food but also for food system services - both upstream and downstream - provided a functioning market exists. Context analysis is necessary to understand if cash injections could lead to price spikes, eroding purchasing power and if the incentives exist for private traders to respond to demand.","[Zhou, Agatha Carol] Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, Pretoria, South Africa; [Hendriks, Sheryl L.] Univ Pretoria, Inst Food Nutr & Well Being, Pretoria, South Africa; [Hendriks, Sheryl L.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria; University of Pretoria; University of Pretoria,"Hendriks, SL (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Inst Food Nutr & Well Being, Pretoria, South Africa.;Hendriks, SL (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, Pretoria, South Africa.",sheryl.hendriks@up.ac.za,"Hendriks, Sheryl L/E-6537-2010","Hendriks, Sheryl L/0000-0002-1487-4302","University of Pretoria; National Research Foundation (NRF) [CPR20110706000020, 77053, 80529]",University of Pretoria; National Research Foundation (NRF),"Fieldwork for this study was conducted by the World Food Programme in Mozambique and the Vulnerability and Analysis Group in Mozambique's Technical Secretariat for Food Security and Nutrition (SETSAN), Mozambique Ministry of Agriculture.

The measurement of response time (RT), the amount of time it takes to make a decision, offers a cost-effective and direct way to study the choice process. Yet, relatively little theory exists to guide the integration of RT into economic analysis. This article presents a canonical process model from psychology and neuroscience, the Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM), and shows that many RT phenomena in the economics literature are consistent with the predictions of the DDM. Additionally, use of the class of sequential sampling models facilitates a more principled consideration of findings from cognitive science and neuroeconomics. Application of the DDM demonstrates the rich inference made possible when using models that can jointly model choice and process, highlighting the need for more work in this area.","[Clithero, John A.] Univ Oregon, Lundquist Coll Business, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",University of Oregon,"Clithero, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Oregon, Lundquist Coll Business, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",clithero@uoregon.edu,"Clithero, John A/C-5380-2011",,Pomona College,Pomona College,"JAC acknowledges Pomona College for funding, and Maya Kaul for excellent research assistance.

A threshold logarithm per capita output, above which fertility decline reverses, was predicted to depend on subsidized child care, maternity pay, and the value placed on children and maternal time spent rearing children. The predictions explained recent evidence and identified cross country differences in gender wages, family policy and willingness to substitute maternal time in childrearing as important factors in an inverse J-shaped effect of economic growth on fertility. The analysis was robust to the introduction of education and cost sharing among children in child rearing. Economies of scale in child rearing reduced the threshold logarithm of per capita output.

Using the news-based index developed by Baker et al. (2016) for twenty-one countries, we find that the strength of the negative relation between investment and the cost of capital decreases during times of high economic policy uncertainty. An increase in policy uncertainty reduces the sensitivity of investment to the cost of capital most for firms operating in industries that depend strongly on government subsidies and government consumption as well as in countries with high state ownership. Consistent with the price informativeness channel, we find that an increase in policy uncertainty reduces the investment-cost of capital sensitivity for firms from more opaque countries, firms with low analyst coverage, firms with no credit rating, and small firms. We conclude that economic policy uncertainty distorts the fundamental relation between investment and the cost of capital. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

FNIRS is a noninvasive optical brain imaging technique that combines the measurements of cerebral blood flow and hemodynamic response in a specific brain area when neural activity occurs. Nevertheless, the feasibility of mobile fNIRS has not yet been verified, because it is rarely used in neuroeconomic and neuromarketing studies. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of mobile fNIRS for marketing and economic research situations. Twelve subjects viewed three different advertisements of the same product, and then rated these pictures. All pictures showed the same product, but with different surroundings. The surroundings included an attractive female and male, shown to male and, respectively, female subjects, a cat, and a relatively neutral landscape. The results indicate that there are significant differences in the activation of the prefrontal cortex when viewing the different pictures. This was especially noticeable for the sexual picture and the childlike picture compared with the landscape. Also, significant differences were found on the group level and between subgroups. The activation was higher for the childlike picture than for the sexual picture, and this effect was stronger for the female subgroup. In addition, significantly higher activation was found during decision-making processes. The results of the present study suggest that using fNIRS is a promising method for measuring economic decision-making processes and consumer attention.","[Meyerding, Stephan G.

As securities are tied to a particular asset (or pool of assets), and investors lose when the asset defaults, the security issuer usually provides further coverage by promising to use the proceedings from other, non-securitized, assets. Although these promises are difficult to enforce, the issuer may still have incentives to strategically avoid default in order to build a reputation of holding high-quality assets. Confidence makes securitization more dependent on the issuer's reputation than other forms of financing and more volatile to forces behind reputation concerns, such as expectations about future profits.

South Africa's Child Support Grant (CSG) is one of the largest cash transfer systems in Africa. However, child poverty remains high in the country, leading to calls to expand the CSG. Government faces resource scarcity and therefore needs to create fiscal space to set up such a reform. This paper evaluates the economy wide impact of the CSG on the economy using a recursive bottom-up/top-down CGE-micro simulation approach. This allows the estimation of the potential effects of a 20% increase in the grant on households' welfare, the economy, as well as on the fiscal constraint. This reform is evaluated under three fiscal scenarios to take into account the fiscal stress the country is currently experiencing. We find that the reform brings some positive impacts at the macro level, and a decrease in poverty for the whole population as well as for children. The direct effect brought by the CSG increase represents the largest contribution to poverty reduction, but the indirect (general equilibrium) effects globally reduce the positive poverty effects engendered by the CSG. Some interesting heterogeneous effects are also found, with the proposed reform being progressive and the richest percentiles showing a (small) deterioration due to the decrease in wage revenues. However, the overall poverty and inequality effects are small and unlikely to be robust. The paper's results can assist South Africa, and indeed other African countries, calling for increased coverage of grants as well as exploring universal coverage. Further, the use of the integrated macro-micro simulation methodology is a major contribution of this paper. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In this research, according to Lucas's critique, structural change test is used in order to control macroeconomic and political variables affecting the results of the study. Findings The results of hypothesis testing by employing three statistical methods suggest that only one hypothesis of this investigation is significant, which shows the significant association of type of market's impact (exchange of OTC) on the relationship between managerial ability and tax avoidance.

Specifically, the paper examines West African CFA franc, Gambian dalasi and Nigerian naira exchange rates in relation to the USD, for any evidence of shock and volatility spillover. Design/methodology/approach The author employs multivariate GARCH (1,1)-BEKK model which enables the evaluation of the interaction within the volatility of two or more series because of its capability to detect volatility spillover among time series observations, as well as the persistence of volatility within each series. Findings The major findings of this study are as follows: there is evidence of volatility clustering in West African CFA franc, Gambian dalasi and Nigerian naira exchange rates in relation to the USD. There is evidence of bi-directional shock and volatility spillover between the Nigerian naira and West African CFA franc/USD exchange rates, and uni-directional shock spillover from the Gambian dalasi to the West African CFA franc/USD exchange rates. There is, however, no evidence of exchange rate shock and volatility spillover between Nigerian naira and Gambian dalasi. Originality/value Although considerable literature exists on the volatility of exchange rate in West Africa and comparative analysis of exchange rates volatility in few countries of West Africa, there is absence of empirical studies on exchange rate volatility spillover among countries in the region. Since containing exchange rate volatility is one of the major objectives of monetary policy, understanding the nature and direction of exchange rate volatility spillover would propel formulation exchange rate policies that would minimise exchange rate uncertainty and entrench sustainable development. In addition, the nature of exchange rate volatility spillover between West African countries would provide basis for international traders and foreign portfolio investors to develop effective strategies for hedging against exchange rate shocks that are propagated across countries by designing appropriate risk management techniques.","[Emenike, Kalu Onwukwe] Kampala Int Univ, Dept Accounting & Finance, Kampala, Uganda",,"Emenike, KO (通讯作者)，Kampala Int Univ, Dept Accounting & Finance, Kampala, Uganda.",emenikekaluonwukwe@yahoo.com,"O., Emenike Kalu/AAD-4225-2019","O., Emenike Kalu/0000-0002-3599-0281",,,,,48,12,12,1,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

We test this relationship empirically, examining the impact of soil conservation training sessions on female agricultural labor contributions within households in Zambia. Moreover, we explore the short-run effects of increased female agricultural productivity on female empowerment through measurement of changes in gender-specific resource allocations within the household. The extension of funding of conservation farming (CF) training sessions in 2007 in specific districts in Zambia provides variation in CF take-up.

Our results suggest that expansion of funding for CF training sessions increased take-up of CF, increased female labor hours, and shifted household expenditures toward goods associated more strongly with female preferences than male preferences.

This paper shows that the Balassa-Samuelson effect exists even when countries share identical production technologies. In the celebrated Heckscher-Ohlin model, changes in factor endowments do not affect the equalized factor prices. This paper considers a three-factor, three-industry model, and demonstrates that endowment differences between countries can cause disparities in their wage rates and the prices of the nontraded good. A dynamic panel data analysis shows that a 10% increase in per capita real GDP results in a 2% increase in the housing price for non-EU OECD countries.","[Choi, Yoonho] Simpson Coll, Indianola, IA USA; [Jin, Hailong] South Dakota State Univ, Brookings, SD USA; [Choi, E.

The total cost for the social planner includes the private cost of production and the social cost of carbon, assumed to be exogenous and growing at the social discount rate. Under these assumptions the optimization problem can be decomposed in two questions: (i) when to launch a given schedule; (ii) at which rate the transition should be completed that is, the design of a transition schedule as such. The first question can be solved using a simple indicator interpreted as the MAC of the whole schedule, possibly non optimal. The case of hydrogen vehicle (Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles) offers an illustration of our results.

The second part provides empirical evidence through panel data methodology that draws on 37 developing countries for the period 1992 to 2012.

While previous research has been careful to identify the causal effect of emissions trading on emissions reductions (Fowlie et al. in Am Econ Rev 102(2):965-993, 2012, hereafter FHM), we argue that existing estimates of differential impacts on demographic groups have relied on unrealistic assumptions regarding pollution dispersion. In this paper, we estimate the emissions reduction due to the RECLAIM cap-and-trade program in Southern California following the identification strategy of FHM, but we relax the assumption of uniform dispersion surrounding point sources. We model the transport of effluents using a state-of-the-science dispersion model to determine the areas impacted by emissions from each source. Importantly, conditional on race and ethnicity, we find that higher income areas receive larger reductions in pollution under cap-and-trade. Furthermore, conditional on income (or poverty rates), we find that Blacks benefit while Hispanics lose relative to whites under RECLAIM.","[Grainger, Corbett; Ruangmas, Thanicha] Univ Wisconsin, 427 Lorch St,Taylor Hall 411, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Grainger, C (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, 427 Lorch St,Taylor Hall 411, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",corbett.grainger@wisc.edu; ruangmas@wisc.edu,,"Grainger, Corbett/0000-0001-5789-3725",,,,,24,17,25,1,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

This paper investigates the determinants of preferences over an intergenerational redistribution policy in Thailand, namely the old-age allowance system. Since 2009 the old-age allowance system has been a non-contributory social pension scheme for all older persons except retired national and local government officials who receive pension monthly and older persons in public residential care facilities. The paper uses nationally representative data collected in 2011 under the project to investigate people's knowledge of, and attitudes towards, the elderly. Employing logistic regression analysis, the paper looks into the factors correlated with: (1) whether an individual prefers the old-age allowance system to be universal or targeted, and (2) whether an individual is willing to pay more tax so that the elderly can receive more monthly allowance. The paper further divides the individuals into four groups based on the above two types of preferences, and uses multinomial logistic regression analysis to analyze the factors correlated with the likelihood of being in each group. The findings suggest that education, income, expectations regarding one's own need for the old-age allowance in the future, together with knowledge, understanding, and attitudes towards older persons are key determinants of individuals' preferences regarding the old-age allowance system.","[Suwanrada, Worawet] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Econ, Bangkok, Thailand; [Sukontamarn, Pataporn; Bangkaew, Busarin] Chulalongkorn Univ, Coll Populat Studies, Bangkok, Thailand",Chulalongkorn University; Chulalongkorn University,"Sukontamarn, P (通讯作者)，Chulalongkorn Univ, Coll Populat Studies, Bangkok, Thailand.",pataporn.s@chula.ac.th,,"Sukontamarn, Pataporn/0000-0003-4110-9697","Higher Education Research Promotion and National Research University Project of Thailand, Office of the Higher Education Commission; project 'Interaction between Population Dynamics and Human Security in Thai Society' under Human Security Research Cluster, Chulalongkorn University [HS1151A]","Higher Education Research Promotion and National Research University Project of Thailand, Office of the Higher Education Commission; project 'Interaction between Population Dynamics and Human Security in Thai Society' under Human Security Research Cluster, Chulalongkorn University","This paper was supported by the Higher Education Research Promotion and National Research University Project of Thailand, Office of the Higher Education Commission.

We use data from local droughts in Japan over three decades to investigate how variability in precipitation and temperature affects water restrictions implemented by drought coordination councils. We find that climate variability is significantly related to water restrictions in terms of both intensity and duration. The regression results show that a 100-mm decrease in annual precipitation is associated with a 0.2% increase in the water withdrawal restriction rate and an increase of one day in the restriction period. Our findings suggest that climate variability might induce more stringent water restrictions, implying negative consequences for water availability. This study thus shows the importance of strategically building adaptive capacity to climate change due to the risks of extreme weather events, such as prolonged droughts and extended summer seasons.","[Tembata, Kaori; Takeuchi, Kenji] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan",Kobe University,"Tembata, K (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.",kaoritembata@stu.kobe-u.ac.jp; takeuchi@econ.kobe-u.ac.jp,"Takeuchi, Kenji/GWV-8019-2022; Takeuchi, Kenji/S-5311-2016","Takeuchi, Kenji/0000-0002-6180-7663;",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS KAKENHI) [17K18565]; Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Environment Foundation; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17K18565] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS KAKENHI)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Environment Foundation; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors would like to thank the editor and two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments and suggestions.

This study analyzes the market effects of the Cocoa Livelihood Program (CLP) in Ghana. To evaluate both the benefits to cocoa farmers and market outcomes of CLP on cocoa and other noncocoa markets, this study simulates a partial-equilibrium farm household model. The analysis shows that CLP participating households benefit by U.S.$154 per household, while nonparticipating households benefit (through market outcome) by only U.S.$21 per household, at the 2016 participation rate of 6 percent. The net welfare changes in staple food markets (maize, rice, cassava, and yam) attributable to CLP, is estimated at U.S.$850 per household. A rise in the CLP participation rate leads to a decline in the Ghanaian cocoa price. However, net gains from the program become negative at participation rates of more than 60 percent, as supply increases and the cocoa price falls. This result suggests that CLP participation could be expanded up to 60 percent of Ghana's cocoa producing households. However, expanding cocoa demand is equally as important as expanding production if participation rates exceed 60 percent.","[Tsiboe, Francis; Luckstead, Jeff; Nalley, Lawton L.; Popp, Jennie S.; Dixon, Bruce L.] Univ Arkansas, AGRI 217, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Luckstead, J (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, AGRI 217, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",jluckste@uark.edu,"Nalley, Lawton/AAN-7643-2021; Tsiboe, Francis/A-6485-2018","Tsiboe, Francis/0000-0001-5984-1072",,,,,51,1,1,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Similar to prior papers, we find a positive association between a bank's equity stake in a borrowing firm and lending to that firm. While such a positive cross-sectional correlation may be due to equity stakes benefiting lending, it may also be driven by endogeneity. To distinguish the two explanations, we study a German tax reform that permitted banks to sell their equity stakes tax-free. After the reform, many banks sold their equity stakes, but did not reduce lending to the firms. This observation is robust to several alternative model specifications, control groups, and time windows.

We use a dataset of 3461 banks from 25 developed and 54 developing countries over the 2001-2013 period. Banks tend on average to exhibit pro-cyclical behavior. But capital buffers seem to be more pro-cyclical in developing countries. Our results show that more competition leads to higher buffers in developed countries but to lower buffers in developing ones. This evidence suggests that the competition-stability thesis adheres in developed economies, whereas competition-fragility makes more sense in developing countries. This asymmetric result may have important policy implications, particularly with regard to new, globally-negotiated capital adequacy standards. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

So far, results have proven to be generally positive, while the impact varies considerably among cities. One of the reasons explaining such heterogeneity is based on the fact that empirical analyses are conducted for different cities using different methodologies. The paper proposes to deal with two main questions: is the impact of new BRT routes similar over different routes within a given metropolitan area? If not, is the variation of the estimated impact for different BRT routes related to the characteristics of their stops? The empirical analysis is conducted using information on the implementation of seven distinct BRT routes between 1992 and 2011. Using information on single-family housing transactions in the Quebec metropolitan area (Canada) between 1986 and 2015 with a difference-in-differences (DID) estimator using a repeated sales approach for seven distinct BRT routes, the empirical investigation reveals that the impact varies between routes and, when significant, the impact is spatially concentrated. An exploratory analysis shows that there exists some statistical relation between characteristics of the stops along the routes and the impact estimated.","[Dube, Jean; Andrianary, Eugenie; Assad-Dery, Francois; Poupart, Janie; Simard, Justine] Univ Laval, ESAD, 2325 Rue Bibliotheques, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada",Laval University,"Dubé, J (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, ESAD, 2325 Rue Bibliotheques, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",jean.dube@esad.ulaval.ca,"Dubé, Jean/L-1751-2019","Dubé, Jean/0000-0003-3445-3449",,,,,59,8,8,0,27,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Our analysis considers the feedback behavior that exists between the financial and real sectors through a micro-level financial accelerator. We find a strong network effect in which the network structure can either attenuate or amplify shocks from the real sector and thus plays a major role in contagion processes. We also find that government-owned banks are the most susceptible banks to receiving shocks from firms of any economic sector. There is empirical evidence to support the claim that more diversified portfolios of banks contribute to higher sector riskiness levels. Our results suggest that systemic risk models should account for the interconnectedness among economic agents such as the interbank and real and financial sector linkages in a multilayer approach. Overall, we show that the feedback between the real and financial sector matters in systemic risk estimation and most models that do not take into consideration could be severely underestimating systemic risk.

This paper proposes a new flexible dynamic copula model being able to explain and forecast the time-varying shape of large dimensional asset returns distributions. The time-varying dependence is introduced by allowing the dynamic updating equation of the copula correlation parameters to depend on a latent Markov-switching process as well as on exogenous covariates. As a further key ingredient of the model specification, we let the univariate marginals to be driven by an updating mechanism based on the scaled score of the conditional distribution. This framework allows us to introduce time-variation in the conditional moments up to the fourth order. Time-varying moments are then used to build a portfolio allocation strategy that maximises the utility function of a representative rational investor. We empirically assess that the proposed model substantially improves the optimal portfolio allocation with respect to competing alternative investment strategies.","[Bernardi, Mauro] Univ Padua, Dept Stat Sci, Via C Battisti 241-243, I-35121 Padua, Italy; [Bernardi, Mauro] Ist Applicaz Calcolo Mauro Picone CNR, Rome, Italy; [Catania, Leopoldo] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Aarhus, Denmark; [Catania, Leopoldo] CREATES, Aarhus, Denmark",University of Padua; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto per le Applicazioni del Calcolo Mauro Picone (IAC-CNR); Aarhus University; CREATES,"Bernardi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dept Stat Sci, Via C Battisti 241-243, I-35121 Padua, Italy.",mauro.bernardi@unipd.it; leopoldo.catania@econ.au.dk,,"Catania, Leopoldo/0000-0002-0981-1921","Italian Ministry of Research PRIN 2013-2015, Multivariate Statistical Methods for Risk Assessment (MISURA); Carlo Giannini Research Fellowship; Centro Interuniversitario di Econometria (CIdE); UniCredit Foundation","Italian Ministry of Research PRIN 2013-2015, Multivariate Statistical Methods for Risk Assessment (MISURA); Carlo Giannini Research Fellowship; Centro Interuniversitario di Econometria (CIdE); UniCredit Foundation","This research is supported by the Italian Ministry of Research PRIN 2013-2015, Multivariate Statistical Methods for Risk Assessment (MISURA), and by the Carlo Giannini Research Fellowship, the Centro Interuniversitario di Econometria (CIdE) and UniCredit Foundation.

In relation to that, Islamic finance receives a lot of attention from institutional investors and asset managers in the search for higher returns, lower correlation and growth potentiality. Therefore, it would be meaningful to investigate whether sukuk can offer any advantage in terms of global diversification. In such context, we have examined the volatilities and correlations of bond indices of emerging counties such as South Korea, Singapore, China, India, Indonesia, and Malaysia with Thomson Reuters BPA Malaysia Sukuk Index by applying wavelet coherence and Multivariate GARCH analyses. The data covers the period January 2010 to December 2015. We conclude that the sukuk market offers effective portfolio diversification opportunities for fixed income investors of the mentioned sample countries. Global and regional investors can avail the benefits of portfolio diversification through investment in sukuk markets but portfolio diversification is not feasible domestically. As a practical implication to the finance industry, the outcome of this research provides a framework for investigating sukuk market integration of several emerging bond markets which serve as an important platform for conducting further research.

This change was intended to prevent sellers from retaliating against buyers who gave them negative feedback. We observe an improvement in the overall quality of the marketplace as a result of this change. We attribute 49%-77% of this improvement to reduced adverse selection as low-quality sellers exit the market or their market share drops, and the rest to a reduction in moral hazard as sellers improve the quality of their service.","[Hui, Xiang] Washington Univ, Olin Business Sch, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Saeedi, Maryam] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Sundaresan, Neel] Microsoft Corp, 1 Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052 USA",Washington University (WUSTL); Carnegie Mellon University; Microsoft,"Hui, X (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, Olin Business Sch, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",xianghui@wustl.edu; msaeedi@andrew.cmu.edu; nsundaresan@ebay.com,,,,,,,30,9,10,2,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1821,1467-6451,,J IND ECON,J.

Using alternative estimators for efficiency, our results show that Takaful operators are inefficient suggesting the presence of widespread managerial lethargy and operational inefficiency. Additional analyses indicate that non-executive directors, audit committees, and product diversification do not improve technical efficiency. Rather, audit committees and regulatory jurisdiction tends to reduce scale efficiency. We also find that CEO/chair duality, board size, organizational age, regulatory jurisdiction and firm size have a positive relationship with technical efficiency. We further report that non-executive directors, Shari'ah board, product diversification and institutional ownership improve scale efficiency. In particular, the study provides new and extended regional evidence on the efficiency of the Takaful industry in the Middle East North Africa (MENA) and the Southeast East Asian (ASEAN) region.

The commodity composition of the two trade collapses was quite similar, but the latter collapse was much sharper due to the spread of manufacturing across the globe during the intervening period. The increasing importance of manufacturing also meant that the trade collapse was more geographically balanced in the later episode. Protectionism was much more severe during the 1930s than after 2008, and in the UK case at least helped to skew the direction of trade away from multilateralism and towards Empire.

This paper finds that the double-trigger hypothesis, which attributes mortgage default to the joint occurrence of negative equity and a life event such as unemployment, is consistent with the evidence. By contrast, a traditional frictionless default model strongly overpredicts the increase in default rates. This paper provides microfoundations for double-trigger behavior in a model where unemployment causes liquidity problems for the borrower.

We explore some demographic and economic characteristics of individuals who express support for acts of violent extremism (VE) by using an extensive cross-country multi-year survey dataset ranging from 2007 to 2014. A growing body of empirical research has focused on examining the various socioeconomic underpinnings of violent extremism. The results have been inconclusive, at times contradictory and often based on limited set of case studies or smaller single time period cross-section datasets. In this study we use information on a little over forty-eight thousand individuals in 12 countries to evaluate the connections between socio-economic status and support for extremism. While the impact of the socioeconomic characteristics on support for violence remains inconclusive in this analysis, we do find interesting and significant results when we interact individual economic status variables with the overall economic growth of the country. Unemployment status and having lower levels of education have significant impacts on the likelihood of support for VE when interacted with country level growth rate. We conclude that inequality or a feeling of being left out-being unemployed, in higher growth countries might be the key to understanding the economic underpinnings of violent extremism.

We considered gains and losses of spare/working time with respect to a reference duration defined in a working contract. Specifically, we elicited a behavioral model of intertemporal choice that accounts for a gain/loss-dependent discounting function and a reference-dependent utility. Additionally, we did not impose preference for the present (positive discounting) and allowed for both decreasing and increasing impatience. While our results are standard regarding the discount of money (our baseline treatment), our subjects heavily discounted gains of time. More patience was observed for losses of time and a sizable portion of subjects even exhibited negative discounting, i.e. they preferred to expedite losses of time.

The paper argues that rather than the volume of non-financial corporations' financial investment, the composition of financial assets is crucial to assess corporate financialization in the country. Non-financial businesses in South Africa fundamentally transformed their investment behaviour during the 1990s, shifting from more productive uses such as trade credit towards highly liquid and potentially innovative (and therefore risky) financial investment. Following the direction of financial flows the article shows that companies' financial operations - fuelled by foreign capital inflows - are linked to the price inflation in South African property markets.","[Karwowski, Ewa] Univ Hertfordshire, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England",University of Hertfordshire,"Karwowski, E (通讯作者)，Univ Hertfordshire, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England.",E.Karwowski@herts.ac.uk,,"Karwowski, Ewa/0000-0001-6350-1839",,,,,104,15,15,3,49,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

FRMs provide insurance for risk-averse borrowers in the sense that they pay the same rate over time and are not subject to uncertain spot market rates. FRMs, however, discourage borrowers from moving to other regions despite better employment opportunities, as they terminate the FRM contracts in order to move and their new loan interests may be higher. As FRM-borrowers do not move to other regions due to the interest lock-ins, entrepreneurs in other regions lose the potential surpluses from productive matches that would have occurred between borrowers-workers and entrepreneurs. Borrowers ignore this negative externality they impose on the entrepreneurs when choosing their mortgages, and too many borrowers choose FRMs relative to the efficient level. If FRMs are eliminated and ARM-insurance (that protects ARM-borrowers against uncertain adjustable interest rates) is created, it will improve efficiency. The paper also assesses quantitatively the welfare effects of eliminating FRMs and providing ARM-insurance.","[Lee, Kangoh] San Diego State Univ, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92182 USA",California State University System; San Diego State University,"Lee, K (通讯作者)，San Diego State Univ, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",klee@mail.sdsu.edu,,,,,,,57,1,1,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

This paper examines the determinants of export performance in developing countries, within a comparative perspective of landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) and non-landlocked developing countries, by using a standard gravity modeling framework. The study covers data from 1995 to 2015. The results suggest that despite recent trade policy reforms, the overall export performance of LLDCs is lower than that of non-landlocked developing countries due to the inherent additional trade costs associated with landlockedness. The conventional wisdom that export performance is aided by economic openness also applies to LLDCs, but distance-related trade costs have a greater negative impact on exports from LLDCs than on other developing countries. The immediate trade policy challenge for LLDCs is therefore to create a more trade-friendly environment by lowering tariffs, reforming exchange rates and entering into regional trade agreements.","[Paudel, Ramesh C.; Cooray, Arusha] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Cooray, Arusha] Univ Nottingham, Business Sch, Nottingham, England",Australian National University; University of Nottingham,"Paudel, RC (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",Ramesh.paudel@anu.edu.au,"Cooray, Arusha/X-1507-2019","Cooray, Arusha/0000-0001-8809-9188",,,,,41,5,5,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

In the short run with fixed number of firms, ECSR investment raises capital rental cost and hence widens wage inequality between skilled and unskilled workers via the factor substitution effect, while the increased capital cost causes firms to exit in the long run. This releases capital and hence lowers the capital rental cost. Thus, the wage gap can be mitigated or even narrowed by a rise in unskilled wage and a drop in skilled wage via the firm-exit effect.

Our results suggest that media coverage and executive empire building and pursuit of a quiet life are positively correlated, particularly for state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which is in contrast to conclusions reached in previous studies. We contend that executive empire building and pursuit of a quiet life are not obvious governance violations in China and that the socially and politically desired governmental goals of job creation and labor harmony contribute to the positive correlation. The particularly strong findings among SOEs relative to non-SOEs corroborate our argument because SOEs typically pursue government-desired social goals.

Scientists and policymakers have proposed various strategies for managing risks, with limited success. In this study we consider two such strategies, specifically drought tolerant rice and weather index insurance. While neither drought tolerant cultivars nor weather index insurance products are perfect solutions for adequately managing drought risk in and of themselves, there is scope to exploit the benefits of each and bundle them into a complementary risk management product, specifically through proper index calibration and an optimized insurance design. In this study, we explore preferences for such a complementary risk management product using discrete choice experiments in Odisha, India. We are able to estimate the added value that farmers perceive in the bundled product above and beyond the value associated with each of the independent products. We also show that valuations are very sensitive to the basis risk implied by the insurance product, with farmers less enthusiastic about risk management products that leave significant risks uninsured.

There is increased research toward better understanding of bikesharing systems (BSS) in urban environments. However, our comprehension remains incomplete on the patterns and characteristics of BSS. In this paper, aiming to help improving sustainability in multimodal transportation through BSS, we perform a systematic data analysis to examine underlying patterns and characteristics of the system dynamics in a bikeshare network and to acquire implications of the patterns and characteristics for decision making. As a case study, we use trip history data from the Capital Bikeshare system in the Washington DC area and some additional data sources. The study covers seven important aspects of bikeshare transportation systems, which are respectively trip demand and flow, operating activities, use and idle times, trip purpose, origin-destination flows, mobility, and safety. For these aspects, by using appropriate statistical methods and geographic techniques, we investigate travel patterns and characteristics of BSS from data to evaluate the qualitative and quantitative impacts of the inputs from key stakeholders on main measures of effectiveness such as trip costs, mobility, safety, quality of service, and operational efficiency, where key stakeholders include road users, system operators, and city. We also disclose some new patterns and characteristics of BSS to advance the knowledge on travel behaviors. Finally, we briefly summarize our findings and discuss the implications of the patterns and characteristics for data-driven decision supports from the relations between BSS and key stakeholders for promoting bikeshare utilization and transforming urban transportation to be more sustainable.","[Xie, Xiao-Feng; Wang, Zunjing Jenipher] WIOMAX LLC, POB 540, Rockville, MD 20848 USA",,"Xie, XF (通讯作者)，WIOMAX LLC, POB 540, Rockville, MD 20848 USA.",xie@wiomax.com; wang@wiomax.com,"Babariya, Dheeraj/G-8663-2019; Xie, Xiao-Feng/AAH-4010-2019; Wang, Zunjing Jenipher/B-1038-2009","Xie, Xiao-Feng/0000-0002-7970-2974; Wang, Zunjing Jenipher/0000-0001-9518-6829",,,,,82,29,36,5,59,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Using a panel of Spanish municipalities, along with a close-elections regression discontinuity design, we find that single-party majorities run budgets with a 1.5% point larger primary surplus than that of coalitions. In addition, we show that lower deficits are driven mainly by single-party majority governments' capacity to raise more revenues. These findings are robust to several model specifications.","[Artes, Joaquin] Univ Complutense, Dept Appl Econ 4, Ciudad Univ S-N, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Jurado, Ignacio] Univ York, Dept Polit, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",Complutense University of Madrid; University of York - UK,"Jurado, I (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Polit, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",jartes@ucm.es; ignacio.jurado@york.ac.uk,,"Jurado, Ignacio/0000-0003-2439-3817","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CSO2013-40870-R, CSO2017-82881-R]",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"We would like to thank Albert Falco-Gimeno, Elias Dinas, Sandra Leon, Jeffrey Timmons, Didac Queralt, Pedro Riera, and Gilles Serra for helpful comments on previous drafts of this paper.

Assuming that managers make profit-maximizing decisions in the absence of a campaign, firms that accede to divestors' demands raise short-run share prices but depress long-run profits. Managers who are more interested in short-run prices are therefore more motivated by divestment than managers who care about long-run profits. We show that, as most managerial compensation contracts reward long-run profitability and stock returns, divestment can be ineffective at best, and perhaps counterproductive, rewarding managers who attract divestment campaigns. In a quantification exercise, we show that the wealth of most executives running likely divestment targets in 2015 would be unaffected by even large movements in share prices. Of those affected, a substantial majority would benefit from divestment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

What is less understood is whether and how such salience effects depend on the magnitude of the tax. We conduct a laboratory shopping experiment with real stakes to study the effect of tax size on salience. We find no evidence that salience effects decline as the tax rate increases; we document a statistically significant salience effect at a tax rate that is considerably larger than the tax rates at which such effects have been previously documented. In fact, our results are more consistent with the hypothesis that higher taxes make consumers less attentive (at least for the range of taxes we consider). This result can be explained by a confirmation bias theory of salience: consumers tend to disregard information (like a tax) that does not align with their intention to purchase an item, and this lack of alignment increases in the size of the tax.","[Feldman, Naomi] Fed Reserve Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA; [Goldin, Jacob] Stanford Law Sch, Stanford, CA USA; [Homonoff, Tatiana] NYU, Robert F Wagner Grad Sch Publ Serv, New York, NY 10003 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors; Stanford University; New York University,"Feldman, N (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",naomi.e.feldman@frgb.gov; jsgoldin@law.stanford.edu; tatiana.homonoff@nyu.edu,,,Princeton Industrial Relations Section and Princeton Lab for Experimental Social Science,Princeton Industrial Relations Section and Princeton Lab for Experimental Social Science,"We thank Taylor Cranor, Henry Farber, David Lee, Alexandre Mas, Baxter Oliphant, Daniel Reck, Bradley Ruffle, Erez Semaria, and numerous seminar and conference participants for helpful suggestions.

This paper assesses and compares the development trends in employment and average wages in the regions of Slovakia and the Czech Republic, and defines development differences over a selected time period: 2007-2016. We used statistical indicators to monitor the observed phenomenon variability by means of setting the minimum, maximum and average variation ranges and coefficients. To set a position, from descriptive characteristics a simple arithmetic mean was used. From the results of the analyses, it can be seen that significant regional differences exist in the Czech and Slovak labour markets due to different primary potentials, different possibilities of development, economic structures, demographic differences and levels of infrastructure. The situation in the Czech labour market is better than in Slovakia, and the differences among regions are smaller in the Czech Republic.

This paper provides a model for the simultaneous prediction of continuous default times and multi-year LGDs. These measures are paramount to predict term structures of LGDs and Lifetime Expected Losses for the revised loan loss provisioning framework of IFRS 9 and US GAAP (current expected credit loss, CECL). The model includes a variation of copulas and corrects for sample selection bias of LGDs, which are only observed given a default event. We find empirical evidence that bonds which default closer to origination tend to generate higher LGDs. The model enables more precise estimates of Lifetime Expected Losses and prevents a severe underestimation in contrast to more restricted credit risk models. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, these programs have not been designed to evaluate which ingredients of the interventions are most essential to improve literacy outcomes. Policy makers therefore lack evidence as to whether program ingredients such as teacher professional development (PD), instructional coaching, learner materials, teachers' guides, community support, or technology are required for program impact. The Kenya Primary Math and Reading Initiative was a randomized controlled trial that compared three treatment groups with specific ingredients and a control group. Using literacy and numeracy outcome measures for grades 1 and 2, we evaluated the benefits of the following ingredients: (1) teacher PD and teacher instructional support and coaching; (2) revised student books in literacy and numeracy, at a 1:1 ratio, added to PD and instructional support; and (3) structured teacher lesson plans added to student books, PD, and instructional support. We found that two of the three combinations of ingredients had statistically significant positive impacts on learning outcomes. The results showed that the third combination-PD, teacher instructional support and coaching, 1:1 student books, and structured teacher lesson plans-was most effective. A cost-effectiveness analysis on the ingredients showed that the option of PD and instructional support, 1:1 revised books, and teachers' guides was the most expensive, but that the additional impact on learning made this the most cost-effective intervention. This study rigorously analyzes which ingredients for literacy and numeracy improvement would be most effective for overall impact, and suggests to policy makers that careful decisions regarding program ingredients will lead to more effectively designed and implemented interventions to improve learning in developing countries.

They are seen to provide a much lower cost option of mass mobility than fixed rail or underground systems which developing countries struggle to afford. Whilst BRT systems have undoubtedly been seen to be successful from a transport system perspective, they are more than a transport system innovation. They are often introduced to replace what is seen to be a failing, unsafe and poorly regulated informal transit system. This paper therefore focuses on the process of BRT introduction as a governance reform. The paper draws on African experience where adoption of BRT has been slow relative to South America and South East Asia. Using an in-depth analysis of the introduction of a new system in Ghana and data on levels of governance maturity across the African sub-continent, the paper finds that to understand BRT implementation requires an understanding of how the incumbent transport regime could and will be able to be reorganized. The success of BRT systems that result will depend at least as much on how the reforms are achieved as it will on the usual design concerns which typically occupy transport planners.","[Poku-Boansi, Michael] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Planning, Fac Built Environm, Kumasi, Ghana; [Marsden, Greg] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; University of Leeds,"Poku-Boansi, M (通讯作者)，Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Planning, Fac Built Environm, Kumasi, Ghana.",mpoku-boansi.cap@knust.edu.gh; G.R.Marsden@its.leeds.ac.uk,"Poku-Boansi, Michael/AGZ-8640-2022","Poku-Boansi, Michael/0000-0003-4929-0961; Marsden, Greg/0000-0003-3570-2793",Commonwealth Scholarship Secretariat [GHCF-2016-13],Commonwealth Scholarship Secretariat,"The authors would like to acknowledge the support from the Commonwealth Scholarship Secretariat for the support granted the corresponding author during his Academic Fellowship (GHCF-2016-13) at the Institute for Transport Studies, University of Leeds.

However, the standard policy tools, such as technical assistance and material aid, are routinely criticized for failing to achieve their objectives. The rare exception is paralegal aid, which is almost universally lauded by policymakers and scholars as effective in promoting the rule of law and access to justice. This belief, however, rests on a very limited empirical foundation regarding what paralegal programs accomplish and under what theory they operate. This paper critically examines the conventional wisdom surrounding paralegal initiatives through case studies of two successful paralegal programs in post-conflict Timor-Leste that are broadly representative of the type of initiatives commonly implemented in developing countries. These programs did improve access to justice services, bolster choice between dispute resolution forums, and increase local knowledge of progressive norms on human rights and women's rights. Yet, as this article shows, even successful programs can expect to achieve only incremental gains in promoting the rule of law because advances largely depend on alignment with the priorities of powerful state and non-state actors, donors, program implementers, and paralegals themselves. To date, the literature has not acknowledged these limitations. This article addresses this gap by demonstrating that paralegal aid faces multiple challenges that mean paralegals cannot necessarily transcend or modify deep seated norms and power structures. These issues include principal agent-problems due to the extensive delegation required, internal limitations resulting from paralegals' limited authority and independence, and external constraints from state and non-state justice actors. Paralegal programs also face program design, implementation, and sustainability challenges. Consequently, scholars, practitioners, and policymakers need to adopt a more balanced view of paralegal aid. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We find IPOs backed by government-controlled VCs exhibit severe IPO-year EM, which is driven by those VCs exiting their investments immediately after the VC lock-up expiration. In contrast, IPOs with politically connected private VCs have lower IPO-year EM and are not associated with VC exits. Therefore, IPOs with government-controlled VCs who immediately exit their investments are most likely to engage in 'window-dressing' of financial performance, and to have poorer long-run stock performance.

Uniform tick sizes constrain price competition and create rents for liquidity provision, particularly for securities with lower prices. The time priority rule allocates rents to high-frequency traders (HFTs) because of their speed advantage. An increase in relative tick size, defined as uniform tick sizes divided by security prices, increases the fraction of liquidity provided by HFTs but harms liquidity. We find that the message-to-trade ratio is a poor cross-sectional proxy for HFTs' liquidity provision: stocks with more liquidity provided by HFTs have lower message-to-trade ratios.","[Yao, Chen] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Ye, Mao] Univ Illinois, 340 Wohlers Hall,1206 South 6th St, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Ye, Mao] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Chinese University of Hong Kong; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Ye, M (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, 340 Wohlers Hall,1206 South 6th St, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",maoye@illinois.edu,"wu, jialin/JPY-4408-2023",,National Science Foundation [1352936]; Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE); XSEDE Extended Collaborative Support Service program; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1352936] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE); XSEDE Extended Collaborative Support Service program; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),"We thank NASDAQ OMX for providing the data.

We study the GH model's moment properties of the associated risk-neutral distribution of logarithmic spot returns, and obtain an explicit pricing formula for European options facilitated by the time-change Levy process construction. Using S&P 500 Index European options during low and high volatility sample periods, we compare the GH model empirically with existing benchmark models such as the finite-moment log-stable model and the Black-Scholes model.

Three scenarios emerge from this setting, namely: the standard tariff war, the export tax war and a mixed scenario-the tariff-export tax war-where one country applies a Nash tariff, while the other imposes an export tax. In this setting, countries derive their market power not only from their relative endowment size, but also from their subsistence consumptions. As a consequence, a large country does not necessarily win a trade war if it has a substantially higher consumption requirement than the small country. This finding explains why large economies sign trade agreements with small counterparts that prohibit the use of tariffs and export taxes.","[Kilolo, Jean-Marc Malambwe] UPN, Route Matadi,Ave Liberat Quartier Binza, Kinshasa 8815, DEM REP CONGO",,"Kilolo, JMM (通讯作者)，UPN, Route Matadi,Ave Liberat Quartier Binza, Kinshasa 8815, DEM REP CONGO.",malambwe@yahoo.com,"Kilolo, Jean-Marc Malambwe/AAU-1967-2021","Kilolo, Jean-Marc Malambwe/0000-0001-7671-2360",,,,,36,1,1,1,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

The data and analysis were prepared to include measures at different spatial scales, including measures of density/accessibility and infrastructure provision for network distances from up to 1 km to up to 5 km from the origin of a trip, as well as the regional position of the city. The probability of cycling is affected by urban structure variables at the local, urban and regional scale. The local scale, which includes the positive effects from population density and cycling infrastructures, is the most important in influencing cycling, but there are substantial additional contributions from access to retail and train stations within a range of 3-4 km, as well as from the relative size of the city within the region. The effect of the regional scale most likely reflects the reliance upon motorized modes to connect to distant important nodes.

Eschewing the need to endow a group with its own preferences, this paper argues that an operational notion of coordination can serve such a role. Coordination is an intrinsically group-level concept that is complementary to, but distinct from, the intrinsically individual notion of performance. Both group rationality as manifest by coordination and individual rationality as manifest by performance are necessary for a full understanding of group behavior in social environments. Conditional game theory provides a flexible mathematical framework within which individuals may modulate their preferences in response to the social influence that others exert on them. As social influence diffuses throughout a social network, a comprehensive social model emerges that provides an operational definition of group rationality as well as an operational concept of augmented individual rationality that together establish a concept of coordinated reasoning.","[Stirling, Wynn C.] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Tummolini, Luca] Italian Natl Res Council, Inst Cognit Sci & Techonol, Rome, Italy",Brigham Young University; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR),"Stirling, WC (通讯作者)，Brigham Young Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Provo, UT 84602 USA.",wynn_stirling@byu.edu; luca.tummolini@istc.cnr.it,"Tummolini, Luca/A-5086-2010","Tummolini, Luca/0000-0001-7791-0457",,,,,31,1,1,0,0,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,2105-2883,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

We develop a tool to estimate tropical cyclone-induced fatalities in the Philippine provinces, and to explain the variability of these fatalities across provinces using an evidence-based approach. We construct a new provincial-level panel dataset, and use statistical methods to assess the influence of socioeconomic vulnerability (i.e., levels of economic and social development, urbanization, governance), exposure (i.e., population, topography, and geography), and hazard characteristics (i.e., rainfall volume and wind speed) on the resulting fatalities from tropical cyclones. We find strong evidence that socioeconomic development and good local governance reduces disaster fatalities, while unplanned urbanization is associated with more fatalities. Exposure, including topography, and tropical cyclone strength are likewise important determinants of fatalities. However, disaster fatalities appear to be influenced much more by socioeconomic vulnerability and exposure, than by the hazard itself. We quantify this difference in order to contribute to policy planning at national and subnational scales.","[Yonson, Rio; Noy, Ilan] Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand; [Gaillard, J.

Before 2008, the European Central Bank used shadow banking to create a single safe asset that we term shadow money, and in doing so also erased borders between Euro area government bond markets. Lacking appropriate ECB support, shadow euros could not withstand the pressures of the global financial crisis and brought down several periphery euro government bonds with them. Two new plans, the Capital Markets Union and the Sovereign Bond-Backed Securities, again turn to shadow banking, this time by using securitization to generate an entirely private safe asset or a public-private safe asset. Such plans cannot solve the enduring predicament of EMU's bond markets architecture: that Member States have competed for investors (liquidity) since the introduction of the euro, betraying a deep hostility towards collective political solutions to the single safe asset problem. Technocratic-led, market-based initiatives need to persuade EMU states that there is little threat to their ability to issue debt in liquid markets. Without ECB interventions, market-based engineering of single safe assets runs the danger of repeatedly destabilizing national bond markets.","[Gabor, Daniela] Univ West England, Coldharbour Lane 16, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England; [Vestergaard, Jakob] Danish Inst Int Studies, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of West England; Aarhus University; Danish Institute for International Studies,"Gabor, D (通讯作者)，Univ West England, Coldharbour Lane 16, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England.",daniela.gabor@uwe.ac.uk,,,Foundation for European Progressive Studies under the grant the Capital Markets Union; Institute of New Economic Thinking under the grant Managing Shadow Money,Foundation for European Progressive Studies under the grant the Capital Markets Union; Institute of New Economic Thinking under the grant Managing Shadow Money,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors would like to thank the Foundation for European Progressive Studies for generous research support under the grant the Capital Markets Union and the Institute of New Economic Thinking for generous research support under the grant Managing Shadow Money.",,95,33,34,1,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

Does the uneven distribution mean that not everyone benefits from new technologies to the same extent, or do some people experience an absolute disadvantage during this process? I explore this question through the case study of curative healthcare access in the context of rapid mobile phone uptake in rural India, contributing thus to an important yet surprisingly under -researched aspect of the social implications of (mobile) technology diffusion. Inspired by a previous analysis of cross-sectional data from rural India, I hypothesise that health systems increasingly adapt to mobile phone users where phones have diffused widely. This adaptation will leave poor non-adopters worse off than before and increases healthcare inequities. I use a panel of 12,003 rural households with an illness in 2005 and 2012 from the Indian Human Development Survey to test this hypothesis. Based on village-cluster, robust fixed-effects linear probability models, I find that (a) mobile phone diffusion is significantly and negatively linked to various forms of rural healthcare access, suggesting that health systems increasingly adapt to phone use and discriminate against non-users; that (b) poor rural households without mobile phones experience more adverse effects compared to more affluent households, which indicates a struggle and competition for healthcare access among marginalised groups; and that (c) no effects emerge for access to public doctors, which implies that some healthcare providers are less responsive to mobile phone use than others. Overall, my findings indicate that the rural Indian healthcare system gradually adapts to increasing mobile phone use at the expense of non-users. I conclude that rapid mobile phone diffusion creates an opportunity to improve people's access to healthcare in rural India, but it also creates new forms of marginalisation among poor rural households.

Regarding the CDS spreads, we find very little discernible direct impact of the Greek credit event on CDS spreads overall. This finding provides some further evidence that the Greek credit event was well anticipated by most market participants. However, we find several significant changes in the Greek CDS network structure following the credit event: the number of connections via exposures declined significantly, the directionality of the positions (net long vs net short) of the main groups of market participants reversed, while none of the non-banks returned to trade Greek CDSs until the last observation of dataset (October 2014). Regarding indirect effects to other CDS markets, we find evidence of temporary spill-over effects on CDS reference entities with credit risk associated with the risk of the Greek sovereign. In particular, the market and counterparty structures changed temporarily with all types of traders decreasing their exposures to the EU periphery sovereign reference entities and also changing their trading counterparties, while after some time, the structure of the market returned to a similar one observed before the credit event. Finally, we find some support for the bank-sovereign nexus, as there was a consistent retreat from the CDS exposures on banks in the EU periphery countries, contrary to banks residing in the other EU countries.

During a financial crisis, however, the effect of market power on liquidity risk varies across bank size. Small banks with greater market power reduce liquidity risk while large banks with greater market power do not change their liquidity risk-taking behavior.

This study presents data on the urban travel and mobility patterns of older adults in Shiraz, Iran - a country where the population is ageing faster than the average of western societies. The relationship between car use and sociodemographic and built environment variables is investigated through Ordinary Least Squares and Geographically Weighted Regression models. These models show that the main determinants of car use among older adults are: employment status; household size; car ownership rate; trip purpose; property prices; and mixed land-uses. Also, the study reveals that car dependency is significant and more pronounced among wealthier individuals, who tend to be clustered in the northern section of the city. The population density and road network design characteristics do not affect car use among older adults, while a mix of land-uses tends to attenuate car dependency. Gender gaps in car use are much wider than in the West, and some level of spatial mismatch between travel needs and car access is observed in the southern section of the city.

Their mobility behavior was examined using a one-week travel diary in a typical school week. This paper examines objective determinants (in particular settlement pattern and trip characteristics) of mode choice. We used a Bayesian approach for nonlinear Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) of binary response variables to assess the effects of external factors on the choice of travel modes. The focus lies on the competitiveness between car and transit. The results indicate that children's modal choices are influenced by trip length and the service quality of motorized modes. A key finding is that school trips and non-school trips are very different. School trips are quite affine to transit even in rural areas, given a sufficient service quality, which can easily be provided by a school bus system. Long school trips increase the frequency of transit use. Non-school trips, however, are much more affine to car ridership, if trip length exceeds the range for walking and cycling.","[Stark, Juliane; Fritz, Alexander; Unbehaun, Wiebke; Hoessinger, Reinhard] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Transport Studies, Dept Landscape Spatial & Infrastruct Sci, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Bartana, Ilil Beyer] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Inst Transport Res Mobil & Urban Dev, Cologne, Germany","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR)","Stark, J (通讯作者)，Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Transport Studies, Dept Landscape Spatial & Infrastruct Sci, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.",juliane.stark@boku.ac.at; ilil.beyerbartana@dlr.de; a.fritz@students.boku.ac.at; wiebke.unbehaun@boku.ac.at; reinhard.hoessinger@boku.ac.at,,"Hossinger, Reinhard/0000-0002-0090-0573; Stark, Juliane/0000-0001-6597-8163",Federal Ministry of Science and Research [SPA 04-025],Federal Ministry of Science and Research,"This paper documents the survey conducted as a part of an Austrian national research project calls UNTERWEGS being funded by the Federal Ministry of Science and Research (SPA 04-025) encouraging the cooperation between universities and schools.

We examine its effect on labor market responses, marital dissolution, and the decision making process regarding the use of money. The assignment mechanism to the AFAM-PE exogenously alters the distribution of non-labor income across applicant households by targeting the monetary transfer (usually) to the female spouse. Our identification strategy exploits both the female targeting and a discontinuity in eligibility for enrollment into the program. Based on a regression discontinuity design and on a follow-up survey matched with program's administrative records, this study finds that the program has significant negative effects on the formality choice of women at the eligibility cut-off. These responses seem to be associated with a lower rate of moving from unregistered jobs to formality. We also find suggestive evidence that the program results in women taking greater (perceived) responsibility for decisions in specific spheres of household expenditures. This study, represents one of the first efforts to analyze the distributional effects of CCT programs on different couples members' behavioral responses. It offers relevant considerations for the ongoing debate about the impacts of these kind of programs on women's agency in developing countries, suggesting the need to discuss new designs for social assistance that reduce discouraging effects on formality.

Bias corrected efficiency estimates for the individual MFIs are regressed on a set of explanatory variables (including governance and gender) employing the double bootstrap truncated regression approach (Simar and Wilson, 2007) and panel data regression. First stage results suggest that South Asian MFIs are more financially efficient than socially efficient. More precisely, we find that these MFIs are technically inefficient but scale efficient, and that there was some improvement in financial efficiency over time. The relatively low average efficiency scores show that there is quite a bit of variation in microfinance efficiency. Second stage regression reveals that female loan officers are positive determinants of MFIs' efficiency. We find a strong association between a MFI's governance and its financial and social efficiency. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Bibi, Uzma; Tripe, David W.

Using the introduction of short sales in China as an exogenous event, we show that short sales also serve as an effective mechanism in curbing expropriation by the controlling large shareholder. The disciplinary effect is more pronounced for firms with higher ownership concentration and bankruptcy risk, and it is muted when alternative governance mechanisms are in place. Our paper provides new insights into the effects of short sales in the corporate governance domain, specifically in mitigating the agency costs between controlling and minority shareholders.

Using a large sample of startups founded in 2004, we find that businesses organized as corporations had very different acquisition outcomes than those organized as sole proprietorships. These different acquisition outcomes could be explained by differences in innovation and growth potential in the startup year as well throughout the business' lifetime. Our results suggest that higher innovation and employment growth explain the likelihood of M&A exit for new, young corporations but not for sole proprietorships. These results indicate that acquirers value the growth potential signaled by corporations through intellectual property rights and growth in employment and, therefore, businesses with high quality innovations are the most attractive targets for acquisitions. Young corporations with external equity investors are more likely to become M&A targets, as angels or venture capitalists have the first opportunity to liquidate some or all their equity holdings when the business becomes an acquisition target. Our results also show that young corporations owned by serial entrepreneurs are more likely to become M&A targets. From an acquirer's perspective, entrepreneurs with startup experience are typically favored due to their proven ability to realize the growth potential of a venture as well as their willingness and ability to harvest value for themselves and their investors.","[Cotei, Carmen] Univ Hartford, 200 Bloomfield Ave, Hartford, CT 06117 USA; [Farhat, Joseph] Cent Connecticut State Univ, 1615 Stanley St, New Britain, CT 06050 USA",University of Hartford; Connecticut State University System; Central Connecticut State University,"Cotei, C (通讯作者)，Univ Hartford, 200 Bloomfield Ave, Hartford, CT 06117 USA.",cotei@hartford.edu,"Farhat, Joseph/HJH-3080-2023","Farhat, Joseph/0000-0002-3715-8202",Barney School of Business at the University of Hartford; Kauffman Foundation,Barney School of Business at the University of Hartford; Kauffman Foundation,"Carmen Cotei gratefully acknowledges financial support from the Barney School of Business at the University of Hartford.

Higher inequality is thought to increase demand for income redistribution in democracies and to discourage democratization and promote class conflict and revolution in dictatorships. Most such arguments crucially assume that ordinary people know how high inequality is, how it has been changing, and where they fit in the income distribution. Using a variety of large, cross-national surveys, we show that, in recent years, ordinary people have had little idea about such things. What they think they know is often wrong. Widespread ignorance and misperceptions emerge robustly, regardless of data source, operationalization, and measurement method. Moreover, perceived inequalitynot the actual levelcorrelates strongly with demand for redistribution and reported conflict between rich and poor. We suggest that most theories about political effects of inequality need to be reframed as theories about effects of perceived inequality.","[Gimpelson, Vladimir] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia; [Gimpelson, Vladimir] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Treisman, Daniel] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Polit Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Treisman, Daniel] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Treisman, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Polit Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",treisman@polisci.ucla.edu,"Gimpelson, Vladimir/F-8863-2016","Gimpelson, Vladimir/0000-0003-3952-4701",NRU HSE Basic Research Program; UCLA College of Letters and Sciences,NRU HSE Basic Research Program; UCLA College of Letters and Sciences,"V.

We argue that family firms proactively engage in social outreach activities as a strategy to ensure smooth succession. We focus on corporate philanthropy (CP), a social outreach activity, in a family firm succession to test our hypothesis. The results show that family firms engage in a strategy of using more CP in connection to family firm succession, especially when the successor is from the second generation. The findings are robust to alternative specifications of CP activities, various sub-sample analyses, using a difference-in-differences analysis, a two-stage least square approach, strategic choice on timing of succession, and accounting for the successor's education and experience of working for the family firm before succession. We document that despite generally poorer performance after succession, a family firm with a second-generation CEO that engages in CP exhibits better market and accounting performance relative to other types of transitions, suggesting a strategy in which CP reduces the magnitude of poor performance after succession.

The present study examined the relationships between financial strain and couple functioning of middle-aged, young-old, and old-old people using the 2010 Health and Retirement Study. Findings show that subjective financial strain was positively associated with partner undermining and negatively with partner support, controlling for the effects of objective financial situations among middle-aged, young-old, and old-old couples. There were gender and age differences in the interaction effects of financial strain and financial control on couple functioning. For middle-aged men, financial control may have different associations with couple behaviors depending on the level of financial strain. When the level of financial strain is high, the positive effect of financial control disappears and the effect changes even in a negative way.

We also investigate the possible existence of profit complementarities between non interest activities and lending. Using quarterly data on 6921 U.S. commercial banks between 2007:Q3 to 2016:Q3 we find that non-interest activities have no adverse influence on bank credit risk. This is the case for banks of different asset size (including systemically important banks) as well as for distressed banks. There is evidence that banks with assets between $100 million and $1 billion that have a greater share of fiduciary income have lower credit risk. They also have lower interest rates on loans secured by real estate, and higher franchise values, particularly post-crisis. Moreover, banks in the aforementioned size range benefit from synergies in joint production of non-interest income and lending, whereas other banks, in particular smaller banks (below $100 million in assets) suffer from diseconomies of joint production. Larger banks exhibit cross-subsidization between several non-interest activities and lending business. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

With debt in place, shareholders pervasively resist leverage reductions no matter how much such reductions may enhance firm value. Shareholders would instead choose to increase leverage even if the new debt is junior and would reduce firm value. These asymmetric forces in leverage adjustments, which we call the leverage ratchet effect, cause equilibrium leverage outcomes to be history-dependent. If forced to reduce leverage, shareholders are biased toward selling assets relative to potentially more efficient alternatives such as pure recapitalizations.","[Admati, Anat R.; DeMarzo, Peter M.; Pfleiderer, Paul] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hellwig, Martin F.] Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Bonn, Germany",Stanford University; Max Planck Society,"DeMarzo, PM (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,,"Admati, Anat/0000-0002-9201-4017",Max Planck Research Award from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research,Max Planck Research Award from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research,"Admati, DeMarzo, and Pfleiderer are from the Graduate School of Business, Stanford University.

The results show that litigation affects a firm's creditworthiness and debt costs in two stages. Before a lawsuit filing, firms at higher risk of litigation have lower credit ratings, are more likely to be rated speculative grade, pay higher yields on loans and bonds, and are less likely to rely on debt financing. At the time of the lawsuit resolution, settlement costs have an additional effect on firm credit quality. Companies facing larger settlement disbursements in relation to their available cash experience a decline in credit ratings and an increase in yield spread.

The crowding-out pattern holds across firms with different relationship banks within a given country.

This creates an adverse selection problem, decreasing the supply of high-quality assets, and lowering valuations by nonspecialist (uninformed) investors, who become unwilling to supply capital to support the price.

J,"Leigland, J",,,,"Leigland, James",,,Public-Private Partnerships in Developing Countries: The Emerging Evidence-based Critique,WORLD BANK RESEARCH OBSERVER,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Advocates of public-private partnerships (PPPs) for infrastructure services in developing countries have long battled criticism of these arrangements by civil society groups. The view among PPP advocates generally has been that these criticisms are mostly ideological polemics that mix opinion with selected but often misinterpreted facts. But over the last two decades, as the experience with PPPs has increased in both developed and developing countries, a different kind of critique has emerged, one that is based on non-ideological empirical research, and is sometimes expressed by PPP advocates. These studies often focus on individual aspects of PPPs, and usually do not claim to be PPP evaluations or express opinions on the overall value of PPPs. Taken together, a powerful, evidence-based critique of PPPs is emerging, but one that is more measured than much of the criticism of the last two decades. This new critique recognizes many cases in which PPPs have not been successful, but also some situations in which PPPs can generate value for money. Because of its critical tone, some of this research is now regularly cited by the civil society critics of PPPs, giving their arguments more weight than was the case a decade ago. This paper attempts to summarize some of the most compelling examples of this kind of emerging critique, and uses the summary to assess the practicality of the G20's recent advocacy of large, transformational PPPs as tools for dealing effectively with infrastructure challenges in low-income countries.",,,,,,,,,,,79,51,57,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0257-3032,1564-6971,,WORLD BANK RES OBSER,World Bank Res.

This study uses well-level enrollment data to explore the factors that influence landowner participation in the Colorado Republican River Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program. An empirical model of enrollment is informed by a theoretical model of participation that incorporates aquifer and soil characteristics in addition to financial incentives.

I approximate the value of co-benefits to these policies that arise from concomitant reductions in nongreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using the CO-Benefits Risk Assessment model (COBRA). There is significant heterogeneity in costs and co-benefits from climate policies across space and income. Policy costs are generally less than 0.5% in equivalent variation terms (between a few tens of dollars and several hundred per household, depending on the income quintile), can be fully neutralized for the lowest-quintile households at a modest increase in overall policy cost, and tend to be lower for upper-quintile households in coastal regions. The policy co-benefit values range widely across regions, approximately $150-1250 per household, exceeding the gross cost of the policy for many households, particularly those in the Midwest. Last, I identify a marginal welfare cost of $58/tCO(2) and a marginal co-benefit of $31/tCO(2) at a national level over all households, which implies a required climate benefit of $27/tCO(2) or less to justify the level of abatement achieved by a $25/tCO(2) tax growing at 5%.","[Woollacott, Jared] RTI Int, 3040 East Cornwallis Rd,12194, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA",Research Triangle Institute,"Woollacott, J (通讯作者)，RTI Int, 3040 East Cornwallis Rd,12194, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",Jwoollacott@rti.org,,,,,,,19,13,14,6,52,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2010-0078,2010-0086,,CLIM CHANG ECON,Clim.

The purpose of this paper is to analyse the socio-economic effects of the large remittance inflows in 12 remittance-dependent MENA countries. Design/methodology/approach - This study uses the vector autoregressive model and Granger causality test on the entire set of labour-exporting MENA countries, and covers the period 1991-2015. It also exploits nine (dependent) variables that represent the economic developments, external balance, employment, and the potential uses of remittances in these countries. Findings - The study shows a positive and significant impact running from remittances to gross domestic product and household expenditures. On the other hand, the authors found that an increase in inflation or a decline in economic conditions result in a considerable increase in remittance inflows, proving the counter-cyclical nature of these transfers. Originality/value - In addition of examining an understudied region, the paper provided many interesting concepts regarding the form of association between remittances and receiving countries' economic conditions, and the relationship dynamics between remittances on one hand and several macro-economic and social variables on the other.","[Awdeh, Ali] Univ Libanaise, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Beirut, Lebanon",Lebanese University,"Awdeh, A (通讯作者)，Univ Libanaise, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Beirut, Lebanon.",ali.awdeh@ul.edu.lb,,,,,,,42,5,5,0,2,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

J,"Azzimonti, M",,,,"Azzimonti, Marina",,,Partisan conflict and private investment,JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,UNCERTAINTY,"American politics have been characterized by a high degree of partisan conflict in recent years. Combined with a divided government, this has led not only to significant Congressional gridlock, but also to spells of high fiscal policy uncertainty. The unusually slow recovery from the Great Recession during the same period suggests the possibility that the two phenomena may be related. In this paper, I investigate the hypothesis that political discord depresses private investment. To this end, I construct a novel high-frequency indicator of partisan conflict. The partisan conflict index (PCI) uses a semantic search methodology to measure the frequency of newspaper articles reporting lawmakers' disagreement about policy. I find a negative relationship between the PCI and aggregate investment in the US. Moreover, the decline is persistent, which may help explain the slow recovery observed since the 2007 recession ended. Partisan conflict is also associated with lower capital investment rates at the firm level, even when economic policy uncertainty and macroeconomic conditions are controlled for. I estimate that about 27% of the decline in corporate investment between 2007-2009 can be attributed to a rise in partisan conflict. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

They are certainly more difficult to govern due to the complexification of states' apparatus (under the double dynamics of neoliberalisation and decentralisation), cities' larger size, massive poverty, and informality. Yet, the ungovernability thesis arguably stems from a theoretical shift, from local government to urban governance, that has rendered the questions of steering, political choices, and accountability almost impossible to conceptualise. Unpacking the policy instruments used to govern street trading in Johannesburg, the paper shows that its so-called ungovernability' was largely manufactured by municipal choices.","[Benit-Gbaffou, Claire] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Architecture & Planning, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Benit-Gbaffou, Claire] Univ Witwatersrand, CUBES, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand; University of Witwatersrand,"Bénit-Gbaffou, C (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, CUBES, Private Bag 3, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.;Bénit-Gbaffou, C (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Architecture & Planning, Private Bag 3, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.",claire.benit@wits.ac.za,,"Benit-Gbaffou, Claire/0000-0001-8827-2462",South African National Research Foundation,South African National Research Foundation(National Research Foundation - South Africa),This work was supported by the South African National Research Foundation.,,75,11,13,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

The activity of credit organizations affects all processes occurring in the economic life of society and the state, both monetary circulation for commercial purposes, and banking operations with budgetary funds. Banks in Russia operate in conditions of increased commercial risks, including the risk of bankruptcy. Most often, the bankruptcy of a credit organization arises from the impossibility of meeting the increasingly stringent requirements of a financial regulator. The bankruptcy of a credit organization also occurs as a result of illegal actions (inaction) of its owners, the head, and management bodies. In the event of a bankruptcy of a credit organization, the bank becomes fully satisfied with the claims of all creditors. The changes made to the Russian bankruptcy law in 2017 clarified the procedure and rules for bringing to the subsidiary responsibility of persons controlling the credit organization in the event that the credit organisation's own funds are insufficient to meet the requirements of all creditors. Methods and methodology - The authors of the article rely on the general principles of the system of social security. The research methodology includes: a review of academic literature, open information sources, materials of judicial and arbitration practice, an analytical approach to solving the problem on the basis of the work of domestic experts. Research results - The authors have revealed the problems of application of the bankruptcy law and suggested ways of eliminating them in view of the established judicial practice. Legislative changes related to vicarious liability not only affect the effectiveness of bankruptcy procedures of a credit organization, but also correct the vector of further development of corporate governance mechanisms in the banking sector in the direction of increasing the personal responsibility of persons taking managerial decisions and those controlling the credit organization. The scope of results - The conducted research develops the theory of bankruptcy of credit organizations and refines the legal regulation of the vicarious liability. Novelty - The authors revealed the shortcomings of the Russian legislation. This can be resolved both by amending the procedural legislation, and by clarifying the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation. Conclusions - Law enforcement practice of bankruptcy of credit organizations indicates a lack of legal regulation of the organization in question and the emergence of legal conflicts. In this regard, there is uncertainty about which of the persons should be brought to subsidiary responsibility in the bankruptcy of the credit organization, in particular, whether actual beneficiary of the credit organization could be brought to justice.","[Burova, Inna] Assoc Attorneys Lebedeva Burova & Partners, Moscow, Russia; [Burova, Inna] Dept Justice Russian Federat, Moscow, Russia; [Burova, Inna] Russian State Social Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Zhesterov, Pavel] Russian State Social Univ, Dept Adm Justice Courts Gen Jurisdict, Moscow, Russia",Russian State Social University (RSSU); Russian State Social University (RSSU),"Burova, I (通讯作者)，Assoc Attorneys Lebedeva Burova & Partners, Moscow, Russia.;Burova, I (通讯作者)，Dept Justice Russian Federat, Moscow, Russia.;Burova, I (通讯作者)，Russian State Social Univ, Moscow, Russia.",burova_inna@bk.ru; zhesterov@mail.ru,"Инна, Бурова/AAG-2684-2019",,,,,,19,0,0,1,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,685,690,,,,,,6,Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BM5GU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000464906000076,0

Our study contributes to the literature by using new measure to test how client importance affect audit quality and adding new evidence on the determinants of audit quality at the partner level.","[Chen, Songsheng; Li, Zheng] Beijing Inst Technol, Dept Accounting, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chi, Wuchun] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Accounting, Taipei, Taiwan",Beijing Institute of Technology; National Chengchi University,"Chi, WC (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Accounting, Taipei, Taiwan.",wchi@nccu.edu.tw,"Zhu, Jie/JAC-4621-2023; Zhu, Jie/HPI-1935-2023","Chen, Songsheng/0000-0001-6526-8903","National Natural Science Foundation of China [NSFC-7132016, 71672009]; Specialized Research Fund for Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China [SRFDP-20131101110053]; National Science Council [NSC 102-2410-H-004-022-MY2]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Specialized Research Fund for Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China(Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (SRFDP)); National Science Council(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","This work was financially supported by the Generic Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China [NSFC-7132016], [71672009]; Specialized Research Fund for Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China [SRFDP-20131101110053]; National Science Council [project number NSC 102-2410-H-004-022-MY2].",,47,4,4,2,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

Using a large sample of US firms, we find that REM is positively related to audit fees and that this relation is incremental over and beyond the effects of accrual-based earnings management and other control variables. We also find that the positive relation between REM and audit fees is stronger for firms with sophisticated investors or higher stock price sensitivity to accounting earnings. Finally, we find that this positive relation is more pronounced for firms with financial constraints where REM is more likely to stem from managerial opportunism and is perceived as riskier by auditors.

Specialty literature emphasizes that this concept is used to designate a journey whose motivation involves a medical procedure or activities that promote the physical and mental well-being of man. The growing presence of patients from the high-income countries in countries with emerging economies and developing economies is explained by the fact that these countries provide high-quality medical services at low costs (a phenomenon known as medical outsourcing). Increasing the flow of patients seeking treatments abroad is a global phenomenon, linked to economic development that generates income growth and education. Tourism is and must become a profitable business, we must struggle with us and with the competition of other international tourism operators to promote our national values and also to gain a recognized position and increase our profits.

This paper intends to explore several schemes for raising the public finance of the GCF among developed countries. Lessons from three main ongoing international financing mechanisms have been drawn, including the United Nations (UN) membership dues, Official Development Assistance (ODA), and the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The indexes that reflect historical emission responsibility (HR) and ability to pay (AP) are also used to share the burden. Results reveal that the ongoing international financing mechanisms vary in their burden sharing results and the shares of existing donors are driven by highly complex reasons. Weighting the HR, UN, and GEF approaches with the Preference Score Compromises (PSC) method could yield a compromise scheme in which the regional contributions are highly similar to those under the GCF initial resource mobilization from 2015 to 2018. GCF financing heavily depends on contributions from the developed countries even if the donor parties are extended to emerging economics. This paper also finds that the decision of the United States to withdraw from climate finance will significantly increase the burden for other donors, particularly for the European Union the contribution share of which is predicted to increase to nearly 14 percentage points. The schemes proposed in this study can provide a useful reference for GCF financing. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Regarding the joint effect, a positive and significant impact is also seen in both periods. The results are even more relevant for the second period(2008-2011) and we could therefore check how investments made during the current period of crisis have had a higher impact on market value. The relevance of our paper for academics and practitioners should be noted, as there were no previous similar studies in Spain relating investments in these types of intangibles and market value using IBEX-35 companies.

The main goal of the research was to find out how changes in tax rates and tax system influence corporate cash holdings. Beside determinants related to tax changes, the research included control variables indicated in literature as cash holdings determinants, such as: financial constraints, company's profitability, leverage, working capital strategy and economic environment uncertainty. The results show that cash holdings increases with growth in profit tax rate and decreases with growth in number of tax payments. Simplification of the tax system is accompanied by an increase in the level of cash holdings, however various effects of changes in particular factors were observed, such as cash holding decreases with growth in corporate income tax rate, but it increases with uncertainty measured by growth in numbers of hours required to prepare, file and pay taxes.","[Gryko, Jozefa Monika] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Gryko, JM (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Poznan, Poland.",jozefa.gryko@ue.poznan.pl,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-76228-9; 978-3-319-76227-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,191,198,,10.1007/978-3-319-76228-9_18,0.0,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1UI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448435600018,0

The analysis shows that the income tax and the tax on buildings occupy a very small share in the total local budget revenues (around 6%) which suggests that it is necessary to rethink the current building tax system that applies in our country.","[Ichim, Cristinel] Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Suceava, Romania",Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava,"Ichim, C (通讯作者)，Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Suceava, Romania.",cristineli@seap.usv.ro,"Ichim, Cristinel/IAP-8522-2023",,,,,,2,0,0,1,2,LUMEN PUBLISHING HOUSE,IASI,"2, TEPES VODA STR, IASI, 700 714, ROMANIA",,,978-1-910129-18-0,,,,2018,,,,,,,28,39,,10.18662/lumproc.59,0.0,,,12,Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BM9BY,,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470307900004,0

Xilingol is not only a natural barrier of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, but it is also located in the border area between China and Mongolia. With the increase of sandstorm occurrences in the Xilingol region in recent years, research that tracks the sand storms that have an influence on this area is of great importance. For this research, the author selects three weather stations in Xilingol, the Naran-Bulag, East Ujimqin Banner, and Erenhot. First, the distribution characteristics of the dust storms occurring between 1980 and 2015 are analyzed. Then, the back-trajectories of the storms occurring between 2006 and 2015 are analyzed using the HYSPLIT model. The results show that the storms are concentrated across the three stations during the months of March, April, and May, followed by the months of June, July, and August. The majority of dust storms occur in the month of April, accounting for 56%, 49%, and 41% of all the storms recorded by each station respectively. After the Naran-Bulag and East Ujimqin Banner regions, the Erenhot region, which lacks rainfall and canopy vegetation, has the most storms. Of all the storms in Xilingol, 82% follow a path from northwestern Mongolia to southeastern Mongolia towards the Xilingol Inner Mongolia and originate in the desert regions of southeastern Mongolia and the desert areas in southern Kazakhstan. In Erenhot, 92% of all the storms originate in Mongolia. The results of this research aim to provide evidence for ecological construction and environment protection in Xilingol.","[Bao, Tana; Yongmei] Inner Mongolia Normal Univ, Coll Geog Sci, Hohhot 010022, Peoples R China; [Jirigala, Buren; Bao, Tana; Yongmei] Mongolian Plateau Key Lab Disaster & Ecol Secur, Hohhot 010022, Inner Mongolia, Peoples R China; [Bao, Tana; Yongmei] Inner Mongolia Normal Univ, Inner Mongolian Key Lab Remote Sensing & Geog Inf, Hohhot 010022, Peoples R China",Inner Mongolia Normal University; Inner Mongolia Normal University,"Yongmei (通讯作者)，Inner Mongolia Normal Univ, Coll Geog Sci, Hohhot 010022, Peoples R China.;Yongmei (通讯作者)，Mongolian Plateau Key Lab Disaster & Ecol Secur, Hohhot 010022, Inner Mongolia, Peoples R China.;Yongmei (通讯作者)，Inner Mongolia Normal Univ, Inner Mongolian Key Lab Remote Sensing & Geog Inf, Hohhot 010022, Peoples R China.",yongmei2012@imnu.edu.cn,,,Inner Mongolia autonomous region [201502095]; national natural fund of science and technology plan projects; regional fund Science and Technology Innovation Guide Award Fund Project in Inner Mongolia 'Urban flood disaster monitoring and early warning management system development and product application' [41561009],Inner Mongolia autonomous region; national natural fund of science and technology plan projects; regional fund Science and Technology Innovation Guide Award Fund Project in Inner Mongolia 'Urban flood disaster monitoring and early warning management system development and product application',"This study obtained the Inner Mongolia autonomous region (201502095), national natural fund of science and technology plan projects, regional fund (project number: 41561009) Science and Technology Innovation Guide Award Fund Project in Inner Mongolia.",,6,0,0,0,3,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-574-0,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,66.0,,,,,,45,51,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448284700008,0

We use longitudinal data, where we observe self-employment entry, childbirths, and self-employment outcomes during the period 1995 to 2013. The main research question is whether women who have children when entering self-employment perform less well compared to women who do not have children at the time of self-employment entry. One reason to expect differences in outcomes is that childless women are less time constrained and could potentially invest more time in the business, which could affect outcomes. We find, contrary to our hypothesis, that women who had a child at the time of self-employment entry have higher incomes, higher revenues and more employees in their firms, while we find no difference in the exit rate out of self-employment.","[Joona, Pernilla Andersson] Stockholm Univ, Swedish Inst Social Res, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Joona, PA (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Swedish Inst Social Res, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",Pernilla.andersson.joona@sofi.su.se,,,Swedish Research Council (VR),Swedish Research Council (VR)(Swedish Research Council),"The author wants to thank Kristina Nystrom, Eskil Wadensjo, seminar participants at the Ratio Institute in Stockholm and two anonymous reviewers for comments on earlier version of the paper.

Indonesia is a geographically large country, and three different levels of unbundling co-exist. The first unbundling aligns with the industry-wise international division of labour in plantation agriculture, mining, and labour-intensive industries; the second aligns with where the task-wise international division of labour dominates mainly in machinery industries; and the third aligns with where face-to-face costs are reduced by the digital economy. We argue that the further upgrading of unbundling and the more effective use of advanced piecemeal technologies among different levels of unbundling will enable Indonesia to achieve rapid and equitable economic development. Overcoming distance is key for effectively using the mechanics of unbundling. We propose that three key elements are be promoted: enhancement of connectivity, development of the service sector, and improvement of the policy environment.","[Kimura, Fukunari; Chen, Lurong] Econ Res Inst ASEAN & East Asia, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Kimura, Fukunari] Keio Univ, Tokyo, Japan",Economic Research Institute ASEAN & East Asia; Keio University,"Kimura, F (通讯作者)，Econ Res Inst ASEAN & East Asia, Jakarta, Indonesia.;Kimura, F (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Tokyo, Japan.",,"Kimura, Fukunari/AAX-8044-2021",,,,,,31,3,3,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

Progressive liberalisation of international trade as an effect of numerous agreements establishing preferences results in freer trade of both commodities and services. However, new circumstances that occured as a result of the events of 2001 in the United States required more attention to security. It also applies to international trade in goods. The pursuit of liberalization with simultaneous increase in security influenced the creation of a new paradigm in international trade in goods - security and facilitation. The abovementioned changes had a significant influence on the model of customs control existing in the European Union. Currently, the main goal of the control is to ensure widely understood security of the Union's market, citizens and environment. Thus, since 2005 new solutions have been regularly introduced into the EU's customs law, and their aim is to increase the level of security of trade in goods, assuming preservation of the possibility to apply facilitation measures at the same time, e.g. the Authorised Economic Operator scheme or simplified customs procedures. The application of customs control based on the risk analysis forced the necessity to introduce legal solutions that aim to ensure the effective risk analysis. The aim of the article is to indicate and assess legal solutions on the level of the EU which adjust customs control to the binding paradigm security and facilitation. In the light of the abovementioned, the legal-dogmatic method was primarily applied in the process of writing this article.","[Laszuk, Miroslawa] Bialystok Tech Univ, Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Laszuk, M (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Bialystok, Poland.",m.laszuk@pb.edu.pl,,,,,,,18,0,0,1,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,108,115,,,,,,8,Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BM5GU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000464906000012,0

Countries have used economic sanctions to isolate North Korea from the benefits of international trade and finance. China, however, has not imposed the sanctions, and consequentially has offset the trade restrictions imposed by other countries. I hypothesize three channels by which North Korea could have responded in this context regional favoritism by the ruling elites, reallocation of commerce that reflects the trade diversion to China, and import substitution. Using nighttime lights from North Korea, I find that the capital city, trade hubs near China, and manufacturing cities become relatively brighter when sanctions increase. However, production shifts away from capital-intensive goods, potentially deterring industrial development. The results imply that despite the intention to target the ruling elites, sanctions may increase regional inequality at a cost to the already marginalized hinterlands.","[Lee, Yong Suk] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, 616 Serra St,Encina Hall E309, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Lee, YS (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, 616 Serra St,Encina Hall E309, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",yongslee@stanford.edu,,,,,,,33,47,52,5,44,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0094-1190,1095-9068,,J URBAN ECON,J.

Restaurants see the need to improve their green performance to achieve competitive advantage and sustainability goals. However, Restaurants' environmental performance not only stems from their internal green practices, but also depends on the cooperation among supply chain members. Thus, this study proposed a cost-sharing contract to coordinate a green supply chain (GSC) between a restaurant and a supplier through developing a Stackelberg game model. Two kinds of uncertainties are considered in this model, namely, the green level of products by restaurants and the supplier's green level of materials. The research results show that a cost-sharing contract can increase profit for the whole GSC and successfully coordinate the restaurant supply chain.","[Li Xiaoying] Dalian Univ, Coll Tourism, Dalian 116622, Peoples R China; [Li Xiaoying] Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China",Dalian University; Dalian University of Technology,"Li, XY (通讯作者)，Dalian Univ, Coll Tourism, Dalian 116622, Peoples R China.;Li, XY (通讯作者)，Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China.",,"liang, liang/IAO-8518-2023; jam, amir/O-6460-2019; li, xiaofeng/GXF-9442-2022; yuan, liping/JPK-7584-2023; li, xiao/GSN-6181-2022",,Humanities and Social Sciences - Education Department of Liaoning Province [w2015040],Humanities and Social Sciences - Education Department of Liaoning Province,The authors gratefully acknowledge the support provided to this study by Humanities and Social Sciences sponsored by Education Department of Liaoning Province Grant No. w2015040.,,11,0,0,0,4,DALIAN UNIV TECHNICAL ELECTRONIC & AUDIO-VISUAL PRESS,DALIAN CITY,"NO.80 SOFTWARE PARK ROAD, HI-TECH ZONE, DALIAN CITY, LIAONING PROVINCE 116024, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89437-202-4,,,,2018,,,,,,,116,119,,,,,,4,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7UP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455659900018,0

The output of econometric model confirms positive relation between the value of CIFI and probability of financial crises occurrence.

The higher the profitability of a bank, the greater profit earned by the bank. The higher profitability also means the better position, in terms of asset, of a bank. Like bank's profitability, deferred tax expense affects profit management as well. The purpose of this study is to provide empirical evidence of the effect of deferred tax expense and profitability on profit management at financial service companies.

Design/methodology/approach - The author uses static and dynamic regression estimation to test for the determinants of bank loan loss provisions. Findings - The author finds that non-performing loans (NPL), loan-to-asset ratio and loan growth are significant non-discretionary drivers of bank provisions in the African region. The author observes that bank provision is a positive function of NPL up to a threshold beyond which bank provisions will no longer increase as NPL increases. Also, bank loan-to-asset ratio is a significant driver of bank provisions when African banks have higher loan-to-asset ratios. The author finds that larger banks in financially developed African countries have fewer loan loss provisions while increase in bank lending leads to fewer bank provisions in countries with strong investor protection. Finally, higher bank lending is associated with higher bank provisions during economic boom. Originality/value - This study is the first to assess the determinants of non-discretionary bank provisions in Africa as part of micro-prudential surveillance of banks in the African region.","[Ozili, Peterson K.] Univ Essex, Colchester, Essex, England",University of Essex,"Ozili, PK (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Colchester, Essex, England.",petersonkitakogelu@yahoo.com,"Ozili, Peterson/A-8418-2015",,,,,,40,18,18,2,21,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Joined analyses of these two intertwined areas are infrequent because scholars usually aim their attention either on social responsibility reporting or human capital reporting. Our paper uncovers characteristics of reporting on both social and human capital aspects of human resources in the Czech Republic and thus addresses the research gap. Specifically, we quantify the amount of voluntary disclosure on human resources in annual reports of the 50 Czech largest corporations.

This is one of the reasons why a reform of the contractual relationships has been frequently discussed. However, little is known about the preferences of German milk producers regarding their preferred attributes of an ideal milk delivery relationship. Therefore, randomly selected farmers in different German regions where presented with Discrete-Choice-Experiments about different contractual attributes such as duration, pricing, cancellation period and quantity regulation. A random parameter logit model was estimated to identify drivers of preference heterogeneity. Results indicate that larger milk producers tend to favor fixed contractual solutions, while small and medium-sized producers tend to adhere to the currently prevailing cooperative delivery system of unregulated quantities of delivery and ex post pricing. However, the majority of milk producers want shorter cancellation periods with their dairy companies, and milk producers in East German federal states reject the typical cooperative delivery system more frequently than the respondents in West Germany.","[Petersen, Julian; Hess, Sebastian] Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Hess, S (通讯作者)，Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Inst Agrarokon Okon Milch & Ernahrungswirtsch, Wilhelm Seelig Pl 6, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",shess@ae.uni-kiel.de,"Hess, Sebastian/ADS-1491-2022","Hess, Sebastian/0000-0002-4597-7654",,,,,29,9,9,0,4,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

Many governments publicly release significant amounts of health data, including hospital ratings and patient outcomes. We propose applying Big Data Analytics to understand open health data. Ideally, citizens would use this data to choose hospitals or evaluate care options. There are major challenges, including merging data from disparate sources and applying interpretive analytics. We are building an open-source tool to facilitate analytical exploration. Such a tool could enable researchers, hospitals, insurers, and citizens to obtain integrated global-to-local perspectives on health-care expenditures, procedure costs, and emerging trends. Our tool is based on the Python ecosystem, and contains a variety of modules from database analytics to machine learning and visualization. We analyzed data from the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System and determined the distribution of costs for hip replacement surgery across the state. The mean cost over 168,676 patients is $22,700, the standard deviation is $20,900, and 88% of these patients had hip replacement costs of less than $30,000. This provides the background to understand why in a state with similar demographics, The California Public Employees' Retirement System capped hip replacement reimbursements at $30,000, which resulted in significant medical savings. Obtaining transparency of medical costs is important to control expenditure. Even though such information is available, consumers have trouble utilizing it effectively. Our tool could be truly transformative, allowing consumers to fully use available data, and to perhaps demand access to data that ought to be made public.","[Rao, A.

Despite this, the industry is facing various issues and challenges from both the clients and microfinance institutions. This study aims to identify the issues and challenges faced by different demographic background of microentrepreneurs receiving Islamic microfinancing from Amanah Ikhtiar Malaysia (AIM). Methodology-It adopts the quantitative research methodology where primary data is collected using survey questionnaires administered on 393 women entrepreneurs who are currently clients of AIM's Islamic microfinance scheme located in Selangor. The descriptive and cross-tabulation analyses are applied in efforts to understand the influence of socio-demographic factors (age, education level, duration with AIM, and times of receiving financing) on the following issues: cost of repayment, financing period, amount of financing, distance to AIM center, group lending mechanism, discipline among members, problematic group members, and consultation services. Findings - The study finds that clients with different socio-demographic factors perceived the issues differently, suggesting an influential role of clients' demographic factors on the microfinance intervention. Practical implications - These findings have important implications to the microfinance industry in terms of further improving their products that are tailor-made to the socio-demographic characteristics of their clients. Originality - This research taken views of AIM's microfinance recipients which were woman entrepreneurs in Selangor directly through a survey. Results of the research would be useful to AIM to enhance their products and services in future.","[Salleh, Marhanum Che Mohd] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Dept Finance, Kulliyyah Econ & Management Sci, Gombak, Indonesia; [Kassim, Salina; Kassim, Siti Nadhirah] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Inst Islamic Banking & Finance, Kulliyyah Econ & Management Sci, Gombak, Indonesia",,"Salleh, MCM (通讯作者)，Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Dept Finance, Kulliyyah Econ & Management Sci, Gombak, Indonesia.",marhanum@iium.edu.my,,,,,,,10,1,1,0,2,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2018,,,,,,,853,870,,10.18502/kss.v3i13.4253,0.0,,,18,Business; Economics; Religion,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Religion,BS3YS,,gold,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000716967900060,0

By this method the company's value can be estimated (valuated) at the certain part of time and compared to the current stock price on the stock market, and the additional advantage of this method is risk elimination of misevaluating for the certain extend incomes is not very high. The aim of this paper is to point out the importance of combining several appraisal methods in establishing the right value of a stock i.e. establishing if a stock currently is over or under valuated on the market. It's to be concluded that this paper approaches the stock evaluation as an ideal segment of a firm. The quality of firm's business and its potentials are often strong indicators of the stock value in long term. Combined with the usual methods CCF method provides a more precise firm evaluation, i.e. more precise stock evaluation.","[Speranda, Ivo] Univ Dubrovnik, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Dubrovnik, Croatia",University of Dubrovnik,"Speranda, I (通讯作者)，Univ Dubrovnik, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Dubrovnik, Croatia.",,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,INTL INST SOCIAL & ECONOMIC SCI,PRAGUE,"TREBESOVSKA 2038/14, PRAGUE, 193 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87927-77-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,468,478,,10.20472/EFC.2018.010.032,0.0,,,11,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2CO,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000505164900032,0

Design/methodology/approach The paper presents a viewpoint based on analysis of the successful international expansion of a sample of Chinese EMNEs where success is measured their ability win share in overseas markets. This allows us to identify their ownership advantages, the antecedents of these advantages and how they were built using dynamic capabilities. Findings EMNEs have non-traditional ownership advantages that have been built by finding innovative ways to leverage the locational advantages of their home countries. The conversion of locational advantages into ownership advantages requires that firms build dynamic capabilities that enable them to innovate in the use of the locational advantages they enjoy. Research limitations/implications The study is limited to a small sample of EMNEs from China who have succeeded in winning market share in the initial phases of their international expansion. In the light of these limitations, the authors discuss the question the sustainability of their competitive advantage as well as the likely applicability of our findings to EMNEs from other EMNEs. Originality/value The authors revisit the paradox that despite the growth and success of multinationals from EMNEs in the past decade they are assumed to lack ownership advantages. The authors show that EMNEs' ownership advantages differ from the traditional advantages such proprietary technologies and brand equity that are enjoyed by incumbent multinationals.","[Williamson, Peter] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Judge Business Sch, Int Management, Cambridge, England; [Wan, Feng] Univ East Anglia, Norwich Business Sch, Norwich, Norfolk, England",University of Cambridge; University of East Anglia,"Williamson, P (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Judge Business Sch, Int Management, Cambridge, England.",p.williamson@jbs.cam.ac.uk; f.wan@uea.ac.uk,,"Williamson, Peter/0000-0003-4894-6180",,,,,51,23,28,1,35,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Specifically, analysts tend to release more optimal ratings on stocks that have been hold by the funds, and the funds tend to significantly reduce the stocks in their portfolio once the analysts have announced high ratings on the stocks. Moreover, the analysts in employment relationships with majority shareholders of funds and with a low reputation reveal worse objectivity.

The ignorance negatively impacts their capacity to become success entrepreneurs. The success of business leaders cannot be separated from their characters and the core values. The social cognitive approach explains how a business leader can be successful. This approach can help to explain the relationship between an entrepreneur, his personality characteristics, his values and other dimensions that will help to predict whether the entrepreneur will be success or not. This paper aims to find the relationship between characters and values and successful entrepreneurs.

Meanwhile, groundwater policy to address the common-pool resource losses remains in its nascent stage. This study analyzes a recent and unique bottom-up effort to self-impose a groundwater pumping fee in San Luis Valley, Colorado. Utilizing a difference-in-difference econometric framework, our results bring new and direct empirical evidence to the debate on the use of economic incentives in groundwater policy. We find that the price intervention has been effective, leading to a 33% reduction in groundwater use, predominantly through reduced irrigation intensity. We also find, to a more limited extent, movement away from water-thirsty crops and reduced overall irrigated acreage. Given that financial incentives can produce substantial conservation within a groundwater commons in duress, price-based policies warrant further consideration as irrigators address diminishing and variable water supplies.","[Smith, Steven M.] Colorado Sch Mines, Div Econ & Business, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Andersson, Krister] Univ Colorado, Dept Polit Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Cody, Kelsey C.] Univ Colorado, Environm Studies Program, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Cox, Michael] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Environm Studies, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Ficklin, Darren] Indiana Univ, Dept Geog, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Colorado School of Mines; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Dartmouth College; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Smith, SM (通讯作者)，Colorado Sch Mines, Div Econ & Business, Golden, CO 80401 USA.",ssmith1@mines.edu,"andersson, krister/R-7554-2019; Cox, Michael/AAI-6510-2020","andersson, krister/0000-0002-9320-8155; Cox, Michael/0000-0002-3462-7798; Ficklin, Darren/0000-0003-3736-7407; Smith, Steven/0000-0002-9653-2663; Cody, Kelsey/0000-0001-6817-2595",National Science Foundation [BCS-1115009],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We would like to thank the editor, Dan Phaneuff, and two anonymous referees as well as many irrigators and officials in the San Luis Valley for their helpful comments.

These changes coincide with a disproportionate increase in housing prices in high-income places, a divergence in the skill-specific returns to moving to high-income places, and a redirection of low-skill migration away from high-income places. We develop a model in which rising housing prices in high-income areas deter low-skill migration and slow income convergence.

By using the comprehensive RavenPack Dow Jones News Analytics database that captures Chinese and US macroeconomic news releases and their sentiment scores at high frequencies, we investigate the circumstances in which public news sentiment is related to the volatility of the above exchange rates. To account for the possibility of different volatility regimes in the RMB-USD volatility, a two-state Regime-Switching EGARCH-in-mean (RS-EGARCH-M) model that incorporates the effects of news sentiment is proposed. Our model suggests that news sentiment has a greater impact on reducing volatility persistence in the low volatility regime (calm state) for all the NDF and futures exchange rates; in contrast, the impact is greater in the high-volatility regime (turbulent state) for the spot rate. Furthermore, depending on the news sources and sentiment, the marginal effects of news on these exchange rates can vary significantly. In particular, compared with the USD news releases, the RMB news releases have a stronger influence on the RMB-USD volatility. Moreover, the impact of negative news sentiment is greater than that of positive news sentiment. However, the effects of RMB-USD volatility on contemporaneous returns are mostly insignificant. Our RS-EGARCH-M model indicates that the estimated smoothing probability of the RMB-USD spot rate can produce consistent identification of the different economic states arising from changes in the macroeconomic and exchange rate policies of the Chinese government. These findings have important implications for China's exchange rate regime and the process of RMB internationalization.","[Ho, Kin-Yip] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Finance Actuarial Studies & Stat, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Shi, Yanlin] Australian Natl Univ, Sch Demog, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Zhang, Zhaoyong] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Business & Law, Perth, WA 6027, Australia",Australian National University; Australian National University; Edith Cowan University,"Zhang, ZY (通讯作者)，Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Business & Law, Perth, WA 6027, Australia.",zhaoyong.zhang@ecu.edu.au,"Zhang, Zhaoyong/D-5100-2013","Zhang, Zhaoyong/0000-0001-9596-2648",Sumitomo Foundation,Sumitomo Foundation,"An early version of this paper was presented in the 2nd International Conference on the Chinese Economy: Past, Present and Future at Tsinghua University.

First, increased bank risk premiums encourage the bank to substitute from wholesale funds to small certificates of deposits (CD) by increasing small CD rates. Second, increased rival risk premiums in a local market require the bank to increase small CD rates even more. Our results are consistent with risk encouraging the use of small CDs as a marginal source of funds and promoting local market competition for small CDs. As risk premiums rise, banks also reduce rates on other retail deposits.

Using a rich panel data set of Ethiopian subsistence farmers, we estimate a distance function of grains production and find large productivity gains (approximately 33% and 29% in 1999 and 2004) from labor sharing due to synergy effects that boost labor productivity. However, labor sharing does not lead to learning as the productivity gains observed in years with labor sharing disappear in following years if the farmers do not continue to engage in labor sharing. Labor-sharing partners are either neighbors, relatives, members of the same funeral and religious associations, or have plots next to each other, which together reduce labor sharing as a single venue for learning. However, the synergy effect is strong enough to warrant the design of extension and outreach policies that recognize and utilize farmers' informal social networks such as labor-sharing arrangements.

We perform an evidence-based assessment of the most relevant economic, social, and environmental implications of the soybeanization of Argentinian agriculture. Our diagnostic relies on a combination of published sources and a unique data set drawn from a field survey carried out in 2011 in two provinces of the Argentinian Pampas. This data set allows us to evaluate with a reliable empirical base the socio-economic impacts of GM soybean cultivation. Our analysis suggests a conflict between the success of the soybeanization of Argentinian agriculture measured in terms of production and profit records, and the social, economic, and environmental sustainability of this new model of production. On the one hand, GM soybean technological package adoption has increased farm productivity, and reduced the costs per unit produced, resulting in a dramatic increase in profits. On the other hand, the specialization of Argentinian agriculture on soybean cultivation has increased the dependence of public finances on the foreign exchange revenue generated by exports earnings. We also find a mixed empirical picture of changing land distribution patterns and labor displacement resulting from GM soybean expansion. Finally, we find that the environmental implications of agricultural biotechnology appear alarming and the long-term sustainability of GM crops highly questionable. Promoting sustainable agricultural growth has become not only desirable but necessary. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

By employing a novel stress test scenario under a panel VAR methodology, the CELCH and the direction of causality between liquidity creation and cost efficiency are tested. Moreover, using new measures of liquidity creation (Berger and Bouwman, 2009), the question of whether potential bank mergers and acquisitions (M&As) can enhance liquidity creation and generate additional credit channels in the economy is addressed. The robustness of potential consolidation scenarios are evaluated and compared through the use of new half-life measures (Chortareas and Kapetanios, 2013). In line with CELCH, the positive impact of cost efficiency on liquidity creation is shown. The empirical evidence further suggests that potential consolidation activity can enhance the flow of credit in the economy. Bank shocks seem to have the most persistent effect on both liquidity creation and cost efficiency. Finally, doubts are cast on the strategies followed by policy authorities regarding the recent wave of M&As in the banking sector. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Individuals trade off the advantages from annuitization, receiving longevity risk insurance, to the disadvantages, giving up 'free' wealth in the form of means-tested supplemental income. We quantify the impact of means-tested benefits with a calibrated life-cycle model, demonstrating that they substantially reduce the desire to annuitize especially for low and intermediate levels of pension wealth. Using an administrative dataset on pension choices, we show that the model's predicted fraction of retirees choosing the annuity is able to match the annuitization pattern of occupational pension wealth observed in Switzerland. On the base of our model, we also assess alternative policies such as mandatory annutization and tougher asset tests.","[Butler, Monika] SEW HSG Univ St Gallen, CESIfo, Varnbuelstr 14, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland; [Butler, Monika] Netspar, Varnbuelstr 14, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland; [Peijnenburg, Kim] Bocconi Univ, IGIER, Dept Econ, I-20135 Milan, Lombardy, Italy; [Peijnenburg, Kim] Netspar, I-20135 Milan, Lombardy, Italy; [Staubli, Stefan] Univ Calgary, CEPR, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Staubli, Stefan] NBER, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada",Bocconi University; University of Calgary,"Staubli, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, CEPR, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.;Staubli, S (通讯作者)，NBER, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",stefan.staubli@gmail.com,,,Centre for Pensions and Superannuationand Kim Peijnenburg; All Pensions Group,Centre for Pensions and Superannuationand Kim Peijnenburg; All Pensions Group,"We thank seminar participants at the University of St. Gallen, the University of Zurich, the Netspar Pension Workshop, and various conferences for helpful comments and suggestions.

Such studies are however lacking in certain contexts like in Malta, an island state in the Mediterranean Sea. Malta is facing a concurrent high population density, high motorisation rate and an ageing population. Nevertheless, older people's mobility is not adequately considered in transport policy. The aim of this paper is to have an exploratory understanding of mode choice in later life in Malta, and understand the key determinants that affect older people's decision to drive or to use the bus. Using descriptive statistics and two regression models, this paper shows how in Malta older males drive significantly more than females, and the latter use more public transport. As age increases, the percentage of drivers declines for both genders. On the other hand, whilst for females public transport use also declined with age, the pattern of usage amongst males fluctuated. The data also showed that public transport was mostly used by non-driving older people who could potentially be captive bus users. The determinants that predicted whether older people drove or not were (i) gender, (ii) age, (iii) their occupation status, and (iv) the presence of an assistive device. The significant predictors for older people's public transport use were (i) the number of cars available in the household, (ii) age, (iii) the district where they lived, (iv) their occupation status, (v) their participation in social activities and (vi) the presence of personal assistance. The two models revealed different predictors for mode choice however there were also several similarities. The paper concludes with a discussion, highlighting the importance and relevance of the results to transport policy-makers. It also provides suggestions for further research to examine older people's mobility and travel behaviour.","[Mifsud, Deborah] Univ Malta, ICCSD Res Offices, Fac Arts, Dept Geog, Porta Cabins Block B,Car Pk 6,MSD2080, Msida, Malta; [Attard, Maria] Univ Malta, Fac Arts, Dept Geog, OH132,MSD2080, Msida, Malta; [Ison, Stephen] Loughborough Univ Technol, Sch Architecture Bldg & Civil Engn, Transport Studies Grp, Ashby Rd, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",University of Malta; University of Malta; Loughborough University,"Mifsud, D (通讯作者)，Univ Malta, ICCSD Res Offices, Fac Arts, Dept Geog, Porta Cabins Block B,Car Pk 6,MSD2080, Msida, Malta.",deborah.mifsud@um.edu.mt; maria.attard@um.edu.mt; s.g.ison@lboro.ac.uk,"Attard, Maria/AAL-4294-2020","Attard, Maria/0000-0002-3876-7376",,,,,75,22,26,4,36,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

We also investigate whether both exchange rate changes and exchange rate volatility affect firms of different sizes differently. Applying the two-step system generalized method of moment estimator on our data for a sample of 221 Pakistani manufacturing firms, we find that the real exchange rate depreciation has positive impacts, whereas the exchange rate volatility has negative impacts on firms' exports. We also find that compared to large-sized firms, small- and medium-sized exporting firms are more likely to benefit from currency depreciations. Yet, regarding the effect of exchange rate volatility, we find that the adverse impact of exchange rate volatility is weaker for large-sized firms as compared to small- and medium-sized firms. Our findings confirm the presence of nonlinearity in export-deterring (favoring) effects of exchange rate volatility (depreciation) on exporting behavior depending on firm size. Pakistan should design and implement export-favoring preferential policies by emphasizing on real exchange rate stabilization and providing incentives to large firms to come into being. Small- and medium-sized enterprises should develop such export strategies that help reduce their size disadvantages, particularly in managing exchange rate risks.","[Rashid, Abdul; Waqar, Shahid Mahmood] Int Islamic Univ, IIIE, Islamabad, Pakistan","International Islamic University, Pakistan","Rashid, A (通讯作者)，Int Islamic Univ, IIIE, Islamabad, Pakistan.",Abdulrashid@iiu.edu.pk; shahed.mw@gmail.com,"Rashid, Dr. Abdul/AAL-3095-2020; WAQAR, Shahid Mahmood/IUQ-3511-2023","Rashid, Dr. Abdul/0000-0003-1550-2612; Waqar, Shahid Mahmood/0000-0002-6012-8060",,,,,48,14,16,1,43,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We argue that firm-released disclosures and news reports released by the press have disparate effects on volatility. Specifically, disclosure information arrivals tend to increase total volatility, consistent with the uncertainty-generating effect, whereas media coverage reduces volatility, consistent with the notion that media reports resolve information uncertainty for firms. For IDV, both types of news tend to mitigate price synchronicity, suggesting that public information flows mainly contribute to the capitalization of firm-specific information on prices overall.","[Aman, Hiroyuki] Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Nishinomiya, Hyogo, Japan; [Moriyasu, Hiroshi] Nagasaki Univ, Nagasaki, Nagasaki, Japan",Kwansei Gakuin University; Nagasaki University,"Aman, H (通讯作者)，Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Nishinomiya, Hyogo, Japan.",aman@kwansei.ac.jp; moriyasu@nagasaki-u.ac.jp,,"Moriyasu, Hiroshi/0000-0001-8173-2761","Kwansei Gakuin University Individual Special Research Fund; JPSS KAKENHI [JP26380415, JP15H03367, JP17H02525]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17H02525, 15H03367] Funding Source: KAKEN","Kwansei Gakuin University Individual Special Research Fund; JPSS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Earlier versions of this paper were presented at the Southwestern Finance Association 2012, Nippon Finance Association 2012, Japan Association for Applied Economics 2011, Monetary Economic Workshop (MEW), Kyusyu Finance Seminar, Yucho Foundation seminar, and Kwansei Gakuin University.

In this paper, we ask whether, in the presence of direct democratic institutions, voters' actions in vetoing a decision or inaugurating a policy by a binding initiative in their jurisdiction have spillover effects on the actions of voters in neighboring jurisdictions. We collect (and make available) data on 3300 initiatives in German towns from 2002 to 2014 and match these to panel data on the towns' sociodemographic and fiscal characteristics. We apply an instrumental variables approach and find that a jurisdiction's probability of hosting an initiative is positively driven by the neighbors' direct democratic activity. The size of the estimated average effect peaks around a 20 km neighborhood-where a standard deviation change of neighbors' activity increases the probability of hosting an initiative by 5 percentage points-then gradually declines and fades away after around 60 km. This effect is driven by spillovers in similar policy areas and by successful initiatives, and is stronger in towns with relatively more information flows (measured by newspaper consumption and commuter flows).","[Asatryan, Zareh; Havlik, Annika; Streif, Frank] ZEW Mannheim, Dept Corp Taxat & Publ Finance, L7 1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany; [Havlik, Annika; Streif, Frank] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); University of Mannheim,"Havlik, A (通讯作者)，ZEW Mannheim, Dept Corp Taxat & Publ Finance, L7 1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany.;Havlik, A (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.",annika.havlik@gess.uni-mannheim.de,,,German Research Foundation,German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We would like to thank Thushyanthan Baskaran, Sebastian Blesse, Katharina E.

As a consequence, an increasing number of development interventions that aim at strengthening the resilience of vulnerable households and communities are now being implemented across the globe. Along with these interventions, a growing and urgent call for rigorous monitoring and evaluation has emerged. Unfortunately, the very few resilience measurement frameworks that are available are often too academics, data-demanding, and therefore poorly adapted to the reality faced by practitioners on the ground. In this paper we develop a resilience impact assessment framework which addresses this challenge. Using an ex-post treatment vs. control approach, the framework satisfies the requirement for rigor that should be found in any proper impact assessment framework, but remains operational in the data- and resource-constrained situations which characterize most of the current interventions in the field.

The empirical literature, however, is inconclusive, owing to both measurement problems and endogeneity. This paper creates a corruption index based on original data from a survey covering top politicians and civil servants in all Swedish municipalities. The effect of more politicians on corruption problems is analyzed using discontinuities in the required minimum size of local councils. Despite the fact that Sweden consistently has been ranked among the least corrupt countries in the world, the survey suggest that non-trivial corruption problems are present in Sweden. Municipalities with more local council seats have more reported corruption problems, and the regression discontinuity design suggests that the effect is causal.","[Bergh, Andreas] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Box 7082, S-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Bergh, Andreas] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Grevgatan 34-2 Fl,Box 55665, SE-10215 Stockholm, Sweden; [Fink, Guenther] Harvard Sch Publ Hlth, 665 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ohrvall, Richard] Linkoping Univ, Dept Management & Engn, SE-58138 Linkoping, Sweden; [Ohrvall, Richard] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, POB 55665, SE-10215 Stockholm, Sweden",Lund University; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

By involving the customers in service production, providers can capture customers' needs and maintain their competitiveness. The cutomers' roles may lead to a higher productivity and competitive quality for companies. Previous researches recognized two types of the customers' co-creation behaviour. First, it is the consumers' participation behaviour. Then, the other one is the consumers' citizenship behaviour. The goal of our study is to examine how the level of involvement influences two kinds of behaviour mentioned. Besides, we explore if respondents' participation behaviour or citizenship behaviour influence the perceived value of service provided. In 2015, for examination of our research questions, we carried out a quantitative research and applied quota sampling to obtain data from two target groups (X and Y generations). The activity and attitude of individuals related to performance of an extra-role in service interaction is less favourable than the required in-role behaviour. According to the results of our survey, the level of involvement influences the customers' mandatory behaviour and volunteer behaviour when working on a co-creation value. Empirically verifiable, the service users' activity in a value creation affects customers' value of the service.","[Ercsey, Ida] Szechenyi Istvan Univ, Kautz Gyula Econ Fac, Egyet Ter 1, H-9026 Gyor, Hungary",University of Istvan Szechenyi,"Ercsey, I (通讯作者)，Szechenyi Istvan Univ, Kautz Gyula Econ Fac, Egyet Ter 1, H-9026 Gyor, Hungary.",ercsey@sze.hu,,,"Internationalisation, initiatives to establish a new source of researchers and graduates, and development of knowledge and technological transfer as instruments of intelligent specialisations at Szechenyi Istvan University [EFOP-3.6.1-16-2016-00017]","Internationalisation, initiatives to establish a new source of researchers and graduates, and development of knowledge and technological transfer as instruments of intelligent specialisations at Szechenyi Istvan University","The research was funded by the following project: EFOP-3.6.1-16-2016-00017; Internationalisation, initiatives to establish a new source of researchers and graduates, and development of knowledge and technological transfer as instruments of intelligent specialisations at Szechenyi Istvan University.",,44,26,30,10,68,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

Despite a growing literature on this population, few studies have addressed how unmarried couples coparent in the context of poverty. In the present study we used in-depth interviews with paired mothers and fathers to explore resilience processes in unmarried coparenting. We found that unmarried couples aspired to be good coparents, but the stress of living in poverty and the challenges of parenting young children led some to experience family strain or crisis. Using family stress theory as a framework for organizing the findings, we concluded that family resource management distinguished couples that adapted successfully to the task of coparenting from those that struggled to do so. Implications for theory, future research, and practice are discussed.","[Jamison, Tyler B.] Univ New Hampshire, Human Dev & Family Studies, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Ganong, Lawrence; Proulx, Christine M.] Univ Missouri, Dept Human Dev & Family Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Ganong, Lawrence] Univ Missouri, Sinclair Sch Nursing, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Jamison, TB (通讯作者)，Univ New Hampshire, Human Dev & Family Studies, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",Tyler.jamison@unh.edu; ganongl@missouri.edu; proulxc@missouri.edu,"Proulx, Christine/L-8002-2019","Proulx, Christine/0000-0001-8184-7665",,,,,48,14,23,1,22,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

Using quarterly data for U.S. bank holding companies from 1986 to 2014, we find evidence that banks having lower funding liquidity risk as proxied by higher deposit ratios, take more risk. A reduction in banks' funding liquidity risk increases bank risk as evidenced by higher risk-weighted assets, greater liquidity creation and lower Z-scores. However, our results show that bank size and capital buffers usually limit banks from taking more risk when they have lower funding liquidity risk. Moreover, during the Global Financial Crisis banks with lower funding, liquidity risk took less risk.

This paper raises and explores the idea that the extent of intra-family moral hazard and non-purchase of LTC insurance might differ when insurance benefits are fixed and when they are proportional to LTC expenditures. It shows that fixed benefits limit and might even eliminate intra-family moral hazard, while the effect of proportional benefits is at best ambiguous. Consequently, non-purchase of insurance is less likely with fixed benefits.","[Klimaviciute, Justina] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Klimaviciute, Justina] Univ Liege, Liege, Belgium",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; University of Liege,"Klimaviciute, J (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.;Klimaviciute, J (通讯作者)，Univ Liege, Liege, Belgium.",justina.klimaviciute@ulg.ac.be,,"Klimaviciute, Justina/0000-0002-1389-6796",,,,,18,12,12,5,34,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",1554-964X,1554-9658,,GENEVA RISK INS REV,Geneva Risk Insur.

Our health outcomes-overweight, ADHD, and hearing-related problems-are characterized by diagnosis rates that only pick up during early elementary school. Moreover, our health outcomes have been found to be negatively linked with many potential implications of extended maternity leave-increased breastfeeding, prompt medical checkups at infancy, reduced prenatal stress, and reduced non-parental care during infancy. Using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Studies (ECLS) within a difference-in-differences framework, our results suggest improvements in health outcomes among California elementary school children following PFL's introduction. Furthermore, the improvements are driven by children from less advantaged backgrounds, which is consistent with the notion that California's PFL had the greatest effect on leave-taking duration after childbirth mostly for less advantaged mothers who previously could not afford to take unpaid leave.

Yet often times economic strain can cause families to migrate at different times. This separation within the family units has created the development of transnational family interactions where immigrant families remain emotionally and financially connected across international borders. Remittances, the back and forth exchange of goods and resources between people in the host nation and their counterparts in the country of origin, can often play a vital role in these interactions. Black African immigrants, Black people from the continent of Africa, are one of the fastest-growing immigrant groups in the US and also one of the highest financial remitters. Women are consistent remitters, yet little is known about the financial contributions of women from this continent to their families in their countries of origin. The current study looked at a segment of this population by exploring the remittance experiences of seven immigrant women from the East African countries of Rwanda and Kenya. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted and our thematic analysis revealed five themes: (1) Women felt their families made financial sacrifices for them, (2) Women took on family financial responsibilities, (3) Women felt their families in the country of origin had skewed financial expectations of them, (4) Women felt guilty about their limited finances and inability to send more to their families, and lastly (5) Women invested or had plans to invest in their country of origin.","[Muruthi, Bertranna] Virginia Tech Northern Virginia Ctr, 7054 Haycock Rd, Falls Church, VA 22043 USA; [Watkins, Kimberly] Univ Georgia, 205 Dawson Hall,Sanford Dr, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [McCoy, Megan] Firm Foundat Counseling, 1443 Highway1 S, Lugoff, SC 29078 USA; [Muruthi, James R.] Univ Georgia, 123 Dawson Hall,Sanford Dr, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Kiprono, Felisters J.] Univ Georgia, 207 Rivers Crossing,850 Coll Stn Rd, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Muruthi, B (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech Northern Virginia Ctr, 7054 Haycock Rd, Falls Church, VA 22043 USA.",Muruthba@vt.edu,"McCoy, Megan A/U-6447-2018","McCoy, Megan A/0000-0001-8535-5027; Muruthi, James/0000-0001-7667-7622",,,,,72,7,8,0,7,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

This paper goes beyond the standard analysis of the univariate properties of the fiscal variables through the estimation of a time-varying fiscal reaction function on a 11-country panel for a period spanning from 1970 to 2014. Even if panel unit root or stationary tests may provide a rough first insight on the sustainability of the public finances, they fail to highlight the adjustment mechanisms to debt overhang in recent years. The main advantage of our empirical approach is that it clearly captures the government's dynamic response to debt accumulation, which signals its commitment to readjust public debt towards a sustainable path. Time-varying estimates of the fiscal reaction function shed new light on this respect and reveal certain heterogeneity among EMU countries on the way they manage their public finances. This paper helps ascertain whether the public resources destined to bail out troubled countries triggered effective fiscal responses. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, due to increasing import dependency, urban consumer preferences for rice have become biased toward Asian export quality standards, against which African rice has difficulties to compete. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this import bias is higher in cities close to the port and remote from the geographical centers of cultural heritage where African rice was domesticated more than 3,000 years ago. We purposely select a sample of five West African urban markets which are supplied by both foreign and domestic rice value chains and which are located at varying distances from the nearest ports and centers of cultural heritage, and conduct framed field experiments based on auctions to analyze the drivers of urban demand for domestic rice with upgraded quality characteristics. We find that West African rice has increasing difficulties competing against imported rice on urban markets the more consumers appreciate characteristics of imported Asian rice, the closer to the port, and the further the geographical and genealogical distance from rice cultural heritage. These challenges provide crucial insights into value chain upgrading in policy makers' struggle to achieve rice self-sufficiency in West Africa. Our findings suggest that the optimal portfolio of investment in value chain upgrading is a function of the targeted end-market and its distance from the port and rice cultural heritage. The closer the end-market is located toward the port, the more investment is needed in lifting demand of domestic rice through quality upgrading, branding, and promotion to enable it to compete against imported rice. Proximity to centers of cultural heritage, on the other hand, endows rice value chains with a comparative advantage indemand, requiring less investment in demand-lifting and leaving more room for supply-shifting investments.

Typically these programs have low rates of success partly because the quality of teaching is heterogeneous. Standardization of teaching provided by computer-aided instruction might be a solution. However, there is little rigorous evidence of the effectiveness of computer-based adult literacy programs in delivering high-quality literacy and numeracy in the developing world. To fill this void in the literature, we study the impact of a computer-based adult literacy program, Tara Akshar Plus, on the literacy and numeracy skills of previously illiterate adult women in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. Through a randomized control trial, we measure learning outcomes with individual-level literacy and numeracy tests and find statistically significant positive impacts of this computer-aided program on literacy and numeracy outcomes of women who undergo the TARA Akshar Plus program relative to the control group. The effects are statistically significant but small in magnitude for women who were entirely illiterate prior to the program. The learning impacts are substantially larger for learners who knew at least a handful of letters at the beginning of the program. We compare the improvement in learning to that of another adult literacy and numeracy program. We conclude that TARA Akshar Plus is the more effective of the two, but the literacy and numeracy level achieved are not large enough to make many entirely illiterate learners become functionally literate.

Using a simple consumption-based asset pricing model that explains nearly two-thirds of the variation in average returns across 55 anomaly portfolios, we map the relation between exposures to consumption risk and portfolio-level characteristics. We use this relation to calculate exposures to consumption risk at the firm level and show that the calculated consumption risk exposures yield portfolios with large differences in average returns and ex post consumption risk exposures consistent with those predicted by our calculated betas. Further, industry betas and risk premia implied by our procedure display economically intuitive variation over time. Finally, Fama-MacBeth regressions suggest that risk exposures calculated using our procedure dominate those from alternative factor models at explaining cross-sectional variation in returns.

This prediction is tested with U.S. commercial banks, where identification is achieved by looking at differential effects according to banks' capital-to-assets ratio (CAR). Increases in uncertainty reduce the supply of credit, more so for banks with lower levels of CAR. These results are weaker for large banks, and are robust to controlling for monetary policy, to different measures of uncertainty, and to breaking the dataset in subsamples. Quantitatively, the effect of uncertainty shocks on credit supply is about as important as that of monetary policy shocks. (C) 2017 International Monetary Fund. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We construct global distributions of income during 1988-2012 based on both household surveys and the new top incomes data derived from tax records, which better capture the rich who are typically excluded from household surveys. We find that the representation of developing countries in the global top 1% declined until about 2002, but that since 2005 it has risen significantly. This coincides with a decline in global inequality since 2005, according to a range of measures. We compare our estimates of the country-composition and income levels of the global rich with a number of other sources-including Credit Suisse's estimates of global wealth, the Forbes World Billionaires List, attendees of the World Economic Forum, and estimates of top executives' salaries.

From these assumptions, we show that it follows that strategic proposers will have an incentive to offer proposals with greater uncertainty about individual values.

QV is a voting rule, proposed by one of us Weyl (Quadratic vote buying. http://goo.gl/8YEO73, 2012), Lalley and Weyl (Quadratic voting. https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Papers.cfm? abstract_id=2003531, 2016) building off earlier work by Groves and Ledyard (Econometrica 45(4):783-810 1977a), Hylland and Zeckhauser (A mechanism for selecting public goods when preferences must be elicited, Kennedy School of Government Discussion Paper D, 70, 1980), where individuals buy as many votes as they wish by paying the square of the votes they buy using some currency. An appreciation of the history of research in the field suggests that QV is uniquely practically relevant compared to the other approximately Pareto-efficient mechanisms economists have proposed for collective decisions on public goods. However, it faces a number of sociological and ethical concerns regarding how a political system organized around QV would achieve the efficiency aims stated in abstract theory and whether the pure aggregate income-maximizing definition of efficiency QV optimizes in its simplest form is desirable. The papers in this volume flesh out and formalize these concerns, but also provide important responses in two ways: by suggesting domains where they are unlikely to be applicable (primarily related to survey research of various kinds) and versions of QV (using an artificial currency) that maintain many of QV's benefits while diffusing the most important critiques. Together this work suggests both a practical path for applying QV in the near-term and a series of research questions that would have to be addressed to broaden its application.","[Posner, Eric A.] Univ Chicago, Sch Law, 1111 E 60th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Weyl, E.

However, the development of these reforms as well as their effectiveness in actually managing immigration flows remain poorly understood. The main reason is that migration regulations are hard to quantify, which has prevented the construction of a universal measure of migration policy. To fill this gap in the literature, we construct an indicator of the restrictiveness of immigration entry policy across countries as well as a more comprehensive indicator of migration policy that also accounts for staying requirements and regulations to foster integration. Specifically, we estimate a Bayesian-state space model to combine all publicly available data sources that are informative on migration policy. This methodology allows us to account for measurement errors in the underlying indicators and increases data availability without imputations or other ad hoc manipulations. The indexes that we obtain are then used to disentangle the factors determining the toughness of migration regulations. Our empirical framework accounts for cross-country correlation in migration policies and combines elements from the median voter and interest group approach. We find strong evidence of spatial correlation in particular in entry restrictiveness, yet substantially less in overall immigration policy. This suggests that there still remains a substantive national margin in immigration policies, in particular in the less visible segments such as staying conditions and integration rights. We also find indications of a global trend of increasing restrictiveness in migration entry policy after the financial crisis of 2007-08. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Weyl, EG",,,,"Weyl, E. Glen",,,The robustness of quadratic voting,PUBLIC CHOICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Robust mechanism design; Quadratic voting; Collusion; Paradox of voting,INCENTIVES; COLLUSION; DECISION; AUCTIONS,"Lalley and Weyl (Quadratic voting, 2016) propose a mechanism for binary collective decisions, Quadratic Voting (QV), and prove its approximate efficiency in large populations in a stylized environment. They motivate their proposal substantially based on its greater robustness when compared with pre-existing efficient collective decision mechanisms. However, these suggestions are based purely on discussion of structural properties of the mechanism. In this paper, I study these robustness properties quantitatively in an equilibrium model. Given the mathematical challenges with establishing results on QV fully formally, my analysis relies on a number of structural conjectures that have been proven in analogous settings in the literature, but in the models I consider here. While most of the factors I study reduce the efficiency of QV to some extent, it is reasonably robust to all of them and quite robustly outperforms one-person-one-vote. Collusion and fraud, except on a very large scale, are deterred either by unilateral deviation incentives or by the reactions of non-participants to the possibility of their occurring. I am able to study aggregate uncertainty only for particular parametric distributions, but using the most canonical structures in the literature I find that such uncertainty reduces limiting efficiency, but never by a large magnitude. Voter mistakes or non-instrumental motivations for voting, so long as they are uncorrelated with values, may either enhance or harm efficiency depending on the setting. These findings contrast with existing (approximately) efficient mechanisms, all of which are highly sensitive to at least one of these factors.","[Weyl, E.

In this paper we try to address these concerns through a novel econometric analysis of 376,992 preschool children from 56 developing countries. We compare a naive least square model to specifications that include cluster fixed effects and cohort-based educational rankings to reduce biases from omitted variables before gauging sensitivity to sub-samples and exploring potential explanations of education-nutrition linkages. We find that the estimated nutritional returns to parental education are: (a) substantially reduced in models that include fixed effects and cohort rankings; (b) larger for mothers than for fathers; (c) generally increasing, and minimal for primary education; (d) increasing with household wealth; (e) larger in countries/regions with higher burdens of undernutrition; (f) larger in countries/regions with higher schooling quality; and (g) highly variable across country sub-samples. These results imply substantial uncertainty and variability in the returns to education, but results from the more stringent models imply that even the achievement of very ambitious education targets would only lead to modest reductions in stunting rates in high-burden countries. We speculate that education might have more impact on the nutritional status of the next generation if school curricula focused on directly improving health and nutritional knowledge of future parents.

It uses three techniques to assess the pro-poorness of multidimensional poverty reduction. The analysis of changes in multidimensional poverty draws on the global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) and related destitution measure in 34 countries and 338 sub-national regions, covering 2.5 billion people, for which there is a recent MPI estimation and comparable Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) dataset across time. First, it assesses overall changes in poverty and its incidence and intensity, and compares this with changes in $1.90 poverty. Next, utilizing the property of subgroup decomposability, it examines changes in the MPI and its consistent sub-indices over time across urban rural regions, sub-national regions and ethnic groups. The decomposition analysis identifies relevant national patterns, including those in which the pace of poverty reduction is higher for the poorest subgroups. Finally, the paper analyzes the dynamics of a strict subset of the poor, who are identified as destitute using a more extreme deprivation cutoff vector, and studies relative rates of reduction of destitution and poverty by country and region. This extensive empirical analysis illustrates how to assess the extent and patterns of reduction of multidimensional poverty, as well as whether it is inclusive or whether some people or groups are left behind. Naturally, some further research questions emerge. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

First we describe the integrated assessment approach to climate impact assessment and the simulation experiments that are needed to address stakeholders' questions about impact and adaptation and discuss the capabilities and limitations of alternative modeling approaches. Then we describe how crop simulation models can be combined with economic models to form hybrid structural models that can be used to conduct relevant simulation experiments and discuss the strengths and limitations of crop simulation models. We conclude that economic assessments of climate impact and adaptation could be improved by further developing methods, data, and software that enable researchers to use biophysical crop, livestock, and farming systems models with economic models.

We find that the biotechnology cluster in the National Capital Region entered a reorientation stage in the early 2000s, building up stored energy, capital, and connectedness in non-research-oriented activities. An increasing regional presence of large biotech firms in the past 5 years, a highly active and diverse start-up sector, increasing merger and acquisition activity, and declines in regional public funding for medical and clinical trials all suggest a transition of entrepreneurial activity in the region from a dynamic driven by federal research spillovers to one increasingly driven by private sector actors.","[Auerswald, Philip E.; Dani, Lokesh] George Mason Univ, Schar Sch Policy & Govt, 3401 Fairfax Dr, Arlington, VA 22201 USA",George Mason University,"Auerswald, PE (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Schar Sch Policy & Govt, 3401 Fairfax Dr, Arlington, VA 22201 USA.",auerswald@gmu.edu; ldani@gmu.edu,,,,,,,43,81,86,12,124,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We first follow the literature and define the entrepreneurial ecosystem as a multidimensional set of interacting factors that moderate the effect of entrepreneurial activity on economic growth. The quality of such an ecosystem, by its multi-dimensionality, is impossible to measure directly. But so defined, we argue that variation in entrepreneurial ecosystem quality should result in variation in the estimated marginal effect of entrepreneurial activity on economic growth. Testing for such variation is possible using a combination of a multilevel growth regression and latent class analysis. We motivate and validate our approach in simulated data before illustrating its applicability in a data set covering 107 European NUTS1-2 regions across 16 EU member states. For this dataset, we cannot reject the hypothesis of a homogeneous contribution of entrepreneurship to regional growth. That is, in this dataset, we no evidence of statistically significant heterogeneity in the estimated slope coefficients for entrepreneurial activity across regions. There are several possible explanations for this negative result. The two we deem most likely are first that the NUTS1-2 level may not be disaggregated enough to coincide with the relevant boundaries of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. We suspect our method would reveal significant differences across smaller geographical units, but the data unfortunately do not yet allow us to empirically test this hypothesis in a multi-country regional analysis. The second possible explanation is that the growth rates from 2006 to 2014 coincided with the global financial and the European crisis, and during this time, the effect of entrepreneurship on (long-run average) growth overall has been obscured. Our simulations also suggested a third reason. If measurement error is large (in the order of 33 or 0.015% point annual GDPgrowth), the effects may also have been obscured.","[Bruns, K.; Bosma, N.; Sanders, M.; Schramm, M.] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht Sch Econ, Kriekenpitpl 21-22, NL-3584 EC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Bruns, K (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Utrecht Sch Econ, Kriekenpitpl 21-22, NL-3584 EC Utrecht, Netherlands.",K.Bruns@uu.nl; N.S.Bosma@uu.nl; M.J.W.L.Sanders@uu.nl; M.Schramm@uu.nl,"Bosma, Niels/B-8187-2008","Bosma, Niels/0000-0003-1977-7680",,,,,80,80,89,13,81,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

First, interest rate rigidities in a monopolistic banking system increase the probability of a financial crisis (relative to the case of flexible interest rate) in response to contractionary shocks to the economy, while they act as automatic macro-prudential stabilizers in response to expansionary shocks. Second, when the interest rate is the only available instrument, monetary policy faces a trade-off between macroeconomic and financial stability. This trade off is both qualitative and quantitative in response to contractionary shocks, while it is only quantitative in response to positive shocks. We show that a second instrument, such as a Pigouvian tax on credit to households on the demand side of the market, is needed to restore efficiency in the economy when both frictions are at work.

Motivated by the principal component analysis, we find the curvature factor of the oil futures curve predicts monthly stock returns: a 1% per month increase in the curvature factor predicts 0.4% per month decrease in stock market index return. This predictive pattern is prevailing in non-oil industry portfolios, but is absent for oil-related portfolios. The in- and out-of-sample predictive power of the curvature factor for non-oil stocks is robust and outperforms many other predictors, including oil spot prices. The predictive power of the curvature factor comes from its ability to forecast supply-side oil shocks, which only affect non-oil stocks and are hedged by oil-related stocks. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The consolidation of the general government budget appears to be of longer duration when expenditure decisions are more decentralized. We also find that transfers from higher levels of government are cut during consolidation episodes, suggesting that central governments shift the burden of consolidation towards lower tiers of government. This is especially true when the latter have little legal autonomy to raise tax revenues and have little influence over executive decisions taken at the central level. We document that this increases local governments' public debt/GDP ratios. In terms of the success of consolidation episodes, countries with greater degrees of decentralization appear to make smaller improvements in their primary balance when consolidating.","[Foremny, Dirk] Univ Barcelona, IEB, Barcelona, Spain; [Sacchi, Agnese] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy; [Sacchi, Agnese] La Sapienza Univ GEN, Vigo, Spain; [Salotti, Simone] European Commiss, JRC, Circular Econ & Ind Leadership Unit, Directorate Growth & Innovat B, Edificio Expo,C Inca Garcilaso 3, Seville 41092, Spain",University of Barcelona; Sapienza University Rome; Universidade de Vigo,"Salotti, S (通讯作者)，European Commiss, JRC, Circular Econ & Ind Leadership Unit, Directorate Growth & Innovat B, Edificio Expo,C Inca Garcilaso 3, Seville 41092, Spain.",foremny@ub.edu; agnese.sacchi@uniroma1.it; Simone.SALOTTI@ec.europa.eu,"Foremny, Dirk/D-2381-2015; Salotti, Simone/N-7916-2019","Salotti, Simone/0000-0003-1898-6683; Foremny, Dirk/0000-0002-8987-231X; Sacchi, Agnese/0000-0002-7754-8360","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2012-37131, ECO2013-41310]; Generalitat de Catalunya [2014SGR-420]",Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya),"The authors would like to thank the participants in the OECD Fiscal Federalism Network Workshop in Paris (November 2014), the 71st Annual Congress of the International Institute of Public Finance in Dublin (August 2015) and the 56th Conference of the Italian Economic Association in Naples (October 2015) for useful comments on previous versions of this paper.

We examine changes in life satisfaction of Japanese and Koreans over a period when hours of work were cut exogenously because employers suddenly faced an overtime penalty effective at lower standard hours. Using repeated cross sections we show that life satisfaction increased relatively among those workers most likely to have been affected by the legislation, with the same finding using Korean longitudinal data. In a household model estimated over the Korean cross-section data we find some evidence that a reduction in the husband's workhours increased his wife's well-being. These results are consistent with the claim that legislated reductions in work hours can increase workers' utility. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In order to shed light on this instability we look at the relationship between the individual socio-economic situation and time preferences and the macroeconomic situation and time preferences. While we find no clear relationship between socio-economic situation and time preferences, we find that for the sample as a whole patience is positively correlated with economic growth, but negatively correlated with income inequality. When studying how the estimations differ across income groups we observe that there is a considerable asymmetry in how different income groups react to changes in the macroeconomic situation.

The initiative process is modeled as a sequential game under uncertainty: petitioners make an entry decision and collect signatures to qualify the initiative. Politicians decide about a political compromise - a counter proposal - after which petitioners have the option to withdraw the initiative before the vote. In equilibrium, politicians infer the initiative's popularity from the number of signatures and collection time. The more the initiative is perceived as a threat to the status quo, the more likely politicians come up with a counter proposal. Under certain conditions, petitioners have the incentive to collect more signatures than required for qualification to demonstrate high success probability. We test model predictions using the data set of all Swiss constitutional initiatives at the federal level between 1891 and 2010. Overall, we find supporting evidence for the model mechanisms. Fast signature collection is associated with a higher probability of reform. The effect is mediated through a higher probability of provoking a counter proposal. Ultimately, counter proposals are key to amending the status quo. Restricting the signature collection time reduces the informative mechanism of the signature collection process considerably.

For the first time, automakers will be able to trade credits between their own car and truck fleets and across manufacturers and bank credits over longer time periods. The potential to lower the costs of the regulations could be large if well-functioning credit markets develop. Starting in 2012, new regulations for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions overlap with the CAFE standards, creating two separate regulations and two separate credit markets, one for fuel economy and one for greenhouse gases. We find that although the two regulations are supposed to be harmonized, there are important differences in how credits are defined and can be traded, increasing costs for manufacturers. We review evidence on how well the credit markets are working and assess how the following may interfere with well-functioning markets: overlapping regulations, reductions that are not additional, lack of price transparency, and use of monopoly power. We find that although trading volumes have been increasing, these markets could be more efficient in lowering GHG emissions and fuel use.","[Leard, Benjamin; McConnell, Virginia] Resources Future Inc, 1616 P St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Resources for the Future,"Leard, B (通讯作者)，Resources Future Inc, 1616 P St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",leard@rff.org; mcconnell@rff.org,,,,,,,31,22,24,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1750-6816,1750-6824,,REV ENV ECON POLICY,Rev.

Moreover, in our esti-mations, we also examine whether a gender gap in both self-estimation assessment results exists. In the pre- and post-examination predictions, the higher-achieving students seem to predict and evaluate their examination results more accurately than their lower-achieving fel-lows on the Moodle tests. Our conclusions also enable the enhancement of the employability of the coming generation of accountants and the competitiveness of higher education to achieve the desired outcomes.

Contrary to previous research, mostly focused on the US, this study finds a higher number of parents who divide their financial transfers among their adult children equally. On average, 36% of European parents divide equally. These results contrast sharply with the approximately 6.4-9.2% of American parents giving equal transfers. It is possible that altruistic parents are also concerned with a norm of equal division, and therefore they do not fully offset the differences of income among their children as predicted by the standard model of altruism. The econometric results show that parents are more likely to give equal transfers if, in their view, income inequality among their children is not too high. Furthermore, the analysis is extended by adding variables at the country level. In this regard, income inequality, pension expenditures, the societal level of altruism and inheritance taxes are key to explaining country differences. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The effectiveness of unilateral climate policy is shown to depend on the joint effect of country and firm heterogeneity, and on their impact on equilibrium location choice. For being effective and not leading to production relocation in the long-run, unilateral climate policy should be moderate, implemented by a sufficiently larger area and complemented by mechanisms promoting the international transfer of clean technologies. The model indicates that the smaller area cannot take the lead in global climate mitigation for a protracted time period.

As part of multiannual management plans, an adjustment restriction on fish quota has been introduced. Its objective is to obtain an efficient fish stock and to reduce overcapacity for the fishing industry. We develop and apply a bi-level stochastic dynamic programming model to study the effect of a quota adjustment restriction on the net present value of resource rents, overcapacity and fish stock, when the system is recovering from a downward environmental shock. At level one, a policy maker sets the quota, considering fishermen behavior, stochastic fish stock dynamics, capital stock dynamics and a quota adjustment restriction. At level two, fishermen harvest myopically and make long-term investment decisions, assuming that fish stock and quota do not change over time. The two levels are linked by the quota, which is optimized by the policy maker at level one and becomes a restriction for myopic harvest and long-term investment decisions of fishermen at level two. Our analysis suggests that in the long run, overcapacity can be reduced by 54 % at modest costs, namely at a 1 % reduction in the net present value of resource rents. Long and short run sustainability of the fish stock is not affected.","[van Dijk, Diana] Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Environm Social Sci, Uberlandstr 133,POB 611, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Hendrix, Eligius M.

In the United States, over half the current flow of lead into the atmosphere is attributable to lead-formulated aviation gasoline (avgas), used in a large fraction of pistonengine aircraft. Various public interest firms have petitioned the EPA to find endangerment from and regulate lead emitted by piston-engine aircraft, though the EPA has so far ruled against such petitions. To address an EPA request for more evidence, we construct a novel data set that links time and spatially referenced blood lead data from over a million children to 448 nearby airports in Michigan. Across a series of tests, and adjusting for other known sources of lead exposure, we find that child blood lead levels (1) increase dose-responsively in proximity to airports, (2) decline measurably among children sampled in the months after 9/11, (3) increase doseresponsively in the flow of piston-engine aircraft traffic, (4) increase in the percentage of prevailing wind days drifting in the direction of a child's residential location, and (5) behave intuitively and significantly when considering two-way and three-way interactions of our main treatment variables. To quantify the policy relevance of the results we provide a conservative estimate of the social damages attributable to avgas consumption. Damages are at least $10 per gallon, which can be compared to a pump price of about $6 per gallon.","[Zahran, Sammy] Colorado State Univ, Dept Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Zahran, Sammy] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Iverson, Terrence; Weiler, Stephan] Colorado State Univ, Dept Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [McElmurry, Shawn P.] Wayne State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Detroit, MI 48202 USA",Colorado State University; Columbia University; Colorado State University; Wayne State University,"Zahran, S (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Dept Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.;Zahran, S (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",Sammy.Zahran@colostate.edu; Terry.Iverson@colostate.edu; S.mcelmurry@wayne.edu; Stephan.Weiler@colostate.edu,"McElmurry, Shawn/ABE-8418-2020","McElmurry, Shawn/0000-0001-7398-431X; Iverson, Terrence/0000-0003-1519-8358",Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health and Society Scholars program,Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health and Society Scholars program(Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF)),"We thank the Michigan Department of Community Health, Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Project for providing the blood lead data used in this study.

Using a large sample of IJVs, we find that the level of economic development of the foreign country influences the ownership choice of the US partner, but the foreign country's origin of legal system does not. The US partner gains more value when there is a dominant party in the transaction: the dominant partner possibly minimizes agency costs and provides greater stability to the joint venture. Partner, deal, and country characteristics influence the created value. Unequal ownership IJVs with English and French law countries bring more value to the US firm compared to unequal ownership in German law countries, and compared to equal ownership structure. The difference in value gain between majority and minority ownership levels is statistically insignificant across all legal systems, thereby providing additional support to the proposition that the presence of a dominant partner, whether of US or foreign origin, enhances the value of the IJV.","[Aguir, Iness] Amer Univ Sharjah, Sch Business Adm, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Misra, Lalatendu] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Finance, One UTSA Circle, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA",American University of Sharjah; University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA),"Aguir, I (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Sharjah, Sch Business Adm, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.",iaguir@aus.edu; lalatendu.misra@utsa.edu,"Aguir, Iness/AAG-9729-2021","Aguir, Iness/0000-0002-1508-8530",American University of Sharjah,American University of Sharjah,"We thank Seminar participants at the 2015 Midwest Finance Association meetings, 2016 Eastern Finance Association meetings and 2016 Southwestern Finance Association meetings, an anonymous referee and Narjess Boubakri for insightful comments.

This should draw the attention of economists and policymakers because domestic child labor is considered as exploitative and in many cases hazardous. This paper purports to explain this apparently perplexing finding theoretically in terms of a three-sector general equilibrium model with a nontraded sector where only child labor is used to render services to the richer section of the society. The analysis shows how FDI-led economic growth increases the size of the services sector although it lowers the overall incidence of child labor in the economy and improves the welfare of the poor families that supply child labor. Finally, a composite policy has been recommended that can deal with all three aspects favorably.","[Chaudhuri, Sarbajit] Univ Calcutta, Dept Econ, 23 Dr PN Guha Rd, Kolkata 700083, India; [Dwibedi, Jayanta Kumar] BKC Coll, Dept Econ, Kolkata, India",University of Calcutta,"Chaudhuri, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calcutta, Dept Econ, 23 Dr PN Guha Rd, Kolkata 700083, India.",sarbajitch@yahoo.com,"CHAUDHURI, Sarbajit/AAE-6343-2019","Chaudhuri, Sarbajit/0000-0003-1471-0460",,,,,25,3,4,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

The present study examines socio-demographic, spatial and attitudinal predictors of air travel for private purposes. The analyses are based on the Swiss Environmental Survey 2007 and a subsequent computation of the respondents' environmental impact, as well as spatial data. A lognormal hurdle model indicates that persons with higher environmental concern are less likely to travel by air and if they still do, they travel less. While political orientations do not affect whether a person travels by air, the results indicate that among those who do fly, respondents voting for the Green Party cause lower emissions than those opting for other left or center parties. Furthermore, higher incomes are associated with more air travel whereas living with children is associated with less air travel. Airport access is related to air travel in the sense that living closer to airports, in particular to large ones, is correlated to more air travel. The result is robust to alterations of the accessibility measure and also upholds when population density is controlled for.","[Enzler, Heidi Bruderer] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Environm Res Grp, Weinbergstr 109, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Enzler, HB (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Environm Res Grp, Weinbergstr 109, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",bruderer@soz.gess.ethz.ch,,,,,,,61,36,39,2,22,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

In recent years, it has been argued that the importance of manufacturing has diminished over the last 20-25 years, resulting in premature deindustrialization or non-industrialization in developing countries. This study explores whether the low levels of industrialization in developing countries are attributable to long-term changes in opportunities available to the sector around the globe. The study's findings show that the manufacturing sector's value added and employment contribution to world GDP and employment, respectively, have not changed significantly since 1970. The declining manufacturing value added and manufacturing employment share in many developing countries has not been caused by changes in the sector's development potential but has instead resulted from a shift of manufacturing activities to a relatively small number of populous countries, thus resulting in a concentration of manufacturing activities in specific developing countries. As was the case in the last millennium, industrialization has continued to play a key role in the growth of developing countries, which have sustained rapid and long-term growth for the last 25 years. Achieving economic development by following the path of industrialization will likely remain important for low-income countries because they are able to take advantage of their backwardness relative to those countries which have already experienced rapid industrialization with a disproportionately large share of manufacturing activities, and could soon enter a mature stage of industrialization.

This welcome news is widely discussed, even in the popular press. Yet as economies grow, some analysts express concerns that such growth is not having as significant an impact on poverty as one would hope. Analysts and policymakers ask whether this growth is adequately pro-poor, shared, or inclusive. Less noticed is that improvements in children's health are accelerating, too. This paper examines the extent to which these health improvements are equitably shared or inclusive. We use a descriptive method, which is analogous to growth incidence curves, and apply it to eight countries from Africa, Asia and Latin America. We draw two principal conclusions. First, within countries, health improvements often have a different distribution than income/expenditure growth, and that distribution is usually more hopeful in the sense that it is more likely to be strongly pro-poor than the distribution of income growth. Second, we have yet to see clear patterns in terms of the within-country relationship between growth incidence curves and health improvement incidence curves. Thus, one cannot rely on the information in the growth incidence curve to infer the inclusiveness of health improvements.","[Sahn, David E.] Cornell Univ, B16 MVR Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Sahn, David E.] Forschungsinst Zukunft Arbeit IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Younger, Stephen D.] Ithaca Coll, 953 Danby Rd, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",Cornell University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Sahn, DE (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, B16 MVR Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",David.Sahn@cornell.edu,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

When general provisions are deductible, a 1 percentage point rate increase leads to a provision increase of 4.9% of the sample average.

We found that after experiencing a larger loss than others, the subjects did not completely adapt their reference points to the absolute wealth loss and the relative negative wealth gap, and thus significantly increased their risk-taking behavior. However, the subjects also did not adjust their attitudes toward risk after experiencing a smaller loss than others, a smaller gain than others, or a larger gain than others. This may be because they promptly adapted to wealth changes or because they did not adapt to wealth changes but the effects of absolute and relative wealth changes mostly offset each other.","[Chao, Hong; Ho, Chun-Yu] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Econ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, 1954 Hua Shan Rd, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Ho, Chun-Yu] SUNY Albany, Dept Econ, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Qin, Xiangdong] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Dept Appl Econ, 1954 Hua Shan Rd, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Qin, XD (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Dept Appl Econ, 1954 Hua Shan Rd, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China.",chaohong@sjtu.edu.cn; chunyu.ho@sjtu.edu.cn; xdqin@sjtu.edu.cn,,"Ho, Chun-Yu/0000-0002-4498-9610","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71301103, 71333010]",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Chun-Yu Ho would like to acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, Project No. 71301103).r Xiangdong Qin would like to acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, Project No. 71333010).",,64,7,8,4,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

These reforms delay the legal retirement ages, increase the contributivity of the system, and adopt a sustainability factor and a pension revualuation index that effectively transform the Spanish pension system into a defined-contribution pension system. We find that these reforms improve the sustainability of Spanish pensions substantially, and that they limit the tax increases that would have been necessary to finance the pension system deficits. But these results are achieved at the expense of large reductions in the real value of the average pension. This reduction is progressive and, by 2050, the average pension is approximately 30% smaller in real terms than what it would have been under the pension system rules that prevailed in 2010. We also show that these reforms are costly in welfare terms and that households born between 1950 and 1970, young disabled workers who are alive at the time of the reform, and future cohorts bear the highest welfare costs. The substantial reduction of pensions and the high welfare costs that these reforms bring about lead us to conjecture that further reforms lurk in the future of Spanish pensions.","[Diaz-Gimenez, Javier] IESE Business Sch, Madrid, Spain; [Diaz-Saavedra, Julian] Univ Granada, Dept Econ Theory & Hist, Granada, Spain",University of Navarra; IESE Business School; University of Granada,"Díaz-Giménez, J (通讯作者)，IESE Business Sch, Madrid, Spain.",jdiaz@iese.edu; julianalbertodiaz@ugr.es,"Saavedra, Julián Díaz/AAA-6687-2019","Saavedra, Julián Díaz/0000-0002-6585-4053",Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologa [ECO2012-37742]; Centro de Investigaciones Financieras; Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia [ECO2011-25737],Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologa(Spanish Government); Centro de Investigaciones Financieras; Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia(Spanish Government),We thank Juan Carlos Conesa for an early version of the code and we thank Fernando Gil and Pablo Rubio Portillo for their research assistance.

To improve financial stability, regulators have proposed limiting banks' size and interconnectedness. I estimate a network-based model of the over-the-counter interbank lending market in the US and quantify the efficiency-stability implications of this policy. Trading efficiency decreases with limits on interconnectedness because the intermediation chains become longer. While restricting the interconnectedness of banks improves stability, the effect is non-monotonic. Stability also improves with higher liquidity requirements, when banks have access to liquidity during the crisis, and when failed banks' depositors maintain confidence in the banking system.

It highlights some important processes that are overlooked in these debates and advances a new, socially inclusive urbanization agenda that addresses emerging urban land grabs. The global land rush debate has ignored not only the fact that large-scale land investments take place in a context of rapid urbanization, but also that these investments are often triggered by urban demand, whereas discussions on the new urban agenda prepared for the latest United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III) are typically city-biased, and pay little attention to the role of increasing cross-border investment in land and the transformation of the countryside. Using cases from areas where the global land rush and urbanization are simultaneously intensifying in the global South, we identify four areas that should be prioritized in current debates, namely the impacts of land investments on intra-city dynamics, peri-urban dynamics, and the emergence of new cities and new infrastructure corridors.

We consider independent entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship as two different start-up modes: While intrapreneurship is conducted within an established organization, independent entrepreneurship is solely an independent activity. This study focuses on this fundamental distinction to identify the parameters of our empirical model. Using nationally representative US data, we find that the effects of being a part-time worker on the likelihood of becoming an independent entrepreneur differ across genders. The obtained results suggest similar findings for intrapreneurship, but in opposite directions. Furthermore, our decomposition results suggest that for both entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship, the gender differences in the employment-related variables are more significant than those in the family-related variables in affecting the observed gender gap negatively (for entrepreneurship) or positively (for intrapreneurship).","[Adachi, Takanori] Nagoya Univ, Sch Econ, Chikusa Ku, 1 Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Hisada, Takanori] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan",Nagoya University; Osaka University,"Adachi, T (通讯作者)，Nagoya Univ, Sch Econ, Chikusa Ku, 1 Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",adachi.t@soec.nagoya-u.ac.jp; pge023ht@student.econ.osaka-u.ac.jp,"Adachi, Takanori/I-6487-2014","Adachi, Takanori/0000-0001-5046-7993","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [23243049, 15K03425]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23243049, 15K03425] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We thank Rui Baptista (editor-in-charge) and two anonymous referees for invaluable suggestions.

In contrast to the vast portfolio- choice literature for SPIAs, we focus on the stochasticity of the DIA's payout yield and address concerns that rates are currently too low to justify irreversible annuitization. We assume a mean-reverting model for payout yields and show that a risk- neutral consumer who wishes to maximize his/ her expected retirement income should wait until yields reach a threshold- which lies above historical averages-and then purchase the DIA in one lump sum. In contrast, a risk- averse consumer who is concerned the payout yield will remain below average for an extended period and worries about losing mortality credits while waiting, should employ a barrier purchasing strategy, as in the portfolio choice problem under transaction costs. We illustrate how this insight is applied in the context of annuitization. In fact, the optimal behavior of a risk-averse consumer resembles an asymmetric dollar-cost averaging strategy, with a portion of the DIA-budget spent even while payout rates are below historical averages. As part of our analysis we offer an easy-to-use asymptotic approximation for the optimal purchasing strategy (threshold) and provide some numerical examples to illustrate the concept.","[Huang, Huaxiong] York Univ, N York, ON, Canada; [Milevsky, Moshe A.] York Univ, Schulich Sch Business, N York, ON, Canada; [Young, Virginia R.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",York University - Canada; York University - Canada; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Huang, HX (通讯作者)，York Univ, N York, ON, Canada.",,"Milevsky, Moshe Arye/AAA-3482-2022","Milevsky, Moshe/0000-0002-5176-8904",IFID Centre; CANNEX; NSERC; SSHRC; Cecil J. and Ethel M.

The study is based on the research of Slovak business environment carried out in 2016, which was evaluated by the tools of descriptive statistics, including percentages and averages, pivot tables, the methods of comparison and deduction, Pearson's chi-square statistics at 5% significance level. Our results suggest that Slovak entrepreneurs primarily supply their products and services on the domestic market, while their export potential is limited. The assessment of the state support of export activities is rather negative.

J,"Mahajan, K",,,,"Mahajan, Kanika",,,Rainfall Shocks and the Gender Wage Gap: Evidence from Indian Agriculture,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,agriculture; wages; gender; rainfall; Asia; India,LABOR-MARKETS; CYCLICALITY; RESPONSES,"In the context of climate change and its effect on poverty, previous studies have shown that productivity shocks in agriculture, such as rainfall variability, affect wages adversely. None of the studies, however, consider the heterogeneity in the impact of these shocks on agricultural wages by gender, a feature which has been studied for demand shocks in urban labor markets for developed countries. Using National Sample Survey data for India from 1993 to 2007, a district-level panel dataset is created to examine how a rainfall shock affects the gender wage gap. The study shows that both female and male wages are positively related to rainfall shocks. Hence, future studies must study the impact of labor market shocks in rural areas on both female and male wages separately. It also finds that the female-to-male wage ratio is significantly positively associated with a rainfall shock in regions where rainfed rice is cultivated, i.e., low (high) rainfall reduces (increases) the female-to-male ratio. The study demonstrates that this result is due to a positive association of demand for female labor with rainfall in these rainfed rice-growing regions. This finding is consistent with the greater marginal value of female labor in rice cultivation, which is also a crop highly sensitive to rainfall variability under rainfed conditions.

We use the GEM database and build an econometric model based on a set of exogenous variables grouped into three large categories: contextual or environmental factors, individual factors and business variables. Given the Venezuelan specific characteristics, we place a particular focus on understanding the differences between entrepreneurs belonging or not to the BoP. The primary findings of this work are the identification of the variables that explain growth aspiration, namely, belonging to the BoP, gender, education, motivation and years of study and some additional variables where individual factors interact with the contextual factor BoP. The second finding is that there are significant differences for the entrepreneurs belonging and not belonging to the BoP, with a threshold where the entrepreneurs of the BoP become averse to continuing to aspire to growth. Practical and policy implications are elaborated with the results.","[Puente, Raquel] Autonoma Occidente Univ, Calle 25 115-85,Km 2 Via Cali Jamundi, Cali, Colombia; [Antonia Cervilla, Maria] Univ Simon Bolivar, Dept Econ & Adm Sci, Caracas, Venezuela; [Giovanni Gonzalez, Carlos] Icesi Univ, Dept Econ, Calle 18 N, Cali 122135, Colombia; [Auletta, Nunzia] IESA, Entrepreneurs Ctr, Ave IESA,Edificio IESA, Caracas, Venezuela",Simon Bolivar University; Universidad ICESI,"Puente, R (通讯作者)，Autonoma Occidente Univ, Calle 25 115-85,Km 2 Via Cali Jamundi, Cali, Colombia.",rpuente@uao.edu.co; mcervilla@usb.ve; cggonzalez@icesi.edu.co; nunzia.auletta@iesa.edu.ve,"Castro, Raquel Puente/AAF-9266-2019; Castro, Raquel Puente/U-5976-2017; Castro, Raquel/HZL-1168-2023","Castro, Raquel Puente/0000-0002-8902-1136;",,,,,134,22,23,2,44,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

To evaluate the accessibility of existing transit services and identify access gaps, it is critical to accurately estimate travel times between transit stops, which change throughout the day due to transit schedule variations. Commonly used methods in PTA ignore such temporal fluctuation. Moreover, these methods are unable to elucidate the causes of poor PTA. To address these issues, we first implemented an algorithm to effectively compute travel times at multiple departure times throughout the day in order to enable spatiotemporal PTA analysis. A series of indicators that are intuitive to interpret were developed to determine the varying causes of poor PTA and identify areas with immediate needs for improvements. We showcase the analytical framework using a transit network in the State of Utah operated by the Utah Transit Authority. The analysis is based solely on publicly-available open datasets, which makes it generally adaptable to other transit networks.

Using the WERS2004 linked employer-employee data and alternative econometric estimators it reports an inverse relationship between workplace union density and gender diversity. Gender and ownership status based sub-group analyses suggest the inverse relationship to be stronger for male union members and those in the private sector. Gender group size-based analysis reveals a positive link between workplace union density and gender diversity in workplaces with a female majority.

When the local rate of inflation increases, local investors subsequently earn lower real returns on local stocks, but not on local bonds or foreign stocks, suggesting that local stock market investors use sticky long-run nominal discount rates that are too low when inflation increases because they are slow to update the inflation expectations in discount rates. Small amounts of stickiness in inflation expectations suffice to match the real stock return predictability induced by inflation in the data.

Using heterogeneous panel cointegration techniques, this paper provides a fresh re-examination of the resource curse while allowing for cross-section heterogeneity and commonalities in the nexus between natural resource abundance and economic development. It finds, in a sample of developing countries, that economies endowed with abundant natural resources tend to develop more slowly than countries with scarce resources. Natural resources are, on average, a curse. However, there is considerable heterogeneity in the effects of resource abundance on economic development across countries, perhaps because of differences in the extent of government intervention, access to sound money, legal structures and the security of property rights, the degree of globalization, and/or corruption.","[Kim, Dong-Hyeon] Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 136701, South Korea; [Lin, Shu-Chin] Tamkang Univ, Dept Econ, 151 Yingzhuan Rd, New Taipei 25137, Taiwan",Korea University; Tamkang University,"Lin, SC (通讯作者)，Tamkang Univ, Dept Econ, 151 Yingzhuan Rd, New Taipei 25137, Taiwan.",econscl@mail.tku.edu.tw,"Lin, Shu-Chin/AAG-3608-2019",,,,,,91,80,83,7,59,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Focusing on Sri Lanka, it explores why and how individuals' wartime experience continues to influence their affinity to subnational entities in post-war society. Analyzing original survey data with Structural Equation Modeling, the results show that civilians' consciousness of rebel statehood has a positive effect on the formation of a subnational identity in the aftermath of civil war. The legacy of rebel governance persists and retains an impact on civilian identity in the post-war context. The findings suggest that those charged with the task of post-war reconstruction need to take into account the long-lasting influence of rebel statehood in order to successfully rebuild integrated communities. A post-war regime cannot simply implant a new national identity if it dismisses this influence because post-war identity is a consequence of civilians' experience of governance by non-governmental but de facto state actors.

While a number of studies have estimated their historic economic impact, arguably the wider community and policy makers are more concerned about their future risk and potential losses, since this type of information is useful for disaster preparedness and mitigation strategy and policy. This paper implements a new approach to undertaking a quantitative wind risk and loss assessment of agriculture in Caribbean island economies. The authors construct an expected loss function that uses synthetically generated, and historical, hurricane tracks within a wind field model that takes cropland exposure derived from satellite data into consideration. The results indicate that expected wind losses are potentially large but vary considerably across the region, where the smaller islands are considerably more likely to be negatively impacted. Moreover, we find that the structure of the agricultural sector can be important in terms of vulnerability.","[Mohan, Preeya] Univ West Indies, Sir Arthur Lewis Inst Social & Econ Studies, Kingston, Jamaica; [Strobl, Eric] Aix Marseille Sch Econ, 2 Rue Charite, F-13002 Marseille, France; [Strobl, Eric] Ctr Vieille Charite, IPAG Res Lab, 2 Rue Charite, F-13002 Marseille, France",University West Indies Mona Jamaica; Aix-Marseille Universite,"Mohan, P (通讯作者)，Univ West Indies, Sir Arthur Lewis Inst Social & Econ Studies, Kingston, Jamaica.",preeya.mohan@sta.uwi.edu; eric.strobl@polytechnique.edu,,"Mohan, Preeya/0000-0003-3333-7198",,,,,34,3,4,2,19,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

The analysis demonstrates through majority voting that the equilibrium emissions tax rate is higher when the income level of the median voter is lower, because residents with low incomes reside near the hazardous site and thus benefit more from pollution abatement than residents with higher incomes.","[Nakada, Minoru] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Nakada, Minoru] Univ British Columbia, Fac Land & Food Syst, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan",Nagoya University,"Nakada, M (通讯作者)，Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.;Nakada, M (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Fac Land & Food Syst, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",mnakada@cc.nagoya-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,18,1,1,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

A Discursive Analysis of Two Cases in Gold-mining Industry in Turkey,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,discourse theory; local movements; MNC; environmental conflict; extractive industry; Turkey,SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; CONFLICT,"This study addresses the question why a struggle emerges between local communities and mining MNCs. Many studies in the extant literature tend to explain the emergence of these struggles by relying on some objective conditions such as the characteristics of the industry, strategies of companies, features of community, and governmental policies. Drawing on Foucauldian and Laclauian insights, we argue that the analysis of such struggles should rather focus on meaning-making processes, through which each party to a struggle articulates surrounding conditions in particular ways, thereby giving shape to new meanings and identities. By comparatively examining Efemcukuru and copler goldmine cases from Turkey, in which a struggle emerges in the former but not in the latter in spite of similar conditions, we demonstrate that the emergence of struggles is mainly due to the construction of rival discourses that construct the issues of mining, environment, and development in highly different ways. We argue that already-prevalent conditions play a role in the emergence of struggles to the extent that they are employed, framed, and refrained in the rival anti-mining and pro-mining discourses. The argument goes further that the availability of anti-mining discourse when the local meaning systems are dislocated by the arrival of MNCs, as well as its popular appeal at the local level are critical in the emergence of local mobilizations against gold-mining. Finally, emphasis is put on the relational nature of struggle processes, where anti-mining and pro-mining discourses are mutually constituted and reconstituted through a constant reformulation of hegemonic strategies.

Industry and size differences between domestic and foreign-owned firms account for much of this slowdown. However, multinationals from different countries performed differently during the crisis. The paper then assesses the role of multinationals in the global recession using a quantitative model.

One proposed reason for such distortions is that coalition governments face more severe 'common pool problems' since parties use their control over specific ministries to advance their specific spending priorities rather than practice budgetary discipline. We suggest that this view of multiparty government is incomplete and that we need to take into account that coalitions may have established certain control mechanisms to deal with such problems. One such mechanism is the drafting of a coalition agreement. Our results, when focusing on the spending behavior of cabinets formed in 17 Western European countries (1970-1998), support our claim that coalition agreements matter for the performance of multiparty cabinets in economic policy-making. More specifically, we find clear support for an original conditional hypothesis suggesting that coalition agreements significantly reduce the negative effect of government fragmentation on government spending in those institutional contexts where prime ministerial power is low.","[Back, Hanna] Lund Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Box 52, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Mueller, Wolfgang C.] Univ Vienna, Dept Govt, Vienna, Austria; [Nyblade, Benjamin] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Law, Los Angeles, CA USA",Lund University; University of Vienna; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Bäck, H (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Box 52, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.",Hanna.Back@svet.lu.se; wolfgang.mueller@univie.ac.at; nyblade@law.ucla.edu,"Muller, Wolfgang C./K-4948-2013","Muller, Wolfgang C./0000-0001-9085-9465; Back, Hanna/0000-0002-0296-9419",German Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB 884: C1]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [I1607] Funding Source: Austrian Science Fund (FWF),German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),This research was carried out under the auspices of the SFB 'Political Economy of Reforms' (SFB 884: C1) financed by the German Research Foundation (DFG).,,62,23,23,1,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JAN,2017,170.0,1-2,,,,,33,62,,10.1007/s11127-016-0373-0,0.0,,,30,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,ED4RC,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000388837000002,0

The conclusion is that the policy of import substitution as a phenomenon can be successfully analyzed and applied to the examples of other countries.","[Beregova, Galina Mihaylovna; Klipin, Alexey Olegovich] Irkutsk Natl Res Tech Univ, Inst Econ Management & Law, Irkutsk, Russia",Irkutsk National Research Technical University (INRTU),"Beregova, GM (通讯作者)，Irkutsk Natl Res Tech Univ, Inst Econ Management & Law, Irkutsk, Russia.",gmberegova@mail.ru; alek7ey09@gmail.com,"Beregova, Galina/AAX-3808-2020",,Irkutsk National Research Technical University,Irkutsk National Research Technical University,The authors acknowledge receiving support from state-funded research program of Irkutsk National Research Technical University.

Our paper tries to fill some of them and contributes to the existing literature in two ways. Firstly, by showing the relationship between ownership structure and intellectual capital efficiency, we provide direct evidence for the substantive role of intellectual capital for various stakeholders. Secondly, prior studies on the relationship between ownership structure and intellectual capital efficiency were mostly conducted in Asian emerging markets. In contrast, this paper examines this relationship in a Central and Eastern European country. In view of this, the purpose of our study is to investigate the relationship between ownership structure and intellectual capital efficiency measured by the value added intellectual coefficient in the Polish listed companies. Analysing an unbalanced panel data on the sample of 354 Polish companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange and 1,505 company-year observations between 2006 and 2011, we found that managerial ownership negatively affects the value added intellectual coefficient and structural capital efficiency. In addition, foreign ownership negatively impacts capital employed efficiency.","[Bohdanowicz, Leszek; Urbanek, Grzegorz] Univ Lodz, Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Bohdanowicz, L (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Lodz, Poland.",,,"Urbanek, Grzegorz/0000-0002-1372-8127; Bohdanowicz, Leszek/0000-0002-4456-070X",,,,,50,0,0,2,18,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-286-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,84,95,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393400009,0

Such events have led many to question the importance of democratic processes. The papers in this special section challenge both the uncritical advocates and over-critical naysayers of the third wave by treating democratisation as a long-term and contested transition from closed to open access societies, where elections represent a necessary but not sufficient mechanism to guarantee representation for excluded groups. The three papers focus on the critical role of civil society organisations (CSOs) in securing representation for marginal actors, drawing on the cases of Bangladesh and Uganda. In doing so the contributions illustrate the challenges that CSOs confront in situations marked by the problems of clientelism, capture and exclusion.","[Brett, E.

The European Commission's initiative on Digitizing European Industry, adopted on 19 April 2016, represents one of the most important measures assumed in the latest years at the European level. However, the last places that Romania has constantly occupied both in the European digitization and competitiveness rankings, should represent a big concern for Romanian authorities and its public policies. The gaps between objectives and results related to digitization process and competitiveness are very high and impose rapid and determined policy measures. The paper provides a brief overview of the current EU evolutions in the field of digitization process either from legislative, institutional and output perspectives. On the other hand, the paper focuses on the significant gaps between estimated and real results recorded by Romania in terms of economy digitization, in order to identify the main deficiencies of the country's digitization strategies and policies. This comparison intends to provide a clear picture of the Romanian's position in the field of digitization in order to respond to the secondary objective of the paper - increasing the awareness of public decision makers on this topic. The paper concludes that, taking into account, on one hand, the fact that the digitalization reality covers the entire world, proving a high degree of dynamism that imposes rapid and constant adaptation to these new realities and, on the other hand, the low national scores recorded by the Romanian digitization process, the Romanian public authorities must reanalyze its specific digital strategies and policies and better exploit the main threats and the opportunities provided by the current European and global context.","[Buica, Mihaela; Dragan, Gabriela] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 Piata Romana,1st Dist, Bucharest 010374, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Buica, M (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 Piata Romana,1st Dist, Bucharest 010374, Romania.",mihaelabuica2002@yahoo.com; gabriela.dragan@rei.ase.ro,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,2,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-269-9,STRATEGICA,,,2017,,,,,,,29,43,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0ZU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431586800002,0

In recent conditions of global economic crisis accompanied by historically low GDP growth and challenges in potential growth, financial market counterparties were placed in rather unfavourable conditions of profound risks, expanding regulatory requirements and turbid profit perspectives. Such conditions became a greenhouse for innovations accelerating the emergence of various alternative finance opportunities, which were believed to solve or at least mitigate the pressure of the topical problems of access to finance and overall lack of investments. The research aim of this paper is to suggest a fundamental understanding of what the term alternative finance represents by developing a systematisation of alternative finance providers which could be taken as a basis for further research in this area. To reach the set goal, a number of top publications by leading experts and professional organisations will be acknowledged, highlighting the organisational criteria and main characteristics of alternative channels for raising both funding or credit resources. Through the work, the author will use the monographic method, the method of economic analysis and the method of graphic visualisation. Developing a consensus view on what the term alternative finance constitutes could have an important role in further academic research as well as provide a certain support to the on-going development of alternative finance regulation by providing a decent input in the practical sense. The results of the presented work state that despite the belief that the alternative investment market is poorly understood, the research done up to now allows us to move to the next step and promote the development of a detailed market structure classification and analysis.","[Dibrova, Alina] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Dibrova, A (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,,,,,,,19,0,1,0,0,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-286-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,133,142,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393400014,0

The search for the optimal geographical location for unloading a vessel using a helicopter is an urgent task, since such way of unloading a vessel is very expensive. The mathematical model of finding a geographical location for maximally profitable transportation of cargo from a cargo vessel using a helicopter to the necessary points of unloading is developed in the work.

The stages of forming a strategy for effective management of the fixed production assets of the oil company are given. Recommendations on the choice of the strategy of technological renewal and effective use of fixed production assets of the oil company are formed on the basis of the ratio of an integrated indicator of the efficiency of the use of the company's fixed production assets and the integral level of environmental factors affecting the process of reproduction of the company's fixed production assets. Formation of the integrated indicator of the efficiency of use of the company's fixed assets is made through the standardization of single indicators of the efficiency fixed production assets. Assessment of the impact of environmental factors on the process of reproduction of the company's fixed production assets is carried out by means of an expert method. A scale for assessing the level of impact of environmental factors on the company's activity is presented. By the example of the oil company PJSOC Bashneft, an experimental approbation of the offered approach is carried out.

The data analysis covers the period between 2007 and 2016. The first indicator taken under consideration is Return on equity (ROE), which shows the profit generated by a company based on the money invested by shareholders. A second indicator that we analyse is Return on assets (ROA), which shows the banks capability to generate profit from the use of its assets. We will also try to decompose each indicator using the DuPont analysis in order to determine which factor had a larger influence on its evolution.

The empirical application conducted on seven market indices in the euro zone over the period from 11/28/2003 to 11/25/2012 high-lights several mechanical interdependencies. The relationship detected in the mean equation confirm the leading role of the French and German indices, an organization of Southern Europe countries around the Italian index and the isolation of Greek and Irish indices. The psychological interdependencies revealed by the specification DCC-GJR-GARCH show two particular groups: the first is composed of ATHEX, CAC, ISEQ, IBEX and DAX indices and the second concerns the Italian and Portuguese indices. We find strong correlations for the Franco-German couple while we note a de-correlation, in the first group between CAC, DAX, ISEQ, IBEX with the Hellenic index following the sovereign debt crisis.

The company-led cooperative represents an innovative supply chain governance mechanism in a Chinese context. However, the pork industry has evolved significantly and the time has come for the senior management team at Jinzhong to decide whether or not to keep the cooperative.

Drawing on intensive fieldwork in Western Uganda, this paper argues that Charles Tilly's 'democratisation as process' provides us with the framework required to explain the ways in which particular kinds of association can advance democratisation from below. Moving beyond the current focus on how elite-bargaining and certain associational forms may contribute to liberal forms of democracy, this approach helps identify the intermediate mechanisms involved in building democracy from below, including the significance of challenging categorical inequalities, notably through the role of producer groups, and of building trust networks, cross-class alliances and synergistic relations between civil and political society. The evidence and mode of analysis deployed here help suggest alternative routes for supporting local efforts to build democracy from below in sub-Saharan Africa.","[King, Sophie] Univ Salford, Sch Built Environm, Salford, Lancs, England; [Hickey, Sam] Univ Manchester, Global Dev Inst, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Salford; University of Manchester,"King, S (通讯作者)，Univ Salford, Sch Built Environm, Salford, Lancs, England.",s.d.king@salford.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [K63440E],Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council [K63440E].,,44,5,5,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

The Basel III Agreement calls for the strengthening of bank's capitals, the increase of liquid assets, and the reduction of overall level of risk of the banking activities. Because of that many authors believe that a full adoption of Basel III will contribute to a greater financial stability of banks and reduce bank profits, as well as their profitability. However, in Latvia, in the post-crisis years, an increase of banks' profits has been observed. In this article, the development of Latvian banking system in the post-crisis period in comparison with pre-crisis tendencies is analysed. The bank profitability indicators, the level of bank capital adequacy, liquidity and the credit activity are assessed. The author evaluates the reasons for bank profits and profitability increase, and appraises the sustainability of this tendency. The purpose of this research is the evaluation of the post-crisis development of the Latvian banking system and the impact of the Basel III Accord on the further development of the banking sector in Latvia. In order to establish a causal link between the profitability of banking activities and the level of bank capital adequacy, liquidity and lending rates of growth, the author constructs a VAR model. The author also assesses the sensitivity of key bank profitability indicators, using the analysis of impulse responses. The analysis reveals that profitability increase has short-term character, but full implementation of the Basel III Accord will be associated with the reduction in the bank profitability.","[Kudinska, Marina] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Kudinska, M (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,"Kudinska, Marina/AAB-7289-2020","Kudinska, Marina/0000-0002-7704-2976",,,,,16,1,1,2,2,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-286-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,298,307,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393400030,0

We use a neoclassical framework and regression analysis to examine the short-run and the long-run effects of tourism whilst accounting for structural breaks. We confirm the presence of a long-run association using the two-step procedure of Engle and Granger (1987) and the ARDL bounds test of Pesaran, Shin and Smith (2001). From the long-run results, we note that a 1% increase in visitor arrivals contribute about 0.22% to the GDP per capita. The short run elasticity is noted to be 0.19%. The study finds evidence of a unidirectional causality from economic growth to tourism, and mutually reinforcing effect between capital investment and tourism. Thus, we can expect greater impact of tourism on the economic growth through tourism related investment activities such as improvements in airports, roads, transportation, financial sector and telecommunications, and parks and beaches.","[Kumar, Nikeel; Kumar, Ronald R.; Stauverman, Peter] Univ South Pacific, Suva, Fiji; [Patel, Arvind] Univ Leicester, Leicester, Leics, England",University of the South Pacific; University of Leicester,"Kumar, N (通讯作者)，Univ South Pacific, Suva, Fiji.",kumar_RN@usp.ac.fj; rrk8@student.le.ac.uk,"Kumar, Nikeel/AAS-9818-2021; Kumar, Ronald Ravinesh/H-4968-2015; Kumar, Ronald/AAK-7991-2020","Kumar, Nikeel/0000-0001-5950-1027; Kumar, Ronald Ravinesh/0000-0001-9658-4896;",,,,,52,13,13,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-11-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,194,214,,,,,,21,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO0GY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000490868000016,0

In this paper, the procedure of regionalization of municipalities of the Republic of Bashkortostan in terms of socio-economic development using panel data modeling is outlined. Firstly, the panel data model of economic growth for all municipalities of the Republic of Bashkortostan is evaluated. Then, clusters of municipalities are formed by grouping fixed individual effects obtained in the construction of the model at the first step. After that, all panel data models are restructured, according to the newly selected clusters of municipalities. Finally, partial coefficients of elasticity are analyzed for the factors influencing the economic growth for each selected cluster.","[Lakman, Irina] Ufa State Aviat Tech Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Robot, Ufa, Russia; [Gafarova, Elena] Russian Acad Sci, Fed State Budgetary Inst Sci, Inst Social & Econ Res, Ufa Sci Ctr, Ufa, Russia; [Bakhitova, Railya; Gindullin, Ramiz] Bashkir State Univ, Inst Econ Finance & Business, Ufa, Russia",Ufa University of Science & Technology; Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Biochemistry & Genetics of Ufa Science Centre of the RAS; Ufa University of Science & Technology,"Lakman, I (通讯作者)，Ufa State Aviat Tech Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Robot, Ufa, Russia.",lackmania@mail.ru; gafarovaea@mail.ru; bakhitovarh@mail.ru; ramizgindullin@gmail.com,"Gindullin, Ramiz/AAH-4236-2019; Lakman, Irina/K-6878-2017",,,,,,23,0,0,0,3,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-408-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,38.0,,,,,,392,398,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI9HY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416099600065,0

Furthermore, we construct the upstream and the downstream foreign restriction index, and examine the impact of foreign investment liberalization on China's export and value-added exports through empirical analysis. The results show that: reduction of the restrictions on foreign investment can promote China's the export of total industry and services, and enhance the competitiveness of exports. Whether the services industry played as an upstream or downstream one, service industry opening can effectively promote its upstream and downstream industry export. Service industry liberalization has strong externality, which means its export effects on upstream and downstream industries are significantly higher than on itself.","[Li, Yang; Huang, Yanxi] Univ Int Business & Econ, China Inst WTO Studies, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics,"Li, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, China Inst WTO Studies, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-382-1,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,48.0,,,,,,222,229,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI9GL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416078200047,0

However, CSA technological innovation diffusion is subject to socio-economic barriers. The success of innovations is partly dependent on the business models that are used to diffuse them. Within the context of innovations for CSA, the role that innovation providers' business models play in the successful adoption and diffusion has received limited attention. In this paper we identify critical issues for business models for CSA technological innovations (BMfCSATI). Our results indicate that current BMfCSATIs are not optimised for diffusing CSA technological innovations. Critical business model elements include the value proposition, channels, customer relationships, key resources, key partners, and cost structure. We find a disparity between the views of CSA technological innovation providers and potential users. The paper explores the implications of the results and develops recommendations for CSA technological innovation providers' business models.","[Long, Thomas B.] Wageningen Univ, Business Models Sustainabil, Management Studies, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Blok, Vincent] Wageningen Univ, Sustainable Entrepreneurship, Business Eth & Responsible Innovat, Management Studies, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Poldner, Kim] Wageningen Univ, Management Studies, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"Long, TB (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Business Models Sustainabil, Management Studies, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",thomas.long@wur.nl,"Blok, Vincent/E-6210-2013","Blok, Vincent/0000-0002-9086-4544; Long, Thomas Benjamin/0000-0002-0655-3779",Climate-KIC,Climate-KIC,The authors are grateful for the financial support provided by Climate-KIC that enabled the research upon which this paper is based.,,53,34,37,6,84,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Second, we find evidence that insurers are less likely to sell downgraded bonds that remain in the same rating class than bonds downgraded to a lower rating class. The result implies that insurers sell downgraded bonds mainly because of additional capital charge is imposed, not because of downgrade itself. In other words, risk factors in risk-based capital regulation do matter on life insurers' investment risk taking.

The data on 83 Russian regions in 2006-2014 comprises GRP and tax revenues disaggregated by main economic activities and certain taxes and tax groups. For estimation of tax yield rate inequality we calculated the GRP-weighted Gini and variation coefficients and used different techniques of their decomposition. The tax system risk was evaluated by means of the inter-temporal variance in tax yield rate. Ultimately we used power functions and logarithmic analysis for assessment of tax system elasticity, and correlation and regression analysis for determination of interrelations of the tax systems properties. The results demonstrate that mineral extraction tax and the mining industry predominantly contribute to the tax yield rate inter-regional inequality in Russia, while the personal income tax, manufacturing industry and public administration have the largest smoothing effects. For Russian regions tax system we revealed significant direct connection of inter-industrial inequality to the system profitability and elasticity and inverse correlation with its stability. The evidence of interrelation of tax systems properties may be useful for optimization of tax policies at various levels of public administration.","[Malkina, Marina] Lobachevsky State Univ Nizhny Novgorod, Inst Econ & Entrepreneurship, Novgorod, Russia",Lobachevsky State University of Nizhni Novgorod,"Malkina, M (通讯作者)，Lobachevsky State Univ Nizhny Novgorod, Inst Econ & Entrepreneurship, Novgorod, Russia.",mmuri@yandex.ru,"Malkina, Marina/M-2681-2017","Malkina, Marina/0000-0002-3152-3934",Russian Foundation for Humanities [15-02-00638],Russian Foundation for Humanities,"The research was funded by Russian Foundation for Humanities as part of project No 15-02-00638, The relationship between income inequality and economic development in the regions of the Russian Federation.",,13,1,1,0,3,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",2336-1239,,978-80-210-8448-3,CURR TREND PUB SECT,,,2017,,,,,,,170,177,,,,,,8,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BH7FG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402427100021,0

Hail occurrence in low and high risk areas was considered as the production risk, with Short-term Crop Hail Insurance (SCHI) and a Contingency Policy (Self-insurance) in the Alternative Risk Transfer (ART) market as insurance options. A financial simulation model was built to simulate the cash flow of a maize enterprise and to calculate the producer's annual margin after interest and tax. Stochastic Efficiency with Respect to a Function (SERF) was used to rank Net Present Value (NPV) of the margin after interest and tax for different scenarios of Certainty Equivalents (CE's) and to calculate the Utility Weighted Risk Premium (UWRP) of each scenario. The model could evaluate the effectiveness of crop insurance products. The SCHI was the preferred option in Mpumalanga (high hail risk area) and ART in North West (low hail risk area) based on the cost effectiveness of the options. The ART, however, was not able to provide constant cover at all times and the long term efficiency thereof should be carefully considered before it is applied as the sole hail risk mitigation strategy.","[Mare, Frikkie; Grove, Bennie; Willemse, Johan] Univ Free State, Dept Agr Econ, POB 339, ZA-9301 Bloemfontein, South Africa",University of the Free State,"Maré, F (通讯作者)，Univ Free State, Dept Agr Econ, POB 339, ZA-9301 Bloemfontein, South Africa.",marefa@ufs.ac.za,"Maré, Frikkie A/H-5270-2018; Grove, Bennie/E-5395-2015","Maré, Frikkie A/0000-0001-9836-060X; Grove, Bennie/0000-0002-5325-2637",,,,,21,0,0,0,9,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2017,56.0,3,,,,,233,247,,10.1080/03031853.2017.1335604,0.0,,,15,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,FH0YL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000410866500002,0

Human capital refers to knowledge (explicit and/or tacit) held by individuals and teams, as well as its ability to regenerate or their capacity to learn. The purpose of this paper is to examine the nexus between intentional unlearning and human capital. This study further reflects on dynamic capabilities and knowledge management highlighting that knowledge resources are critical to achieve organisational innovation. Dynamic capabilities depend upon the ability to 'upgrade' and ameliorate knowledge through both exploration and exploitation. The advantages of exploitation are based on increased efficiency while those of exploration are based on increased innovation. Organisational routines and standard operating procedures carried out daily, lead to inertia, stifle creativity and thwart innovation. Past learning inhibits new learning and, therefore, organisations need to unlearn old ideas by reflecting on their insufficiencies and abandoning them. This capacity for unlearning is important because there seems to be the urgent need for organisations to give up obsolete knowledge. Moreover, the old dominant logic must be unlearned in order for organisations to embrace innovation and creativity. This conceptual paper critiques organisational learning models and highlights the capacity for unlearning in the organisational learning processes. Furthermore, this paper critically analyses the typologies of unlearning and forgetting as well as related barriers of forgetting in the organisational process and does not offer any empirical test. The social constructivist perspective of organisational learning is adopted within a dynamic capability theoretical framework. Our research shows that a lack of the unlearning capacity in the extant organisational learning models can be regarded as a weakness and we think its inclusion is necessary.","[Martins, Isabel; Martins, Ana; Vajeth, Taahir] Univ Kwazulu Natal, Durban, South Africa; [Pereira, Orlando] Univ Minho, Braga, Portugal",University of Kwazulu Natal; Universidade do Minho,"Martins, I (通讯作者)，Univ Kwazulu Natal, Durban, South Africa.",martinsm@ukzn.ac.za; martinsa@uzkn.ac.za; orlandop@eeg.uminho.pt; Vajetht@ukzn.ac.za,"Martins, Isabel/M-5467-2019; Martins, Ana/S-1831-2016","Martins, Isabel/0000-0001-5095-7028; Martins, Ana/0000-0002-9271-2114; Pereira, Orlando/0000-0003-4635-2696",,,,,55,0,0,0,12,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-911218-31-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2017,,,,,,,213,220,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI0KF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404891000027,0

We provide a model in which a self-interested ruler chooses an institution that constrains his or her policy choice. The ruler must care about the extent of citizens' support in order to remain in power. Under an extractive institution, the ruler can extract a large share of citizens' wealth, but faces a high probability of losing power because of low public support. We show that inequality affects the ruler's tradeoff between the expropriation of citizens' wealth and his or her hold on power. Substantial inequality among citizens makes support for the ruler inelastic with respect to his or her institutional choice. The ruler therefore chooses an extractive institution, which impedes investment and growth. These results provide an explanation for the negative relationship between inequality and growth as well as the negative relationship between inequality and institutional quality, both of which are observed in nondemocratic countries.","[Mizuno, Nobuhiro] Osaka Univ Econ, Fac Econ, Higashiyodogawa Ku, 2-2-8 Osumi, Osaka 5338533, Japan; [Naito, Katsuyuki] Asia Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 5-24-10 Sakai, Musashino, Tokyo 1808629, Japan; [Okazawa, Ryosuke] Osaka City Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Sumiyoshi Ku, 3-3-138 Sugimoto, Osaka 5588585, Japan",Osaka Metropolitan University,"Mizuno, N (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ Econ, Fac Econ, Higashiyodogawa Ku, 2-2-8 Osumi, Osaka 5338533, Japan.",nobu.mizuno8@gmail.com,,"Okazawa, Ryosuke/0000-0002-2456-2812; Naito, Katsuyuki/0000-0001-8894-6615; Mizuno, Nobuhiro/0000-0002-0547-5801","JSPS [15K21290]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K21290, 25245040] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We are grateful to William F.

The results indicate that an intercrop of pearl millet and groundnuts is the most economically viable farming system compared with other alternative scenarios if supplemented with rainwater harvesting technology.

We estimate the stochastic meta-frontier and region-specific stochastic frontiers based on the 'true random effects' framework. Our results show variations in efficiency measures and that smallholder maize production is characterised by increasing returns to scale across all regions, which clearly suggest maize farmers to reduce their average long-term costs by increasing their production scale. We find that some regions are on average more technically efficient than others while those with TE values exceeding 90 per cent operate further below their potential output than those with moderate TE values. Similarly, farm households from regions whose mean TE values are about 90 per cent employ inferior farming techniques to those employed by farmers from regions whose mean TE values are lower. This is in part due to industry-wide specific environmental factors. Most importantly, we find no region to have maize farmers that adopt the most advanced techniques.

Generally, our results point to the need to promote superior techniques that would withstand industry-wide specific environmental factors. While it is not possible to find the many reasons for wide variations in TEs, TGRs, and MTEs across regions and time, our results make novel contributions to literature.","[Ng'ombe, John N.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Ng'ombe, John N.] Univ Zambia, Dept Agr Econ & Extens, POB 32379, Lusaka 10101, Zambia",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; University of Zambia,"Ng'ombe, JN (通讯作者)，Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.;Ng'ombe, JN (通讯作者)，Univ Zambia, Dept Agr Econ & Extens, POB 32379, Lusaka 10101, Zambia.",ngombe@okstate.edu,"Ng'ombe, John Nedson/I-2655-2019; Ng'ombe, John N./GXA-1230-2022","Ng'ombe, John Nedson/0000-0002-1410-1350;",,,,,50,28,31,0,9,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2017,56.0,4,,,,,347,365,,10.1080/03031853.2017.1409127,0.0,,,19,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,FR9MU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000419398600003,0

The proposed conceptual model was based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). This was extended by adding perceived risk, perceived cost and trust as external factors. In addition, the conceptual model was extended by adding three dimensions of CSR including Economic responsibility, Environmental responsibility and Social responsibility as the antecedents of trust. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was conducted to analyze the data collected from the field survey questionnaires administered to a convenience sample of Vietnamese banking customers. The results showed that behavioural intention is significantly influenced by perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived risk and trust. Specially, CSR initiatives play a vital role in building customer's trust. Therefore, this study has attempted to fill this gapby empirically examining some of the important factors influencing the adoption of m-banking from the Vietnamese customers' perspective. Finally, practical and theoretical implications for both Vietnamese banks and researchers in the m-banking context are also discussed in the concluding section.","[Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao; Nguyen Van Anh; Han, Sang-Lin] Dalat Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Da Lat, Vietnam",Dalat University,"Thao, NTP (通讯作者)，Dalat Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Da Lat, Vietnam.",thaonguyendhdl@gmail.com,"Han, Sang-Lin/V-4533-2017; Nguyen, Anh Van/ABB-3424-2021","Nguyen, Anh Van/0000-0003-3640-1482",,,,,63,0,0,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-11-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,470,496,,,,,,27,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO0GY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000490868000038,0

As a result, it is becoming extremely difficult to secure against internal threats and safeguard sensitive data in such a multi-system environment. There is a need for a common centralised data protection platform. One way to defend against internal threats using intelligent algorithms is Anomaly Activity Detection (AAD). To gain benefits of AAD systems and avoid their typical problems, we have developed our own AAD framework, which is embedded into the IS at the application level of the OSI model. To solve the problems associated with the growth of the number of information systems, an extension of common user behaviour profile to a distributed one has been developed within the framework of the research. One user has a common profile for all ISs of a corporate information network; as a result, the costs of implementing, maintaining and using the abnormal behaviour detection system are significantly reduced. At the same time, there is a cumulative effect when the amount of data about the user behaviour increases due to their receipt from all target ISs, which gives improvement in the efficiency of such a global profile. The paper proposes three approaches to building distributed profiles of user behaviour.","[Osipov, Pavel] Riga Tech Univ, Riga, Latvia; [Cizovs, Jurijs; Zabinako, Vitalijs] ABC Software Ltd, Riga, Latvia",Riga Technical University,"Osipov, P (通讯作者)，Riga Tech Univ, Riga, Latvia.",,,,"research project Competence Centre of Information and Communication Technologies of the EU Structural Funds [1.2.1.1/16/A/007]; Central Finance and Contracting Agency, Research Adaptation of Method for Identification of Suspicious Activities of IT System Users to Conditions Similar to Real Environment [1.5]","research project Competence Centre of Information and Communication Technologies of the EU Structural Funds; Central Finance and Contracting Agency, Research Adaptation of Method for Identification of Suspicious Activities of IT System Users to Conditions Similar to Real Environment","The present research has received funding from the research project Competence Centre of Information and Communication Technologies of the EU Structural Funds, contract No. 1.2.1.1/16/A/007 signed between the IT Competence Centre and the Central Finance and Contracting Agency, Research No. 1.5 Adaptation of Method for Identification of Suspicious Activities of IT System Users to Conditions Similar to Real Environment.",,11,0,0,0,1,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-286-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,407,416,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393400041,0

The methodology is based on the regression analysis with the sample of 98 observations. The results of the econometric analysis confirmed that with a higher number of bids the competitive effect in the case of collection and disposal of municipal waste transfers into the lower level of expenditure per capita. However, far more significant effect has the change of suppliers or distributing contracts between several suppliers. In terms of economic efficiency, a market size also appears to be important.

In particular, it examines the long-and short-run relationships among the stock market indices of eight countries: China (CH), Japan (JP), Korea (KR), Malaysia (MY), Indonesia (ID), Philippines (PH), Thailand (TH), and Singapore (SG). Design/methodology/approach - The study applied a global VAR and vector error correction model (VECM) model to investigate this relationship using daily data over the period from first March 1992 to end of September 2013. The study period has been separated into pre-1997/1998 financial crisis period (1992-1997) and post-1997/1998 crisis period (1999-2013). Findings - The findings show that the stock markets in the ASEAN region are integrated during both periods of financial crises. However, the markets are moving toward better integration, particularly during the post-crisis period. This is supported by the results of the error correction which indicated that most ASEAN+ 3 stock market indices adjust quickly within the short run to a shock in the long-run equilibrium relationships in the region during both the pre- and post-crisis periods. In addition, the results of the VECM causality test showed that a short-run relationship exists among the ASEAN+3 stock market indices. Practical implications - The results of this study therefore have two implications: first, for investors in terms of construction of the portfolio diversification strategies across difference stock markets in Asian region, and second, for policy makers, as the study presents an understanding of financial exposure in their countries as consequences of changes that occur in the other stock market indices in the ASEAN region. Social implications - The investors can find the potential sectors for the portfolio investments. Originality/value - The paper is one of the pioneers to examine the validity of ASEAN+3 financial cooperation agreement.","[Rahman, Md.

Service blueprinting is used as a framework to investigate the possible methods to improve the service as well as to determine the possible failure points in the two cases. Furthermore, this research found out that blueprint could be used as a quality mechanism. In addition, it is discovered that the difference in organization size from both cases produces a significant impact on the number of service actions delivered, such as Quality Assurance implementation, cultural barrier, and financial challenge.

Our exploration of the factors motivating AFs to engage in such contracts uses instrumental-variable probit regressions to control for endogeneity in our transaction-cost economics model. This model incorporates the importance of household characteristics, transaction characteristics, transaction costs, risk behaviour, and trust in the choice of contract between AFs and their intermediaries. These intermediaries play an important role in facilitating transactions and contractual relationships between AFs and processors in the marketing value chain. We find that social capital is a statistically significant instrumental variable in our model. We also find that risk behaviour and trust are not statistically significant in influencing the choice of governance structure.

By conditioning access to their low-cost loans and lucrative markets on foreign sales and local content, for example, East Asian officials forced their manufacturers to improve quality, cut costs, and develop linkages to allied industries - that generated jobs and foreign exchange revenues of their own - in the so-called miracle years. But the politics of performance standards are themselves unclear. Why are they more common in some countries than others? Are they more likely to be imposed by autocratic than democratic regimes? And, if so, why? I address these questions by examining cross-national data on export and local content requirements in the auto industry in 1980; find that they all but presupposed autocracy in labour-surplus - but not labour-scarce - countries; explore the interactions of political regimes, productive assets, and performance standards in South Korea in particular; and discuss their theoretical and methodological implications. The results not only imply that efforts to build new comparative advantages over the long run by means of performance standards that put existing comparative advantages at risk in the short run are unlikely to succeed in labour-surplus democracies but, in so doing, speak to the merits of middle-N' methods and typologies that try to reconcile the at times competing goals of generality and historical detail in cross-national research.","[Schrank, Andrew] Brown Univ, Dept Sociol & Int Studies, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Brown University,"Schrank, A (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Dept Sociol & Int Studies, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",andrew_schrank@brown.edu,,,,,,,162,4,5,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

NG's model is used in the solution stage in the application. In this research, a new type of supplier selection problem called long-term supplier selection problem with a case study is proposed. Finally, solution of long-term supplier selection problem by a new approach is presented. According to the values obtained by scoring, it has been determined that a long-term agreement can be concluded with the supplier no. 4 (S4) and a long or medium-term agreement can be made with supplier no. 2 (S2). S1, S3 and S5 are determined as the suppliers with the worst performances. As a result, it has been shown to the company that working with S1, S3 and S5 suppliers will not generate any benefits.","[Senyigit, Ercan] Erciyes Univ, Dept Ind Engn, TR-38039 Kayseri, Turkey; [Soylemez, Ismet] Abdullah Gul Univ, Dept Ind Engn, TR-38039 Kayseri, Turkey; [Atici, Ugur] 2nd ASMC, Ground Syst Directorate, TR-380100 Kayseri, Turkey",Erciyes University; Abdullah Gul University,"Senyigit, E (通讯作者)，Erciyes Univ, Dept Ind Engn, TR-38039 Kayseri, Turkey.",senyigit@erciyes.edu.tr,"söylemez, ismet/AAG-4835-2021; SENYIGIT, Ercan/AAG-4509-2019","söylemez, ismet/0000-0002-8253-9389; SENYIGIT, Ercan/0000-0002-9388-2633",,,,,22,3,3,1,3,"SCIENCEPARK SCI, ORGANIZATION & COUNSELING LTD",KYRENIA,"13 SUBAT ST, NO 17, KYRENIA, 99030, CYPRUS",2547-8818,,,N TR ISS P HUM SOC S,,,2017,,,,,,,182,189,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM4PU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000463801800023,0

This paper focuses on results of insolvency proceedings in the case of enterprises which do not have a traditional headquarter. Instead of the traditional headquarter these enterprises are registered at virtual addresses for a purpose of business register. Among the professional public this institute enables discussions about lower transparency and even functioning of grey-area. First the paper analyzes results for enterprises with virtual address and second these results are compared with traditional enterprises. Research questions are based on probability of insolvency proposal, kind of bankruptcy (with default and without default) and level of creditors' satisfaction. The used data are extracted from business as well as insolvency register. The gained results show that there are significant differences between the insolvency proceedings of traditional and virtual enterprises which have in this case higher probability of insolvency, lower level of creditor's satisfaction and therefore many cases finish without default due to enterprises' property emptiness.","[Smrcka, Lubos; Placek, Jan] Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Fak Podnikohospodarska, Prague, Czech Republic; [Camska, Dagmar] Ceske Vysoke Uceni Tech Praze, Masarykuv Ustav Vyssich Studii, Prague, Czech Republic; [Arltova, Marketa] Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Fak Informatiky & Stat, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Czech Technical University Prague; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Smrcka, L (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Fak Podnikohospodarska, Prague, Czech Republic.",lubos.smrcka@vse.cz; dagmar.camska@cvut.cz; marketa.arltova@vse.cz; jan.placek@vse.cz,"Čámská, Dagmar/AAC-7644-2020; Smrcka, Lubos/AFV-1635-2022; Arltová, Markéta/P-4315-2018","Čámská, Dagmar/0000-0003-4597-379X; Smrcka, Lubos/0000-0003-4966-2171;",,,,,24,4,4,0,3,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

On the basis of estimated demand function it is possible to calculate the coefficient of price elasticity of demand and income. When compiling a function of demand, it is necessary to analyse the behaviour of the market as a whole. The motion in the Slovak Republic to reduce the rate of VAT on selected food products to 10% sought to increase domestic consumption of these goods. One of these products is bread, which belongs to staple foods in the home. In order to check the impact of reduction in the rate of VAT on the amount of consumption, we opted for the period of 11 years (2005-2015).","[Vrtikova, Kristina] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Management, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Vrtíková, K (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Management, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",kika.vrtikova@hotmail.com,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,VYDAVATELSTVO EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"DOLNOZENSKA CESTA 1-B, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-4429-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,500,508,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP5LI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000556157800059,0

We focus on the implementer effect' on the programme participation of the treated farmers. We demonstrate that the heterogeneous programme participation of ordinary farmers could be induced due to heterogeneity in the characteristics of the project staff. In particular, we indicate that the baseline altruism of the project staff, measured by the dictator game, consistently increases the participation rate and the number of participations in the training sessions of beneficiaries. This type of heterogeneity in project staffs' preferences across treatment sites could be a source of treatment heterogeneity for programmes conducted at a certain cluster level. While few studies have focused on the heterogeneity of programme implementers, our empirical results indicate that the preference of implementers could be a source of treatment heterogeneity and imply the importance of implementation of an actual project.","[Wakano, Ayako] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan; [Yamada, Hiroyuki] Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan; [Shimamoto, Daichi] Waseda Univ, Waseda Inst Polit Econ, Tokyo, Japan",Osaka University; Keio University; Waseda University,"Wakano, A (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan.",qgp802wa@student.econ.osaka-u.ac.jp,"Yamada, Hiroyuki/Q-3464-2019",,"International Rice Research Institute (IRRI); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15J04594, 26220502] Funding Source: KAKEN","International Rice Research Institute (IRRI); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The research reported herein was supported by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI).

In the marketing, the consumer situation effect can be used to guide consumer consumption better. Through the analysis of the influence of consumer situation and situation on consumer behavior, this paper puts forward the strategies to improve the marketing effect of the enterprise. With the rapid development of social economy, the ability to buy society has been improved, but the similar products in the market to narrow the differences, commodity information transfer is not timely or asymmetrical market information intensive deepening problems, exacerbated by the homogeneity of products, making the market more competitive. Enterprises want to stand out in the fierce market competition, rely on traditional marketing methods, emphasize the marketing mix with 4P as the core, obviously, the advantages are not outstanding, and marketing has little effect. Enterprises must make marketing mix optimization based on the concept of modern marketing, highlight and emphasize the demands of product differentiation, and develop customized marketing strategies for enterprises. In personalized marketing, the consumption situation is an important factor. The situation refers to the internal and external stimuli that the consumer faces, and can respond to the physiological and psychological responses of the consumer. The situation is made up of some temporary events and states, which are neither part of the marketing stimulus itself nor a consumer feature. ([1]) the factors affecting consumer behavior include macro and micro environmental factors, as well as personal, social and marketing factors, and consumer situations are microcosmic factors. The consumption situation mainly emphasizes consumer's consumption process, such as specific scenes, time, weather, scene atmosphere, salesperson's service attitude, accompanying purchase partners and so on. Situation is only affected by specific scenes and time points, and scenes or time points change. For consumers, the original situation will no longer play a role. Consumption situation is generally composed of some temporary time and location and status, so the consumption situation is not the law, by chance in the consumer purchase activities, will disappear as consumers leave, nor by the consumer personal factors or product factors determined, consumption situation is relative in consumer spending in.","[Xu, Jian] Qujing Normal Univ, Kirin Sanjiang Ave, Qujing City 655011, Yunnan, Peoples R China",Qujing Normal University,"Xu, J (通讯作者)，Qujing Normal Univ, Kirin Sanjiang Ave, Qujing City 655011, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",14027400@qq.com,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,4,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-463-7,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,53.0,,,,,,603,606,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL5MW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452213200121,0

Elimination of the deduction would have led to a 35% reduction in individual charitable donations. Even if coupled with cuts in marginal tax rates, eliminating the charitable deduction will still likely result in substantial reductions given the inelastic income elasticities of charitable donations.

Umbrella organizations are nonprofit structures, developed to support the development of the nonprofit sector by providing information, resources, promoting good practices in various ways and contributing to knowledge and skill development in the member organizations. Therefore, intra-organizational and inter-organizational knowledge management is at the core of the activity of umbrella organizations and they could be a positive factor in shaping knowledge management strategies. Some authors recommend that knowledge management should be approached in a similar manner in NGOs compared to firms, due to the existence of the same set of subsystems to be considered people, technology, task, and structure.

After defining twin crises as events where bank crises and sovereign defaults combine, and further distinguishing between those bank crises that end up in sovereign defaults and vice versa, we study what differentiates single and twin events. Using an event analysis methodology, we document systematic differences between single and twin crises across various dimensions including the balance sheet interconnection between banks and the sovereign, banking sector characteristics, the state of public finances, the macroeconomic environment and financial openness. The importance of these characteristics in shaping the transmission of stress between banks and sovereigns is confirmed by two alternative discrete-variable multivariate approaches. We also show that twin crises themselves are heterogeneous events: taking into account the actual time sequence of crises that compose twin episodes is important for understanding their channels of transmission and economic consequences.

The graphical presentation reveals that the various tax rates under the TCJA complicate choice-of-entity analyses and undermine general rule-of-thumb concepts that drove choice-of-entity decisions prior to the TCJA. Under the TCJA, choice-of-entity preferences will likely be highly situational and may feature combinations of various entities. Using a typical business situation, this article illustrates how different types of entity can cause the effective tax rate on business income at the $1,000,000 level to vary from 21.36 to 34.60 percent. The most favorable effective rate results from an entity structure that combines a C corporation and passthrough entity. Rate variations based upon entity combinations portend subtle, carefully calculated, shifts in choice-of-entity actions following the TCJA.","[Borden, Bradley T.] Brooklyn Law Sch, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA",,"Borden, BT (通讯作者)，Brooklyn Law Sch, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA.",brad.borden@brooklaw.edu,,,,,,,10,4,4,1,12,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

Despite the distracting effect of macroeconomic news on investor attention, we find that earnings announcements with concurrent macroeconomic news announcements actually have significantly stronger immediate market response and weaker post-earnings announcement drift. We hypothesize that the combined total attention to macroeconomic news and earnings announcements helps investors understand both the systematic and firm-specific components of earnings surprises. Consistent with the hypothesis, our results show that the macroeconomic news effect is mainly driven by firms with high exposure to macroeconomic news. Moreover, we show that the effect is stronger when macroeconomic news contains more information and for firms with greater information uncertainty.

Results suggest a negative multiplier on impact, with the economy starting to recover from the second year on and expanding after 5 years. Revenue-based adjustments are more contractionary on impact than expenditure-based adjustments.

Using plot-level data from a specifically designed survey conducted in Pakistan, we investigate the productive benefits for farmers who adapt to climate change. The impact of implementing on-farm adaptation strategies is estimated separately for two staple crops: wheat and rice. We employ propensity score matching and endogenous switching regressions to account for the possibility that farmers self-select into adaptation. Estimated productivity gains are positive and significant for rice farmers who adapted, but negligible for wheat. Counterfactual gains for non-adapters were significantly positive, which is potentially a sign of transactions costs to adaptation. Other factors associated with adaptation were formal credit and extension, underscoring the importance of addressing institutional and informational constraints that inhibit farmers from improving their farming practices.

Drawing on a survey of 362 Danish SMEs, we address four partner proximity characteristics: geographic, cognitive, organizational, and social. The results show that SMEs prioritize geographic openness over regional clustering. Furthermore, to simultaneously facilitate collaboration and ensure innovation, firms tend to collaborate with partners that are characterized by cognitive similarity at a technological level and knowledge distance at a market level. Technological proximity is also found to be more relevant than social proximity when it comes to bridging the potential geographic and market distance between the collaborative partners. Finally, the results indicate that the tendency of organizational proximity to facilitate informal interactions with partners enhances process innovation only at two of four process innovation levels. Thus, the results highlight the fact that the value of partner proximity characteristics change with the level of process innovation considered.","[Jespersen, Kristina; Rigamonti, Damiana; Jensen, Morten Berg; Bysted, Rune] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus BSS, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Jespersen, K (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Aarhus BSS, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark.",kjespersen@econ.au.dk,,"Risom Jespersen, Kristina/0000-0002-8864-7495; Rigamonti, Damiana/0000-0002-6707-005X; Jensen, Morten Berg/0000-0002-9455-0104","rethink IMPACTS 2017; Aarhus 2017, city of Aarhus as European Capital of Culture in 2017; Aarhus University","rethink IMPACTS 2017; Aarhus 2017, city of Aarhus as European Capital of Culture in 2017; Aarhus University","This work was supported by rethink IMPACTS 2017, a joint project of Aarhus University and Aarhus 2017, i.e., the city of Aarhus as European Capital of Culture in 2017.

Second, no negative effect of low birth weight is found on educational attainment or primary job status. Third, health outcomes due to low birth weight at older ages are not negatively affected except for difficulty in mobility and higher risk of diagnosis with hypertension or diabetes. Overall, our findings suggest that the negative effect of lower birth weight seems to fade out over the life course.","[Matsushima, Midori] Osaka Univ Commerce, 4-1-10 Mikuriyasakae Machi, Higashiosaka, Osaka 5778505, Japan; [Shimizutani, Satoshi] Nakasone Yasuhiro Peace Inst, Minato Ku, Toranomon 30 Mori Bldg 6F,3-2-2 Toranomon, Tokyo 1050001, Japan; [Yamada, Hiroyuki] Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Minato Ku, 2-15-45 Mita, Tokyo 1088345, Japan",Keio University,"Yamada, H (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Minato Ku, 2-15-45 Mita, Tokyo 1088345, Japan.",midori@daishodai.ac.jp; sshimizutani@iips.org; hyamada@econ.keio.ac.jp,"Shimizutani, Satoshi/AAZ-9848-2021; Yamada, Hiroyuki/Q-3464-2019",,"JSPS [15K17082, 15H01951]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H01951, 15K17082] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) (Grant no. 15H01951), and JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) (Grant no. 15K17082).

We enriched the model by including a financial vehicle corporation, which buys loans and mortgages from banks and issues asset-backed securities (ABSs) and mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), and a mutual fund, which invests both in ABSs and MBSs using its liquidity resources and issues new shares when in liquidity shortage. Households own the equity of the mutual fund in the form of equity shares. By means of securitization, banks conduct regulatory capital arbitrage and reduce risk-weighted assets in their balance sheet, thus being able to lend more loans and mortgages. Results show that different levels of securitization propensity are able to affect credit and business cycles in different manners. On one side, securitization increases banks' lending activity, influencing positively investment and consumption. On the other side, the increased amount of credit amplifies negative shocks, due to higher loans' write-offs probability triggered by the boosted lending activity. Firms' bankruptcies impact the equity of banks, affecting their ability to grant new loans to consumption goods producers (CGPs), which need credit for their production activity, and mortgages to households, which need them to purchase housing units. The effect of securitization on the economy critically depends on the level of securitization propensity and on the time span considered.","[Mazzocchetti, Andrea; Raberto, Marco; Cincotti, Silvano] Univ Genoa, DIME, CINEF, Via Opera Pia 15, I-16145 Genoa, Italy; [Teglio, Andrea] Univ Ca Foscari Venice, Dept Econ, Cannaregio 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy; [Teglio, Andrea] Univ Jaume 1, Campus Riu Sec, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain",University of Genoa; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Universitat Jaume I,"Mazzocchetti, A (通讯作者)，Univ Genoa, DIME, CINEF, Via Opera Pia 15, I-16145 Genoa, Italy.",andrea.mazzocchet-ti@edu.unige.it; marco.r-aberto@unige.it; andrea.teglio@unive.it; silvano.cincotti@unige.it,"Teglio, Andrea/AAI-9500-2021; Cincotti, Silvano/A-4680-2016","Cincotti, Silvano/0000-0001-6778-0185; Mazzocchetti, Andrea/0000-0003-3862-9085; Raberto, Marco/0000-0002-0624-5709",EU-FP7 collaborative project SYMPHONY9 [611875],EU-FP7 collaborative project SYMPHONY9(European Union (EU)),The authors acknowledge EU-FP7 collaborative project SYMPHONY9 under the grant number 611875.,,81,10,10,1,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

This policy brief examines the implications. The UK is a large importer of emission permits. Thus, meeting its climate policy targets would be much more difficult without the EU ETS, costing an additional 0.2 to 0.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). In addition to the increased compliance costs, the UK will face transition costs for leaving the EU ETS because a central plank of UK climate policy (i.e., permit trade) will need to be replaced on short notice. Furthermore, there may be a loss of business as the carbon trade leaves London. Moreover, as UK greenhouse gas regulation diverges from the EU, distortions at the border will also increase. The impact of a UK departure from the EU ETS on the EU would be limited if the EU accepts a weaker emissions cap. Non-EU countries such as Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein participate in the EU ETS, and this would appear to be the best option for the UK if it leaves the EU.","[Tol, Richard S.

Finally, our out-of-sample analysis presents significant improvement for the performance of portfolio allocation after involving the effect of investor sentiment on the long-term stock-bond correlation.","[Fang, Libing; Yu, Honghai; Huang, Yingbo] Nanjing Univ, Sch Management & Engn, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University,"Yu, HH (通讯作者)，22 Hankou Rd, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",hhyu@nju.edu.cn,"fang, libing/W-6528-2019",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71472085, 71401071, 71672081, 71771117, 71720107001]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71472085, 71401071, 71672081, 71771117 and 71720107001).",,36,28,30,2,46,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

Our methodology addresses typical issues that arise when estimating network effects: reverse causality, common unobserved factors, and self-selection. In particular, we instrument the size of networks by predicting the number of migrants in each location using the location's accessibility by distinct methods of transportation and information about how migrants from each country initially arrived in Spain. Our findings show that immigrants from above-average remitting countries remit more if they live in larger networks. For a subset of countries that receive large remittance flows from Spain, we show that migrants in larger networks are less likely to use most expensive remittance channels, and that cost spreads between the most expensive and cheapest remittance service provider are lower for countries characterized by stronger networks. Our results suggest that network effects could boost policy efforts to lower remittance prices. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Our equilibrium model shows that contagion arises because investors pay fluctuating attention to news. As a negative shock hits one sector, investors pay more attention to it. This raises the volatility of equilibrium discount rates resulting in simultaneous spikes in cross-sector correlations and volatilities. We test the economic mechanism of the model on fundamentally unrelated U.S. industries, which are identified using their customer-supplier relationships.

We project healthcare consumption to 2060 using a modified Lee-Carter technique. In our modification, GDP per capita plays the role of time in explaining changes in the age-pattern of health consumption as countries become wealthier. We find that rising wealth mainly affects health consumption at older-ages. The main advantage of the model is its simplicity and its reduced reliance on expert judgment about future trends. Unlike many health projections, we find that population aging is an important driver of future health consumption. Our model predicts rapid increases in healthcare consumption during the rapid phase of population aging but more modest increases thereafter once the great transformation to aged societies is complete.

We use longitudinal data from a cohort of 700 Peruvian children drawn from a very rich dataset, the Young Lives Survey, to test the impact of children's perception of respect at the age of 8 on cognitive achievement 4 years later, controlling for cognitive skills at the age of 8, lagged child and household characteristics, and community fixed effects. This empirical specification is akin to estimating a conditional demand function for cognitive skills, which deals with some of the main pitfalls of skill endogeneity. We find that poorly respected children are linked to a lower rate of cognitive accumulation than their better-respected counterparts. As expected, we also find that previously accumulated cognitive skills enable higher subsequent cognitive skill accumulation. We go one step further by testing and finding evidence of complementarities across skills. We show that cognitive differences amplify over time between children with low and high psychosocial skills. Overall, our results suggest that psychosocial status, an aspect little studied in the context of developing countries, plays an important role in the acquisition of cognitive skills during childhood.","[Outes, Ingo] Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, Oxford, England; [Sanchez, Alan] Grp Anal Desarrollo, Lima, Peru; [Molina, Oswaldo] Univ Pacifico, Lima, Peru",University of Oxford; Universidad del Pacifico Peru,"Molina, O (通讯作者)，Univ Pacifico, Lima, Peru.;Molina, O (通讯作者)，Univ Pacifico, Ave Salaverry 2020, Jesus Maria 15072, Peru.",o.molinac@up.edu.pe,"Sánchez, Alan/JQX-2450-2023; Sánchez, Alan/AAM-1982-2021","Sánchez, Alan/0000-0001-7109-8613",Oxford Department of International Development (Young Lives Study),Oxford Department of International Development (Young Lives Study),This research was partially funded by an student grant from the Oxford Department of International Development (Young Lives Study),,23,3,3,1,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

However, only patchy information has been presented in the literature on the use of RMB in Chinese trade. Using the information obtained from two-round, large-scale questionnaire surveys, this paper presents new evidence on the use of RMB and exchange risk management by Japanese subsidiaries operating in China and other Asian countries. We find that Japanese subsidiaries in China mainly use the U.S. dollar, and to a lesser extent, the yen in trade with other countries. However, they increase the use of RMB in infra-firm trade with Japan. The result of Logit estimation indicates that RMB transactions will grow further if overseas subsidiaries have more discretion in exchange rate risk management.

This seems paradoxical as norms, culture and social capital appear to play a more important role in everyday life in Africa. We use a rich data set collected in Niakhar in rural Senegal, between 2001 and 2008 to study whether the school attendance of a child depends on the school attendance of other children in the same social group. Social groups are defined using geographical proximity and caste groups. While it is particularly difficult to empirically identify the impact of social group behavior, we take advantage of the temporal structure of the data to deal with a number of endogeneity issues. We rely moreover on different empirical strategies and placebo tests to argue that our results are not subject to confounding interpretations. Results show evidence of a strong and positive effect of social interactions on school attendance and the impact is greater for members of the highest caste. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We argue that the two types of aid may respond differently to security challenges because of donors' disparate objectives and aid-giving motives. The results show that armed conflict reduces the amounts of obtained aid of all types, conditional on a. country being an aid recipient. Multilateral donors are also less likely to include a conflict-ridden country on a recipient list. Domestic terrorism increases bilateral aid, but this effect appears to be entirely driven by assistance from the United States, arguably a terrorist prime-target country. When we disaggregate aid flows by their purposes, we find that international and domestic terrorism are associated with increases in bilateral aid for promotion of governance, education, health and society.

Using a large sample of administrative tax records and exploiting inter-provincial variation in tax withholding rates over time in the identification, the withdrawal elasticity to the net-of-tax withholding rate is estimated to be approximately 0.40 for many prime-aged savers. Hence, tax withholding discourages pre-retirement savings withdrawals and serves as a de facto savings commitment device. This finding is not well-explained by rational agency, and theories of present-biased time preferences and fiscal illusion are shown to be a better explanation of such behavior.","[Messacar, Derek] STAT Canada, Social Anal & Modelling Div, 100 Tunneys Pasture Driveway, Ottawa, ON K1A 0T6, Canada; [Messacar, Derek] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Econ, 230 Elizabeth Ave, St John, NF A1B 1T5, Canada",Statistics Canada; Memorial University Newfoundland,"Messacar, D (通讯作者)，STAT Canada, Social Anal & Modelling Div, 100 Tunneys Pasture Driveway, Ottawa, ON K1A 0T6, Canada.;Messacar, D (通讯作者)，Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Econ, 230 Elizabeth Ave, St John, NF A1B 1T5, Canada.",derek.messacar@canada.ca,,,,,,,32,3,3,0,3,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

Public investment enhances productivity growth in all sectors but when it is financed by foreign inflows, it also causes a real exchange rate appreciation leading to a contraction in the open modern sector. These results provide a partial explanation for recent patterns of growth in Rwanda and elsewhere in Africa where the non-tradables or what we call the in-between sector has expanded more rapidly than the tradable sector.

Using OLS and Fixed Effects models on an unbalanced panel data set for more than 400 Indonesian districts covering the period 2005-2013, we investigate whether the allocation of the grants are determined by the need of a district, by political alignment of the central government with the local district heads, or by reelection motives of the incumbent president. We find that grants are not determined by need characteristics and that political considerations matter significantly. Districts with low support for the president received significantly more than the core supporting districts, especially in the year of national elections. This effect is limited to the first term of the president. In the second term, after which reelection is impossible, political considerations were largely absent. This pattern is consistent with the view that the incumbent president considers discretionary grants as an instrument to increase reelection probabilities. Unlike the evidence for most countries, we find no effect for political party alignment with local district heads.

Theoretical predictions and empirical studies suggest that risk taking may increase or decrease after experiencing shocks. So far the empirical evidence is sparse, especially when it comes to developed countries. We contribute to this literature by investigating whether experiencing financial and health-related damage caused by storms affects risk preferences of individuals in Germany. Using unique panel data, we find that household heads were more risk-seeking after they experienced storm damage. We do not find evidence of exposure to storm per se (regardless of damage experience), which suggests that household heads have to suffer damage for their risk preferences to be affected. These results are robust across a battery of alternative model specifications and alternative storm damage measures (magnitude of financial damage). We rule out other potential explanations such as health-related and economic shocks. The self-reported storm damage data is broadly confirmed by regional storm damage data provided by the insurance industry. While we cannot identify the channels through which experiencing storm damage affects risk preferences from our data, we suggest and discuss some potential channels. The results may have important policy implications as risk preferences affect, for instance, individuals' savings and investment behaviour, adoption of self-protection and self-insurance strategies, and technology adoption.","[Kahsay, Goytom Abraha] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 23,E-109, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Osberghaus, Daniel] Ctr European Econ Res, L 7,1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany",University of Copenhagen; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Kahsay, GA (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 23,E-109, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",goytom@ifro.ku.dk; osberghaus@zew.de,,"Kahsay, Goytom Abraha/0000-0001-8433-8575",German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) [01LA1113C],German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"We thank Kibrom A.

We deploy a property-level house price model which shows that a ten per cent increase in credit available leads to an 1.5 per cent increase in the value of property purchased. Coefficients from this model are then used to fit values under scenarios of macroprudential restrictions on LTV, LTI and DSR on credit availability and house prices in Ireland during the 2003 to 2010 period. Our results suggest that macroprudential limits would have had substantial impacts on house prices, and that both the level at which they are set and the timing of their introduction is a crucial determinant of their impact on housing values.","[Kelly, Robert; McCann, Fergal] Cent Bank Ireland, Macro Financial Div, Dublin, Ireland; [O'Toole, Conor] Econ & Social Res Inst, Econ Anal Div, Dublin, Ireland; [O'Toole, Conor] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin, Ireland",European Central Bank; Central Bank of Ireland; Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin,"O'Toole, C (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Econ Anal Div, Dublin, Ireland.",robert.kelly@centralbank.ie; fergal.mccann@centralbank.ie; conor.otoole@esri.ie,,,,,,,43,26,29,4,28,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1051-1377,1096-0791,,J HOUS ECON,J.

The research and development sector is represented by an aggregate stock of energy-saving technology, which acts as a weak substitute with a polluting resource in the energy generation sector. Using this model, we analytically show how ITC occurs and affects the cost of a carbon tax. Applying quantitative estimates of the size of ITC to numerical simulations calibrated to the US economy, we find that existing empirical evidence can reduce the welfare cost of environmental tax reform by 12%. Our tests of alternative parameters show that this result is highly sensitive to the assumptions used, suggesting that ITC could result in much larger reductions in cost.","[Liu, Antung Anthony] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, 1315 E 10th St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Yamagami, Hiroaki] Seikei Univ, 3-3-1 Kichijoji Kitamachi, Musashino, Tokyo 1808633, Japan; [Yamagami, Hiroaki] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, 106-112 Bd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Seikei University,"Liu, AA (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, 1315 E 10th St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",aaliu@indiana.edu; yamagami@econ.seikei.ac.jp,"Yamagami, Hiroaki/AER-7802-2022","Yamagami, Hiroaki/0000-0003-0174-7811",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [15K17055]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K17055] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",Funding was provided from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) through a Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) (No. 15K17055).,,28,5,5,2,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

I overcome this issue by investigating school districts containing varying tax rates. Identification is derived from the use of school and spatial-temporal boundary fixed effects to eliminate unobserved variation associated with tax districts that can confound capitalization estimates. Results from the primary model provide evidence of a negative capitalization of tax rate levels that corresponds to full capitalization at discount rate of nearly 3.5 percent. Further, property fixed effects are uniquely incorporated within the boundary identification method to show that tax rate changes are capitalized similar to baseline tax rate differences.","[Livy, Mitchell R.] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Econ, 800 N State Coll Blvd, Fullerton, CA 92831 USA",California State University System; California State University Fullerton,"Livy, MR (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Econ, 800 N State Coll Blvd, Fullerton, CA 92831 USA.",mlivy@fullerton.edu,,,,,,,34,10,14,1,9,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1051-1377,1096-0791,,J HOUS ECON,J.

We show that, under certain conditions, the host country and foreign parent firm (FP) are both better off in equilibrium if FP chooses to form a joint venture (JV) with a domestic partner in the host country, with some form of technology transfer, rather than have FP's exclusive reliance on exporting to the host country. These results provide justification, for example, to China's and some other host countries' FDI policies in recent years. Our results also justify host countries with small open economies to resort to the introduction of new foreign competitors when they face their domestic markets suffering from monopolists' abuse of market power. Canada, for example, is known to use inward FDI with limited foreign ownership as government policy tools for dealing with abusive domestic monopolists. Our welfare implications may be useful for evaluating such FDI-driven competition and other public policy issues.

Rather than fitting the expectile models over ad-hoc fixed data windows, this study focuses on parameter instability of tail risk dynamics by utilizing a local parametric approach. Our framework yields a data-driven optimal interval length at each time point by a sequential test. Empirical evidence at three stock markets from 2005-2016 shows that the selected lengths account for approximately 4-6 months of daily observations. This method performs favourable compared to the models with one-year fixed intervals, as well as quantile based candidates while employing a time invariant portfolio protection (TIPP) strategy for the DAX, FTSE 100 and S&P 500 portfolios.

With visual similarity, copycats may mislead consumers to incorrectly link the copycats to familiar and leading brands. Copycat practices are serious challenges for the leading brands, consumers, and even imitators. In this study, the cognitive differences between a leading brand and a copycat brand were investigated subconsciously by using event-related potentials. Using a questionnaire on the leading brand and the copycat brand, consumers' attitudes to perceived value of the brand, brand attitude, and purchase intentions were also studied. Electroencephalogram and survey results showed significant differences between the two brands. Consumers' perceived value, brand attitude, and purchase intention of the leading brand were higher than the copycat brand. The copycat brand elicited a higher P160 and N240 at the front-central area and a higher P240 and lower P400 at the central-parietal area. We supposed that the amplitude variation in event-related potentials expressed different neural activity with regard to the target identification, cognitive control, automatic attention, and categorization mechanism between the original and the counterfeit. This study contributes to understanding the consumers' different neural activity with regard to the original and the counterfeit and provides a feasible neuroscience-based method to perfect present theories and methodologies on issues concerning imitation. Exploration of the differences between the leading and copycat brands can help companies promote their brand and develop more reasonable marketing strategies.","[Zhang, Xuefeng; Guo, Fu; Li, Sen; Li, Mingming; Chen, Han] Northeastern Univ, Sch Business Adm, 11,Lane 3,Wenhua Rd, Shenyang 110819, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xuefeng] Liaoning Tech Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Fuxin, Peoples R China",Northeastern University - China; Liaoning Technical University,"Zhang, XF (通讯作者)，Northeastern Univ, Sch Business Adm, 11,Lane 3,Wenhua Rd, Shenyang 110819, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",zhangxuefengnue@gmail.com,,"Li, Mingming/0000-0002-4702-6350",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71471033],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant 71471033).

It uses exogenous variation in crop-to-beef relative prices to investigate the effects of pasture-to-cropland conversion on deforestation. The findings indicate that increases in crop-to-beef relative prices increase the rate of pasture-to-cropland conversion and reduce the rate of deforestation. The magnitude of the effects implies that land conversion reduced deforestation at the local level by 5,300 square kilometers from 2002 to 2012. This reduction is the equivalent of almost 15 per cent of the total deforestation observed in the region during this period. These results are consistent with a land use model in which cattle ranching and crop cultivation have different input-intensities and there is imperfect mobility of productive factors between municipalities. This model highlights the fact that changes in relative prices affect deforestation through its effect on input prices.","[Braganca, Arthur] Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio de Janeiro PUC Rio, Dept Econ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Braganca, Arthur] Climate Policy Initiat, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",,"Bragança, A (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio de Janeiro PUC Rio, Dept Econ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.;Bragança, A (通讯作者)，Climate Policy Initiat, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",arthurbraganca@puc-rio.br,"Bragança, Arthur/U-9964-2019","Amorim Braganca, Arthur/0000-0002-5741-0348",Children's Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF),Children's Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF),"I would like to thank Juliano Assuncao, Laisa Rachter, Priscila Souza, Dimitri Szerman for their comments and helpful discussions.

Consequently, in integrated global markets, country-specific expected return is priced with a world price of covariance risk. This study relates domestic excess stock returns to the world downside risk. Evidence shows that downside tail risk (as a multiplier of volatility) has long memory cointegration properties; hence, the underlying risk aversion behavior in an integrated market is associated with the conditional quantile ratio, the correlation of stock returns, and the cointegrating coefficient of downside risk.

Whereas expectations that such adaptation strategies would positively interact with local priorities to support action, adaptive actions at one scale might also constrain actions at other scales depending on the context. Yet, limited empirical evidence exists on the tensions, or, in the best case, synergies between adaptation practices that cross spatial scales, policy arenas, and jurisdictional boundaries. Drawing on a longitudinal study conducted in agropastoral communities in Burkina Faso, I examined how higher scale agricultural adaptation actions initiated by government and international organizations were re-defined when implemented locally. The findings illuminate a discrepancy between the aims of (a) higher scale adaptation practices and (b) the strategies pursued by local agropastoralists. While higher scale initiatives, promoted since the great droughts hit the region in the 1970s and 1980s, remained technical in nature and aimed to boost agricultural food production, local strategies were primarily pursued to secure off-farm income and animal fodder. Efforts to advance adaptation across scales will necessitate better attention to local contexts such as off-farm activities as integrated and viable ways of agropastoralists' agricultural' adaptation repertoire, and institutions, organizations, and local networks should move forward with collaborative processes, including local stakeholders from the outset, to develop broader adaptation plans than technological-only.

Basing our tests on the sensitivity of company returns to opinion polls preceding the 2010 General Election we find that, on average, firms in industries which donate only to the Conservative Party exhibit higher sensitivity to the electoral success of the Conservatives. However, within industries, there is no consistent evidence that the firms which employ directors who make these donations exhibit higher sensitivity than firms which do not.

These flows are beneficial, allowing banks to cope with liquidity risk. First, we analyze the efficiency of three network structures: star-shaped, complete, and incomplete in transferring liquidity among banks. The star-shaped interbank network achieves the complete coverage of liquidity risk with the smallest amount of interbank deposits held by each bank. This result implies that the star-shaped network is most resilient to systemic risk. Second, we analyze the banks' decentralized interbank deposit decisions for a given network structure. We show that all network structures can generate an inefficiently low amount of interbank deposits. However, the star-shaped network induces banks to hold an amount of interbank deposits that is the closest to the efficient level. These results provide a rationale for consistent empirical evidence on sparse and centralized interbank networks.","[Castiglionesi, Fabio] Tilburg Univ, EBC, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Eboli, Mario] Univ Pescara, Pescara, Italy",Tilburg University; G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara,"Castiglionesi, F (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, EBC, Tilburg, Netherlands.",,,"Castiglionesi, Fabio/0000-0003-2963-7147",,,,,31,22,23,4,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

These relations are stronger or only present in acquisitions where the merging firms do not operate in the same industries or product markets. Reductions in employment and wages following mergers with high human capital relatedness suggest that the merged firm has greater ability to layoff low quality and/or duplicate employees and reduce labor costs.

Results indicate that political connections had little impact on cumulative abnormal returns in the estimation period. However, some sectors reacted in a robust and statistically significant manner. In particular, gas and oil firms' stock prices showed a notably higher and positive abnormal return. While the effect of the electoral outcomes on specific sectors indicates that the Israeli stock market does evaluate political outcomes through asset prices, the market's lack of responsiveness to political connections after the 2015 elections could indicate that political connections do not carry financial value in the Israeli stock market.

Inequities in the burden of commuting have attracted increasing attention from researchers. Although many studies have described the facts of transport inequality, there has been little in-depth research on institutional factors that influence commuting inequality. This paper aims to contribute fresh evidence on this topic by examining Beijing as a case study through a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches. The results of this analysis show that increasing inequality in the commuting burden largely results from existing institutional discrimination against migrants, especially highly-skilled migrants. Beijing's Danwei, Hukou and BGC systems, as well as the city's housing distribution system, create serious institutional barriers to maintaining Beijing's jobs housing balance, causing extra commuting burdens for highly-skilled migrants. Surprisingly, low-skilled migrants are restricted less by institutional barriers and maintain a good job-housing relationship due to sufficient provisions of informal houses and jobs in a broad range of urban areas. Our study reveals a back to Danwei house movement through which local households negotiate the growing commuting burden with the pursuit of quality of life. Based on these findings, we argue that increasing social inequality in the commuting burden may continue to worsen unless institutional discrimination against disadvantaged groups is removed in the process of China's economic transition.","[Zhang, Mengzhu; Zhao, Pengjun] Peking Univ, Ctr Urban & Transport Studies, Sch Urban & Environm Sci, Yiheyuan Rd 5,Yifu 2 Bldg,Off 3267, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Mengzhu; He, Shenjing] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Urban Planning & Design, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Peking University; University of Hong Kong,"Zhao, PJ (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Ctr Urban & Transport Studies, Sch Urban & Environm Sci, Yiheyuan Rd 5,Yifu 2 Bldg,Off 3267, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",mengzhu.zhang@pku.edu.cn; sjhe@hku.hk; pengjun.zhao@pku.edu.cn,"He, shenjing/AHC-5435-2022; Zhao, Peng/HDO-7507-2022","He, shenjing/0000-0001-5692-2088; Zhang, Mengzhu/0000-0002-8254-6802",National Natural Sciences Foundation of China [41571147],National Natural Sciences Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research was funded by the National Natural Sciences Foundation of China (Ref: 41571147).

Using bank-level data, we unveil the interaction of RR with bank lending. We identify a new channel that works through a decline in banks' liquid assets and loan supply due to an increase in RR. Quantitative tightening through RR raises the short-term funding needs of the banking system, which is met by collateralized central bank lending, thus depleting banks' unencumbered liquid assets. Our results suggest that such a shift in bank liquidity is associated with a significant change in lending.","[Alper, Koray] European Investment Bank, Econ Dept, Kirchberg, Luxembourg; [Binici, Mahir; Kara, Hakan] Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Istanbul, Turkey; [Demiralp, Selva] Koc Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey; [Ozlu, Pinar] Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, Istanbul, Turkey",Koc University,"Alper, K (通讯作者)，European Investment Bank, Econ Dept, Kirchberg, Luxembourg.",k.alper@eib.org; Mbinici2@imf.org; sdemiralp@ku.edu.tr; hakan.kara@tcmb.gov.tr; Pinar.ozbay@tcmb.gov.tr,"Demiralp, Selva/L-6650-2016","Demiralp, Selva/0000-0003-4087-168X; Binici, Mahir/0000-0001-8655-3113",,,,,17,9,10,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Half of London's boroughs, as well as neighborhoods in several other cities, were impacted through the more than 200 individual riot events that caused 200 pound ($300) million in property damage. Despite widespread media coverage at the time, we know little about what citizens experienced during the riots. This paper bridges that gap using daily response panel data (from the Mappiness smartphone application) to estimate the beyond-monetary costs of the riots. Based on the difference-in-differences estimation, the disturbances substantially increased unhappiness and stress in areas they affected. This negative effect was even more pronounced in areas with the biggest proportion of Black residents, and it also reached a national scale, as even neighborhoods without riots experienced a pronounced wellbeing loss. The negative effects persisted beyond the end of the disturbances, at least until the end of the summer. Citizens changed their behavior in response to the events, respondents in neighborhoods with riots started seeking information and communicating more, which manifested in higher levels of TV watching, texting, email, and social media use. The English riots form part of a larger trend in current social tensions-with a marked wellbeing loss for the majority of Brits.","[Bencsik, Panka] Univ Sussex, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Bencsik, P (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England.",p.bencsik@sussex.ac.uk,"PAN, ZEQIANG/X-6341-2018",,,,,,31,4,4,0,5,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1051-1377,1096-0791,,J HOUS ECON,J.

One way that local elites capture community-driven development is to limit information about opportunities for citizens to shape group decisions. We investigate whether sending citizens targeted and timely information about when and how they can participate in the planning of community-driven development projects increases knowledge, participation, and satisfaction with local institutions. We implemented a pre-registered randomized field experiment in partnership with the Uganda Wildlife Authority that involved sending residents in randomly selected villages near Bwindi National Park approximately 60 messages by mobile phone over eight months about how a park-sponsored revenue sharing program worked and how and when residents could participate. We do not find evidence that the information increased perceived knowledge, participation, perceived efficacy, or satisfaction with local institutions. Exploratory findings suggest that among women, who are often disenfranchised in Ugandan society, the information treatment backfired related to perceived opportunities to participate. More positively, we find that reaching more people in a community with information led to promising results related to participation and satisfaction with the park. We conclude that informational treatments are unlikely to empower participation on average, unless they are deployed broadly and in ways that promote collective action. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Conceptually, the paper employs social cognitive theory to explore the interplay between social learning, relational agency, and culture. This interplay builds the foundation for the development of an empowerment model of capacity building that proposes an interlinked system of community capacity and empowerment dimensions. The model is explored in the context of the Education for All project in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco. The research combines participant observation, qualitative interviews and visual methods to provide rich insights to situated knowledges of learning and empowerment. Findings reveal that the meaning of education equates to the capacity to aspire to a different life. This problematizes the way gender and gender relations are understood in the rural Berber villages. The girls' education unsettles the repeating cycle of female educational deprivation, and leads them to become role models within their communities. This instills the image of educated women in community consciousness, leading to an incipient change in perceptions of what girls and women can be and do. (C) 2018 The Authors.

We find that tax benefits to homeowners reduce the user cost of housing capital by almost 40 per cent compared with the efficient level under neutral taxation. On average, the tax subsidy translates into an excess consumption of housing services equivalent to 7.8 per cent of the value of owner-occupied housing, or about 30 per cent of financial asset holdings in household portfolios. The bulk of the subsidy stems from undertaxation of the return to home equity, while the average contribution of the tax rebate for mortgage interest payments is driven down by relatively low loan-to-value ratios in the data. However, at the margin, the tax-induced incentive to use mortgage debt to finance the purchase of the main residence is sizeable.","[Fatica, Serena] European Commiss, Growth& Innovat Directorate, JRC, Finance& Econ Unit, Seville, Spain; [Prammer, Doris] Oesterreich Nationalbank, Vienna, Austria",Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB),"Fatica, S (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Growth& Innovat Directorate, JRC, Finance& Econ Unit, Seville, Spain.",serena.fatica@ec.europa.eu; doris.prammer@oenb.at,,"fatica, serena/0000-0002-9990-4354",,,,,44,6,6,1,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

We show that when additional funds released to the debtor (Greece), via debt restructuring, are used efficiently in pursuit of a practicable business plan, then both debtor and creditor can benefit. We examine a dynamic two country model calibrated to Greek and German economies and support two-steady states, one with endogenous default and one without, depending on creditors' expectations. In the default steady state, debt forgiveness lowers the volatility of both German and Greek consumption whereas demanding higher recovery rates has the opposite effect. In a second order approximation of the model, conditional welfare analysis shows that a policy of immediate leniency followed by harsher terms as the economy grows is beneficial to both creditors and debtors.

We find that the number of blocks that a firm's large institutions hold is positively associated with forced chief executive officer (CEO) turnover-performance sensitivity, abnormal returns around forced CEO turnover announcements and 13D filings, and changes in firm value. These results are particularly evident when institutions have multiple blockholdings in the same industry, when they have activism experience, or when they have long-term blockholdings in their portfolio firms. Our results suggest that information advantages and governance experience obtained from multiple blockholdings are important channels through which institutions perform effective monitoring.

We present a causal framework that can be used to identify leaks and blockages in the information production and dissemination process in such programs. We conceptualize the information pipeline as a series of connected nodes, each of which constitutes a possible point of blockage. We apply the framework to a field-experimental evaluation of a program that provided households in Bangalore, India, with advance notification of intermittently provided piped water. Our study detected no impacts on household wait times for water or on how citizens viewed the state, but found that notifications reduced stress. Our framework reveals that, in our case, noncompliance among human intermediaries and asymmetric gender relations contributed in large part to these null-to-modest results. Diagnostic frameworks like this should be used more extensively in development research to better understand the mechanisms responsible for program success and failure, to identify subgroups that actually received the intended treatment, and to identify potential leaks and blockages when replicating existing programs in new settings.

After documenting integration arising from the increasing dispersion of black households across neighborhoods that were entirely, or disproportionately, non black, we identify a stark exception: non-blacks do not move to neighborhoods that are over-90% black. The surprise is that, while the mean proportions of metropolitan black populations residing in such highly segregated neighborhoods decreased, the numbers of such neighborhoods actually increased in most metropolitan areas. The expansions of black neighborhoods, even as segregation decreases, pose challenges for local development and for continued racial integration.","[Madden, Janice Fanning] Univ Penn, 3718 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Ruther, Matt] Univ Louisville, Louisville, KY 40292 USA",University of Pennsylvania; University of Louisville,"Madden, JF (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, 3718 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",madden@upenn.edu,,,,,,,34,7,7,0,10,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1051-1377,1096-0791,,J HOUS ECON,J.

By using administrative data from Japan, we show that a levy-grant scheme increases the employment of disabled workers in Japan's manufacturing industry. In addition, we find that small-sized firms hire disabled workers when increasing firm size, although they are not obligated to pay levies. Finally, we use the number of disabled workers assigned by the quota system as an instrumental variable (IV) to evaluate the impact of disability employment on a firm's profit rate. The results of the fuzzy regression discontinuity design (RDD) suggest that an increase in the number of disabled workers does not necessarily decrease a firm's profit rate, which is in contrast to the results of the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression that suggest a negative relationship between the profit rate and disability employment.

However, when concretized in regular planning thinking and practice, the latter ideal becomes contested and complex. This paper explores sustainable accessibility and how urban planners understand, seek to operationalize, and integrate the concept in their planning practices; we consider what planners hope to achieve in this process and the tensions they experience in doing so. The data, collected through semi-structured, focus-group interviews (workshops) with 35 planners in three Swedish municipalities, were subjected to thematic qualitative analysis. Urban planners' interpretations of sustainable accessibility form five recurrent themes: the importance of cross-sectoral approaches in planning; the need for urban land-use densification; measures to shift the transport mode balance in favour of walking, cycling, and public transit; facilitating proximity to everyday activities; and planning in accordance with citizens' rights to access basic services. Although there is overall agreement on these themes, discussing how the related policies should be implemented reveals several tensions, for example: city centre densification could reinforce gentrification, resulting in displacement and increased travel; tension regarding to what extent and where car use should be reduced; trade-offs between the needs of different groups; and accounting for quality and functionality factors when stressing the importance of proximity to services. In conclusion, disagreements arising when implementing sustainable accessibility goals relate in many ways to social considerations and to the socio-spatial distribution of resources.","[Sola, Ana Gil; Vilhelmson, Bertil; Larsson, Anders] Univ Gothenburg, Sch Business Econ & Law, Dept Econ & Soc, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Solá, AG (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Sch Business Econ & Law, Dept Econ & Soc, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",ana.gilsola@geography.gu.se,"Larsson, Anders/P-7275-2015; Gil Sola, Ana/GSN-6074-2022; Vilhelmson, Bertil/HMD-8759-2023","Vilhelmson, Bertil/0000-0002-4548-4059",Swedish Research Council Formas [259-2013-103]; Sustainable Transport Initiative of University of Gothenburg; Chalmers University of Technology,Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas); Sustainable Transport Initiative of University of Gothenburg; Chalmers University of Technology,This research was funded by the Swedish Research Council Formas (project number 259-2013-103) and the Sustainable Transport Initiative of University of Gothenburg and Chalmers University of Technology.,,45,32,34,5,41,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

A relational approach allows for the analysis of how actors are connected, transact, and assign meaning and value to regional development. Much of the literature on port-city interfaces has primarily focussed on late 20th century transformation processes at the urban waterfront. This fails to appreciate the often-continued presence of port activity within cities and falls short in understanding how the development agendas of port cities are relationally constituted. In this paper, first we argue that the port-city interface is a relational geometry through which heterogeneous flows of actors, assets, and structures are coupled. Second, we present an analytical framework capable of operationalizing such relational approach. The contemporary relational geometries in the bio-based sectors within the port cities of Amsterdam and Ghent are taken as starting points. Analysing these reveal how different coupling mechanisms result in particular development trajectories of the port city, setting the scene for future coupling mechanisms. This paper concludes with a discussion on the value of a relational approach to the study of port-city interfaces.","[Van den Berghe, Karel; Boelens, Luuk] Univ Ghent, Ctr Mobil & Spatial Planning, POB 9000,Sint Pietersnieuwstr 41B2, Ghent, Belgium; [Jacobs, Wouter] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Ctr Urban Port & Transport Econ, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Ghent University; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Van den Berghe, K (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Ctr Mobil & Spatial Planning, POB 9000,Sint Pietersnieuwstr 41B2, Ghent, Belgium.",Karel.VandenBerghe@UGent.be,"Van den Berghe, Karel/Y-2332-2019; Van den Berghe, Karel/ABA-6451-2020","Van den Berghe, Karel/0000-0001-8395-0586;",Special Research Fund (BOF) of the Ghent University; Flanders Research Foundation (FWO) [V4.331.16N],Special Research Fund (BOF) of the Ghent University(Ghent University); Flanders Research Foundation (FWO)(FWO),"We wish to thank the interviewees in Ghent and Amsterdam and the participants to the Regional Sciences Association (RSA) meeting, Dublin (4-7 June 2017) for their valuable comments on a first version of this paper.

While individual and organisational causes for this minor presence have been deeply explored, there is a lack of empirical studies on the effectiveness of female expatriates. Moreover, these studies have focused on a particular facet of effectiveness, and findings are usually based on the perceptions of women of their own work. Additionally, only a few of them include male expatriates, which undermine the possibility of making comparisons. This paper explores gender contingencies on expatriate effectiveness using different groups of measures: adjustment, premature return, performance, commitment and job satisfaction. The author carried out four logit models and, overall, and she did not found significant differences on effectiveness between female expatriates and men ones. Moreover, not-significant differences favour women. Theoretical and practical implications are contemplated. (C) 2018 AEDEM.

Longer statehood experience gives countries more time to adapt their laws to local needs, provided the legal system is adaptable. We find that, relative to British common law countries with the most flexible laws, German and Scandinavian civil law countries initially exhibit lower financial development. However, as their history of statehood grows longer, financial development improves in countries with adaptable laws such as the German and Scandinavian civil law countries. This is not the case in French civil law countries with more rigid legal systems. Our results mainly show no or at most a weakly negative effect of French civil law legal origin on financial development.

I argue that the states may react similarly and radically when their authority is challenged in the periphery. The Ottoman Empire and the Kingdom of Italy developed the same forms of state intervention to fight against the bandits, even though these two states had fundamentally different political, cultural, and socio-legal structures. I present three different forms of state intervention: (i) victim-centred state intervention; (ii) security-centred state intervention; and (iii) authority-centred state intervention. These three forms consolidated the state's authority while making the two states both fragile and dependent on other social agencies in the long term. I further claim that consolidation of the state's authority manifests the paradox of state intervention and creates more vulnerabilities in traumatic geographies.","[Cayli, Baris] Univ Derby, Coll Law Humanities & Social Sci, Derby DE1 1DZ, England",University of Derby,"Cayli, B (通讯作者)，Univ Derby, Coll Law Humanities & Social Sci, Derby DE1 1DZ, England.",b.cayli@derby.ac.uk,"Messina, Baris Cayli/AAV-7649-2021","Cayli Messina, Baris/0000-0002-8677-4626",,,,,72,1,2,1,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Using a cross-country sample of major multinational firms, we find that firm-level CSR mitigates corruption risk. On closer examination, we find that the relationship between CSR and corruption risk is mediated by country-level variables such as institutional quality, protection of minority shareholders' rights, stock market development and freedom of the press. Further, we find that in emerging countries, CSR mitigates corruption risk only when the country-level institutional quality is high and citizens enjoy press freedom. Our findings suggest that both formal institutions and the quality of civil society influence the effect of CSR on corruption risk.

We study firm-level decisions in France, Germany, Japan, the UK, and the US. We find significant differences between the response of US and non-US firms. US firms significantly decreased their production costs relative to firms in other countries. They have also reduced debt, reduced dividend payout, and increased their cash holdings compared to firms in other countries. The differences are, in general, explained by differences in financial leverage. However, financial leverage does not explain differences between production decisions in German and U.S. firms and between Japanese and US firms. We argue that differences in firm governance between US firms and firms in Germany and Japan drive these responses.

Large organizations may discriminate less frequently because of more resources in recruitment and training, more human resources development, and greater experience with diversity.

To estimate connectedness in short-, medium-, and long-term financial cycles, we introduce a framework based on the spectral representation of variance decompositions. In an empirical application, we document the rich time-frequency dynamics of volatility connectedness in U.S. financial institutions. Economically, periods in which connectedness is created at high frequencies are periods when stock markets seem to process information rapidly and calmly, and a shock to one asset in the system will have an impact mainly in the short term. When the connectedness is created at lower frequencies, it suggests that shocks are persistent and are being transmitted for longer periods.","[Barunik, Jozef] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Opletalova 26, Prague 11000, Czech Republic; [Krehlik, Tomas] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Prague, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Baruník, J (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Opletalova 26, Prague 11000, Czech Republic.",barunik@fsv.cuni.cz,"Barunik, Jozef/G-7617-2014; Krehlik, Tomas/G-7481-2014",,Czech Science Foundation [GA16-14179S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"For estimating the frequency-dependent connectedness measures introduced by this paper, we provide the package frequencyConnectedness in R software.

At the same time, it is a sector sensitive to internal and external impacts that result in fluctuations in the economic cycle, copying its development or even outstripping the development of economic cycles. The main objective of this contribution was to identify the relationship between manufacturing and GDP, which represents the economic cycle in European Union countries. The time series of selected indicators of the manufacturing industry and GDP from the Eurostat database for Q1 2000-Q4 2016 were used for analysis purposes. An analysis of 296 time series with a quarterly periodicity from 22 EU countries (including the United Kingdom) was performed. The results of analyses indicate that the processing industry is a sector with significant cyclical behavior. In most countries, production and sales in the manufacturing industry behaved as concurrent indicators, changes in production and sales almost immediately reflected in the growth or decline in GDP. Labor market indicators have been shown to be delayed cyclical indicators. Changes in the economic development of the countries have a strong impact on employment, the remuneration of employees and the number of hours worked in the sector. Strong cyclical industries must be constantly monitored, as negative changes in these sectors will automatically exacerbate the economic cycle recession. The results of our analyses represent a valuable platform for economic policy makers and regional strategic plans.","[Behun, Marcel] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Min Ecol Proc Control & Geotechnol, Letna 9, Kosice 04001, Slovakia; [Gavurova, Beata] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Banking & Investment, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia; [Tkacova, Andrea] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia; [Kotaskova, Anna] Paneuropean Univ Bratislava, Fac Econ & Business, Tematinska 10, Bratislava 84000, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice; Technical University Kosice; Technical University Kosice; Pan-European University,"Gavurova, B (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Banking & Investment, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",marcel.behun@tuke.sk; beata.gavurova@tuke.sk; andrea.tkacova@tuke.sk; anna.kotaskova@gmail.com,"Behun, Marcel/AAZ-6591-2020; Gavurová, Beáta/N-9159-2018; Kotaskova, Anna/AAD-8105-2019; Tkáčová, Andrea/ABC-9384-2021","Behun, Marcel/0000-0001-8130-9664; Gavurová, Beáta/0000-0002-0606-879X; Kotaskova, Anna/0000-0002-6282-9899; Tkáčová, Andrea/0000-0002-6025-1261",,,,,43,43,48,0,16,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

We use an extended version of the classic Harberger model to predict and quantify consequences of the Affordable Care Act for the incidence of health insurance coverage and patterns of labor usage. If and when the new exchange plans are competitive with employer-sponsored insurance (ESI), our model predicts that more than 22 million people will leave ESI as a consequence of the law. Behavioral changes are expected to add two million participants to the new exchange plans: beyond those that would participate solely as the result of employer decisions to stop offering coverage and beyond those who would have been uninsured. We find large differences in coverage pattern impacts based on the benefit (including tax incentives) of joining exchange plans and degree to which statutory penalties on individuals and firms are implemented: If exchange plans were not valued while the individual mandate were fully enforced, ESI could potentially even expand.","[Gallen, Trevor S.] Purdue Univ, Dept Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Mulligan, Casey B.] Univ Chicago, Kenneth C Griffin Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; University of Chicago,"Gallen, TS (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",tgallen@purdue.edu; c-mulligan@uchicago.edu,,,University of Chicago's Stigler Center for Study of the Economy and the State; Thomas W.

Furthermore, for both episodes, the overaccumulation of debt relative to capital during the boom is critical for the busts since it implies a fall in credit worthiness.

This research describes a tool of discretionary administrationadministrative burdenthat is increasingly used in enforcing immigration law and policies at state and sub-state levels and presents a theoretical frame for more fully investigating and addressing its consequences. The application and implications of administrative burden are explored empirically and qualitatively in a case study analysis of an enforcement-oriented policy change in Texas that denied access to birth certificates for some citizen-children born to Mexican immigrants. To better understand the potential consequences of this and related policies, interviews with immigrant parents and longitudinal data from a survey of children of immigrants are analyzed to assess both short-term and later outcomes of children who are denied economic assistance and other benefits under policies that impose barriers to their integration into society. The study findings point to serious, adverse consequences for citizen children of state and sub-state immigration policies that create administrative burden and perpetuate racial discrimination, while simultaneously diminishing the transparency, fairness, and effectiveness of public administration.","[Heinrich, Carolyn J.] Vanderbilt Univ, Peabody Coll Educ & Human Dev, Dept Leadership Policy & Org, Publ Policy Educ & Econ, 202 Payne Hall,PMB 414,230 Appleton Pl, Nashville, TN 37203 USA",Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University Peabody College,"Heinrich, CJ (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Univ, Peabody Coll Educ & Human Dev, Dept Leadership Policy & Org, Publ Policy Educ & Econ, 202 Payne Hall,PMB 414,230 Appleton Pl, Nashville, TN 37203 USA.",carolyn.j.heinrich@vanderbilt.edu,,,University of Texas at Austin; Vanderbilt University,University of Texas at Austin; Vanderbilt University,"I thank the University of Texas at Austin and Vanderbilt University for financial support of this research and Olivia Murray and Andrew Reducha for research assistance.

International comparison requires determining a complex of factors that affect the success of developed economies; factors that, given their multiplier effects, influence the social productivity of labor in a country and create a competitive advantage in an international comparison. A key factor of the states' increasing competitiveness is assumed to be the innovation performance of enterprises, which is projected through innovative business processes into the innovation performance of the economy as a whole. This paper determines the impact of their innovation performance on their international competitiveness position observed by the Global Economic Forum based on the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI). To assess the impact, the following economic-statistical methods were used: comparative and correlation analyses and logical deduction. Data from the World Economic Forum (WEF), European Innovation Scoreboard (EIS), and Eurostat database were used to process the assessment. The results of the research have led to the conclusion that the Visegrad 4 (V4) countries as transition economies in terms of their economic development are quite similar, but in the ranking of global competitiveness, their position varies depending on the innovative performance. The Czech economy is the best performing of the four, while the worst indicators are attributed to the economies of Slovakia and Hungary. The economy of Poland has a relatively balanced development. The results of these analyses have led to the creation of a discussion platform focused on the evaluation of the innovation potential status and its determinants in Slovakia, with the aim of pointing out critical areas in the country's competitiveness growth on an international scale.","[Ivanova, Eva] Alexander Dubcek Univ Trencin, Fac Social & Econ Relat, Studentska 3, Trencin 91150, Slovakia; [Cepel, Martin] Paneuropean Univ Bratislava, Fac Econ & Business, Tematinska 10, Bratislava 85105, Slovakia",Alexander Dubcek University Trencin; Pan-European University,"Ivanová, E (通讯作者)，Alexander Dubcek Univ Trencin, Fac Social & Econ Relat, Studentska 3, Trencin 91150, Slovakia.",eva.ivanova@tnuni.sk; cepel@benzinol.sk,"Cepel, Martin/AAY-6375-2020",,VEGA [1/0233/16],VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),The paper was written under the VEGA project No. 1/0233/16 Dimensions and factors of social and economic development of regions in Visegrad Four countries.,,43,64,65,4,51,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

Benefit transfer functions are frequently specified based on statistical considerations alone. However, such a purely statistical approach can lead to willingness-to-pay functions that fail to satisfy some aspects of theoretical consistency that may be especially important for policy evaluations. In this paper, we examine several previous meta-analyses of nonmarket valuation studies in light of the adding-up condition, which is one important aspect of theoretical validity. We then use meta-regression to estimate a new willingness-to-pay function for surface water quality improvements intended to be used for benefit transfers. We estimate the meta-regression model using summary results from 51 previously published stated preference studies. An important feature of our approach is that we develop the meta-regression estimating equation to ensure that the resulting benefit transfer function will necessarily comply with the adding-up condition. This is achieved by first specifying a marginal willingness-to-pay function and then deriving an expression for total willingness-to-pay. This leads to a non-linear estimating equation, so we estimate the parameters of the model using non-linear least squares. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of our approach relative to other structural approaches, and we compare our empirical results to a more traditional nonstructural meta-regression model. Finally, we examine the quantitative importance of imposing the adding-up condition in our case study by performing some illustrative calculations of willingness-to-pay for hypothetical water quality improvements using both structural and non-structural models.","[Newbold, Stephen C.; Massey, D.

We can trace them back to Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and Alexander Hamilton. More recently, in response to a literature that questions the desirability of current immigration restrictions, Borjas (J Econ Lit 53:961-974, 2015) speculates that immigrants coming from countries with poor institutions could reduce substantially the institutional quality in the United States to a point where it could negate all economic gains associated with immigration in terms of GDP and income. Using the Economic Freedom of North America index since 1980, we find no evidence to corroborate Borjas's concerns.

We find that with very high (low) discounting, there is a unique low (high) growth equilibrium, regardless of the size of government. For the intermediate range of discounting, there are multiple equilibria and the growth outcome depends on the size of government. With endogenous time discounting, the growth outcome is path dependent and depends on the level of inherited human capital. However, there is only one stable growth regime and the economy endogenously switches to it. When the institutional constraints on rent-seeking are not extremely high, the stable regime is the one in which there is a high-growth equilibrium for a smaller size of the government and for larger size, both the high-growth and the low-growth equilibrium coexist. When the institutional constraints on rent-seeking are extremely high, there exists only a unique high-growth equilibrium irrespective of the size of government. Furthermore, economies with bigger size of the government and/or with poor quality institutions will take longer to endogenously switch to this stable growth regime.","[Wadho, Waqar; Ayaz, Umair] Lahore Sch Econ, Main Campus,Barki Rd, Lahore, Pakistan",Lahore School of Economics,"Wadho, W (通讯作者)，Lahore Sch Econ, Main Campus,Barki Rd, Lahore, Pakistan.",w.wadho@lahoreschool.edu.pk,"Wadho, Waqar/R-6487-2019","Wadho, Waqar/0000-0002-6972-5697",,,,,41,2,2,0,19,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

Using municipality-level panel data, the study shows that raising the tax rate on land while lowering the tax rate on buildings leads to an increase in land value per acre. Further, this impact differs between residential land and commercial and industrial land. Residential land appears to be more responsive to changes in the tax differential than commercial and industrial land. The paper contributes to the literature on land value taxation by testing important theories that have never been tested before and offering the first empirical evidence on the impact of site value taxation on land value.","[Yang, Zhou] Robert Morris Univ, Dept Econ & Legal Studies, 6001 Univ Blvd, Moon Township, PA 15108 USA",Robert Morris University,"Yang, Z (通讯作者)，Robert Morris Univ, Dept Econ & Legal Studies, 6001 Univ Blvd, Moon Township, PA 15108 USA.",yangz@rmu.edu,,,Lincoln Institute of Land Policy,Lincoln Institute of Land Policy,"I thank the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy for the financial support for this research.

Insights from a Semiparametric Approach to Modeling Firm Performance,REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; LABOR; REGRESSION; PRODUCTIVITY; MARKET; UNEMPLOYMENT; INDUSTRY; GROWTH; CHINA,"There is a large and growing literature on the impact of institutional quality on economic performance and the broad consensus is that good institutions facilitate better economic performance. The literature that provides micro-level support for the policy discourse about institutional quality does not, however, account for significant intra-country variation in reactions of firms to changes in business environments, even within the same industry, and it generally ignores the possibility that the impact of institutional quality on firm performance may not be neutral. In this paper, we analyze the impact of institutions on firm performance using an approach that enables us to overcome these problems with the stylized approach. Using cross-country firm-level data, we demonstrate that not only does the marginal impact of institutional quality vary significantly within countries, but also that the impact is economically significant only at the two extremes of the distribution. We view this as prima facie evidence that policies that tinker with institutional quality on the basis of the popular wisdom about the impact of these institutions on the average firm may not have the desired or expected impact, at least at the micro level.","[Bhaumik, Sumon Kumar] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield Univ, Sch Management, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Bhaumik, Sumon Kumar; Dimova, Ralitza] Inst Labor Econ, IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Bhaumik, Sumon Kumar; Dimova, Ralitza] GLO, Bonn, Germany; [Dimova, Ralitza] Univ Manchester, Global Dev Inst, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Kumbhakar, Subal C.] SUNY Binghamton, Binghamton, NY USA; [Sun, Kai] Shanghai Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China",University of Sheffield; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Manchester; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton; Shanghai University,"Bhaumik, SK (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sheffield Univ, Sch Management, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",s.k.bhaumik@sheffield.ac.uk,"Sun, Kai/AAX-1669-2020","Sun, Kai/0000-0002-5245-0439; Bhaumik, Sumon/0000-0002-4459-3659",,,,,44,13,13,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

This paper shows that some salient characteristics of the geographical area in which entrepreneurs reside affect the success of the crowdfunding projects they propose. Specifically, we theoretically discuss and empirically document that the altruism of people residing in the area (i.e., local altruism) increases the likelihood of success. Moreover, the strength of this effect depends on the level of social capital in the area (i.e., localized social capital). Building on the extant literature, we claim that localized social capital has two main dimensions: the social relations among residents and their compliance with social norms. Using a dataset of 618 proponents that launched 457 crowdfunding projects on 13 Italian reward-based platforms, we find that social relations magnify the effect of local altruism. Conversely, compliance with social norms does not have any moderating effect.","[Giudici, Giancarlo; Guerini, Massimiliano; Rossi-Lamastra, Cristina] Politecn Milan, Sch Management, Via Lambruschini 4b, I-20156 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Rossi-Lamastra, C (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, Sch Management, Via Lambruschini 4b, I-20156 Milan, Italy.",cristina1.rossi@polimi.it,"Guerini, Massimiliano/E-9361-2017",,,,,,76,149,156,2,154,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

However, the unevenness of the list across countries and regions may point to other factors that contribute to the inclusion of a site on the list.

This paper explores whether alleviating this impediment through a land-titling program in rural Peru is associated with improvements in household water sources, as well as sanitation and electricity services. The economics literature on the links between property rights and investment decisions has amassed; yet due to the necessity of water for life, the high fixed costs associated with water infrastructure construction, and the positive externalities that can result from water provision, it is not obvious how water services might respond to land tenure improvements. Utilizing the phased-in program timing in a quasi-experimental design, we exploit the differences in implementation timing across space in conjunction with the differences in program impact across households that held property titles prior to the project and those that did not. Results from this modified difference-in-differences method indicate that land titling is associated with small in magnitude, but statistically significant increases in water access. Larger gains in sanitation and electricity services are found. We investigate the channels through which this improved access occurs and find evidence of investments in all three services via either government or water utilities. We find evidence of individual household investment only in the case of sanitation. Taken together, these results indicate that land titles are important, but not sufficient to increase access to water and other services. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

These route changes have previously escaped attention from researchers. A database of all route changes on the Interstate system and other freeways was compiled in GIS and analyzed. Route changes are due to the need to replace old and obsolete bridges and tunnels, rebuild sharp curves or steep grades, and eliminate substandard sections.

In particular, they explore whether this investor sentiment has the ability to be predicted by the residuals from the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). The analysis makes use of data for S&P500 firms on a daily basis, spanning the period of 1995-2015, as well as certain panel methodological approaches. The results suggest that the residuals from the CAPM model gain explanatory power for investor sentiment. In other words, investor sentiment is a priced factor. The implication of this finding is that overlooking the role of investor sentiment in classical finance theory could lead to an imperfect picture of describing the asset pricing.","[Apergis, Nicholas] Univ Piraeus, Athens, Greece; [Rehman, Mobeen Ur] SZABIST, St 09,Plot 67,Sect H-8-4, Islamabad 46000, Pakistan",University of Piraeus; Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Institute of Science & Technology,"Rehman, MU (通讯作者)，SZABIST, St 09,Plot 67,Sect H-8-4, Islamabad 46000, Pakistan.",mobeenrehman@live.com,"Rehman, Mobeen Ur/B-4368-2017","Rehman, Mobeen Ur/0000-0002-8889-9051; , Nick/0000-0002-0375-2457",,,,,49,12,14,3,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

As a consequence, it is estimated that more than 60 million children in rural China are left behind and live with relatives, typically their paternal grandparents. These children are called Left Behind Children (LBCs). There are concerns about the potential negative effects of parental migration on the academic performance of the LBCs that could be due to the absence of parental care. However, it might also be that when a child's parents work away from home, their remittances can increase the household's income and provide more resources and that this can lead to better academic performance. Hence, the net impact of out-migration on the academic performance of LBCs is unclear. This paper examines changes in academic performance before and after the parents of students out-migrate. We draw on a panel dataset collected by the authors of more than 13,000 students at 130 rural primary schools in ethnic minority areas of rural China. Using difference-in-differences and propensity score matching approaches, our results indicate that parental migration has significant, positive impacts on the academic performance of LBCs (which we measure using standardised English test scores). Heterogeneous analysis using our data demonstrates that the positive impact on LBCs is greater for poorer performing students.","[Bai, Yu; Shi, Yaojiang] Shaanxi Normal Univ, CEEE, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Linxiu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Chengfang] Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr Sci, China Ctr Agr Policy, Yiheyuan Rd 5, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Mo, Di; Rozelle, Scott] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Shaanxi Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Peking University; Stanford University","Liu, CF (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr Sci, China Ctr Agr Policy, Yiheyuan Rd 5, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",cfliu.ccap@pku.edu.cn,"ZHANG, LIN/GYD-9123-2022; Zhang, Lin/HZH-4842-2023; li, zhang/JHV-1750-2023; Bai, Yu/AAO-2988-2020","Bai, Yu/0000-0002-6052-7766","Chinese Academy of Sciences [Y02015004]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71333012, 71473240]; 111 Project [B16031]","Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); 111 Project(Ministry of Education, China - 111 Project)","This work was supported by the Chinese Academy of Sciences [Y02015004]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71333012,71473240]; and 111 Project [B16031].",,50,53,59,11,85,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze the relationship between use of Big Four auditors and access to debt capital by applying data from microfinance institutions (MFIs) in emerging countries, a population typically not investigated in accounting research. Design/methodology/approach - The authors apply a unique hand-collected data set from 60 emerging markets and empirically investigate whether access to various debt categories is related to the use of Big Four auditors. Findings - The authors find that access to international commercial debt, international subsidized debt and government agency debt is positively related to the use of a Big Four auditor. For local commercial debt, the authors find no association between auditor type and access to debt capital. The association between auditor choice and access to debt capital is stronger for nonprofit than for-profit MFIs. Originality/value - This is the first audit quality study to include a broad sample of emerging countries, which in itself is an important contribution. As far as general audit quality research is concerned, the authors take the literature one step further by showing that the benefits of using a Big Four auditor may be dependent on the specific source of debt financing a firm or organization seeks to use. Moreover, the authors demonstrate that the for-profit vs nonprofit dimension influences the relationship between auditor choice and access to capital.","[Beisland, Leif Atle; Mersland, Roy] Univ Agder, Sch Business & Law, Kristiansand, Norway; [Strom, Oystein] Oslo & Akershus Univ Coll Appl Sci, Sch Business, Oslo, Norway",University of Agder; Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet),"Beisland, LA (通讯作者)，Univ Agder, Sch Business & Law, Kristiansand, Norway.",leif.a.beisland@uia.no,"Strøm, Reidar Øystein/IST-7619-2023","Strøm, Reidar Øystein/0000-0002-9028-2472; Mersland, Roy/0000-0002-6683-2737",,,,,69,2,2,1,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Our study shows the prevalence of premarital sex is higher when based on reports from married females and males aged 15-24 instead of reports from unmarried Indonesians. Males, less-educated people, and rural residents are also more likely to have premarital sex, while females, more-educated people and rural residents marry sooner after first having sex. Generally, however, Indonesians who have had premarital sex marry later than their counterparts. The long time span between Indonesians initiating premarital sex and marrying needs to be considered in policy that provides unmarried adolescents with rights to comprehensive sexual reproductive health (SRH) services.","[Berliana, Sarni Maniar; Utami, Efri Diah] Politekn Stat STIS, BPS, East Jakarta, Indonesia; [Efendi, Ferry] Univ Airlangga, Surabaya, Indonesia; [Kurniati, Anna] Minist Hlth, Jakarta, Indonesia",Airlangga University; Ministry of Health - Indonesia,"Berliana, SM (通讯作者)，Politekn Stat STIS, BPS, East Jakarta, Indonesia.",,"Berliana, Sarni/AAN-4465-2021; efendi, ferry/B-5700-2012","Berliana, Sarni/0000-0001-7908-6019; efendi, ferry/0000-0001-7988-9196",,,,,65,9,11,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

Specifically, we examine how the economic crisis affected comparative advantage indices at 1) the start of a period of comparative advantage, 2) during a period of comparative advantage, and 3) how quickly comparative advantage grew within a defined period. Duration and regression analyses are applied to examine the fragility of comparative advantage indices using alternative model specifications and estimation procedures. Estimations suggest that the comparative advantage for most agri-food products is short lived. Economic crisis reduces the duration and growth of comparative advantage, while spell duration, lag in comparative advantage and product differentiation reduce the probability of failure of duration of comparative advantage. Economic crisis and the duration of a period after-crisis reduce, and a period after-crisis and crisis-duration increase the growth of comparative advantage. These results are relevant for EU agri-food exporting countries, as the fragility of comparative advantage is found to be driven by both endogenous factors and the exogenous macro-economic-related shock of economic crisis. Exit from economic crisis and product differentiation have strengthened the comparative advantage of EU-28 member states in terms of differentiated agri-food product varieties for final consumption.","[Bojnec, Stefan] Univ Primorska, Koper, Slovenia; [Ferto, Imre] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Budapest, Hungary; [Ferto, Imre] Kaposvar Univ, Kaposvar, Hungary",University of Primorska; Hungarian Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies; Kaposvar University; Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences,"Bojnec, S (通讯作者)，Univ Primorska, Fac Management, Cankarjeva 5, Koper 6104, Slovenia.",stefan.bojnec@fm-kp.si,"Fertő, Imre/AAQ-4634-2021; Ferto, Imre/GPS-7523-2022; Bojnec, Stefan/AFG-8313-2022; Ferto, Imre/A-7371-2009","Bojnec, Stefan/0000-0002-1270-6372; Ferto, Imre/0000-0002-3742-5964",Economic Crises and International Agricultural Trade [NKFI-115788],Economic Crises and International Agricultural Trade,We express our grateful thanks to the two anonymous journal reviewers for the useful suggestion to improve the paper.

In this article, we focus on individuals who refuse to purchase over Internet and aim to explore reasons for their behavior. To do so, we rely on Community Statistics on Information Society (CSIS) microdata for the year 2015. Individuals who report ordering and buying over the Internet more than one year ago and those who never engaged in online shopping were asked about reasons for not buying online. Potential reasons include lack of skills, privacy and security concerns, delivery concerns and problems, not having payment cards as well as habit, loyalty and preference of shopping in stores. The focus of this article is on comparison of reasons for not shopping online of individuals in EU countries that lead in adoption of e-shopping with laggard countries. We first analyze the prevalence of reasons for not buying online and compare countries in that respect. Among individuals who did not adopt e-shopping, there are those who have tried it at one point in time and did not continue to use it frequently and those who actually never engaged in buying over Internet. Both have certain reasons and constrains that prevent them from adopting this form of shopping. The analysis is followed by identification of reasons that significantly affect probability of trying online shopping, if not adopting it fully. It can be assumed that gaining true experience might contribute to increase in adoption of e-shopping among individuals. This is even more important for countries that still lag behind not just in buying online but in overall digital performance.","[Bozic, Ljiljana; Botric, Valerija] Inst Econ, Trg JF Kennedy 7, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",Institute of Economics Zagreb (EIZ); University of Zagreb,"Bozic, L (通讯作者)，Inst Econ, Trg JF Kennedy 7, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",ljbozic@eizg.hr,,,,,,,31,2,2,0,12,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2018,,,,,,,265,279,,10.18502/kss.v3i10.3543,0.0,,,15,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7SJ,,gold,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455399000017,0

As the investment decisions of multinational enterprises are commonly taken by managers and not by owners, the focus is on the impact of SA versus that of FA on the investment location decided by managers. This is done within the framework of the principal-agent setting, where a Monte Carlo simulation is carried out. Considering taxation under SA supports investing in a less risky investment, even if it is located in the country with the highest tax rate. In analysis of FA, allocation of the tax base based on formula and the cross-border loss offset encourages investing in a risky investment. This is in line with the aim of the European Commission regarding making investments more attractive and supporting cross-border investments within the EU. These results also show that the delegation of investment decisions to managers facilitates the investment in the high-tax country, under both systems, SA as well as FA. As a contribution to the literature reviewed, this study demonstrates that taking the differences in expected returns of investments across the countries, as well as the risk-averse behavior of investors, into account, reveals different impacts of taxation on the invested amount under SA and FA.","[Celebi, Hulya] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Accounting, Sch Management, Auditing & Taxat, Innsbruck, Austria",University of Innsbruck,"Celebi, H (通讯作者)，Univ Innsbruck, Dept Accounting, Sch Management, Auditing & Taxat, Innsbruck, Austria.",huelya.celebi@gmail.com,,,,,,,20,0,0,1,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-68762-9; 978-3-319-68761-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,1,14,,10.1007/978-3-319-68762-9_1,0.0,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL3UH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450036900001,0

In Ecuador, the administration of Rafael Correa has invested substantially in both new infrastructure and community level training in order to steer world heritage visitors into a more diversified tourist sector. Our research examined the attempt of one community at the crater lake Quilotoa (Cotopaxi province) to maintain control of their economy in the face of increased state investments. We asked, under what circumstances is a community able to both define and defend a zone of locally managed economic development? To answer the question, we carried out a participatory GIS mapping project focused on sites of conflict and community assemblies and supplemented the mapping with an economic survey and detailed career histories. Our research finds that, since 1988, cycles of conflicts within the community of Quilotoa and between Quilotoa and its neighbors came to define an effective, yet informal, territorial boundary within which residents were highly committed to mobilize to defend their work and investments. Interviews show the importance of territory as political resources used by the community to escalate commercial conflicts into matters of wide public concern and ultimately establish the institutional basis of non-agricultural work.

In support of this idea, we recall the conclusion that has been made by research that has taken place over time that the value of private pension fund assets has risen on average by 11.5% annually. The impressive value of assets becomes extremely tempting for investors who see extremely good long-term investment opportunities if we consider the amounts traded. The Romanian pension system has entered a continuous process of change, not always with positive consequences on the level of pensions. The truly significant reforms have only emerged since 2000, being favored by the country's accession to the European Union. Unlike other states, in Romanian the 2008 crisis affected the pension system especially in its public component. Private funds have resisted fairly well the problems that have arisen, partly because of the extremely prudent investment policy. The paper attempts to capture the pressures on pension systems, also making a series of forecasts on future developments in different hypotheses of the economic and social context.","[Colomeischi, Tudor; Iancu, Eugenia] Stefan Cel Mare Univ, Suceava, Romania",Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava,"Colomeischi, T (通讯作者)，Stefan Cel Mare Univ, Suceava, Romania.",tudorcolomeischi@yahoo.ro; eiancu@seap.usv.ro,"Eugenia, Iancu/D-5891-2015",,,,,,4,0,0,0,2,LUMEN PUBLISHING HOUSE,IASI,"2, TEPES VODA STR, IASI, 700 714, ROMANIA",,,978-1-910129-18-0,,,,2018,,,,,,,1,6,,10.18662/lumproc.56,0.0,,,6,Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BM9BY,,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470307900001,0

Separately research on the CRT evolves from 3 questions to 7 questions variant. However, there is an evident gap in the literature for data that combines these two tools (DG and CRT) in one setup. In this study, we extend existing research on the relationship between cognitive performance on the CRT and dictator decisions taking into account such factors as donated sum, anonymity of the receiver and dictators' position (giving vs. taking). The main goal is to find out if the cognitive reflection test (CRT) helps to predict rational (or selfish) behavior in a DG. In our investigation, we asked 511 participants to respond to 6 types of dictator games and CRT test. For statistical analysis of the received results, we applied correlation, descriptive statistics, the t-student test and the Mann-Whitney test. Our results show that cognitive reflection was positively correlated with rational (selfish) behavior in DGs. Those dictators who scored high on the CRT (reflective dictators) kept more money for themselves than those who achieved lower scores on the CRT (altruistic, impulsive dictators). Our results confirm an inequity aversion attitude among altruistic, impulsive dictators and selfish, reflective dictators.","[Czerwonka, Monika; Staniszewska, Aleksandra] Warsaw Sch Econ, 162 Aleja Niepodleglosci, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland; [Kompa, Krzysztof] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, 12 Skwarczynskiej St, PL-91175 Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics; Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Czerwonka, M (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, 162 Aleja Niepodleglosci, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland.",monika.czerwonka@sgh.waw.pl; apalim@sgh.waw.pl; krzysztof_kompa@sggw.pl,"Kompa, Krzysztof/K-3228-2013",,,,,,23,3,3,0,7,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-99187-0; 978-3-319-99186-3,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,301,312,,10.1007/978-3-319-99187-0_22,0.0,,,12,Behavioral Sciences; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Behavioral Sciences; Business & Economics,BM1WR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000460629400022,0

Furthermore, trends and scores of individual indicators addressing this subindex, namely Labour Force Participation, Wage Equality for Similar Work, Estimated Earned Income and Ability of Women to Rise to Positions of Leadership over the period 2006-2017 are analyzed and discussed. The findings indicate that despite a minor improvement in the Czech Republic's rating in the Economic Participation and Opportunities subindex over the period 2006-2017, the overall the gap between women and men in this subindex remains significant. Moreover, the results indicate that the lower score in the subindex is directly connected to the country's worse performance in the Wage Equality for Similar Work, Estimated Earned Income and Ability of Women to Rise to Positions of Leadership indicators. On the other hand, our analysis reveals that the Czech Republic ranks higher in gender parity in relation to the Labour Force Participation indicator.

Until now, the term marketing and the existence of Islam and its acceptance is still a widely debated issue among academics, students, practitioners and consumers, especially in non-Islamic countries. Because there are arguments from experts that Islamic marketing is important in contemporary commercial activities, the 7P concept in marketing must be combined with Islamic principles. The 7P concept was chosen because of its wide acceptance as the main pillar of marketing. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to develop an understanding of 7P based on Islamic and contemporary marketing perspectives, which explains how the marketing mix in the perspective of Islam, which in practice must be in accordance with the rules in force in muamalah, this regulation does not harm consumers and producers.

Publicly,the German Government was preoccupied with the creation of a moral hazard that common funds would create for banks in those participating countries that had weak banking systems. This paper argues that to understand German moral hazard concerns it is necessary to look beyond the ideational - notably concerns stemming from German Ordo-liberalism - and focus on the existing national institutional arrangements that the German Government sought to protect. German moral hazard concerns stemmed from the fear that well-funded German deposit guarantee schemes (DGS) - especially those of small savings and cooperative banks - could be tapped to compensate for underfunded (and largely ex post funded) DGS in other member states. We thus demonstrate that the difficulties facing the construction of an EDIS owe to the weakness of the previously agreed harmonization of national DGS. This failure to harmonize schemes beyond a low minimal standard can be explained through an analysis focused on national systems. Different existing national DGS stem from the different configuration of national banking systems, the longstanding relationships among national banks and well-entrenched regulatory frameworks.","[Howarth, David] Univ Luxembourg, Inst Polit Sci, Belval, Luxembourg; [Quaglia, Lucia] Univ Bologna, Dept Polit & Social Sci, Bologna, Italy",University of Luxembourg; University of Bologna,"Howarth, D (通讯作者)，Univ Luxembourg, Inst Polit Sci, Belval, Luxembourg.",david.howarth@uni.lu,,"Howarth, David/0000-0003-2697-165X",,,,,55,27,27,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

The reason for conducting this analysis is the European Banking Authority's stance about retail sight deposits being stable funding for credit institutions under stress, due to their transactional nature. Thus, this opinion assumes the existence of linkages between the levels of deposits and financial situation (especially incomes) of their owners. The study is based on data from the Eurosystem HFCS, which relate to households' financial well-being in 15 euro area countries in the time of economic and financial turmoil. The regression models are used to estimate the impact of respondents' incomes and assets (real and financial assets). The main findings are that the significance of households' financial well-being for the allocation of deposits is heterogeneous in the countries analysed. In part of them the primary influence is assigned to the level of recent annual gross income, while in the other to net wealth accumulated by a household in the long run. From all the sight deposits declared, the most sensitive to financial situation are those placed by respondents on retirement. However, assuming the constancy of the financial situation of households in the euro area, their willingness to allocate more sight deposits appears geographically differentiated. The most willing in this regard is the Finnish population.","[Kochaniak, Katarzyna] Cracow Univ Econ, Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Kochaniak, K (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Krakow, Poland.",katarzyna.kochaniak@uek.krakow.pl,,"Kochaniak, Katarzyna/0000-0002-0680-9922",National Science Centre in Poland [DEC-2013/11/D/HS4/04056],"National Science Centre in Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)",The paper presents the results of a study carried out under a research project financially supported by the National Science Centre in Poland (grant number: DEC-2013/11/D/HS4/04056).

Although RO enjoys a substantial body of literature considering its application and suitability in different situations, the impact of national culture on the application of RO has received little attention. Values embedded in national culture affect the behavior of managers. In particular, these values play a role in how managers frame information, communicate, and make decisions, directly and indirectly affecting behavior through cultural layers such as organizational culture. National culture, therefore, can systematically affect the application of RO, potentially leading to suboptimal outcomes. In this article, we hypothesize how 2 particularly relevant dimensions of culture, power distance and uncertainty avoidance, affect RO exercise, and estimate the magnitude suboptimality of these effects using a model we develop for the case of a put option.

To do so, training along with workshops with practical and simple technique may be used to increase their knowledge on social media.","[Maming, Jumidah; Munir, Abdul Razak; Kadir, Nuraeni; Reni, Andi] Hasanuddin Univ, Makassar, Indonesia",Universitas Hasanuddin,"Maming, J (通讯作者)，Hasanuddin Univ, Makassar, Indonesia.",,"Munir, Abdul Razak/M-3494-2017","Munir, Abdul Razak/0000-0003-0773-9193",,,,,7,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-786-7,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,92.0,,,,,,720,726,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP5ZL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000558679400077,0

It also analyses the banking inclusion effect on income distribution and poverty level in the regions. Banking inclusion is measured by the index, in particular, banking inclusion through banking penetration indicator, banking accessibility, and also the use of bank account. Distribution and inequality of financial and income are measured by the total growth of the poor in the respective regions. Type of this research is explanatory with qualitative approaches by using secondary data and survey in the selected city in KTI. The focuses of research analysis are analysis on banking inclusion index and analysis on relation test between banking inclusion to income distribution indicator and poverty level. Analysis method employs various analysis tools. Banking inclusion index is measured by using financial inclusion index formula. Inequality income indicator and inequality on financial sector employ, namely Gini Ratio Index, and Relation Analysis Approach employs the descriptive method. Generally, assumption put forward is that banking inclusion in the city in KTI can be still categorized in financial inclusion index, in particular, banking relatively low and unequal, except in some province which has been becoming a strategic economic hub, namely Makassar and Manado. It is caused by some structural problems, institutional, human resources, and applicable rules. The result of relation test between banking inclusion index and its inequality to economic inequality indicator, income distribution, and poverty are expected to indicate one-way relation, in which banking inclusion index affects distribution index, and subsequently affect poverty level.","[Marsuki; Sabir; Munawwarah, S.

About 60 percent of women aged 65 years or over do not have a contributory retirement pension. Widowhood pensions play an important role to extend the coverage of contributory pensions and reduces the poverty of women. These gaps are the consequences of gender differences in employment such as salaries, working hours and duration of working life. Also, there is a strong cultural component which implies the traditional role of women as the caretakers of their families. The Social Security system is currently undergoing changes which mainly affect retirement pensions. The main effect of the Spanish reforms on pensioners consists in lowering pensions and adds to the women's pensions some negative impacts such as the penalization of short work careers and careers with low intensity of time worked (part-time and others). Also, the sustainability factor based on the life expectancy will affect in greater proportion in women than in men. It should be considered alternatives measures to reconcile finance sustainability and adequacy of pension systems in the context of ageing populations.

Moreover, waste-picking could provide a sustainable solution for solving the waste management crisis that affects the 3 billion people lacking access to waste services. Governmental policies toward waste-pickers in particular, and the informal economy in general, have been fundamentally based on four policy approaches: (1) dualist and voluntarist, which proposes repressive policies against waste-picker activity and the expansion of formal solid waste management systems; (2) structuralist, which argues for weak supporting policies aimed at reinforcing waste-picker associations; (3) legalist, which promotes the competition of waste picking with other recycling alternatives without government intervention; and (4) co-production, which supports waste-picking with local policies as a means of enhancing waste-pickers' productivity. Both qualitative, and particularly quantitative evidence testing the impact of these four approaches is scarce. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap in the literature by operationalizing concepts, building a waste-picker sustainable performance index, and estimating the impacts of these four competing policy approaches. An exploratory sequential design method is used to analyze data: first, a thematic analysis to examine 40 in-depth interviews, and then multiple linear regressions to analyze a census survey of 100 waste-pickers in four cooperatives in Santiago de Chile. Our empirical results suggest a positive association between the level of government support and waste-pickers' sustainable performance. Consequently, further positive government intervention, particularly in supporting a stronger structural organization for the waste-picker recycling system, is advocated as the primary policy recommendation of this paper.

Environmental and consumer protectionists demand government intervention to mitigate these externalities. With this in mind, the present study examines the effects of nudge-based regulatory strategies. We use an incentivized multi period single player business management game as experimental device to study how nudges affect compliance with the minimum-distance-to-water rule in a sample of agricultural science students. We analyse two different nudge treatments: a nudge with pictures showing environmental and health damages that are presumably caused by breaching the minimum-distance-to-water rule, and a nudge with an additional social comparison, which suggests that the majority of farmers in the same region comply with the rule. We observe three core experimental outcomes: first, nudging has a preventive effect and reduces not only the share of non- compliant participants but also the total acreage that is irregularly fertilised. Second, against all expectations, the preventive effect of the nudge with pictures and a social comparison is weaker than that of the nudge with pictures alone. A further contra-intuitive result is that nudging increases the severity of infringements (in terms of the irregularly fertilised acreages) among the nonetheless remaining offenders; and this effect is even a bit stronger for the nudge with additional social comparison. Despite the overall limited generalizability of experimental findings based on student participants, the results show that nudging produced very different behavioural effects in different groups: It worked well as a preventive device in one subgroup, but within the rule-breaking group it increased the severity of offences. At present, we can only speculate about the drivers behind these contrary effects (e.g., reactance). However, the indication that the same policy measures might work in opposite directions in different subgroups provides an important subject of future research (policy impact analysis).","[Peth, Denise; Musshoff, Oliver] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany; [Funke, Katja; Hirschauer, Norbert] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Halle, Saale, Germany",University of Gottingen; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Peth, D (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ Gottingen, Dept Agrarokon & Rurale Entwicklung, Arbeitsbereich Landwirtschaftl Betriebslehre, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",denise.peth@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021","Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X; Hirschauer, Norbert/0000-0001-6027-8889",,,,,137,0,0,2,13,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

On a global scale, new patterns of resource exploration, extraction, and commodification create new territories. This takes place within a dynamic of frontiers and territorialization. Frontier dynamics dissolve existing social orders property systems, political jurisdictions, rights, and social contracts whereas territorialization is shorthand for all the dynamics that establish them and re-order space anew. Frontier moments offer new opportunities, and old social contracts give way to struggles over new ones. As new types of resource commodification emerge, institutional orders are sometimes undermined or erased, and sometimes reinterpreted, reinvented, and recycled. New property regimes, new forms of authority, and the attendant struggles for legitimacy over the ability to define proper uses and users follow frontier moments. The drawing of borders and the creation of orders around new resources profoundly rework patterns of authority and institutional architectures. We argue that the territorialization of resource control is a set of processes that precedes legitimacy and authority, fundamentally challenging and replacing existing patterns of spatial control, authority, and institutional orders. It is dynamics of this sort that the articles in this collection explore: the outcomes produced in the frontier space, the kinds of authority that emerge through control over space and the people in it, and the battles for legitimacy that this entails. This collection explores the emergence of frontier spaces, arguing that these are transitional, liminal spaces in which existing regimes of resource control are suspended, making way for new ones.

Third, additional macroeconomic variables, such as the CRB, Copper, and Oil are found to be statistically significant in some strategies. This economic and historical information, when included with asset pricing models, is more powerful in explaining hedge fund returns than previous models. Fourth, unlike the previous literature, these generated models are corrected for time-series assumptions violations and heteroskedasticity.

Taking into consideration the firm's indifferent FDI option value between the two policies, the government trades off the immediate and certain lump-sum cost of the subsidy against the future random flow of tax rate reduction. We demonstrate that the optimal policy for attracting FDI depends on the growth rate and the volatility of the profit as well as the discount rate. There exists a critical level in each of the three parameters. The tax rate reduction (or investment cost subsidy) is preferable when the growth rate and the volatility of the profit is higher (or lower), and when the discount rate is lower (or higher). These results are consistent with the empirical findings, which found that governments are more likely to adopt tax rate reduction for firms with high risk and high return.","[Tian, Yuan] Ryukoku Univ, Fac Econ, Kyoto, Japan",Ryukoku University,"Tian, Y (通讯作者)，Ryukoku Univ, Fac Econ, Kyoto, Japan.",tian@econ.ryukoku.ac.jp,,,"JSPS [24730283, 25245046]; Ryukoku University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25245046, 24730283, 16K17151] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Ryukoku University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","I would like to thank the editor and two anonymous referees for their invaluable comments.

Using an electricity system planning model, this study investigates two complementary strategies to reduce CO2 emission intensity of the power sector in South Asia: carbon pricing, and expansion of cross-border electricity trade to exploit dean energy resources, especially hydropower. The study finds that with a carbon tax imposed on fossil fuels used for power generation, CO2 emissions from the power sector would be 10% lower than that in the baseline over 2015-2040 even if the cross-border electricity transmission capacity is not expanded from the current level. On the other hand, if the cross-border transmission capacity is expanded to facilitate unlimited power trading across countries, the carbon tax would cause 16% reduction of regional power sector CO2 emissions from the baseline. The regional electricity trade is not only beneficial economically as it saves almost US$100 billion electricity supply cost in the region over 2015-2040, but also an attractive option for climate change mitigation. The carbon tax would, however, increase the power supply cost and could adversely impact consumers unless the carbon tax revenue is used as a safeguard measure.","[Timilsina, Govinda R.; Toman, Michael A.] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Timilsina, GR (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",gtimilsina@worldbank.org,,,World Bank; AusAid,World Bank(The World Bank India); AusAid(Australian Aid (AusAID)),"We acknowledge three anonymous reviewers and editors for their constructive comments.

Stable labor relations can promote the healthy development of enterprises, and building harmonious labor relations is the social responsibility that enterprises should undertake. Based on this, this paper analyzes the importance of corporate social responsibility through literature review methods, and finds out the problems of corporate social responsibility in labor relations and the path choice of building harmonious labor relations.","[Wang, Jianju; Zhang, Jingzhe] Guizhou Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Business Adm, Human Resource Management, Guiyang, Guizhou, Peoples R China",Guizhou University of Finance & Economics,"Zhang, JZ (通讯作者)，Guizhou Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Business Adm, Human Resource Management, Guiyang, Guizhou, Peoples R China.",280510329@qq.com,,,,,,,5,0,0,2,7,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-623-5,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,56.0,,,,,,32,35,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO0KO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000491539600008,0

Design/methodology/approach - This study uses stock returns data of two countries - Saudi Arabia and Iran - from January 2008 to September 2014 and the ARMA-GARCH models to study impact of the Ramadan month on the return and volatility of the stock market in these two countries. Findings - The results of this study show some differences in the impact of the Ramadan month on the return and volatility of the stock market in these two countries. While the Ramadan month has a significant positive influence on the mean returns and the volatility of the Saudi market, its influence on the Iranian market is found to be insignificant. Further analysis on the last ten days of the Ramadan month provides a similar result for the Saudi market. However, for the Iranian market, volatility is significantly negatively affected during these last ten days. Originality/value - Most prior studies have found significant changes in returns during the Ramadan month but a deeper understanding of this stock market anomaly is needed. The results point toward the influence of mood/emotions and religious experience in explaining the existence of the Ramadan anomaly.","[Wasiuzzaman, Shaista] Multimedia Univ, Fac Management, Finance, Cyberjaya, Malaysia; [Al-Musehel, Noura Abdullah] Multimedia Univ, Fac Management, Cyberjaya, Malaysia",Multimedia University; Multimedia University,"Wasiuzzaman, S (通讯作者)，Multimedia Univ, Fac Management, Finance, Cyberjaya, Malaysia.",shaista@mmu.edu.my,"Wasiuzzaman, Shaista/H-8403-2019","Wasiuzzaman, Shaista/0000-0002-0244-2174",,,,,39,19,19,0,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

The results of the study show that the assumption that developing market MNEs tend to invest more in knowledge-intensive OFDI than those from developed markets is correct as the lack of product and service differentiation capabilities provides motivation to seek knowledge in operations and marketing in foreign countries. However, this assumption is overstated as this study shows that there is no significant difference in the explorative behaviour of the two groupings. Upon further investigation, it is found that explorative OFDI is most applicable to European emerging market MNEs. Further analysis on developing market MNE OFDI also shows that these firms target medium to low-technology OFDI rather than high-technology OFDI. This is due to constraining factors such as capital intensity, institutional controls, and alignment with core competences. A combination of descriptive statistical analysis and mean comparison analysis is performed using SPSS software to test the hypotheses. The OFDI data used for analysis was collected from the International Trade Centre (2016 and 2017) databases.

We offer an alternative timing structure that validates the equilibrium derived in Choi [2010] under the conditions provided there. Second, we show that his equilibrium analysis with tying ignores a profitable deviation. We rectify this analysis under our alternative timing structure and derive the (mixed-strategy) equilibrium with tying.

We use the recently developed recursive Augmented Dickey-Fuller methods and propose similar recursive procedures based on Phillips-Perron. We find that conditional on bubbles in the S&P 500, there are strong links between bubble episodes across equity markets in Latin America. In addition, the financial bubble periods in Latin America begin earlier and last longer than bubble periods in the United States during the 2008 financial crisis.

For this purpose, the existence of social beta-, sigma-and gamma-convergence at national and regional level was tested. The author of this article decided to tackle the convergence problem since there is a high risk that countries are trying to catch up at international level even at the expense of increasing internal differences. This trade off could be framed as undesirable from a cohesion policy point of view. Achieving convergence is not only important for inhabitants' standard of living but for regions' and countries' competitiveness as well. In today's turbulent and globalised world, regions must become more resilient and competitive, and this cannot be done without adequate human capital. Dealing with present unsustainable trends of many kinds, regions are forced to create the best living conditions in order to avoid the brain drain. In this article, a spatial taxonomy measure of development (Pietrzak, 2016) was used to compare the Visegrad Group countries performance with respect to their internal cohesion in the period of 2004-2014. It seems that the inclusion of spatial relationships is justified because nowadays, no region develops in isolation. Therefore, the situation in each region is influenced by neighbourhood.","[Kuc, Marta] Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Chair Econ Sci, Ctr Stat, Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology,"Kuc, M (通讯作者)，Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Chair Econ Sci, Ctr Stat, Gdansk, Poland.",marta.kuc@zie.pg.gda.pl,,,,,,,53,31,31,0,6,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

We account for accumulation in abatement capital, greenhouse gases, and adaptation capital in order to better capture the arbitrage between abatement and adaptation investments. Pollution damages arise from the emissions due to the country consumption but also from the emissions of the rest of the world (ROW). A pollution threshold is then introduced, above which adaptation is no longer efficient. We obtain that if this threshold is lower than the steady-state level of pollution, there is no way for the modelled economy to avoid it. In particular, such a situation will appear if the ROW's emissions are high. We then show that CDM may be a means to avoid a pollution threshold above which adaptation becomes of no use.","[Le Kama, Alain Ayong] Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre Def, EconomiX, Nanterre, France; [Pommeret, Aude] City Univ Hong Kong, SEE, Tat Chee Ave, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Pommeret, Aude] Univ Savoie, IREGE, Annecy, France",Universite Paris Nanterre; Universite Paris Saclay; City University of Hong Kong; Universite Savoie Mont Blanc,"Pommeret, A (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, SEE, Tat Chee Ave, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Pommeret, A (通讯作者)，Univ Savoie, IREGE, Annecy, France.",aude.pommeret@cityu.edu.hk,,,,,,,30,8,8,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

This paper addresses this issue by using a case study of Spain, where the retail banking market was split evenly between shareholder and stakeholder banks before the crisis. We examine how institutional diversity mattered in the accumulation of risk in the pre-crisis years, in the severity of losses caused by the crisis, and in the resilience to recover from the losses. The method of analysis consists in linking the risk position of the banks in the pre-crisis period and the losses arising during the crisis to the decisions of banks to migrate from business models based on deposit financing to models based on market-debt financing. We find that cajas migrated to more vulnerable business models following the strategy of the shareholder banks, but the losses in the crisis were much higher in the former than in the latter. The paper interprets this result as evidence that what matters the most about the ownership of banks is their resilience in bad times. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this article, we emphasize the importance of these understudied aspects through a comparative case study of equity finance for cleantech in the United States and Germany. We find that systemic interdependencies between institutional investors, VC/PE and policy makers influence the conditions for innovation-the finance-innovation-policy nexus.

By utilizing event study analysis, our results suggest that grouping announcements have significant effect on stock prices and trading volume. The event day positive (negative) relationship between abnormal return and volume for the upgraded (downgraded) stocks supports the downward sloping demand curve hypothesis. Moreover, findings also suggest that stocks which are upgraded to Group A are exposed to more attention which is in line with the attention hypothesis. The reverse is valid for the downgraded firms. We find no evidence of price reversals and long-term symmetrical liquidity effect which lead us to reject price pressure and liquidity hypotheses.

To this end, the paper makes use of the spillover index methodology suggested by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012). Nonetheless, the paper extends this methodology by incorporating ex ante volatility measures that account for long memory in equity and foreign exchange markets. The paper finds asymmetric influences among BRICS countries in relation to the cross transmission of risks. The finding of the paper implies the possibility of unequal benefit that could result from a possible capital market liberalization between the BRICS countries.","[Bonga-Bonga, Lumengo] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Johannesburg,"Bonga-Bonga, L (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa.",lbonga@uj.ac.za,,,,,,,26,5,7,1,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

However, when examining the relationship for the sample of developing countries, the results reveal an N-shaped form.

However, small consumers (<75 m(3)) benefit from the new tariff program and increase their consumption, whereas the consumption of the others (>75 m(3)) decreases.

Further, two sets of high-frequency data are also used. The model is a parametric state space model with an estimation framework that combines long memory and level shifts by decomposing the underlying process into a mixture model and ARFIMA dynamics. The results of the estimates are not conclusive as those obtained in Varneskov and Perron (2017a,b). In fact, the very small magnitudes of the fractional parameter estimates suggest that only the high-frequency series could be modeled as RLS-ARFIMA models. The other (daily) series would be modeled as RLS-ARMA models with measurement errors except in the case of the Forex market of Brazil where there is no evidence of measurement errors. Another possibility is to accept the small magnitudes of the estimates of the fractional parameter as evidence of genuine long memory and, in that case, a larger group of series can be modeled as RLS-ARFIMA models. The forecasts are evaluated from two perspectives: one using 10% of the Model Confidence Set of Hansen, Lunde, and Nason (2011) and the other using a recent statistic proposed by Kniippel (2015) to evaluate density forecasts. The results favor the RLS-ARMA and RLS-ARFIMA models although we found some differences between the two approaches for the cases of Brazil and Mexico (stocks) and Argentina (Forex). Finally, forecasts are used to calculate the VaR at 1%, 5% and 10%. The results support broadly the RLS-ARFIMA models with one or two exceptions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Big-science organizations represent a special breed of co-developers, as their demands are not necessarily the avant-garde of a coming market. Yet, they may provide a valuable test bed for suppliers because they are pushing the boundaries of technological capacities and, thus, challenging suppliers' talents. They are also prestigious collaboration partners that help producers to be acknowledged as being at the forefront of technology. They are often deeply engaged in their suppliers' manufacturing and development activities, which is seen as a characteristic of the customer-active paradigm upon which the lead-user notion builds. This paper investigates whether and how interacting with the European Organization for Nuclear Research concerning their development needs may contribute to suppliers' innovation. We ask the question: What characterizes interactions with big-science organizations as a type of lead user, and how do these characteristics impact the potential innovation benefits accruing to the suppliers?","[Andersen, Poul H.] Aalborg Univ, Fibigerstr 11, DK-9100 Aalborg, Denmark; [Aberg, Susanne] Uppsala Univ, Uppsala, Sweden",Aalborg University; Uppsala University,"Andersen, PH (通讯作者)，Aalborg Univ, Fibigerstr 11, DK-9100 Aalborg, Denmark.",poa@business.aau.dk,"Andersen, Poul Houman/H-7745-2017","Andersen, Poul Houman/0000-0001-6513-3080",,,,,53,2,4,1,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

We adopt a comparative multi-scalar approach, and develop the concept of livelihood pathways' as a means of understanding agrarian change associated with crop booms. The study reveals sharply divergent patterns of social change resulting from the pangasius boom, as experienced in two different village settings, despite underlying similarities in the processes of commodification evident in both. In addition to drawing attention to domestic crop booms and the diversity of transitions in which they result, the paper demonstrates the value of comparative multi-scalar analytical approaches and the importance of livelihood pathways in processes of agrarian change.","[Belton, Ben] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, 446 W Circle Dr, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Belton, Ben] WorldFish, Bangladesh & South Asia Off, House 22B,Rd 7,Block F, Dhaka 1213, Bangladesh; [van Asseldonk, Imke Josepha Mariana; Bush, Simon R.] Wageningen Univ, Environm Policy Grp, POB 8130, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands",Michigan State University; CGIAR; Worldfish; Wageningen University & Research,"Belton, B (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, 446 W Circle Dr, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.;Belton, B (通讯作者)，WorldFish, Bangladesh & South Asia Off, House 22B,Rd 7,Block F, Dhaka 1213, Bangladesh.",beltonbe@msu.edu; imkevanasseldonk@gmail.com; simon.bush@wur.nl,,"Bush, Simon/0000-0002-6689-2246",United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Feed the Future Cereal Systems Initiative for South Asia project (CSISA-BD),United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Feed the Future Cereal Systems Initiative for South Asia project (CSISA-BD)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),This paper is a contribution to the CGIAR research programme on Livestock and Fish.

Under a high-risk environment, a country's economic growth is harmed by raising its public debt. The negative effects public debt has on economic growth become weak under low political and financial-risk environments, while an increase in public debt could help to stimulate economic growth under low composite and economic risk environments. In addition, the differences of countries' income and debt levels also lead country risks to have different effects on the debt-growth nexus, suggesting that a country should borrow appropriately based on its current risk environments while improving economic performance.","[Chiu, Yi-Bin] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Business Adm, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Lee, Chien-Chiang] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; National Sun Yat Sen University,"Chiu, YB (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Business Adm, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",yibin.chiu@gmail.com; cclee@cm.nsysu.edu.tw,"Chiu, Yi-Bin/JYQ-2605-2024; Lee, Chien-Chiang/AAZ-9983-2020","Lee, Chien-Chiang/0000-0003-0037-4347",,,,,26,28,28,4,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1074-3529,1465-7287,,CONTEMP ECON POLICY,Contemp.

This paper proposes a theoretical model of PIF policies within a framework in which voters belonging to different income groups vote over the level of subsidies to higher education. We analyze the impact of two types of potential PIF policies-a deferred tuition approach and an income share approach-on college access and on voting equilibria over subsidy levels. The results show that college access is enhanced by PIF policies. The equilibrium level of subsidies depends crucially on the pattern of income distribution, in particular on the relationship between mean income and the income of the median income group, and on whether higher education widens or narrows the distribution of income. We show that the equilibrium level of subsidies to higher education will not necessarily decline under PIF, and may increase in some circumstances due to changes in college access for low-income groups.","[Delaney, Jennifer A.] Univ Illinois, Dept Educ Policy Org & Leadership, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Dharmapala, Dhammika] Univ Chicago, Sch Law, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Chicago,"Delaney, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Educ Policy Org & Leadership, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",delaneyj@illinois.edu; dharmap@uchicago.edu,"Dharmapala, Dhammika/GPF-9205-2022","Dharmapala, Dhammika/0000-0001-9858-0565",Lee and Brena Freeman Faculty Research Fund at the University of Chicago Law School,Lee and Brena Freeman Faculty Research Fund at the University of Chicago Law School,"The authors would like to thank the Editor (Brad Humphries), two anonymous referees, Bethany Carmien, Bradley Hemenway, Caroline Hoxby, Tyler D.

The model unemployment insurance program includes four realistic features: 1) a 50% replacement rate up to a benefit cap; 2) finite duration of eligibility during a jobless spell; 3) limited eligibility; and 4) and an imperfectly monitored job search requirement. The model is parameterized to fit the size of scope of unemployment insurance in the United States. Removing unemployment insurance from the model leads to only a 0.1% consumption equivalent increase in average welfare. Simplifying assumptions about the structure of unemployment insurance, such as allowing all job losers to receive benefits, lead to much larger welfare effects similar to the effects found in the past literature.

In this paper, we discuss the valuation problem of double barrier options under a volatility regime-switching model where there exist psychological barriers in the prices of underlying assets. The volatility can shift between two regimes, that is to say, when the asset price rises up or falls down through the psychological barrier, the volatility takes two different values. Using the Laplace transform approach, we obtain the price of the double barrier knock-out call option as well as its delta. We also provide the eigenfunction expansion pricing formula and examine the effect of the psychological barrier on the option price and delta, finding that the gamma of the option is discontinuous at such barriers.","[Song, Shiyu] Tianjin Univ, Sch Math, Tianjin 300354, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yongjin] Nankai Univ, Sch Business, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China",Tianjin University; Nankai University,"Song, SY (通讯作者)，Tianjin Univ, Sch Math, Tianjin 300354, Peoples R China.",shiyu.song@tju.edu.cn,"xuan, li/JNI-7432-2023",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71532001],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The authors would like to thank the editors and the anonymous referee for their valuable comments and suggestions which helped to improve the paper significantly.

This paper describes a novel explanation for ambiguity in political campaigns. It develops a model of candidate competition in which policy-motivated candidates can choose whether or not to announce their policy preferences to voters. It applies Eyster and Rabin's (Econometrica 73(5):1623-1672, 2005) concept of cursed equilibrium, which allows for varying degrees of understanding of the connection between type (policy preference) and strategy (whether to announce). If voters updated according to Bayes' rule, they would understand that candidates who do not announce positions are strategically concealing an unpopular policy preference. In equilibrium, only the most extreme candidates, those located furthest from the median voter's position, would choose to take no position. However, if voters do not sufficiently appreciate the informational content of a non-announcement, unraveling will not occur and both extremists and more moderate candidates will not announce positions.","[Szembrot, Nichole] Trinity Coll, Dept Econ, 300 Summit St, Hartford, CT 06106 USA",Trinity College,"Szembrot, N (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll, Dept Econ, 300 Summit St, Hartford, CT 06106 USA.",nichole.szembrot@trincoll.edu,,,,,,,31,3,3,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,OCT,2017,173.0,1-2,,,,,25,41,,10.1007/s11127-017-0461-9,0.0,,,17,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,FJ8CH,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412988600002,0

We consider this question in Vietnam, a market economy with socialist orientation that has seen rapid growth in export manufacturing and foreign direct investment, while signing regional trade agreements, which include labour rights provisions, with high-income trading partners. Our paper focuses on two such agreements - the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the European Union-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement. We ask how, if at all, these negotiations have influenced changes in Vietnam's labour regime, particularly regarding the representation and participation of workers in the country's system of industrial relations. Comparing binding and nonbinding provisions, we find that the effects of trade-labour linkages are mediated by their enforceability, and prospects for strengthening associational rights are improved by the possibility of commercial sanction. Overall, we find that gains for workers in Vietnam continue to be made by collective action, despite a context hostile to freedom of association, and that external influences to improve labour standards and conditions have had a minimal effect.","[Tran, Angie N.] Calif State Univ Monterey Bay, Seaside, CA USA; [Bair, Jennifer] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA USA; [Werner, Marion] SUNY Buffalo, Buffalo, NY USA",California State University System; California State University Monterey Bay; University of Virginia; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo,"Tran, AN (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Monterey Bay, Sch Social Behav & Global Studies, 100 Campus Ctr, Seaside, CA 93955 USA.",atran@csumb.edu,"Werner, Marion/IXW-9642-2023","Werner, Marion/0000-0002-5000-3053; Bair, Jennifer/0000-0002-5083-1385",Baldy Center for Law and Social Policy ( University at Buffalo- SUNY); Symposium,Baldy Center for Law and Social Policy ( University at Buffalo- SUNY); Symposium,"The author( s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/ or publication of this article: The authors would like to acknowledge the funding from the Baldy Center for Law and Social Policy ( University at Buffalo- SUNY), which funded the Symposium where the paper was first presented.",,46,27,28,0,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

This is because there is a non-zero correlation between movements in the price of the underlying asset and movements in the asset's volatility. The minimum variance delta takes account of both price changes and the expected change in volatility conditional on a price change. This paper determines empirically a model for the minimum variance delta.

The regulator optimally combines compensation and capital regulations. In contrast, if the board delegates the choice of strategy to the CEO, compensation regulation is sufficient to prevent both types of risk shifting.

Our results show that East Asian equity market integration among China and other countries has increased significantly since 2007, whereas among other East Asian equity markets excluding China increased significantly in an earlier period from 1999 to 2001. Additionally, we find that increasing integration has been mostly caused by correlation increases in after trading hours. These results suggest that stock prices in East Asia are sensitive to Europe and US stocks because Europe and US investors are actively investing in East Asian stocks. Indeed, the periods reflect striking increases in integration that correspond approximately to the start of intensive Europe and US investment activity in East Asian stock markets.

Using data from all 16 waves of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (1997-2013), a random effects regression analysis indicated that children with at least one immigrant parent had a higher likelihood of higher education attainment. When separate regressions were run by race/ethnicity, the immigrant advantage was only present for Black and Hispanic respondents.

However, this average blends multiple effects that are significant and that vary in magnitude across the landscape, yielding varied net impacts. We distinguish the locations with different net spillovers by their distances to roads and park entrances-both of which are of economic importance, given critical local roles for transport costs and tourism. We find large and statistically significant leakage close to roads but far from park entrances, which are areas with high agricultural returns and less influenced by tourism. We do not find leakage far from roads (lower agriculture returns) or close to park entrances (higher tourism returns). Finally, parks facing greater threats of deforestation show greater leakage.","[Robalino, Juan; Pfaff, Alexander; Villalobos, Laura] Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Robalino, J (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.",robalino@catie.ac.cr; alex.pfaff@duke.edu; laura.villalobos@economics.gu.se,,,"Tropi-dry II CRN3 of the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research; Tinker Foundation; NASA Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia; Latin American and Caribbean Environmental Program; Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency through the Environment for Development Initiative of the Department of Economics, University of Gothenburg","Tropi-dry II CRN3 of the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research; Tinker Foundation; NASA Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia; Latin American and Caribbean Environmental Program; Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency through the Environment for Development Initiative of the Department of Economics, University of Gothenburg","We have received financial support through project Tropi-dry II CRN3 of the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research, the Tinker Foundation, the NASA Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia, the Latin American and Caribbean Environmental Program, and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency through the Environment for Development Initiative of the Department of Economics, University of Gothenburg.

Insurance liabilities are modeled using a doubly stochastic compound Poisson process in which the mortality rate is correlated and cointegrated with the index mortality rate. We solve this dynamic hedging problem using a theory of forward-backward stochastic differential equations. Our theory shows that cointegration materially affects the optimal hedging strategy beyond correlation. The cointegration effect is independent of the risk preference of the insurer. Explicit solutions for the optimal hedging strategy are derived for cointegrated stochastic mortality models with both constant and state-dependent volatilities.,"[Wong, Tat Wing] BNU HKBU United Int Coll, Div Business & Management, Zhuhai, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Chiu, Mei Choi] Hong Kong Inst Educ, Dept Math & Informat Technol, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wong, Hoi Ying] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University - Hong Kong Baptist University United International College; Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK); Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Wong, HY (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",wong@cuhk.edu.hk,"Wong, Hoi Ying/Q-9219-2019","Wong, Hoi Ying/0000-0001-9743-1832; Wong, Tat Wing/0000-0003-0136-0676; Chiu, Mei Choi/0000-0003-2799-8360",Research Grants Council of Hong Kong; GRF [403511],Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); GRF,"Tat Wing Wong is at the Division of Business and Management, BNU-HKBU United International College.

We provide the first systematic review covering 38 empirical studies published between 1991 and early 2015. Increased budgetary disclosure and participation-which we call fiscal openness-are consistently associated with improvements in the quality of the budget, as well as governance and development outcomes. Only a handful of studies, however, convincingly identify causal effects, in the form of reduced corruption, enhanced electoral accountability, and improved allocation of resources. We highlight gaps and set out a research agenda that consists of: (a) disaggregating broad measures of budget transparency to uncover which specific disclosures are related to outcomes; (b) tracing causal mechanisms to connect fiscal openness interventions with ultimate impacts on human development; (c) investigating the relative effectiveness of alternative interventions; (d) examining the relationship between transparency and participation; and (e) clarifying the contextual conditions that support particular interventions.","[de Renzio, Paolo] Int Budget Partnership, London, England; [Wehner, Joachim] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Publ Policy, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"de Renzio, P (通讯作者)，Int Budget Partnership, London, England.",pderenzio@internationalbudget.org; j.h.wehner@lse.ac.uk,,"Wehner, Joachim/0000-0002-1951-308X; de Renzio, Paolo/0009-0007-2253-9671",Global Initiative for Fiscal Transparency (GIFT),Global Initiative for Fiscal Transparency (GIFT),"Paolo de Renzio is a Senior Research Fellow at the International Budget Partnership.

This article focuses on progressive lending over the course of the bank-borrower relationship. As the agricultural sector is increasingly important for Azerbaijan's economy, this study differentiates between the lending policies faced by farmers and non-farmers, and matches the findings with the repayment performances of both client groups. By means of a rich data set spanning from 2007 through 2012 provided by an MFI in Azerbaijan, it can be demonstrated that farmers face a higher degree of loan volume rationing that cannot be justified by our findings on repayment performances. Moreover, we find that repeated borrowing increases the default probabilities of both client groups. In conclusion, we deduce that the MFI and borrowers could benefit from reconsidering the current lending policies.","[Hering, Imke; Musshoff, Oliver] Georg August Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Goettinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Hering, I (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Goettinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",imke.hering@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021","Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X",German Research Foundation (DFG),German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the German Research Foundation (DFG).

The aim of our study is to present the economic and non-economic aspects which determine the quantitative evaluation of migration and to reveal which of the two main factor groups is more dominant. In January 2017, an online questionnaire survey was conducted on the subject of migration. The group of respondents consisted of 438 full-time BSc, MSc and PhD students in Hungarian higher education institutions. Based on these questionnaires, two independent samples t-test, and one-way ANOVA, factor analysis and binary logistic regression procedures were performed. Based on the findings obtained, it was concluded that anti-migration behaviour cannot be explicitly explained by its economic impacts on the labour market. The rejecting attitudes observed on behalf of certain respondents were not in significant correlation with their highest educational levels or their given social class. As a result of the statistical analysis performed, it was concluded that the integration of foreigners is hindered by the so-called socio-cultural barriers, which cannot be removed solely by economic policy measures. Social conflicts of interest have to be eliminated in order for migration to have an active and permanently positive impact on the economy.","[Olah, Judit; Halasi, Gyorgy; Szakaly, Zoltan; Popp, Jozsef; Balogh, Peter] Univ Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary",University of Debrecen,"Popp, J (通讯作者)，Univ Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.",popp.jozsef@econ.unideb.hu,"Oláh, Prof. Dr. Judit/U-5352-2019; Balogh, Peter/J-9183-2019; Popp, József/AAF-4461-2021; Popp, József/AFN-1250-2022","Oláh, Prof. Dr. Judit/0000-0003-2247-1711; Balogh, Peter/0000-0002-8611-0221; Popp, József/0000-0003-0848-4591; Szakaly, Zoltan/0000-0001-8332-3152",,,,,48,15,15,0,18,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2017,19.0,46,,,,,790,805,,,,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FK9UI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413856000013,0

We review the existing literature regarding the impact of resources on intimate partner violence, extracting testable and often conflicting hypotheses at the micro and macro level, and on the interaction across levels. We propose to extend existing theory to take into account attitudes at the community level. In the empirical analysis, we find no evidence that resources protect against abuse at the individual level, although resources are associated with lower acceptance. We find that resource inequality, both within the household and at the aggregate level, is associated with more abuse. Finally, we find that employed women face greater risk of abuse in communities with relatively higher acceptance of wife-beating. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

Complex models that attempt to incorporate default dependency are difficult to implement in practice. In this study, we develop a model for a company asset process, based on which we calculate simultaneous default probabilities using an option-theoretic approach. In our model, a shot noise process serves as the key element for controlling correlations among companies' assets. The risk factor driving the shot noise process is common to all companies in an industry but the shot noise parameters are assumed company-specific; therefore, every company responds differently to this common risk factor. Our model gives earlier warning of financial distress and predicts higher simultaneous default probabilities than commonly used geometric Brownian motion asset model. It is also computationally simple and can be extended to analyze any finite number of companies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

On this assumption, we consider whether oil prices shocks have any impact on bank non-performing loans (NPLs), and if so, whether the effect is homogenous across banks. This paper addresses these questions by applying a dynamic GMM model on data from 2310 commercial banks in 30 oil-exporting countries over the period 2000-2014. Three main results emerge. First, changes in oil prices do have a significant impact on bank NPLs: A rise (fall) in oil prices is associated with a decrease (increase) in NPLs. Second, oil prices shocks have asymmetric effects on bank problem loans, with negative oil price movements generally have a greater impact than positive oil price movements. Third, the unfavourable impact of adverse oil prices shocks on the quality of bank loans tends to be more pronounced in large banks. Overall, these robust results favour the adaptation of appropriate macroprudential policies and diversification of the economy, in order to mitigate the adverse impact of oil prices shocks.

We propose a novel way to risk neutralize the returns without relying on option price information. Empirically, we illustrate our methodology by estimating a tail-risk measure over a long historical period based on a set of size and book-to-market portfolios. We find that a risk premium is associated with long-short strategies with portfolio sorts based on tail-risk sensitivities of individual securities. Our tail-risk index also provides meaningful information about future market returns and aggregate macroeconomic conditions.

While empirical evidence is essential to understanding causality between capacity and project outcomes, past CD research primarily focuses on case studies. Using fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis, this research analyzes 126 urban infrastructure projects in India that were funded by a national urban renewal program to find which combinations of capacity factors at the enabling environment, organizational, and individual level led to successful or unsuccessful project delivery. The results identify six pathways to success and three pathways to failure and reveal the complex causality between capacity factors and project delivery. This study moves beyond theoretical discussions found in existing CD literature by providing an example of how CD can be studied in the context of a real-world development program, and contributes to our understanding of how capacity is interconnected with project delivery.

The paper presents an analysis of the mobility practices of residents and investigates the mobility constraints they experience in relation to the limited accessibility provided by the urban transport system. The paper draws upon qualitative interviews with residents in the periphery as well as recently collected travel speed data and offers a unique combination of testimony with GIS-based modelling of overall accessibility. A central finding is the overall importance of regular mobility and access to the city for residents in the periphery. Regular mobility is an ingrained part of residents' livelihood strategies. The majority of households rely on one or more members regularly travelling to central parts of the city in relation to their livelihood activities. The analysis reveals a widespread, near-to-universal, dependence on motorized transportation, with the vast majority depending on public transport. Raster-based modelling of overall accessibility provides an indication of the very high travel times endured by residents in the periphery. The analysis identifies and distinguishes between three overall mode types: 1) Private car, 2) public transport and 3) motorcycle/car combined with public transport. While private cars appear marginally faster, differences in travel times are actually limited. This suggests that travel times are less influenced by mode of transport than by road and traffic conditions and highlights how accessibility problems of peripheral settlements are not easily understood separately from the general dysfunctions of the overall mobility system of city.","[Andreasen, Manja Hoppe; Moller-Jensen, Lasse] Univ Copenhagen, Geog Sect, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Andreasen, MH (通讯作者)，Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Oster Voldgade 10, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",manja.andreasen@ign.ku.clk,"Moller-Jensen, Lasse/A-4225-2015; Andreasen, Manja Hoppe/N-8015-2015","Moller-Jensen, Lasse/0000-0001-9503-055X; Andreasen, Manja Hoppe/0000-0001-5617-3945",European Union under the 7th Research Framework Programme (theme SSH) [290732],European Union under the 7th Research Framework Programme (theme SSH),"This research is part of the 'African Rural-City Connections' (RurbanAfrica) research project.

It argues that, together with Donald Trump's election as President of the United States, it represents the historical moment when the twin crises that emerged in 2008 - the re-emergence of Russia as a geopolitical challenger to the United States and the financial crash that exposed the fragility of the neoliberal economic system - effectively fused. The article explores the double imperial constitution of the European Union, Britain's peculiar positioning within global power structures, and the combined impact of the crash, the Great Recession of 2008-2009, and the policy reaction of seeking to recharge neoliberalism through austerity as creating the conditions for the Brexit vote.

Monetary unions, such as the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), require even stronger fiscal rules to avoid free riding by regional fiscal authorities on the common monetary policy. By contrast, in a fiscal federation, the federal government internalises the effect of active regional policies on the overall price level. Federal fiscal policy contributes to price stability either by enforcing fiscal rules or by adjusting its own stance. Following Canzoneri, Cumby and Diba (2001), we test whether federal and regional governments in Germany behave in an active or passive way. We find evidence of a spillover effect of unsustainable policies on other regions. The German federal government offsets the effect on the price level by running passive policies. The Bundesbank's prime objective of price stability is therefore endorsed by fiscal policy. The results have implications for the regulation of fiscal policies in the EMU.","[Claeys, Peter] Vrije Univ Brussel, Brussels, Belgium; [Ramos, Raul; Surinach, Jordi] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain",Vrije Universiteit Brussel; University of Barcelona,"Claeys, P (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Brussel, Brussels, Belgium.",peter.claeys@eui.eu; rramos@ub.edu; jsurinach@ub.edu,"Claeys, Peter/AAJ-2126-2020; Suriñach, Jordi/E-6801-2016; Ramos-Lobo, Raul/L-3287-2013","Claeys, Peter/0000-0003-2263-4250; Ramos-Lobo, Raul/0000-0003-0047-0793",,,,,50,0,0,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

In sub-Saharan Africa ('Africa') most low income countries are among the worst countries for elderly people to live in, as shown by the Global AgeWatch Index 2015. According to HelpAge International, the author of this new Index, the worst preforming countries lack a comprehensive approach in the political framework to respond to the challenges posed by the ageing of their populations. While this conclusion is not completely wrong, it needs careful attention because of questions such as those raised in this article: what does it mean to have a comprehensive approach to population ageing in countries where the increase in the number of elderly people, here referred to as geron-togrowth, is neutralised by the rejuvenation of the population in general? Why would people be concerned to anticipate a problem they are not yet living through or feeling? Without questioning the potential of the Global AgeWatch Index, this article argues that its explanatory scope could be substantially improved, but for this an analytical and methodological framework really more comprehensive is needed. A framework that articulates better the concept of capacities with crucial structuring concepts of population dynamics, notably putting into context the various stages of the world demographic transition, in which the world's elderly population is involved.

These effects are observed for exchange-listed firms and for firms from countries with weak investor protection. We conclude that although cross-listed firms are still valued at a significant premium over non-cross-listed firms, the rule decreased the value of commitment to the U.S. regulatory system.","[Ghosh, Chinmoy] Univ Connecticut, Sch Business, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [He, Fan] Cent Connecticut State Univ, Sch Business, New Britain, CT USA",University of Connecticut; Connecticut State University System; Central Connecticut State University,"Ghosh, C (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Sch Business, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",chinmoy.ghosh@business.uconn.edu; fan.he@ccsu.edu,"ghosh, chinmoy/AAE-2935-2022",,,,,,56,5,7,0,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

Differences in the timing of the introduction of provincial policies provide variation in treatment across provinces, and variation within provinces comes from differences across students in the number of years of schooling during which junk food was banned. Using data from cycles of the Canadian Community Health Survey, I find that each year of a junk food ban is associated with a decline of about 0.05 body mass index. Students exposed to five or more years of a junk food ban had lower body mass index equivalent to a decrease of about two pounds for an individual who is five feet, six inches tall.","[Leonard, Philip S.

Specifically, we use the panel cointegration technique by Pedroni (1999, 2004); the DOLS approach by Kao and Chiang (1999); the FMOLS; the PMG technique of Pesaran et al. (1999) and the panel VECM causality approach. The panel cointegration test shows the existence of cointegration among our dataset. The Granger causality test demonstrates that causality runs from globalization to institutions, and institutions in turn Granger cause financial development specifically in the banking sector in the BRICS and MINT blocs. Globalization is further found to have a causal impact on the stock market, although bypassing the institutions channel. For the PMG, DOLS and FMOLS results, there is evidence of a positive long run relationship among globalization, institutions and financial development.

However, it decreases with increase in balanced fund flows suggesting rational investment behaviour of balanced mutual funds. In addition, equity funds follow the market volatility positively, suggesting positive feedback trading (momentum) behaviour. On the other hand, balanced funds follow market volatility negatively and exhibit negative feedback trading behaviour (contrarian behaviour).

Donor agencies have interests, as does any political actor, and bureaucratic politics theory states that any bureaucracy has a dual interest, consisting of delivering on its formal mandate as well as informally increasing its power by maximizing budgets, staff, and fields for political responsibility. This study aims to conceptualize the formal and informal interests of bilateral foreign donor bureaucracies in allocating aid, using Bangladesh forest development aid by USAID, GIZ, and the EU as a case study. Quantitative analysis of documents on actual spending in the context of forest development projects and qualitative analysis from detailed interviews with development aid experts are employed. Important informal interests of donor agencies were observed as follows: (1) drawing on consultants as well as products and services from the donor's country; (2) expanding favorable markets for the donor's economy; (3) increasing the donor's geopolitical as well as policy influence in recipient countries; (4) obtaining information that is independent from the recipient government; and (5) shaping good governance as a prerequisite for investment from donor countries. Of the three donor organizations, USAID was found to have allocated extensive aid to two activities consultancy, and collaboration and networking that advance USAID's informal economic and political interests. GIZ allocated major aid to recipient developmental interventions; it also advanced its informal economic and political interests (albeit to a smaller extent). The EU allocated the largest amount of aid to developmental interventions, though its informal economic and political interests were also served, even if only to a limited extent. This study concludes with key points regarding informal interests of donor bureaucracies as well as on future research fields. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Avoiding cultural attributions upon which many international comparisons of entrepreneurship are truncated, we apply strategic behavior theory to uncover a rational-choice basis for this phenomenon. We identify individual and organizational players, consider their strategies, and compare equilibria in the institutional context of Japan and the US. We pay close attention to how competition in Japanese educational, labor, and marriage markets differs from such competition in the US to identify factors which raise the career attraction of big firms and thereby fuel adverse selection that hurts ventures. Our conclusions challenge the stereotype that the founders and employees of Silicon Valley ventures are heroic risk-takers whereas the Japanese are much more risk-averse. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We study the risk-return tradeoff in connection with a bank's capital structure, and identify several new significant market factors that drive the level of equity capital in banks. During normal growth periods, bank leverage is negatively related to a level of competition and loan portfolio diversification, while high bank leverage is associated with low past liquidity. During recessions and expansions, the roles of those factors change following distortions in risk-return tradeoff. In distress, when banks approach regulatory capital requirements, market determinants of book leverage lose their significance; however, leverage does not decrease until a bank is within 1% of the minimal capital threshold.

We propose that this unique setting, which has not been studied before, elicits perception of reciprocity that prompts a unique bias in preferences. We found that decision-makers are less patient (more discounting), and more risk averse for losses than gains, with other peoples' money, especially when their choices for others are more uncertain. Those results were derived by exploiting a computational modeling framework that has been shown to account for the underlying psychological and neural decision processes.

Overall, taxpayers are unresponsive to small changes in local income tax rates.","[Yang, Lang (Kate)] George Washington Univ, Trachtenberg Sch Publ Policy & Publ Adm, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Heim, Bradley T.] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN USA",George Washington University; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Yang, L (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Trachtenberg Sch Publ Policy & Publ Adm, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",katelangyang@gmail.com; heimb@indiana.edu,,"Yang, Lang (Kate)/0000-0003-2780-6242",,,,,30,0,0,1,4,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

Yet, conventional assumptions shared by many integrated assessment models such as DICE lead to the counterintuitive result that higher concern about climate change risks does not lead to stronger near-term abatement efforts. This paper examines whether this result still holds in a refined DICE model that employs the Epstein-Zin utility specification and that is fully coupled with a dynamic tipping point model describing the evolution of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation (THC). Risk is captured by the possibility of a future collapse of the circulation and it is nourished by fat-tailed uncertainty about climate sensitivity. This uncertainty is assumed to resolve in the middle of the second half of this century and the near-term abatement efforts, which are undertaken before that point of time, can be adjusted afterwards. These modelling choices allow posing the question of whether aversion to this specific tipping point risk has a significant effect on near-term policy efforts. The simulations, however, provide evidence that it has little effect. For the more likely climate sensitivity values, a collapse of the circulation would occur in the more distant future. In this case, acting after learning can prevent the catastrophe, implying the remarkable insensitivity of the near-term policy to risk aversion. For the rather unlikely and high climate sensitivity values, the expected damage costs are not great enough to justify taking very costly measures to safeguard the THC. Our simulations also provide some indication that risk aversion might have some effect on near-term policy, if inertia limiting the speed of decarbonisation is accounted for. As it is highly uncertain how restrictive this kind of inertia will be, future research might investigate the effects of risk aversion if additional uncertainty about inertia is considered.","[Belaia, Mariia; Funke, Michael] Univ Hamburg, Dept Econ, Von Melle Pk 5, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Glanemann, Nicole] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Telegraphenberg A 31,POB 60 12 03, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Belaia, Mariia] Int Max Planck Res Sch Earth Syst Modelling, Hamburg, Germany; [Funke, Michael] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Glanemann, Nicole] WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Vallendar, Germany",University of Hamburg; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Max Planck Society; Ifo Institut; WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management,"Belaia, M (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Dept Econ, Von Melle Pk 5, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.;Belaia, M (通讯作者)，Int Max Planck Res Sch Earth Syst Modelling, Hamburg, Germany.",mariia.belaia@wiso.uni-hamburg.de; michael.funke@uni-hamburg.de; nicole.glanemann@pik-potsdam.de,,"Belaia, Mariia/0000-0003-2074-8799",German Science Foundation through Cluster of Excellence 'Integrated Climate System Analysis and Prediction' (CliSAP) of the University of Hamburg,German Science Foundation through Cluster of Excellence 'Integrated Climate System Analysis and Prediction' (CliSAP) of the University of Hamburg,"We would like to thank the anonymous referee for constructive comments that helped improve the contents of this paper.

Processes of urban governance addressing climate change reconfigure the politics of climate change. Practitioners and scholars may be interested in the transformation of urban governance that follows global advances in climate change and urban policy. They may specifically be interested in how the urban governance of climate change is achieved and with what consequences for international development. This review evaluates the deep changes in urban governance that follow attempts to address climate change and how, in turn, attempts to govern climate change in urban areas reconfigure discourses informing the politics of climate change. The review shows that efforts to institutionalize climate change governance in urban areas reflect the conditions of specific contexts; that cities and sub-national entities have gained traction in international climate policy through heterogeneous forms of network governance; that governing climate change in urban areas relates to the production and deployment of new climate rationalities, or governmentalities; and that governing experiences in cities are reconfiguring discourses of climate change governance toward an increasing emphasis on experimentation as a means to deal with the open ended processes of governing urban areas.

But does this product mix also predict income inequality? Here we combine methods from econometrics, network science, and economic complexity to show that countries exporting complex products-as measured by the Economic Complexity Index-have lower levels of income inequality than countries exporting simpler products. Using multivariate regression analysis, we show that economic complexity is a significant and negative predictor of income inequality and that this relationship is robust to controlling for aggregate measures of income, institutions, export concentration, and human capital. Moreover, we introduce a measure that associates a product to a level of income inequality equal to the average GINI of the countries exporting that product (weighted by the share the product represents in that country's export basket). We use this measure together with the network of related products-or product space-to illustrate how the development of new products is associated with changes in income inequality. These findings show that economic complexity captures information about an economy's level of development that is relevant to the ways an economy generates and distributes its income. Moreover, these findings suggest that a country's productive structure may limit its range of income inequality. Finally, we make our results available through an online resource that allows for its users to visualize the structural transformation of over 150 countries and their associated changes in income inequality during 1963-2008.

Particularly, employing the instrumental variables regression approach of Boguth Carlson, Fisher and Simutin (2011) to estimate the conditional Fama-French model can successfully explain returns on COMBO portfolios in North America, Europe, Japan, and the global market. Furthermore, instrumenting the global Fama-French model with lagged component betas can reduce the unconditional AMP's 50-50 COMBO alpha by 11-72%, pointing to the efficacy of this instrumental variable in international markets.

Using a rich sub-national dataset for Russia covering 1995-2009, we estimate the impacts of changes in climatic conditions through short-term variation and medium-term changes in average regional temperatures and precipitation. We show a strong and robust negative (but non-linear) relation between regional budget expenditures and population-weighted temperature. The results indicate that an increase in temperature results in a decrease in public expenditures and that the magnitude of this effect diminishes the warmer the region. Further, our results suggest that the benefits from warming accumulate and that adaptation measures could help leverage those benefits. The estimated decreases in regional government expenditure are, however, quite small. In mild warming scenarios, according to our estimates Russia saves roughly USD 3-4 billion in regional government expenditures between 2000 and the 2020s without undertaking adaptation measures, depending on the scenario. It should be noted that our results are estimated for a scenario of mild temperature increase (1-2 C). Larger temperature increases are likely to have dramatic consequences e.g. from loss of permafrost and methane release that are impossible to predict with available historical data.","[Leppanen, Simo; Kosonen, Riitta] Aalto Univ, Ctr Markets Transit CEMAT, Sch Business, Lapuankatu 2, Helsinki 00100, Finland; [Solanko, Laura] Bank Finland, Bank Finland Inst Econ Transit BOFIT, POB 160, Helsinki 00101, Finland",Aalto University; Bank of Finland,"Leppänen, S (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Ctr Markets Transit CEMAT, Sch Business, Lapuankatu 2, Helsinki 00100, Finland.",simo.leppanen@aalto.fi; laura.solanko@bof.fi; riitta.kosonen@aalto.fi,,,Academy of Finland [255635]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [255635] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Research Council of Finland),"We thank Mika Kortelainen, Tuukka Saarimaa, Matti Liski, Francois Libois, Vincenzo Verardi and Veli-Pekka Tynkkynen for valuable comments.

Financial openness may affect GDP growth in and of itself, and it may also influence concentration in banking and thus the impact of bank-specific shocks for the aggregate economy. To test these relationships, we use different measures of de jure and de facto financial openness in a panel dataset for 79 countries and the years 1996-2009.

As such, despite its simplicity, the model is able to robustly reproduce an ensemble of empirical stylized facts, including ample heterogeneity in productivity distributions, persistent market turbulence, and fat-tailed distribution of growth rates.","[Dosi, Giovanni; Virgillito, Maria Enrica] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, Piazza Martiri Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy; [Pereira, Marcelo C.] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Econ, BR-13083857 Sao Paulo, Brazil",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; Universidade Estadual de Campinas,"Dosi, G (通讯作者)，Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, Piazza Martiri Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy.",gdosi@sssup.it; marcelocpereira@uol.com.br; m.virgillito@sssup.it,"VIRGILLITO, Maria Enrica/ABB-8288-2020; Pereira, Marcelo/F-2827-2015","VIRGILLITO, Maria Enrica/0000-0001-5958-9647; Pereira, Marcelo/0000-0002-8069-2734",European Union [649186-ISIGrowth]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2015/09760-3]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [15/09760-3] Funding Source: FAPESP,European Union(European Union (EU)); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa e Inovacao do Estado de Santa Catarina (FAPESC)),"We gratefully acknowledge the support by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No. 649186-ISIGrowth, and by Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP), process No. 2015/09760-3.",,65,38,39,0,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

If poor profit or a liability triggers insolvency, then the firm forgoes a profitable future. The behavioral implications of this survival motive vary across firms. Firms for whom the principal insolvency risk is liability-related now choose precaution above the level chosen by the solvent firm. For firms whose primary insolvency risk is profit-related, the survival motive reinforces incentives for care below the solvent benchmark arising from the familiar judgment-proof effect. We also characterize how insolvency risks affect incentives to conceal adverse events linked to these choices, such as an accident or a regulatory violation. An understanding of these incentives is particularly important during recessionary periods when firms struggle to survive the downturn.","[Evans, Mary F.] Claremont Mckenna Coll, Robert Day Sch Econ & Finance, 500 E Ninth St, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [Gilpatric, Scott M.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Econ, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Gilpatric, Scott M.] Univ Tennessee, Ctr Corp Governance, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",Claremont Colleges; Claremont McKenna College; Claremont Graduate School; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Evans, MF (通讯作者)，Claremont Mckenna Coll, Robert Day Sch Econ & Finance, 500 E Ninth St, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",mevans@cmc.edu; sgilpatr@utk.edu,,,"U.S. Environmental Protection Agency through STAR Grant [R832847]; EPA [909151, R832847] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",U.S. Environmental Protection Agency through STAR Grant; EPA(United States Environmental Protection Agency),"An early version of this paper was presented at an Association of Environmental and Resource Economists (AERE) session at the 2009 ASSA Meetings in San Francisco; we thank Kathy Segerson, our discussant at this session, for her comments.

However, existing literature over-relies upon theoretical arguments rather than empirical evidence, and until now the emphasis has been on potential positive linkages. We address these weaknesses by empirically examining the role of microfinance in adaptation, drawing from household-level quantitative and qualitative data gathered from Satkhira District, Southwest Bangladesh. We find evidence that microfinance facilitates coping by reducing sensitivity to environmental and climate hazards. Credit is especially important because its availability is uncorrelated with the occurrence of flooding, unlike many other traditional coping responses. We also find evidence that microfinance facilitates adaptation by helping households to overcome financial barriers of adopting adaptation options which reduce exposure or sensitivity. However, credit limits are likely to restrict its role to incremental adaptations, which may not meaningfully reduce vulnerability. Transformational adaptations at times required access to bank credit which the poorest cannot access. This restricts their ability to effectively adapt and are penalized financially by having to obtain loans to cope. We also find evidence that microfinance can lead to maladaptation when used in non-profit generating activities as income streams are not produced to help repay associated costs. Almost a fifth of all loans were obtained for repaying existing loans. Thus microfinance may undermine longer term adaptive capacity. (C) 2016 The Authors.

We interpret the IT industry as made up of four components: computer hardware, computer software, semiconductors, and key computer customers. We pose two fundamental questions. First, did counties where the IT industry clustered in 1974 grow at a faster rate between 1974 and 1980? Second, did each individual component of the IT industry grow faster between 1974 and 1980 in counties where the other components clustered in 1974? We find that counties in which the IT industry clustered early on grew faster than those in which it did not, after controlling for a variety of county-specific characteristics and after addressing the potentially endogenous nature of the IT industry's location. We also find that each individual component of the IT industry grew faster in regions in which the other components clustered. We interpret these findings as consistent with the tenets of the spillover theory of entrepreneurship.","[Garcia-Vicente, Florencia] Belly Chicago, 600 West Chicago Ave, Chicago, IL 60654 USA; [Garcia-Swartz, Daniel] Charles River Associates Inc, One South Wacker Dr,Suite 3400, Chicago, IL 60606 USA; [Campbell-Kelly, Martin] Univ Warwick, Dept Comp Sci, Coventry, W Midlands, England",Charles River Associates; University of Warwick,"Garcia-Swartz, D (通讯作者)，Charles River Associates Inc, One South Wacker Dr,Suite 3400, Chicago, IL 60606 USA.",Flori@Bellycard.com; DGarcia-Swartz@crai.com; M.Campbell-Kelly@warwick.ac.uk,,,,,,,69,5,5,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The share of Allais-type behavior is indeed high and related to indicators of lacking ability, such as poor education, unemployment, and little financial sophistication. Based on prospective reference theory, we extend these characteristics by biased processing of probabilistic information. Finally, we reveal that Allais-type behavior is linked to risk-related characteristics, such as risk tolerance and optimism.

Evidence from Tax-Motivated Mutual Fund Flows,REVIEW OF FINANCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PERFORMANCE; INDUSTRY; DEMAND; ADVICE,"Rationality would suggest that advice-seeking investors receive benefits from costly financial advice. However, evidence documenting these benefits for US investors has so far been lacking. This article is the first to document that US mutual fund investors indeed receive one of the many previously hypothesized benefits associated with financial advice. The documented benefit comes from valuable tax-management advice that helps investors avoid taxable fund distributions and becomes even more valuable when investors face distributions that can cause large and hard-to-predict tax liabilities. Additional evidence suggests that financial advice helps with other aspects of tax management such as tax-loss selling.","[Cici, Gjergji; Kempf, Alexander; Sorhage, Christoph] Ctr Financial Res Cologne CFR, Cologne, Germany; [Cici, Gjergji; Kempf, Alexander; Sorhage, Christoph] Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne; University of Cologne,"Cici, G (通讯作者)，Ctr Financial Res Cologne CFR, Cologne, Germany.",,"Kempf, Alexander/M-4153-2015","Kempf, Alexander/0000-0002-7455-4044",,,,,31,11,13,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

In particular, we study the impact of providing better houses in situ to slum dwellers in El Salvador, Mexico and Uruguay. We experimentally evaluate the impact of a housing project run by the NGO TECHO (roof), which provides basic pre-fabricated houses to members of extremely poor population groups in Latin America. The main objective of the program is to improve household well-being. Our findings show that better houses have a positive effect on overall housing conditions and general well-being: the members of treated households are happier with their quality of life. In two countries, we also document improvements in children's health; in El Salvador, slum dwellers who have received the TECHO houses also feel that they are safer. We do not find this result, however, in the other two experimental samples. There are no other noticeable robust effects in relation to the possession of durable goods or labor outcomes. Our results are robust in terms of both their internal and external validity because they are derived from similar experiments in three different Latin American countries.

Hierarchical linear regression and ANOVA models were used to examine the patterns of similarities and differences among regions according to the family financial socialization model. Results suggest that financial achievement attitudes, financial power attitudes, and responsible spending behaviors differ across locations. Results also revealed that greater financial achievement attitudes and power attitudes were associated with fewer responsible spending behaviors. Results did not indicate that geographic location moderated the link between financial achievement attitudes or power attitudes and spending behaviors.

Based on quarterly EV sales and charging station deployment in 353 metro areas from 2011 to 2013, our empirical analysis finds indirect network effects on both sides of the market, with those on the EV demand side being stronger. The federal income tax credit of up to $7,500 for EV buyers contributed to about 40% of EV sales during 2011-13, with feedback loops explaining 40% of that increase.

In constructing the monetary policy instrument, we used both conventional and unconventional measures, the latter being the asset purchases ratio in the central banks' balance sheets. In the pre-crisis subperiod, the bank-lending channel operated effectively in response to changes in central banks' rates. In the post-crisis sub-period, however, this traditional mechanism was distorted. The effect of unconventional measures on the banks' behavior, however, was statistically significant. Our results suggest that an increase in asset purchases by central banks reduced the financial institutions' balance sheet dependence to extend financing. Consequently, we infer that the implementation of unconventional monetary policy measures was effective in stimulating credit growth in the post-crisis sub-period. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

On the other hand, the governance environment does not impact large innovative and non-innovative firm performance differently. Latin America and the Caribbean is a region with many entrepreneurs but few innovators. The region also has a larger proportion of smaller firms compared to other regions.

We show that an already marginalized group-female-headed households in South Africa-is differentially affected by relatively modest levels of variation in rainfall, which households experience on a year-to-year basis. Data from three waves of the National Income Dynamics Survey in South Africa allow us to follow incomes of 4,162 households from 2006 to 2012. By observing how household income is affected by variation in rainfall relative to what is normally experienced during the rainy season in each district, our study employs a series of naturally occurring experiments that allow us to identify causal effects. We find that households where a single head can be identified based on residency or work status are more vulnerable to climate variability than households headed by two adults. Single male-headed households are more vulnerable because of lower initial earnings and, to a lesser extent, other household characteristics that contribute to economic disadvantages. However, this can only explain some of the differential vulnerability of female-headed households. This suggests that there are traits specific to female-headed households, such as limited access to protective social networks or other coping strategies, which makes this an important dimension of marginalization to consider for further research and policy in South Africa and other national contexts. Households headed by widows, never-married women, and women with a non-resident spouse (e.g., left-behind migrant households) are particularly vulnerable. We find vulnerable households only in districts where rainfall has a large effect on agricultural yields, and female-headed households remain vulnerable when accounting for dynamic impacts of rainfall on income.

Furthermore obtained results were compared in such a way as to analyse particularly the reviews of hotels which have implemented TQM and have the ISO 9001 certificates with reviews from hotels which have not implemented TQM and do not have the ISO 9001 certificates. The conducted analysis included 55 hotels in Serbia belonging to the 4- and 5-star categories, i.e. 1308 guests who have stayed in them. The results show that between the observed groups of guests there are fewer differences in expectations than in perception, and that generally speaking guests who have stayed in the hotels that have implemented TQM are more satisfied. The biggest difference concerning the guest satisfaction with the quality of service in the observed hotels is noticeable in relation to the employees and the value-for-money.","[Knezevic, Miroslav; Cerovic, Slobodan; Dzamic, Vladimir; Radojevic, Tijana] Singidunum Univ, Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management, Belgrade, Serbia",,"Knezevic, M (通讯作者)，Singidunum Univ, Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management, Belgrade, Serbia.",mknezevic@singidunum.ac.rs,"Radojevic, Tijana/ABC-6367-2020; Cerovic, Slobodan/GXF-9147-2022","Cerovic, Slobodan/0000-0002-4646-2476; Radojevic, Tijana/0000-0001-5324-2482; Knezevic, Miroslav/0000-0002-5586-7213",,,,,67,3,4,0,33,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2017,19.0,44,,,,,124,143,,,,,,20,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EN1CB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000395746900009,0

However, if people were aware of their inability to make such calculations they should demand services to ameliorate the consequences of such deficiencies. In a laboratory experiment, we find that people exhibit substantial exponential-growth bias but, more importantly, that they are overconfident in their ability to answer questions that involve exponential growth. They also exhibit overconfidence in their ability to use a spreadsheet to answer these questions. This evidence explains why a market solution to exponential growth bias has not been forthcoming.

In particular, a lack of empowerment and job satisfaction means that the turnover of Pakistani employees in manufacturing firms remains high. This study investigates the mediating impact of job satisfaction on the relationship between empowerment and turnover intention. A purposive sample of 315 participants from the agricultural manufacturing industry in the region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, Pakistan, was selected for the study, and a cross-sectional survey was conducted. A self-administrated survey questionnaire was distributed, and participants were asked to respond on a five-point Likert scale to questions regarding empowerment, job satisfaction, and turnover intention. SEM/SPSS were employed to analyze the data. Furthermore, a statistical analysis was conducted to test the mediating effects of job satisfaction on the relationship between empowerment and turnover intention. For the full mediating impact of job satisfaction on the relationship between empowerment and turnover intention, we obtained statistically significant results. Our study also determined a significant negative direct relationship between empowerment and turnover intention. Thus, job satisfaction not only significantly influences turnover intention, but also mediates the relationship between empowerment and turnover intention. The findings of this study contribute to the literature on turnover intention in the agricultural manufacturing industry by increasing understanding of the impact of job satisfaction and empowerment on turnover intention among manufacturing employees. This research provides important policy insights for managers in manufacturing industries seeking to increase empowerment and job satisfaction among their employees to reduce turnover intention.","[Ali, Amjad; Huang JianPing; Ali, Zulfiqar; Li ZhongBin] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Sch Management, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China",Fujian Agriculture & Forestry University,"Li, ZB (通讯作者)，Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Sch Management, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China.",amjad_jamy81@yahoo.com; nine_01@126.com; zulfiqar3344@yahoo.com; lzb15592@yahoo.com,"Huang, Jianping/KCY-8800-2024",,,,,,18,1,1,1,7,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-435-4,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,49.0,,,,,,42,46,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6OH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426885700010,0

Stock prices should not be accurately predicted by looking at the historical prices. Stock prices could be described by statistical process called random walk, i.e. single day's deviations from the central value are random and unpredictable. The aim of this research is to test the effectiveness of Monte Carlo simulation model and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model (ARIMA) in predicting stock prices. Selected methods use different input data in predicting stock prices, including different time horizons; ARIMA model uses time series data to predict future prices, while Monte Carlo simulation uses random walk component. We compare daily predictions of stock prices estimated by both methods for five companies from Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index. Predictions have been generated for one month period, from 10th March 2016 until 10th April 2016. For the purpose of evaluation of prediction models we use Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE), Mean Square Error (MSE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) methods. We came to the conclusion that there is a slight advantage in accuracy of predictions of ARIMA model for shorter periods (5 days), while Monte Carlo simulation has undoubted advantage for longer periods (21 days). Also, we noticed linkages between single stock's predictions for periods of 5, 10 and 15 days for both models. Our results show that in shorter periods stock prices have elements of predictability, what questions the level of efficiency of the world leading stock exchange. In longer periods (21 days) results indicate market efficiency, i.e. model with random walk component (Monte Carlo simulation) has advantage compared to the model based on historical prices (ARIMA).","[Arnaut-Berilo, Almira; Zaimovic, Azra] Univ Sarajevo, Sarajevo Sch Econ & Business, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Sarajevo,"Arnaut-Berilo, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sarajevo, Sarajevo Sch Econ & Business, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg.",almira.arnaut@efsa.unsa.ba; azra.zaimovic@efsa.unsa.ba; nedzmija_t@hotmail.com,"Arnaut-Berilo, Almira/AEY-8165-2022; Zaimovic, Azra/N-6276-2019","Arnaut-Berilo, Almira/0000-0002-3285-9122; Zaimovic, Azra/0000-0002-3956-4626",,,,,23,0,0,0,5,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2017,,,,,,,946,963,,,,,,18,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7PJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455302900060,0

The target is to define main parameters of sustainable supply of funding of external capital providers and to test the relationships among determinants of external solvency, foreign sources of funding the economy and banking sector and credit aggregates in the Czech Republic using unrestricted ARDL ECM model. The results show growing inflow of debt funding motivated by export led growth, the Czech FDI investments and lack of euro liquidity due to CNB foreign exchange interventions. The debt provided by foreign parent companies could overcome a constraint of home banking sector's credit supply. Growing export causes investments to production capacity financed by equity of foreign holders. The cost of negative NFA is driven by profitability of exporters which is positively correlated with GDP growth.

One important stream in the contemporary literature puts the focus on the concept of capital, namely on its human and social components. In addition, several schoolars have been claiming that HRM systems and the respective HR practices play a critical role in the process of building employees' capital - human and social. Despite the advancements achieved so far, it is still open to further exploration the organizational mechanisms connecting HR practices to organizational performance through HC and SC. This paper draws on the aforementioned perspectives to explore potential mediation mechanisms between these two sources of intellectual capital and a set of so called high performance HR practices. We analyzed survey data of 225 employees from 75 organizational units of different economic sectors. The theoretical research model and hypotheses were tested using structured equation modeling (SEM). Our findings support the mediation role of HC and SC on the effects of HR practices on perceived organizational performance, and their distinctive influence on different organizational performance criteria. Moreover, the study provides additional evidence on the mechanisms linking HRM and organizational performance, which is useful to consolidate and expand our understanding of the black box perspective.","[Botelho, Carlos] Lisbon Univ, ISCSP, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa,"Botelho, C (通讯作者)，Lisbon Univ, ISCSP, Lisbon, Portugal.",cbotelho@iscsp.ulisboa.pt,,,,,,,46,2,2,0,7,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-911218-31-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2017,,,,,,,26,33,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI0KF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404891000004,0

In general, the inspection programs consist of two components: evaluation of accounting firms' quality control systems and review of selected audit engagements. This study examines whether quality control system deficiencies and audit engagement deficiencies identified in the inspections reflect the audit quality of accounting firms using the data from Korean regulator inspections. We find that both quality control system deficiencies and audit engagement deficiencies reflect the audit quality of the accounting firms under inspection. Our findings also suggest that quality control system deficiencies discern the audit quality of accounting firms better than audit engagement deficiencies. Our results are robust across audit quality measures and auditor size.

The offered mathematical model allows one to provide optimization of decisions in strategic management of investments. The technique of using several sources of financing as part of an investment portfolio is described. Various combinations of sources of financing for different terms of crediting are considered. There are different methods of making decisions on investment projects, based on the analysis of various criteria, which fall into two broad categories: conventional (not discounting) and discounting. The main function of the funds invested in the project is the generation of such cash flows which allow predicting the investment attractiveness of the project and efficiency. The author is interested in the dynamics of the cash flow generation process, which is ensured by the use of discounting. Investment projects have different qualitative and quantitative characteristics: financial, technological, organizational, temporary, etc. All of them are important, but financial assessments of investment policy are crucial in many cases. The author examines the criteria that are crucial for characterizing the investment process. The use of economic and mathematical models makes it possible to take into account various requirements, conditions, and to obtain variants of investment project scenarios. These criteria characterize the project's own effectiveness in generating cash flows, which is large compared to other weight criteria in proving project feasibility.","[Chernyatieva, R.

As a consequence, social media content about firms may have an impact on stock prices (Hachman [2011]). Various studies utilize social media content to forecast stock market-related factors such as returns, volatility, or trading volume. The objective of this article is to investigate whether a bidirectional intraday relationship between stock returns and volatility and tweets exists. The study analyzed 150,180 minute-by-minute stock price and tweet data for the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average over a random 13-day interval from June 2 to June 18, 2014 using a BEKK-MVGARCH methodology. Findings indicate that 87% of stock returns are influenced by lagged innovations of the tweets data, but there is little evidence to support that the direction is reciprocal, with only 7% of tweets being influenced by lagged innovations of the stock returns. Results further show that the lagged innovations from 40 percent of stock returns affect the current conditional volatility of the tweets, while 73 percent of tweets affect the current conditional volatility of stock returns. Moreover, there is strong evidence to suggest that the volatility originating from the returns to the tweets persists for 33 percent of stocks; the volatility originating from the tweets to the returns persists for 73 percent of stocks. Last, 53 percent of stocks exhibit both immediate and persistent impacts from returns to tweets, while 90 percent of stocks exhibit both immediate and persistent impacts from tweets to returns. These results may help traders achieve superior returns by buying and selling individual stocks or options. Also, asset and mutual fund managers may benefit by developing a social media strategy.","[de Jong, Pieter; Elfayoumy, Sherif; Schnusenberg, Oliver] Univ North Florida, Jacksonville, FL USA",State University System of Florida; University of North Florida,"de Jong, P (通讯作者)，Univ North Florida, Coggin Coll Business Accounting & Finance, 1 UNF Dr, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA.",p.dejong@unf.edu,,,,,,,35,14,17,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

This is why the possibility of behavior measurement based on a propensity theory is proposed. These problems are connected not only with behavioral aspects of decision making but also with the neuroeconomics. In the chapter the main features of propensity theories are discussed. A definition of propensity as well as methods useful in measuring propensities are presented. The prepared questionnaire is used to measure and analyze such economic propensities as the propensity to consume, save, invest and money storing. These propensities are tested in three ways, as declared (by respondents) propensities, as observed propensities and also as propensities deduced from preferred choices.

Low level of competitive development of high-tech industrial enterprises complicates the use of innovative ways of economic development and implementation of technological breakthrough. Low investment demand, associated with low investment attractiveness and with low domestic consumption the same negative impact on the development of high-tech industrial enterprises. Deterrent effect of industrial enterprises has problems of institutional and infrastructural problems. High level of import dependence has also had a negative effect on the situation. All of the above problems development of high-tech industrial enterprises are observed in terms of becoming world processes new industrialization, the purpose of which is to facilitate the transition to the new technological ways and build a competitive economy. So by 2020, the European Commission plans to bring: up to 20% of the industry; the share of gross fixed capital formation in GDP up to 23%; investment in equipment from the current 6-7% of GDP to 9% in the year 2020.

The article shows the dependence of property tax rates and the number of small enterprises which will be forced to go out of business or to go into a shadow economy. It was found that the maximum property tax rate of 2 % proposed by the Government of Irkutsk oblast will have negative effects on the regional economy, increase the number of the unemployed, decrease investment attractiveness and yield a reverse effect. Tax revenues of the regional budget will decrease rather than increase. If the tax rate is 0,2%, tax effects will be less destructive, but can also have negative impacts. Negative effects of the property tax depend on the floor area of properties. If the size is more than 5000 m(2), there will be no negative effects.

The persistence of sisal plantations amidst failed attempts at land redistribution is explored by drawing on primary research in villages in the vicinity of three privatized sisal estates. I situate collective land claims in the wider politics of African socialism (ujamaa), to then explain their gradual demise throughout the 1990s as a consequence of neoliberal policies such as privatization and liberalization. Throughout the 2000s, the subsequent allocation of contested lands to commercial sisal contract farmers has fuelled further land disputes. An account of land claims over time, coupled with a class analysis of sisal contract farming, underlines the continuing relevance of the land question in areas of historical land dispossession.","[Greco, Elisa] Univ Manchester, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Greco, E (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",elisa.greco@manchester.ac.uk,,"Greco, Elisa/0000-0002-7580-3444",COSTECH Tanzania,COSTECH Tanzania,"I thank COSTECH Tanzania for authorizing my doctoral research and my home university Orientale (Naples, Italy) for funding it.

A Stakeholder Analysis,GERMAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS,,,German,Article,,,,,,animal welfare measures; animal welfare program; importance; practicability; stakeholders; quantitative survey,PIG FARMERS; CITIZENS; BROILER; SCIENCE; VETERINARIANS; WILLINGNESS; ATTITUDES; SYSTEMS; LEVEL,"In response to the growing number of citizens who express concerns about farm animal welfare in intensive, modern livestock farming, a number of programs that sell meat and other food products of animal origin from more animal friendly production systems (so called animal welfare programs) have emerged on the market in recent years. To successfully establish an animal welfare program in the market, the acceptance of several stakeholders along the supply chains of food products of animal origin is needed. For this reason, based on three quantitative empirical studies, this study investigates the perceived importance and practicability of 13 often discussed animal welfare measures from farmers', veterinarians' and consumers' point of view. The results show that the evaluations of the animal welfare measures surveyed differ widely between the stakeholder groups. However, the results also give evidence that it is not impossible to develop an animal welfare program which meets the common concerns of consumers regarding animal welfare and at the same time is accepted by the experts directly involved in livestock production. For some animal welfare measures, there is still research demand to improve the practicability in conventional livestock farming. This is particularly urgent for the provision of outdoor access and the renouncement of curative interventions such as tail docking or teeth clipping as consumers rate these animal welfare measures as important for the wellbeing of animals while, at the same time, conventional farmers rate their practicability rather low. From the results, first implications for the conception of animal welfare programs can be derived. Thus, our study can help to establish a broader market segment for products from more animal friendly production system. In this way the more and more critical discourse between the broader public and the agricultural sector can be mitigated.","[Heise, Heinke; Theuvsen, Ludwig] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Heise, H (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ Gottingen, Dept Agrarokon & Rurale Entwicklung, Lehrstuhl Betriebswirtschaftslehre Agribusiness, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",hheise@gwdg.de,,,,,,,76,5,5,2,18,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

We find that while deferred tax liabilities are positively associated with cost of debt, deferred tax assets are not. This evidence may reflect the greater probability of tax obligations being realized compared to tax benefits. Further, we analyze the relationship between cost of debt and the various components of deferred taxes. We find that net deferred taxes caused by temporary differences are negatively related to cost of debt. On the other hand, net deferred taxes from net operating losses are positively related to cost of debt. Additionally, we find that valuation allowances are less positively related to cost of debt when firms are suspected of seeking to avoid losses or decreases in earnings. These results suggest that debt investors in the Japanese debt market evaluate the various components of deferred taxes differently.","[Inamura, Yumi] Niigata Univ, Fac Econ, Niigata, Japan; [Okuda, Shin'ya] Nagoya City Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan",Niigata University; Nagoya City University,"Okuda, S (通讯作者)，Nagoya City Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.",s-okuda@econ.nagoya-cu.ac.jp,,,"Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, Culture and Technology, Japan [24730384, 26380630]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26780249, 26380630, 24730384] Funding Source: KAKEN","Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, Culture and Technology, Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by the Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) [24730384], 2014-2016 (for Inamura) and the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) [26380630], 2014-2017 (for Okuda) provided by the Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, Culture and Technology, Japan.",,26,1,2,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

In the study, we have used a range of data on the crime theft from hotel and motel rooms and camping committed in the period 2012-2016 in eight towns and seaside resorts. The statistical method used is the correspondence factor analysis, and data processing, indicator significance testing and graphical representations were performed using the SPSS statistical analysis software. This information can be used both by institutions of the Romanian state (i.e. the police and the gendarmerie), which are legally enabled to intervene in fighting crime by improving their activity, developing security strategies focused on safety and protecting tourists and tourist destinations, as well as individuals (by tourists, in particular), which should have a cautious and responsible behavior to avoid becoming victims of criminals.","[Juganaru, Ion Danut; Juganaru, Mariana; Aivaz, Kamer-Ainur] Ovidius Univ Constanta, Constanta, Romania",Ovidius University,"Juganaru, M (通讯作者)，Ovidius Univ Constanta, Constanta, Romania.",mjuganaru@univ-ovidius.ro; kamer_aivaz@yahoo.com,"Juganaru, Ion Danut/AAC-2632-2021",,,,,,15,0,0,0,1,FILODIRITTO PUBLISHER,BOLOGNA,"INFOROMATICA SRL, VIA CASTIGLIONE, 81, BOLOGNA, 40124, ITALY",,,978-88-95922-97-3,,,,2017,,,,,,,72,80,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6KN,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426793600010,0

An investigation involves 85 regions of the Russian Federation. A data source is the web site Statistics of Russia and the web site of Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation. Data was subjected to cleaning process and its relevance was proved. The statistical software NCSS and k-medoids clusters methods were used. Government support of agriculture in the Russian Federation is lower than in Europe. In 2015 the total amount of support was 3,264 mln. EURO. Agricultural production is marginal in Russia. Profitability of the vast majority of regions is zero or negative without subsidies. According to results of cluster analysis there are 3 groups of regions depending on subsidies utilization efficiency. Results of the investigation proved that increased amount of subsidies did not improve production efficiency in agriculture. The linear regression model was constructed in order to reveal dependence of agricultural production volume from amount of subsidies, GNP and share of subsidies in the whole volume of GNP. This model helps predict the results of changes in government support. Efficiency of subsidies is decreased by its improper use and for this reason some measures such as different types of control (preliminary, current and follow-up) are suggested to control utilization of subsidies.","[Kontsevaya, Stanislava; Makunina, Irina; Postnikova, Lubov; Khoruziy, Ludmila; Kostina, Raisa] Russian Timiryazev State Agrarian Univ, Moscow, Russia",Russian State Agrarian University - Moscow Timiryazev Agricultural Academy,"Kontsevaya, S (通讯作者)，Russian Timiryazev State Agrarian Univ, Moscow, Russia.",s.kontsevaya@mail.ru; tasia_22@mail.ru; lpostnikova@gmail.com; hli@timacad.ru; kostina@ajour.ru,"Постникова, Любовь/AAA-8028-2022; Kostina, Raisa/AAE-5014-2022; Постникова, Любовь Валерьевна/HJA-9975-2022; Khoruzhy, Liudmila/AAH-4697-2019; Makunia, Irina/ABI-1713-2020; Kontsevaya, Stanislava/F-2088-2017","Постникова, Любовь Валерьевна/0000-0002-5483-900X; Khoruzhy, Liudmila/0000-0003-3061-1374; Kontsevaya, Stanislava/0000-0002-1222-1682",,,,,16,0,0,0,10,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2787-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2017,,,,,,,159,166,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BJ1CL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417392400021,0

We can see strong integration trends between various areas of science, arts, technology, and humanities, building up new areas of research and practice in the process. Powerful benefits of the transdisciplinary approach to problem solving are giving us a glimpse into a possible future where an enduring and systematic scientific order will be challenged, blurring the lines between traditionally perceived subjects, sciences, and disciplines. It is evident that with strong development of information and technology and their application, transdisciplinarity is a logical answer to problems that cannot be directly attributed to any particular discipline or field. The main purpose of this paper is to analyse and discuss the latest transdisciplinary trends and offer a perspective on their impact on scientific research in a rapidly changing world. Special focus is given to the areas of economics and finance and the way the transdisciplinary approach is changing the traditional perception of theory and practice, decision making, and problem solving. Transdisciplinary solution-oriented approach can benefit many areas of theory and practice as well as provide a new perspective on business structure and dynamics, decision making, communication, and scientific development and collaboration. Transdisciplinarity prompts for the new ways of thinking, motivates the innovative approach to individual and group learning and the exchange of ideas, challenging traditional schools of thought that support specialisation and development within a single discipline.","[Kozarevic, Emira] Univ Tuzla, Fac Econ, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg; [Peric, Amela] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Transdisciplinary Innovat, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Tuzla; University of Technology Sydney,"Kozarevic, E (通讯作者)，Univ Tuzla, Fac Econ, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg.",emira.kozarevic@untz.ba; amela_peric@hotmail.com,,,,,,,42,0,0,0,7,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2017,,,,,,,111,129,,,,,,19,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7PJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455302900006,0

We investigate whether the export credit insurance facilitates exports, and whether it alleviates the drop in exports during the global financial crisis. Using an instrumental variable strategy we identify a significantly positive effect of export credit insurance on exports, find that a 1 million RMB increase in export credit insurance premiums leads to a 212.67 million US dollar increase in exports. Empirical results show that the trade-enhancing effect of the export credit insurance has been suffering wane during the crisis, but the export credit insurance premiums have been rising after the onset of the financial crisis, showing conspicuous counter-cyclical characteristics and weakening the fall in international trade.","[Liu Xueping] Minjiang Univ, Inst Internet Innovat, 1 Wenxian Rd Univ Town, Fuzhou 350108, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Wu Xiangyou] Minjiang Univ, Newhuadu Business Sch, Dept Finance & Accounting, 1 Wenxian Rd Univ Town, Fuzhou 350108, Fujian, Peoples R China",Minjiang University; Minjiang University,"Wu, XY (通讯作者)，Minjiang Univ, Newhuadu Business Sch, Dept Finance & Accounting, 1 Wenxian Rd Univ Town, Fuzhou 350108, Fujian, Peoples R China.",liuapple@yeah.net; wuxiangyou@nbs.edu.cn,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,7,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,,,,2017,,,,,,,45,62,,,,,,18,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK8HD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000442810700004,0

However, the production fragmentation widespread around the world due to the recent globalization may weaken the role of exchange rate on international trade. As the Czech economy is a very open one, a quantitative knowledge of the impact of exchange rate on export is a valuable information for all actors in the economy. In our contribution, we examine effect of the exchange rate of the Czech crown on domestic export in three macroeconomic models in both short and long run. The first one is a Keynesian model representing the demand for export in the form of marginal propensities. The second one is a VAR model in elasticities of the reduced form. The last one is a structural model resulting from the findings from the previous one. To estimate their parameters, we use quarterly data from 2000 Q1 to 2016 Q1.

For this purpose, we use relevant variables commonly used in the franchising literature to explain the difference between the profitability of hotel chains that employ franchising as an organizational form and those that do not. A survey is conducted to complete information obtained from Annual Guidebooks and hotel official webpages. Finally, the sample includes data for the most relevant Spanish hotel chains for the period 2009 - 2013. Information from public databases is also introduced. Franchising is a hybrid organizational form that delivers high or powerful incentives to franchisees and, therefore, results or profit generated in this type of outlets should be superior compared to outlets owned by the franchisor and where certain employees are hired to perform activities. Therefore, according to agency theory, franchised outlets should enhance performance and show higher rates of profitability. Most hotel chains typically employ franchising as a mode of growth, especially as geographical dispersion increases and accelerated expansion is necessary. The franchisor, in some instances, chooses to expand activities through franchised units. Franchisees have incentives to be diligent because they put their work, and sometimes, most of their financial resources in the opening of their outlets. This should improve the profitability of franchised outlets compared to franchisor-owned units where managers employed by the chain can have a percentage of variable pay but, mostly, receive a fixed salary in exchange for their work. The paper is structured as follows. After the introduction, the variables used in the analysis are presented from a resource perspective. Then, the sample and methodology employed are described.

Milk prices in 2015 were, on average, around 25-29% lower than in 2014 and was in average 135.7 EUR per ton. Therefore, after the abolition of milk quotas in the European Union, the cow milk production in Latvia has increased continuously and increased by 3176 tonnes (0.4%) in 2015 compared to 2014. According to the analysis of covariance milk supply amount is influenced by milk products consumer price index (CPI) and year, and milk products CPI depends on milk production supply price and year.

Consumers are changing how they relate to grocery stores, increasingly circling the perimeter, focusing on produce and preferentially choosing fresh, local, and new, even unknown, brands while spending less time in the processed food aisles in the center. The next generation, the millenials, are increasingly shunning traditional outlets when buying food. Traditional leading brands of processed food, backed by traditional marketing strategies (heavy advertising on traditional media, coupons, brand extensions, etc.) are failing to hold on to their customers. The challenges can be found throughout the food value chain, from new competitors for grocery providers to new delivery mechanisms, from changes in generational food preferences with social media platforms to express their preferences to farmers who increasingly can and want to communicate directly with the end-users who actually eat the food that they produce. This access to more information opens more options (and opportunities) to buyers and suppliers all along the food value chain. Barely 100 years old, the grocery store model is becoming obsolete, and with it the organization of the food value chain must be re-written. So what does that mean for Big Food and the food supply chain? What directions can the industry take to adjust to the new competitive realities? This paper offers direction and guidance for Big Food and other producers in the food supply chain.","[Phillips-Connolly, Kate] Univ Dublin, Trinity Coll, Coll Green, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Connolly, Aidan J.] Abhaile Consulting, 271 Beach Rd N, Wilmington, NC 28403 USA; [Connolly, Aidan J.] Univ Coll, Mkt, Dublin, Ireland; [Connolly, Aidan J.] China Agr Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Trinity College Dublin; University College Dublin; China Agricultural University,"Connolly, AJ (通讯作者)，Abhaile Consulting, 271 Beach Rd N, Wilmington, NC 28403 USA.;Connolly, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Coll, Mkt, Dublin, Ireland.;Connolly, AJ (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",aconnolly@alltech.com,,,,,,,27,2,5,1,29,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

A lot of empirical studies show that if country succeed to develop higher export sophistication in relation to the GDP per capita level, than it should achieve faster economic growth in the future. In comparison to similar studies, this research will add to the existing literature by focusing not only on relationship between GDP and export sophistication, but on role of real exchange rate in process of structural change of the export sector of developing countries. The basic objective of this research is to analyze one of the channels through which real exchange rate acts on the economic growth of the Eastern European Countries, which relate to its effect on the external competitiveness and sophistication of the exports sectors. The working hypothesis is that under/overvaulted real exchange rate has statistically significant impact on export sector sophistication measured by EXPY index. The paper also hypothesizes that impact of the changes in a level of under/overvaluation on export sophistication is different in pre and post crises period in countries covered by this research. Different impact of the real exchange rate under/overvaluation in those periods is related to the prevailing influence of liberalization of capital account on the overall macroeconomic indicators in pre-crisis period, as well as reduction of its influence after outbreak of the financial crisis. The empirical analysis primarily includes a panel dataset of a total of 26 countries, covering period 1995-2013.

Building on the perspective of emergent strategy, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the evolutionary process of strategy formation in an entrepreneurial firm in the context of an emerging economy. Design/methodology/approach - This study uses a longitudinal case study of Lenovo and examines how its strategic search unfolded during its formative years. It utilizes an explorative research approach with data gathered from many sources including published and unpublished documents, existing case studies, and primary data files and documents from Lenovo's first chief engineer. Findings - The case findings presented herein show that Lenovo's strategic search process was progressive and emergent. As opposed to a deliberate strategy-making mode, in which ends and means can be planned in advance, this study presents entrepreneurial strategy as an emergent process of guiding experiment and learning, whereby firms and entrepreneurs increase the knowledge of their strategic vision over time. Research limitations/implications - There are limitations in the sampling and data analysis, further research could expand this paper's findings to other industry settings or countries. Practical implications - The findings offer important insights into how entrepreneurial firms identify and explore constraints and opportunities from the external environment and evolve their strategy over time. This implication is especially important in the context of emerging economies in which firms in their formative years are faced with resource and environmental constraints. Originality/value - This paper provides unique insights on how an entrepreneurial firm in an emerging economy mobilizes resources and implements strategic search. Future empirical research can build on these qualitative findings to expand research agenda toward other contexts.","[Shu, Ei (Emily)] Kyushu Univ, Fukuoka, Japan",Kyushu University,"Shu, E (通讯作者)，Kyushu Univ, Fukuoka, Japan.",shu@econ.kyushu-u.ac.jp,,"Shu, Ei/0000-0002-7440-576X",,,,,65,4,7,0,29,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

To this end the authors have employed the highly liquid constituent stocks of the U.S. Dow Jones Islamic Index for the period January 2007 to December 2014. The methodology encompasses both static and dynamic models that capture potential time-varying patterns or asymmetric behavior of herding. Summarizing the results, the authors document significant antiherding behavior that is robust across different formulations and testing procedures. Most interestingly, they observe an asymmetric behavior of the antiherding phenomenon. Results from the dynamic analysis reveal that antiherding tends to be more intense during turbulent periods. The findings may entail useful implications for investors who wish to diversify their portfolios using faith-based investments.","[Stavroyiannis, Stavros; Babalos, Vassilios] Technol Educ Inst Peloponnese, Antikalamos, Kalamata, Greece; [Babalos, Vassilios] Univ Piraeus, Piraeus, Greece",University of Piraeus,"Babalos, V (通讯作者)，Technol Educ Inst Peloponnese, Dept Accounting & Finance, Antikalamos 24100, Kalamata, Greece.",vbabalos@teikal.gr,"Stavroyiannis, Stavros/Q-7148-2019","Stavroyiannis, Stavros/0000-0001-8444-9371; BABALOS, VASSILIOS/0000-0002-2633-7985",,,,,39,39,39,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

Or does causality run the opposite way - does rising economic growth boost accessibility? Results document that increases in accessibility lead to significant and relatively large increases in GDP growth on the city-level; further, the benefits substantially out-weigh HSR's fixed costs, depreciation and subsidies. Out-of-sample methods document the importance of increases in HSR in forecasting GDP growth.

The hedging result is evaluated using out-of-sample data and the realized variances and covariances, and is really satisfying in the subprime period or when both spot and future stay in a down state. In this stock index context, the risk aversion is determined to be 1. The optimal hedge ratio on average is around 0.878. The White test favors the regime-switching models in prediction.

First and foremost, each port is ranked according to its attractiveness under four indexes, namely marine services, customs clearance services, transport services and tourism services. Secondly, with the aim of creating asymmetric links and the shortest path, a planning model is formulated to select and rank the ports of call. The aim of the model is to gain the optimal revenue per voyage, with considerations of time window and voyage duration. With regards to small-scale and large-scale port collections, the traversal and randomised algorithms are adopted to find the practical routes. Furthermore, an empirical analysis of routes in South Asia is given.

The reasons root in its inflexible education system, not enough emphasis from universities, obscure teachers' role and unconsciousness of students themselves, etc. Because of its importance, it is strongly recommended that employment instruction lectures should be taught by those professionals with relevant working experience, employment units should strengthen their coordination with schools, teachers pay more attention to the textbook selection and consciously strengthen their relevant training skills.

Their importance in national economies is not reflected only in their share in the total number of enterprises but also in their share of the realized value of GDP and exports and their great contribution to employment. However, it is not enough to start small businesses and ensure their survival, but a critical factor of SMEs' influence on economic growth is the propulsion of their growth and development. This research assumes that the way SMEs manage the changes determines their development potential and consequently their success and its associated longevity. The purpose of this paper is to examine whether the studied enterprises could be categorized with recognizable features concerning the mode these SMEs manage organizational and strategic changes. Therefore, a cluster analysis is used on the sample of 190 established SMEs in the Republic of Croatia. The results indicate the distribution of analyzed SMEs in four clusters that show significant differences between selected classification variables of organizational and strategic dynamics and their related performance. In cluster of SMEs with the strongest organizational and strategic dynamics are the enterprises that show the highest level of performance. More than 60% of the enterprises with the potential (fast-growing, high-tech and innovative SMEs) are in this cluster. Based on the conducted research, practical recommendations may be provided for resource allocation on certain aspects of organizational and strategic dynamics with the aim of increasing SME's development potential and their long-term performance. From the theoretical viewpoint, this research gives a new insight into the specificities of change management in SMEs in relation to large enterprises. It also unfolds arrays of new research to include new samples and longitudinal approach. This would allow a comparison of results and further expansion of knowledge in this specific area.","[Tomljenovic, Ljerka] Polytech Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia",Polytechnic Rijeka,"Tomljenovic, L (通讯作者)，Polytech Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia.",ljerka.tomljenovic@veleri.hr,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,4,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2017,,,,,,,522,537,,,,,,16,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7PJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455302900032,0

According to the realized research it can be concluded, that Slovakia is among the other states specific with leading position of the received support in relation to its farm output. This situation can be connected with the fact that the subsidy is remunerated per hectare, which strongly motivates Slovakia's farmers to use vast amount of agriculture land and thus receive support as high as possible.","[Urbanova, Maria] Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia; [Kozakova, Jana] Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Management, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Urbánová, M (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",maria.urbanova1@uniag.sk; jana.kozakova@uniag.sk,"Kozáková, Jana/AAC-7916-2020; Urbanova, Maria/F-6826-2019","Kozáková, Jana/0000-0001-7913-9053; Urbanova, Maria/0000-0003-4281-7329","Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic [VEGA 1/0543/17]","Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic","This paper was created within the project VEGA Integrated talent management model and its impact on economic results of enterprises from The Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic.

The results shown that the separate and uniform modulus approach are similar generally for the dynamic characteristics of composite frame under frequent earthquake.","[Wang, Yi-ju; Ma, Suo-fei-ya] Lanzhou Inst Technol, Sch Civil Engn, Lanzhou 730050, Peoples R China",Lanzhou Institute of Technology,"Wang, YJ (通讯作者)，Lanzhou Inst Technol, Sch Civil Engn, Lanzhou 730050, Peoples R China.",376964787@qq.com; 12213719@qq.com,,,natural science foundation of Gansu province [1205VCRA178],natural science foundation of Gansu province,This paper is supported by the natural science foundation of Gansu province (NO: 1205VCRA178).,,13,0,0,0,11,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",2475-8868,,978-1-60595-446-2,DESTECH TRANS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,197,203,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI0AD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404468200039,0

For research purposes the authors tested the hypothesis: when distributing revenues from personal income tax between Federal and regional budget levels, it is possible to use the calculation mechanism, taking into consideration a number of delimitative criteria. Economic analysis, synthesis and the analog approach allowed to quantitatively interpret seven theoretical criteria dividing income tax within levels of the budget. Using time-series methods, quantitative and correlation analysis, integral indicator we evaluated each criteria received for 83 regions of the Russian Federation for the period between 2010 and 2014 and identified the possibility of splitting revenues from personal income tax between the Federal and regional budgets. Nizhny Novgorod region, one of the regions of Russian Federation, was taken as an example in the course of study. Methods of factor analysis allowed to test the algorithm built for dividing tax revenues, confirming their relevance and significant value. As a result of the study, the authors identified two main features of the distribution of personal income tax in Russia between the Federal and regional budgets, at a ratio of 10% to 90% or 20% to 80%, respectively.

Through the research on the number of papers published by authors, it is concluded that the core author group in the research field of the Uygur language as the second language teaching has not yet been fully formed, and the research development in this field is still to be mature. Through the study of the cooperation rate of the author, it is concluded that the literature cooperation intensity of Uygur language as a second language teaching research field is low and the strength is not enough. Conclusions: a), More attention has been paid to this major, but the Uyghur language as the second language teaching has not been comprehensively studied in China. Its theoretical research relatively lags behind. b), There is not enough research on this subject, and the scale of teaching and the research intensity are disproportionate. The research status of Uygur language teaching as the second language teaching is not optimistic. Relevant units and scholars need to pay more attention to this field and promote the development of this field.","[Yuan, Fangli] Xinjiang Univ, Chinese Language Inst, Xinjiang 830046, Hutubi County, Peoples R China; [Yibulayin, Xiadiya] Xinjiang Univ, Chinese Language Inst, Urumqi 830046, Xinjiang, Peoples R China",Xinjiang University; Xinjiang University,"Yibulayin, X (通讯作者)，Xinjiang Univ, Chinese Language Inst, Urumqi 830046, Xinjiang, Peoples R China.",yfl_merely@163.com; xadiya49@hotmail.com,,,"social science fund project of the autonomous region, Research on the Development of Minority Languages in Xinjiang of the 60th Anniversary since the Establishment of the Autonomous Region [2015BYY086]; funding project of the key research base of the Humanities and Social Sciences of the colleges and universities in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Research on the Uygur Language as the Second Language Teaching Based on the Model of Bilingual Transla [XJEDU010815C01]","social science fund project of the autonomous region, Research on the Development of Minority Languages in Xinjiang of the 60th Anniversary since the Establishment of the Autonomous Region; funding project of the key research base of the Humanities and Social Sciences of the colleges and universities in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Research on the Uygur Language as the Second Language Teaching Based on the Model of Bilingual Transla","This article is the periodic result of social science fund project of the autonomous region, Research on the Development of Minority Languages in Xinjiang of the 60th Anniversary since the Establishment of the Autonomous Region (Project number: 2015BYY086) and funding project of the key research base of the Humanities and Social Sciences of the colleges and universities in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Research on the Uygur Language as the Second Language Teaching Based on the Model of Bilingual Translation Talents Training (Project number: XJEDU010815C01).",,4,0,0,2,5,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-463-7,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,53.0,,,,,,321,330,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL5MW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452213200066,0

The study is based on simultaneous examination of a region as functional and structural subsystems of national economy by methods of quantitative and qualitative analysis. The paper presents theoretical assumptions and methodological foundations of research into the reproductive potential in the framework of regional economic management regarding resource, dynamic and resulting components. The authors developed a conceptual approach to study of the reproductive potential including three inter-related groups of potentials: resources, factors and results of economic development, which allows one to consider the complex of in-line, torque and dynamic parameters and to carry out assessment by means of a graphical model. The authors proposed an expanded view of an aggregate potential: a latent potential (implicit and unmeasured potential value); an actual potential (power and size of economic system); a forecasted potential (reserves and unused opportunities). The authors identified features of the reproductive potential (consistency, controllability, built-up capacity, variability of sizes and borders), which allow defining it as a major subsystem of regional regulation. The authors described features of the region's reproductive potential: its specific structure, dual focus of operation, a significant role of import and export.","[Yusupov, Kasim Nazifovich; Yangirov, Azat Vazirovich; Akhunov, Rustem Rinatovich; Toktamysheva, Yuliya Semenovna] Bashkir State Univ, BSU, Dept Macroecon Dev & State Governance, Ufa, Russia",Ufa University of Science & Technology,"Yusupov, KN (通讯作者)，Bashkir State Univ, BSU, Dept Macroecon Dev & State Governance, Ufa, Russia.",kasim_jusupov@mail.ru; jangirovav@list.ru; akhunov@list.ru; tokt-yuliya@yandex.ru,"Toktamysheva, Yuliya Semenovna/Q-1146-2017; Yangirov, Azat Yangirov A.V./J-4417-2014",,Russian Foundation for Basic Research [16-12-02011],Russian Foundation for Basic Research(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)Spanish Government),"The work was performed with the financial support of the grant Regional Contest Ural: history, economy, culture 2016 - Respublika Bashkortostan, No 16-12-02011, of the Russian Foundation for Basic Research.",,15,1,1,0,3,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-408-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,38.0,,,,,,685,692,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI9HY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416099600112,0

Although a lot of studies analysed the degree to which travel preferences affect the residential location choice, few studies looked at the effect of a residential relocation on peoples travel behaviour and attitudes. A new residential context has the potential to disrupt previous travel choices and could potentially change peoples attitudes. This study using 1539 recently relocated residents in the city of Ghent (Belgium) analyses self-reported changes in mode frequency and travel attitudes after a relocation, and uses a cohort approach to look at mode frequency and attitudes at different times after the relocation took place. Results suggest that (i) travel attitudes often influence the residential location choice, and (ii) both travel attitudes and travel mode choice change after a relocation, albeit in different ways depending on the current (urban versus suburban) and previous residential neighbourhood (more/equally/less urbanised). This study also suggests that a (possible) dissonance between travel attitudes and the residential neighbourhood is partly a temporal situation, as attitudes can gradually change in accordance with the new residential environment.","[De Vos, Jonas; Witlox, Frank] Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, Krijgslaan 281 S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Ettema, Dick] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Utrecht, Netherlands",Ghent University; Utrecht University,"De Vos, J (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, Krijgslaan 281 S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",jonas.devos@ugent.be; D.F.Ettema@uu.nl; frank.witlox@ugent.be,"Ettema, Dick/IQS-9627-2023; Witlox, Frank/A-5143-2008; De Vos, Jonas/AAJ-1298-2021","Witlox, Frank/0000-0002-8966-6823; De Vos, Jonas/0000-0003-4919-2157",Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO) [12F2519N],Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO)(FWO),"The authors would like to thank the three anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments and suggestions, making it possible to improve this article.

This article critically assesses claims that this method of finance would alleviate the economic issues of incentives and efficiency and the political issues of taxpayer burdens and support that challenge all major BIG schemes. The self-financing methods are shown merely to obscure the adverse impacts on marginal effective tax rates that would otherwise require explicit increases in income tax rates. Increased efficiency costs are shown by examples to be extremely large. The self-financing structure is also found to concentrate burdens on middle-income taxpayers. Public opinion surveys further suggest scant public support for the taxes that would be needed to finance such schemes. The article reviews the economic basis for categorical treatment, with BIG benefits focused on those who are unable to work and policies supporting work, earnings, and human capital investment for employable persons. This approach could be financed with lesser taxpayer burdens while according more closely with public values about work; it would also directly address the long-run causes of poverty rather than just the symptoms.","[Kesselman, Jonathan Rhys] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Vancouver, BC, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Kesselman, JR (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",,,,Canada Research Chairs program,Canada Research Chairs program(Canada Research Chairs),"I thank Robin Boadway, Matt Jensen, Wayne Simpson, and Harvey Stevens for clarifying details on their proposals addressed in this article and comments on an earlier draft.

We find that bank-driven terminations significantly decrease investment, exerting an effect that exceeds that due to credit reductions within continuing relationships. Our results also show that the unwanted effect of bank-driven terminations grows as the loan market deteriorates as a whole, which prevents firms from obtaining funding from other sources after their relationships with banks are terminated. Our findings coincide with previous literature emphasizing financial frictions in the matching process and the importance of relation-specific assets in credit markets. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

For this purpose, an extensive panel data set was constructed, whereby each observation corresponded to a recession episode. The empirical analysis yielded two novel findings. First, pre-recession inequality and recession severity are weakly related to each other, as a negative and statistically significant relationship is only observed for middle and high levels of income and governance. Second, the relationship between recession length and post-recession income inequality is positive and highly significant in low- and middle-income countries. This relationship is insignificant in high-income countries due, possibly, to their high capacity to accommodate for the impacted low-income groups.","[Neyapti, Bilin] Bilkent Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey",Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University,"Neyapti, B (通讯作者)，Bilkent Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.",neyapti@bilkent.edu.tr,"Neyapti, Bilin/AAE-5557-2020","Neyapti, Bilin/0000-0002-1819-7804",,,,,52,2,2,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

Using samples of 254 vacant plots of lands and 3,681 houses in Selangor, Malaysia, we find that the option premium for vacant lands ranges from 8% to 20% across all areas in Selangor. We posit that the higher option premium for vacant lands is the result of a higher level of speculation by landowners. We also find that, while the option value increases, the intrinsic value reduces the market price of the vacant land.

Although extant studies are mainly from countries where Christianity is part of the common cultural traditions, China provides a unique context to test these effects. We find that, compared with non-Christians, Christians are significantly less likely to cheat and demonstrate a significantly higher level of trust in all conditions tested. We also find variation among Christians by religiosity. Specifically, Christians with higher religiosity exhibit a significantly higher rate of trust and a lower rate of deception than the less-religious Christians. Further, our data show that both Christians and non-Christians trust Christians significantly more than others. We also find that both Christians and non-Christians are sensitive to consequences when deciding whether to lie.","[Xu, Hui] Beijing Normal Univ, Business Sch, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yingxi] Yunnan Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Liang, Jie] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, 777 GuoDin Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Yunnan University of Finance & Economics; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Liang, J (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, 777 GuoDin Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",liang.jie@mail.shufe.edu.cn,"Liang, Jie/HGE-7219-2022","Xu, Hui/0009-0003-2994-9834",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71503022]; Beijing Normal University Interdisciplinary Project [312231104]; Yunnan Provincial Education Department [2017zzx007],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Normal University Interdisciplinary Project; Yunnan Provincial Education Department,"All authors have contributed to it in a meaningful and equal way and should be considered co-first authors.

In particular, it focuses on identifying the importance of firms' heterogeneities on the effects, taking into account the source of FDI, the intensity of firm interaction, and the target firms' technology-absorptive capacity. Most importantly, the paper investigates whether the estimates depend on a combined rather than single impact of these heterogeneities. Design/methodology/approach To control for the possibility of selection bias and endogeneity, this empirical analysis uses a methodology that combines propensity score matching and difference-in-differences (PSM-DID) in adopting a comprehensive data set of both foreign- and Indian-acquired firms that were purchased through mergers and acquisitions in India between 1991 and 2013. Findings The analysis reveals four major findings. First, overall, the post-foreign acquisition target firms' performance gains were positive and varied by the heterogeneous technology transfer capacity of the foreign investor. Second, it is possible that target firms located in industrial clusters with more foreign agglomeration experienced larger profitability gains through more dynamic firm interactions in terms of spillovers. Third, Indian targets with higher technology-absorptive capacity benefitted in higher profitability gains from acquiring and assimilating the superior technology that is transferred from foreign investors. Finally, an optimal combination of Indian target firms with higher technology-absorptive capacity and foreign investors with higher technology transfer capacity maximizes profitability gains, post-acquisition. This synergy effect is particularly prominent in clusters where more foreign firms agglomerate. Originality/value This study captures the true direct effect of FDI by adjusting the combined causal effects of various inherent heterogeneities in the target firms' performance, thus correcting any possible bias, which few previous studies have addressed.","[Song, Young Chul] Korea Inst Int Econ Policy, Asia Pacific Reg Res Dept, Sejong, South Korea; [Lie, Han Young] Chung Ang Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Korea Institute for International Economic Policy (KIEP); Chung Ang University,"Song, YC (通讯作者)，Korea Inst Int Econ Policy, Asia Pacific Reg Res Dept, Sejong, South Korea.",deskmanyc@daum.net; lee10@cau.ac.kr,,"SONG, Youngchul/0000-0003-4689-3273",,,,,94,6,6,2,27,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,Leeds,"Floor 5, Northspring 21-23 Wellington Street, Leeds, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

We build a three period model that focuses on Islamic equities' financial filters, market wide liquidity and the role of Shariah conscious customers to show how Islamic stocks could provide a shelter during a financial crisis. We then offer empirical support by using quantile regressions to analyse the relation between conventional and non-conventional (i.e., Islamic) stock markets. Using major indices from around the world, we provide strong support for Islamic stocks as a hedge for majority of the markets under study suggesting that they offer a safe haven against most international markets.

Crucial to the applicability of this test in practice, which relies on endowing a subsample of respondents with a good free of charge, is that the income effects due to endowment are negligible. In this study, we apply the adding-up test in an experimental value elicitation format to examine the potential effect of endowment as part of the test design on the adding-up property of elicited values.The results show that the adding-up property can be affected by free provision of part of the bundle.","[Elbakidze, Levan] West Virginia Univ, Div Resource Econ & Management, Ctr Innovat Gas Res & Utilizat, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.] Univ Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.] Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res, Oslo, Norway; [Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",West Virginia University; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Elbakidze, L (通讯作者)，West Virginia Univ, Div Resource Econ & Management, Ctr Innovat Gas Res & Utilizat, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",levan.elbakidze@mail.wvu.edu; rnayga@uark.edu,,"Elbakidze, Levan/0000-0002-7298-5879",,,,,32,5,5,1,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The analysis is based on the rich Youth in Transition Survey, Cohort A (YITS-A), which follows a representative sample of Canadian youth age 15 in 1999 through to the normal point at which PSE decisions are made. The main findings include that female students go into STEM disciplines at a much lower rate than male students, even after controlling for a broad set of control variables, including high school grades in math and science. Conversely, visible minorities, especially those who are first-generation immigrants, and particularly those from a specific set of regions, participate at much higher rates than others.

The choice of a single mandate depends on the trade openness and the credibility. Reduced-form empirical results show as central banks become less credible, they are more likely to adopt a pegged exchange rate, and the tendency to peg depends on trade openness. In a model with loose commitment, as credibility falls, either an inflation target or a pegged exchange rate is more likely to be adopted.

For manufacturing firms, findings indicate that an unexpected disruption in oil supply that raises oil prices by 1% lowers firm profits by 1.3% on impact. On the other hand, profits rise by 0.39% in response to the same increase in the price of oil, when it is driven by a positive movement in the global demand for oil, and by 0.79% after an unexpected surge in speculative oil demand. The positive balance sheet effect of speculative oil shocks on the manufacturing sector contrasts their negative effect on global economic activity. An explanation follows from the industry level analysis, which suggests that speculation in the oil market creates a ripple effect in downstream industries and raises inventory demand for petroleum and chemical products. In contrast to its secondary role in explaining historical variations in the price of oil and profits in trade and mining sectors, oil supply shocks are found to have been the dominant oil market innovations in driving fluctuations in manufacturing firms' profits. The analysis also finds a limited response of production costs to exogenous changes in the oil price, disputing the classic notion that the cost share of oil in an industry determines its level of exposure to oil market shocks.

Our evidence supports this view: Analysts are more likely to cover stocks inside industry clusters, and when institutional investors have a large position in one stock in the industry cluster, they are more likely to hold other stocks in the same industry cluster.","[Engelberg, Joseph] Univ Calif San Diego, Rady Sch Management, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Ozoguz, Arzu] Southern Methodist Univ, Cox Sch Business, Dallas, TX USA; [Wang, Sean] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, KenanFlagler Business Sch, Chapel Hill, NC USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Southern Methodist University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine,"Engelberg, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Rady Sch Management, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",jengelberg@ucsd.edu; aozoguz@smu.edu; sean_wang@kenan-flagler.unc.edu,"Wang, Sean/AAI-2952-2020","Wang, Sean/0000-0002-9803-369X",,,,,36,30,36,3,54,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

Personal characteristics and attitudes are crucial to this decision, but recent literature also highlights the importance of social networks as providers of information and financial support. To date, empirical research dealing with the network effect has considered self-employed migrants as a homogeneous group. In contrast, our paper examines the impact of the size and the composition of geographic concentration of co-nationals on the propensity to be self-employed among the foreign-born workers taking into account two possible choices: own-account workers and entrepreneurs. Using micro-level data of migrant workers in Spain over the period 2000-2009, the results show that networks affect positively the probability of becoming self-employed. However, they do not affect the likelihood of becoming an entrepreneur, which is determined by individual characteristics such as education and number of years of residence. Thus, our results suggest policies that enable immigrant assimilation can play a significant role in generating entrepreneurial activity.","[Martin-Montaner, Joan] Univ Jaume 1, Inst Econ Int, Ave Vicente Sos Baynat S-N, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain; [Serrano-Domingo, Guadalupe; Requena-Silvente, Francisco] Univ Valencia, Ave Tarongers S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain",Universitat Jaume I; University of Valencia,"Martín-Montaner, J (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Inst Econ Int, Ave Vicente Sos Baynat S-N, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain.",jmartin@uji.es,"Requena, Francisco/AAX-7248-2020; Serrano, Guadalupe/H-7520-2015; Martin-Montaner, Joan/G-1808-2016","Requena, Francisco/0000-0003-1043-0277; Serrano, Guadalupe/0000-0001-5748-3216; Martin-Montaner, Joan/0000-0002-5754-9024","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2014-58975-P, EC2015-68057-R]; Universitat Jaume I [P1.1B2013-22]",Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); Universitat Jaume I,"This work was supported by the Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [grant numbers ECO2014-58975-P, EC2015-68057-R] and the Universitat Jaume I [grant number P1.1B2013-22]",,38,5,8,0,54,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Debate continues on what domains constitute women's empowerment and how to measure empowerment across countries. Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) are the most widely available source of data on women's empowerment. However, measurement invariance often is assumed, but not tested. We used DHS data from Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda to test factor structure and measurement invariance of women's empowerment among married women ages 15-49. Factor analysis confirmed a three-latent-domain model of women's empowerment in each country capturing women's human/social assets, gender attitudes related to wife abuse, and women's participation in household decisions. Multi-country confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) identified an invariant three-factor model of women's empowerment and a subset of country-specific items. Our results offer a standardized, invariant measure of women's empowerment that can be applied to monitor women's empowerment cross-nationally in East Africa, and possibly beyond.

In response to the growth in liabilities, many states have introduced legislation that cuts back on defined benefit (DB) plan commitments, in some cases even shifting the pension system from a DB to a defined contribution or hybrid plan. This paper explores the factors that have led states to engage in pension reform, focusing particular attention on one factor that has only recently gained attention in the research literature: contribution volatility. While unfunded liabilities have significant long-term solvency implications, in the short term fluctuations in the amount of required contributions pose substantial difficulties for the ability of plan sponsors to balance budgets and engage in strategic planning. We begin by quantifying the volatility in the required contributions US states were expected to make between 2001 and 2013 and comparing the volatility of pension spending to other relevant tax and spending measures. Next, we describe the various types of pension reforms that states have implemented and examine the fiscal pressures facing those states that have engaged in reform. States with greater fluctuations in their required payments have been more likely to reduce benefits and increase employee contributions; they have also been more likely to institute these reforms sooner.","[St Clair, Travis; Guzman, Juan Pablo Martinez] Univ Maryland, Sch Publ Policy, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"St Clair, T (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Sch Publ Policy, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",tstclair@umd.edu; jpmart04@umd.edu,,"Martinez Guzman, Juan Pablo/0000-0002-3457-8703",,,,,18,9,12,0,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

Public and private investment in India,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,India; Public and private investment; Crowding in (out),DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; GROWTH-MODELS; UNITED-STATES; FLUCTUATIONS; PERMANENT; SHOCKS; ROOT,"This paper contributes to the debate on the relationship between public and private investment in India along the following dimensions. First, acknowledging major structural changes that the Indian economy has undergone in the past three decades, we study whether public investment in recent years has become more or less complementary to private investment in comparison to the period before 1980. Second, we construct a novel data-set of quarterly aggregate public and private investment in India over the period 1996-2015 using investment-project data from the CapEx-CMIE database. Third, embedding a theory driven long-run relationship on the model, we estimate a range of Structural Vector Error Correction Models (SVECMs) to re-examine the public and private investment relationship in India. Identification is achieved by decomposing shocks into those with transitory and permanent effects. Our results suggest that while public investment crowds out private investment in India over the period 1950-2012, the opposite is true when we restrict the sample to post 1980 or conduct a quarterly analysis since 1996. This change can likely be attributed to the policy reforms which started during the early 1980s and gained momentum after the 1991 crisis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We study the relation between public-sector wages and corruption in China. Our measure of corruption is the value of bribes obtained by government officials as reported in court proceedings. The data cover the period 1985 to 2014. We hypothesize that the public-sector wage is a reference point for bribe payers and bribe takers in determining the value of bribes, and that external wage opportunities for comparison with public-sector wages, as proposed by the fair wage hypothesis, are not required to determine the relation between public-sector wages and corruption. Our empirical estimates confirm our hypothesis. We find no consistent support for the fair-wage hypothesis but a systematic U-shaped relation between the public-sector wage and corruption measured as the value of bribes. We conclude that 'carrots' of higher public-sector wages reduce corruption when the public-sector wage is low, but, when the public-sector wage is high, 'sticks' rather than carrots seem to be required to deter corruption.","[Chen, Yanting; Liu, Qijun] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Publ Adm, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Liu, QJ (通讯作者)，Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Publ Adm, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",qijun_liu@163.com,,"Liu, Qijun/0000-0002-3693-3270",Funds for Creative Work by Huazhong University of Science and Technology,Funds for Creative Work by Huazhong University of Science and Technology,"We thank many friends who generously provided the court documents of corruption cases for this research.

We develop a general equilibrium model that accounts for the joint interaction of product quality and variety. Our findings show that the aggregate price bias is procyclical and the contribution of product variety is persistent whereas the contribution of product quality becomes countercyclical in the medium to long run. We show that accounting for product quality and variety has critical implications on the measure of cyclical fluctuations. Measurements of cyclical fluctuations derived using the consumption deflator, which abstracts from changes in product quality and variety, underestimate the variables' true volatility.","[Hamano, Masashige; Zanetti, Francesco] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Hamano, M (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford, England.",masashige.hamano@waseda.jp; francesco.zanetti@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,Zengin Foundation; JSPS [15K1702]; John Fell Fund,"Zengin Foundation; JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); John Fell Fund","The authors would like to thank Pok-sang Lam, anonymous referees, Peter Ireland, Michiru Kosaka, Julien Martin, Peter Neary, Ha Nguyen, Pierre M.

Optimizing linear combinations of multipowers can indeed drastically reduce the variance with respect to traditional estimators. In the case of quarticity, we also prove that the optimal combination is a nearly efficient estimator, being arbitrarily close to the nonparametric efficiency bound as the number of consecutive returns employed diverges. We provide guidance on how to select the optimal number of consecutive returns to minimize mean square error. The implementation on U.S. stock prices corroborates our theoretical findings and further shows that our proposed quarticity estimator noticeably reduces the number of detected jumps, and improves the quality of volatility forecasts.","[Kolokolov, Aleksey] Goethe Univ, SAFE Ctr, Frankfurt, Germany; [Reno, Roberto] Univ Verona, Verona, Italy",Goethe University Frankfurt; University of Verona,"Renò, R (通讯作者)，Univ Verona, Dipartimento Sci Econ, Via Cantarane 24, I-37129 Verona, Italy.",roberto.reno@univr.it,"Reno, Roberto/F-2891-2013","Reno, Roberto/0000-0002-1470-2420; Kolokolov, Aleksey/0009-0005-3512-4366",Riksbankens Jubileumsfond Grant [P13-1024:1]; VR Grant [340-2013-5180]; Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences [P13-1024:1] Funding Source: Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences,Riksbankens Jubileumsfond Grant(Swedish Foundation for Humanities & Social Sciences); VR Grant; Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences(Swedish Foundation for Humanities & Social Sciences),We thank Lucio Barabesi and Federico Bandi for insightful discussions.

I exploit the unanticipated freeze of private mortgage securitization in 2007 to provide new evidence that securitization increases foreclosure probability and decreases modification probability. These effects are economically large and persist over time even after implementation of the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) in 2009. Using hand-collected data on the contractual terms of servicing agreements, I show that servicers typically have broad discretion to modify loans but face significant incentives favoring foreclosure.

Japanese and U.S. survey data are analyzed to examine the associations between personality traits and annual income in the two countries. In particular, we focus on a country-specific, noncognitive determinant of annual income, which is found in agreeableness among male workers. Agreeableness contributes to higher annual income in male workers in Japan, but acts as a penalty for male workers in the U.S. This contrasting effect of agreeableness remains significant even when controlling for labor-related variables such as occupation, industry sector, employment type, and working hours. However, the wage penalty of agreeableness observed in the U.S. labor market is heterogeneous, differing by firm size. Negative effects are pronounced only in smaller companies; they disappear in large companies. In Japan, where higher agreeableness on average translates to higher income, the income premium is strengthened at large companies. This income premium of agreeableness does not necessarily result from career promotion, suggesting that agreeableness might act as part of a skill set directly improving job performance and productivity, rather than acting indirectly through occupational choice or career advancement.","[Lee, Sun Youn] Meiji Gakuin Univ, Fac Int Studies, Totsuka Ku, 1518 Kamikurata Cho, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2448539, Japan; [Ohtake, Fumio] Osaka Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res, 6-1 Mihogaoka, Ibaraki, Osaka 5670047, Japan",Osaka University,"Lee, SY (通讯作者)，Meiji Gakuin Univ, Fac Int Studies, Totsuka Ku, 1518 Kamikurata Cho, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2448539, Japan.",sylee@k.meijigakuin.ac.jp; ohtake@iser.osaka-u.ac.jp,"Li, Wang/M-1612-2019; Ohtake, Fumio/D-1901-2012",,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [15K17079]; JSPS [26245041]; ISER/Osaka University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26245041, 15K17079] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); ISER/Osaka University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This study is supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists B [grant number 15K17079] from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) to Sun Youn Lee, a Grant-in Aid for Scientific Research A [Grant number 26245041] from the JSPS, and a grant from the Joint Usage/Research Center provided by ISER/Osaka University to Fumio Ohtake.

These programs deploy three types of public-goods contribution mechanisms: voluntary contribution, green tariff, and all-or-nothing green tariff (Kotchen and Moore, 2007). We extend the theoretical understanding of the all-or-nothing green tariff mechanism by showing that an assumption of warm-glow preferences is needed to explain widespread participation in programs deploying this mechanism. We conduct the first experimental test to compare the revenue generating capacity of a pure public good (based on the voluntary contribution mechanism) and an impure public good (based on the green tariff mechanism). In experimental play, the voluntary contribution mechanism raises 50% more revenue than the green tariff mechanism. With the all-or-nothing green tariff, experimental play and regression estimates show that a warm-glow preference positively affects participation, as predicted by the theory.","[Mitra, Arnab] Portland State Univ, Dept Econ, 1721 SW Broadway, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Moore, Michael R.] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Portland State University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Mitra, A (通讯作者)，Portland State Univ, Dept Econ, 1721 SW Broadway, Portland, OR 97201 USA.",amitra@pdx.edu,,,Erb Institute for Global Sustainable Enterprise at the University of Michigan; Portland State University,Erb Institute for Global Sustainable Enterprise at the University of Michigan; Portland State University,"The authors thank Jim Andreoni, Erin Krupka, Tom Lyon, Christian Vossler, and two anonymous referees for insightful suggestions.

The study employs an aggregate of four sets of portfolios mimicking size and industry with varying dimensions. The first set consists of three set of six portfolios each sorted on size to B/M, size to investment, and size to momentum. The second set comprises of five index portfolios, third, a four-set of twenty-five portfolios each sorted on size to B/M, size to investment, size to profitability, and size to momentum, and the final set constitute thirty industry portfolios. To estimate the parameters of six-factor asset pricing model for the four sets of variant portfolios, we use OLS and Generalized method of moments based robust instrumental variables technique (IVGMM). The results obtained from the relevance, endogeneity, overidentifying restrictions, and the Hausman's specification, tests indicate that the parameter estimates of the six-factor model using IVGMM are robust and performs better than the OLS approach. The human capital component shares equally the predictive power alongside the factors in the framework in explaining the variations in return on portfolios. Furthermore, we assess the t-ratio of the human capital component of each IVGMM estimates of the six-factor asset pricing model for the four sets of variant portfolios. The t-ratio of the human capital of the eighty-three IVGMM estimates are more than 3.00 with reference to the standard proposed by Harvey et al. (2016).

The shadow prices were regarded as the abatement cost. We found that the Chinese national average SO2 shadow price showed a fluctuating downward trend during the period of 2001-2012 and increased significantly in 2013. The results also show that the mean value of the non-efficiency of environmental technology presents a downward trend. Moreover, the values of environmental technical non-efficiency of all production units are greater than zero, which shows that there is room for improvement. Finally, the factors influencing the shadow price were analyzed using regression analysis, which revealed a negative correlation between the shadow price of CO2 and that of SO2. The shadow price of SO2 will decrease with increasing per capita GDP. The effect of capital-labor intensity is also significant, but the coefficient is positive, i.e., higher capital-labor intensity is associated with a higher SO2 abatement cost.","[Zeng, Shihong; Jiang, Xue] Beijing Univ Technol, Coll Econ & Management, Appl Econ Dept, Beijing 100124, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Xue] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Su, Bin] Natl Univ Singapore, Energy Studies Inst, Singapore 119620, Singapore; [Zeng, Shihong; Jiang, Xue; Nan, Xin] Beijing Univ Technol, Coll Econ & Management, Finance & Econ Dev Res Ctr, Beijing 100124, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Shihong] Beijing Univ Technol, Beijing Modern Mfg Dev Res Base Beijing Philosoph, Beijing 100124, Peoples R China",Beijing University of Technology; Beihang University; National University of Singapore; Beijing University of Technology; Beijing University of Technology,"Zeng, SH (通讯作者)，Beijing Univ Technol, Coll Econ & Management, Appl Econ Dept, Beijing 100124, Peoples R China.;Jiang, X (通讯作者)，Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.;Su, B (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Energy Studies Inst, Singapore 119620, Singapore.",zengshihong@bjut.edu.cn; a410862000@126.com; subin@nus.edu.sg,"Zeng, Shihong/AFN-8962-2022; SU, BIN/B-7990-2011","Zeng, Shihong/0000-0002-5489-1975; SU, BIN/0000-0003-4273-7054","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473010, 71573186]; Chinese Philosophy & Social Science Research Program [12BJY060]; Beijing Modern Manufacturing Base of Beijing Philosophy and Social Sciences and social science fund of Beijing university oftechnology [25]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese Philosophy & Social Science Research Program; Beijing Modern Manufacturing Base of Beijing Philosophy and Social Sciences and social science fund of Beijing university oftechnology,"The research study was funded jointly by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71473010; 71573186); the Chinese Philosophy & Social Science Research Program (12BJY060); and the Beijing Modern Manufacturing Base of Beijing Philosophy and Social Sciences and social science fund of Beijing university oftechnology (No.25, 2018).",,55,39,43,6,39,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

A decomposition approach,JOURNAL OF HOUSING ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Quantile decomposition; House price; China,QUANTILE REGRESSION APPROACH; NEIGHBORHOOD; MARKET; DISTRIBUTIONS; IMPACT; CHINA; WAGES,"The average real house price in Beijing rose by roughly 41.8% between 2012 and 2015, and the appreciation differs across low- versus high-priced homes. The rising house price might be caused by changes in the characteristics of housing units, and it might also be induced by the changing returns to housing characteristics in the underlying hedonic price functions. In this paper, we use a comprehensive housing transaction dataset and analyze the changes in the distribution of house prices over time through a decomposition approach. The result of Oaxaca-Blinder mean decomposition suggests that the proportion of the price gap between 2012 and 2015 due to altered returns over time is greater than the proportion caused by changes in housing characteristics. The quantile decomposition shows that the decomposition effects are heterogenous across the complete distribution of house prices. We also find that low-priced homeowners are exposed to a decline in house prices, while there are deteriorating housing conditions from 2012 to 2015. The high-priced homeowners experience an improvement in living conditions, but a rise in house prices.","[Zhang, Lei] North Dakota State Univ, Dept Agribusiness & Appl Econ, 811 2nd Ave N, Fargo, ND 58102 USA; [Yi, Yimin] Syracuse Univ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",North Dakota State University Fargo; Syracuse University,"Zhang, L (通讯作者)，North Dakota State Univ, Dept Agribusiness & Appl Econ, 811 2nd Ave N, Fargo, ND 58102 USA.",lei.zhang.3@ndsu.edu,"Zhang, Lei/S-2463-2019","Zhang, Lei/0000-0003-4216-4452; Yi, Yimin/0000-0001-7920-5196",,,,,25,12,17,4,46,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1051-1377,1096-0791,,J HOUS ECON,J.

Associated macro models were mostly based on a single country. This paper sheds light on several aspects of pension economics when these assumptions do not hold using-to our knowledge-the first multi-country model of procrastinating households. Our focus is on the interaction between the share of procrastinators in a country, the speed and extent of population aging, and the size of an existing PAYG-DB pension system. Starting from the insight that procrastination reduces the volume of savings, we focus on three questions that are particularly relevant for the quickly aging Asian economies: What are the consequences for the balance between pay-as-you-go and fully funded pension systems? Where will retirement savings be invested in a globally linked world with very different pension systems and demographics?

Our main contribution is to introduce and explore the natural time lag of the climate system between emissions and damages to capital accumulation in an endogenous growth setting. This allows us to investigate how optimal climate policy, and its interplay with climate dynamics, affect long-run growth and the transition of the economy towards it. Without pollution decay, a higher speed of emissions diffusion steepens the growth profile of the economy. With pollution decay, this leads to lower short-run but higher long-run economic growth during transition.

Informed managers outperform after fees, uninformed managers underperform, while the average manager's performance depends on the number of noise allocators. Small investors should remain uninformed, but large and sophisticated investors benefit from searching for informed active managers since their search cost is low relative to capital.

To do so requires information on the nature and magnitude of market failures on the one hand, and government's capacity to redress them successfully on the other. This article reviews perspectives on vertical (sectoral) and horizontal (factor markets, cluster) policies with a view to both criteria. We first argue that the case for either vertical or horizontal policies cannot be made on the basis of the likelihood of successful implementation: for instance, educational policies and picking the winner types of policies both run the risks of capture and incompetent execution. However, the economics profession has been able to establish more convincing market failures for horizontal policies than for vertical policies. Most of the recent approaches to identifying failures around particular goods are of limited help. Hence, for a given difficulty of execution, the former are generally preferred. A second critical message is that improving the quality of governance in terms of collecting information, coordination ability, and defending against capture is critical to the successful implementation of productivity policies and should be central on the policy agenda.","[Maloney, William F.] World Bank Grp, Equitable Growth Finance & Inst Practice Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Nayyar, Gaurav] World Bank Grp, Finance Competitiveness & Innovat Global Practice, Washington, DC USA",The World Bank; The World Bank,"Maloney, WF (通讯作者)，World Bank Grp, Equitable Growth Finance & Inst Practice Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",wmaloney@worldbank.org,,,,,,,91,5,8,1,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0257-3032,1564-6971,,WORLD BANK RES OBSER,World Bank Res.

Thus, this paper covers a significant gap by approaching the universities' IC disclosure and bio-economy evolution. It also enriches the literature by underpinning the proposed model on the macroeconomics theories (public interest theory, stakeholders or agency theory). These theories supports the need to enhance transparency and accountability through greater disclosure levels. The empirical research performed by combining the qualitative analysis performed for developing the IC disclosure index with the quantitative techniques enable us to develop an econometric model on the Romanian public universities. It is aimed to express their role in the IC as a mean of achieving a sustainable economy. The study' results reveal that there is a strong connection between the IC disclosure and bio-economy, knowing that public universities are research clusters for innovative and durable economy environment.

We also propose additional moment conditions that can be used to reduce the biases caused by shifts in the mean of the data.,"[Chowdhury, Rosen Azad] Swansea Univ, Swansea, W Glam, Wales; [Russell, Bill] Univ Dundee, Sch Business, Dundee, Scotland",Swansea University; University of Dundee,"Chowdhury, RA (通讯作者)，Swansea Univ, Swansea, W Glam, Wales.",,,"chowdhury, rosen/0000-0003-1796-9603",,,,,15,2,2,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

The analysis is based on a two-stage DEA approach. In the first step, the efficiency of MN is estimated, by performing a VRS model (variable returns of scale) with input orientation. A total of six efficiency models are estimated, three of which relate to financial efficiency and three to social efficiency. The efficiency scores obtained in this first step are regressed in the second step on a set of environmental variables by following Simar and Wilson's bootstrap truncated procedure [2007], which is more robust than the conventional approaches based on a tobit regression. The results of the first stage show that the MFIs in the WAEMU area are not very efficient Inefficiency is both technical and of scale, but it is more likely to be explained by a poor technical combination of resources. It is more palpable socially than financially. The results of the post-dea estimate show that economic profitability is an essential determinant of financial and social efficiency. The MFIs that are most profitable economically are the most socially and financially efficient. The largest and oldest MFIs are also the least efficient at the social level. Similarly, MFIs with a non-commercial profile are the most efficient from the social point of view. However, the results show that environmental variables often have an impact that varies according to the type of model specified.","[Fall, Francois] Univ Toulouse, IEP Toulouse, UT2J, LEREPS, Toulouse, France; [Fall, Francois] Univ Dakar, CRES, Dakar, Senegal",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Universite de Toulouse - Jean Jaures; Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Institut d'Etudes Politiques Toulouse (SciencePo Toulouse),"Fall, F (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse, IEP Toulouse, UT2J, LEREPS, Toulouse, France.;Fall, F (通讯作者)，Univ Dakar, CRES, Dakar, Senegal.",Francois-Seck.Fall@ut-capitole.fr,,,,,,,48,2,2,0,2,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

The Buy and hold effect slows down this growth as it freezes the exchange of these assets in the secondary market. In this perspective, this paper introduces an approach aiming at improving Sukuk exchange by using the diversity of the investors' risk profiles. Through this study that applies several investment strategies based on rebalancing, we demonstrate that these strategies have the potential to boost the Sukuk market's growth. This is actually due to the fact that the investor can choose among these strategies according to his investment profile and his market anticipation. However, this approach's effectiveness is conditioned to the adherence of a large number of investors. In terms of contribution, this paper fills the gap in the literature by introducing a pragmatic approach to reduce the impact of the Buy and Hold effect on the Sukuk market.

We show empirically that borrowers who bought additional life insurance coverage were significantly more likely to fully repay their loan, and were allowed to receive higher loan amounts, even after controlling for borrower health and other determinants of loan repayment and insurance purchase. The relationship is stronger in magnitude for new borrowers' first loan than for their second loan, and in several situations in which borrowers would have a higher incentive to signal their creditworthiness. We interpret this evidence as borrowers signaling their creditworthiness (or quality) by purchasing costly insurance in an environment subject to a high level of information asymmetries and devoid of credible tools to demonstrate creditworthiness.

The tests include merger-firm fixed effects to exploit the variation in changes to coworkers across branches of the same firm. The probability of an advisor committing misconduct increases if his new coworkers, encountered in the merger, have a history of misconduct.

However, the estimated effects of tax increase on smoking behavior vary substantially, underscoring the need to identify moderating variables. We examined whether behavioral disengagement the tendency to abandon goals when experiencing stress modified the association between cigarette taxes and daily smoking behavior. We connected state-level cigarette tax rate data with individual-level behavioral data, including a national sample of 725 US adults who smoked daily at baseline and reported follow-up data approximately 10 years later, and 376 who were resampled a third time after another 10 years. Analyses involved multilevel logistic regression (with time as a nested variable and anonymized state codes as a grouping variable), where current smoking status (dichotomous) was regressed on behavioral disengagement, state level cigarette tax at baseline and current time, and the interaction between disengagement and current tax. Consistent with hypotheses, tax rate interacted with disengagement (OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.90, 0.99, p = .0255): Among those one SD above the mean for disengagement, tax rate was unassociated with quit ratio (OR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.85, 1.16, p = .6975). However, among those one SD below the mean, tax rate was significantly associated with higher quit ratio (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.04, 1.43, p = .0163). Our data suggest the possibility that cigarette taxes may be more effective in facilitating cessation among smokers low in behavioral disengagement or when accompanied by interventions that reduce stress or maintain goal pursuit. Identifying psychological moderators of policy effectiveness holds promise for improving policy design and targeting.","[Ferrer, Rebecca A.] NCI, Basic Biobehav & Psychol Sci Branch, Behav Res Program, 9609 Med Ctr Dr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Orehek, Edward] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Scheier, Michael F.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Psychol, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [O'Connell, Mary E.] NCI, Behav Res Program, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA",National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Cancer Institute (NCI); Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Carnegie Mellon University; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Cancer Institute (NCI),"Ferrer, RA (通讯作者)，NCI, Basic Biobehav & Psychol Sci Branch, Behav Res Program, 9609 Med Ctr Dr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",ferrerra@mail.nih.gov; orehek@pitt.edu; scheier@cmu.edu; Mary.O'Connell@nih.gov,,,National Institute on Aging [P01-AG020166],National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),The MIDUS 2 research was supported by a grant from the National Institute on Aging (P01-AG020166) to conduct a longitudinal follow-up of the MIDUS 1 investigation.

The opposite relationships between these two components and the equity premium explains the stronger link found between the downside VRP and the equity premium compared with the well-established relationship between VRP and the equity premium.

Using a unique Canadian administrative database that links the event of the involuntary layoff with detailed data on income receipt, we track all of their sources of income over an interval spanning five years after layoff. We conduct a multivariate statistical analysis of the incidence of relying on income from several alternative sources, specifically early retirement (both public and private), reemployment, self-employment, or reliance on social insurance benefits (other than pensions). The two most common states for laid-off workers who have not yet reached normal retirement age are early retirement and continued labour market activity. Our findings indicate that the older workers are at the point of layoff, the greater the likelihood is that they will rely on pension income as their primary income source. This incidence of reliance on pension income also increases with the number of years elapsed since the point of layoff.","[Finnie, Ross] Univ Ottawa, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Gray, David] Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa,"Finnie, R (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",,,,,,,,20,4,4,0,21,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

Empirical research shows, for example, that false news generates persistent abnormal returns and affects trading volume. Studies also show that institutions often know about news before it breaks. However, the role institutions play in false news events is still unclear. To understand that role, we track institutional order flow around the release of false news in the Chinese stock market. We find that institutions seem to have early information about false news releases. Their prerelease order flows predict false news sentiments and market reactions. We further find that the early information may come from the media outlets reporting the false news. We also find evidence that institutions reverse their positions several days after the denial releases rather than when the news breaks. In turn, our evidence shows which trading patterns could bring more potential profits than reversing right on the news breaks. Our results provide unique insights into price movements and institutional reactions on false news, as well as evidence regarding regulating institutions, media platforms, and information manipulation in the stock market.

Advances made by the Colombian government to achieve greater security within the country - putting an end to the long-standing armed conflict - and to promote ecotourism can help position Colombia as one of the most important bird watching destinations worldwide. This study estimates the economic benefits from bird-based tourism in post-war Colombia. In particular, we estimate the value that members of the US-based National Audubon Society place on a birding tour that includes the participation of local communities (some of whom were victims of the armed conflict), and visits to important areas for bird watching that are increasingly accessible. The study also approximates the demand for international bird watching tourism to the country. Through the application of the contingent valuation method, we show that birding enthusiasts would be willing to pay, on average, an additional $58 per person per day for a tour in Colombia, as compared to a similar tour in terms of duration and services in Costa Rica, currently one of the main tourism destinations for birdwatchers. Our analysis indicates that a total of 278,850 North American bird watchers would be interested in visiting the country, generating an annual profit of $9 million and 7516 new jobs. In addition to confirming demand for bird-based travel, the study provides information about potential visitors' preferences, which can help guide the development of a strategy to promote bird-based tourism to Colombia.

Using simulation models, we investigate the racial and socioeconomic distribution of students among colleges under the use of race- or SES-based affirmative action policies, or targeted, race-based recruitment policies. We find, first, that neither SES-based affirmative action nor race-targeted recruiting on their own produce levels of racial diversity achieved by race-based affirmative action. However, the two policies in combination, although likely expensive, may yield racial diversity comparable to race-based affirmative action. Second, the use of affirmative action policies by some colleges reduces the diversity of similar-quality colleges without such policies. Third, the combination of SES-based affirmative action and race recruiting results in fewer academically-overmatched Black and Hispanic students than under race-based affirmative action, but the schools that use both also see a reduction in the academic achievement of enrolled students.","[Reardon, Sean F.] Stanford Grad Sch Educ, Poverty & Inequal Educ, CERAS Bldg,520 Galvez Mall,526, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Reardon, Sean F.] Stanford Grad Sch Educ, Sociol, CERAS Bldg,520 Galvez Mall,526, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Baker, Rachel] Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Educ, Educ 3200, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Kasman, Matt] Brookings Inst, Ctr Social Dynam & Policy, 1775 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Klasik, Daniel] George Washington Univ, Grad Sch Educ & Human Dev, 2134 G St NW, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Townsend, Joseph B.] Stanford Grad Sch Educ, CERAS Bldg,520 Galvez Mall,Fifth Floor, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; Brookings Institution; George Washington University,"Reardon, SF (通讯作者)，Stanford Grad Sch Educ, Poverty & Inequal Educ, CERAS Bldg,520 Galvez Mall,526, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Reardon, SF (通讯作者)，Stanford Grad Sch Educ, Sociol, CERAS Bldg,520 Galvez Mall,526, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",sean.reardon@stanford.edu; rachelbb@uci.edu; mkasman@brookings.edu; djklasik@gwu.edu; jtownsen@stanford.edu,,"reardon, sean/0000-0002-0465-965X; Klasik, Daniel/0000-0003-4038-155X","Network on Inequality, Complexity, and Health - National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) [HHSN276200800013C]; Educational Testing Service (ETS)","Network on Inequality, Complexity, and Health - National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR); Educational Testing Service (ETS)","This paper was supported by the Network on Inequality, Complexity, and Health, funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) (Award HHSN276200800013C) and by the Educational Testing Service (ETS).

Therefore, the purpose of the paper is the quantitative assessment of the circular economy in the OECD countries based on the indicators assembled by the authors. The goal set was achieved through both a theoretical and empirical objective. The theoretical objective is to combine and group indicators referring to the circular economy, as they are present in the literature. The empirical objective is to develop a model of causal analysis with significance for circular economy practice, based on indicators that measure economic growth, research-development, education, recycling. To achieve the empirical objective, cluster analysis, correlation analysis and path analysis were applied. The authors' contribution consists of adapting circular economy indicators to the 5 newly created classes and applying the statistical methods mentioned in the OECD circular economy analysis. The results of empirical research reflect, on the one hand, the classification of countries for a set of indicators of the circular economy and the significant links and dependencies between the indicators analysed on the other.","[Cautisanu, Cristina; Asandului, Laura; Borza, Mioara; Turturean, Ciprian] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Cautisanu, C (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania.",cautisanucristina@yahoo.com,"Asandului, Laura/AAG-7622-2021; Mihăilă, Mioara/HKE-4961-2023; Turturean, Ciprian/AAE-9917-2019; Cristina, Cautisanu/M-5695-2015","Cristina, Cautisanu/0000-0002-4457-1185",,,,,23,20,20,6,46,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2018,20.0,48,,,,,262,277,,10.24818/EA/2018/48/262,0.0,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GN9XV,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439567500003,0

The data show significant differences in the intensity of enforcement across Europe. The empirical tests are highly consistent with the view that the intensity of enforcement is the most statistically robust and economically significant predictor of market abuse detection. In particular, the data identify three important arms of enforcement: the number of supervisors, which enhances detection; formalized cooperation, which facilitates surveillance; and imprisonment, which facilitates deterrence.

This study finds that the relationship between child nutrition and maternal group participation depends on the level of maternal education. In fact, maternal group participation is positively associated with child height-for-age when children were 1 year old, for those children whose mothers had had no formal education. This same association fades at 5 years of age. Maternal group participation may affect child nutrition through a number of mechanisms. This paper provides suggestive evidence on the positive role that this participation might play in promoting better breastfeeding practice and a more secure mother-child bond and in easing mothers' access to additional resources and support.","[Favara, Marta] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Favara, Marta] IZA Inst Lab Econ, Bonn, Germany",University of Oxford; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Favara, M (通讯作者)，Dept Int Dev, 3 Mansfield Rd, Oxford OX1 3TB, England.",marta.favara@qeh.ox.ac.uk,,"Favara, Marta/0000-0002-5764-4654",,,,,34,0,0,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

The differences in daily travel (e.g., commute to work) between urban and peri-urban areas have been comprehensively researched. However, other travel domains (e.g., occasional weekend trips or holidays) have only recently received more attention, despite their environmental impact. The paper investigates whether and how daily travel patterns (modality styles) correspond with non-daily travel behaviour such as holidays and longer weekend trips in order to establish a more comprehensive understanding of the role of urban structure in travel behaviour across different travel domains. The study is based on a questionnaire survey, which was conducted in an urban district in central Copenhagen and a small town in the commuter belt of Greater Copenhagen in spring 2016. First, we identify modality styles by grouping the sample based on the respondents' daily mode choices. Second, we relate the identified modality styles to socio-economic and socio-demographic factors, frequency and mode choice of longer weekend trips and holidays, and travel-related attitudes. The results reveal that the urban structure of a residential location (e.g., urban vs. peri-urban) exerts to some extent influence on the constitution of daily modality styles. We found, furthermore, a tendency for more weekend trips and holidays among the urban sample; we interpret this as interdependency between modality style, residential location, car ownership/use, and plane use expressed in certain travel behaviour.","[Grosse, Juliane; Olafsson, Anton Stahl; Carstensen, Trine Agervig; Fertner, Christian] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Grosse, J (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",jg@ign.ku.dk; asol@ign.ku.dk; tac@ign.ku.dk; chfe@ign.ku.dk,"Große, Juliane/C-8929-2015; Fertner, Christian/AAQ-1029-2020; Olafsson, Anton/D-1002-2015; Carstensen, Trine Agervig/C-8504-2015","Große, Juliane/0000-0002-0964-7789; Fertner, Christian/0000-0001-6112-3328; Olafsson, Anton/0000-0002-7940-8126; Carstensen, Trine Agervig/0000-0002-2133-1621",,,,,68,28,28,3,38,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Based on this definition, we present stylized facts on firm recovery using data on firms from 106 countries in the aftermath of the crisis, and we focus in particular on the relationship between firms' recovery and their financial constraints. Using a probit model, we find that firms with stronger financial constraints tend to experience a more sluggish recovery from the financial crisis than those with weaker constraints. Furthermore, a well-developed bank financing market and a bank-oriented financial structure contribute to firms' recovery by easing their financial constraints, but the effect of capital market financing is ambiguous. Although expansionary fiscal and monetary policies are helpful for a speedy recovery, only expansionary monetary policies effectively stimulate firms' recovery by easing their financial constraints.","[Jin, Yuying; Luo, Mingjin] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Business, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Wan, Chao] Shanghai Lixin Univ Accounting & Finance, Sch Int Econ & Trade, Shanghai 201209, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Shanghai Lixin University of Accounting & Finance,"Luo, MJ (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Business, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",luo_mingjin@163.com,"Wan, Chao/U-9803-2019","Wan, Chao/0000-0001-5566-4849; Jin, Yuying/0000-0001-6416-0140",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71703086]; National Social Science Foundation of China [12AZD051]; MOE Project of Humanities and Social Sciences [12YJC790180],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); MOE Project of Humanities and Social Sciences,"We acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71703086), the National Social Science Foundation of China (No. 12AZD051), and MOE Project of Humanities and Social Sciences (No.12YJC790180).",,37,18,18,5,27,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

It assesses the dynamics of web platform evolution towards sectoral innovation eco-system in tourism. Applying case study methodology and unique data set we analyse the Bank of Tourism Potentials in Slovenia (BTPS), a web platform for the promotion of innovation in tourism. BTPS is considered an organizational innovation that leverages innovation in tourism and results in a number of new services, processes and business models. The originality of the paper derives from an in-depth analysis of actors' networking, collaboration and mutual learning in implementing innovation. The characteristics of interactions between actors translate into the emerging patterns of BTPS development and suggest that the web platform is assuming the characteristics of the innovation eco-system in tourism that can be transferred to other environments as well.

Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) is a technique for expanding transit access through redesign of existing roadways with dedicated bus lanes and spaced stations for rapid operation, with associated pedestrian improvements. Such innovations prompt intriguing questions. How does BRT planning reimagine accessibility to transport networks and urban streets, and with what implications for socio-spatial relations and justice? We analyze plans, public debates, and interviews with key stakeholders in a proposed BRT corridor along Chicago's diverse and busy Ashland Avenue. Results show how BRT planning rethinks transit networks through purposeful reallocation of street spaces, interpreted relative to efficiency and equity. But if BRT planners promote transit improvements and complete streets as questions of fairness, they confront engineering and business interests in vehicular mobility and parking, highlighting enduring obstacles to multimodal accessibility and mobility justice.","[Sukaryavichute, Elina; Prytherch, David L.] Miami Univ, Dept Geog, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; [Sukaryavichute, Elina] Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA",University System of Ohio; Miami University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Sukaryavichute, E (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",esukarya@uncc.edu; prythedl@miamioh.edu,,,[01688e],,"We would like to thank all the interviewees who participated in our research in Summer 2015.

However, enabling franchisees to develop their ventures may damage system consistency. This dilemma makes conflict particularly prevalent in the field of franchising. Nevertheless, prior research has reported an incomplete picture of factors leading to serious disagreement and premature termination in franchise partnerships. We address this gap, first, by adding the entrepreneurial autonomy of franchisees as a relevant but underexplored source of conflict and, second, by providing a more fine-grained analysis of franchisors' versus franchisees' drivers of termination. Specifically, we focus on the controversial issues of pricing and local advertising policies and analyze how expanding franchisees' entrepreneurial autonomy in these decision areas is related to contract terminations depending on who ended the relationship (the franchisor or a franchisee). The study also highlights less controversial requirements and conditions (e.g., upfront investments, franchisor experience aEuro broken vertical bar) that may reduce early terminations. Our empirical objectives are met by using survey data from a sample of franchisor companies. The results show how the performance outcomes of entrepreneurial autonomy differ depending on the decision area in which it is exercised. Results also throw light on the consequences of various critical franchise policies that may be masked if both types of termination (franchisors vs. franchisees) are considered together.","[Lopez-Fernandez, Begona; Lopez-Bayon, Susana] Univ Oviedo, Dept Business Adm, Fac Econ & Empresa, Avda Cristo S-N, E-33071 Oviedo, Asturias, Spain",University of Oviedo,"López-Fernández, B (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Dept Business Adm, Fac Econ & Empresa, Avda Cristo S-N, E-33071 Oviedo, Asturias, Spain.",blopez@uniovi.es; sbayon@uniovi.es,"López-Bayón, Susana/AEQ-0279-2022; Lopez-Fernandez, Begona/AAE-1090-2020","Lopez-Fernandez, Begona/0000-0001-5432-0446",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [MINECO-13-ECO2013-40407R],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),This paper has benefited from the support of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO-13-ECO2013-40407R).,,98,20,21,1,46,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Out-of-sample results show that combination forecasts with GARCH-class models can achieve high forecast accuracy.

To explain this behavior, we develop a novel model featuring direct competition between heterogeneous firms to hire workers. This simultaneously endogenizes both average match productivity and the division of output between workers and firms. In existing matches, wages partly reflect labor market conditions at the time of hiring. A positive TFP shock therefore reduces the aggregate labor share, making it counter-cyclical. However, greater competition and lower unemployment increase labor's share among new firms. As more firms enter, the aggregate labor share rises and eventually overshoots its initial level, as in the data. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Another aim is to define and analyze the transport potential of the rural elderly population. The paper is based on research carried out in 2012 and 2013 in rural areas of Serbia. The data were collected through a household survey specially designed for rural areas, from a sample of 346 elderly respondents. Based on the data analysis, it was found that mobility of the rural elderly population in Serbia is generally low, but there are significant differences among rural settlements with different accessibility, with age and possession of a driving license having a major impact on mobility. It was also found that the transport alternative choice set of the majority of respondents consists of four modes of transport, which is due to the fact that the rural elderly live in multi-member households. However, considering the identified demographic trends in Serbian rural areas, the transport potential of the elderly is likely to be lower in the future, and this should inform future rural transport policy with the aim of mitigating transport deprivation and social exclusion.","[Plazinic, Biljana Rankovic; Jovic, Jadranka] Univ Belgrade, Fac Transport & Traff Engn, Vojvode Stepe 305, Belgrade 11000, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Plazinic, BR (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Fac Transport & Traff Engn, Vojvode Stepe 305, Belgrade 11000, Serbia.",b.plazinic@sf.bg.ac.rs,,,,,,,54,37,38,9,46,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

J,"Breedon, F",,,,"Breedon, Francis",,,On the transactions costs of UK quantitative easing,JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Quantitative easing; Auctions; Government bonds,FINANCIAL MARKET IMPACT; AUCTIONS,Most quantitative easing programmes primarily involve central banks acquiring government liabilities in return for central bank reserves. In all cases this process is undertaken by purchasing these liabilities from private sector intermediaries rather than directly from the government. This paper estimates the cost of this round-trip transaction - government issuance of liabilities and central bank purchases of those liabilities in the secondary market - for the UK. I estimate that this cost amounts to about 0.5% of the total value of QE (over E1.8 billion in my sample). I also find some evidence that this figure is inflated by the unusual design of UK QE operations. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Our findings show evidence of instability in standard cointegration models, suggesting the possibility of structural breaks and nonlinearity in the relationship between house prices and non-housing CPI. This motivates the use of a time-varying approach, namely, a quantile cointegration analysis, which allows the cointegrating coefficient to vary over the conditional distribution of house prices and simultaneously test for the existence of cointegration at each quantile. Our results suggest that the U.S non-housing CPI and house price index series are cointegrated at lower quantiles only, with house prices over-hedging inflation at these quantiles. In addition, we also show that this result holds for higher price levels only. Using these two sets of results, we conclude that house prices act as an inflation hedge when the latter is relatively higher and the former is lower.","[Christou, Christina] Open Univ Cyprus, Sch Econ & Management, CY-2220 Latsia, Cyprus; [Gupta, Rangan; Nyakabawo, Wendy] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Wohar, Mark E.] Univ Nebraska, CoIlege Business Adm, 6708 Pine St, Omaha, NE 68182 USA; [Wohar, Mark E.] Loughborough Univ Technol, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",Open University of Cyprus; University of Pretoria; University of Nebraska System; Loughborough University,"Wohar, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, CoIlege Business Adm, 6708 Pine St, Omaha, NE 68182 USA.",christina.christou@ouc.ac.cy; rangan.gupta@up.ac.za; wnyakabawo@gmail.com; mwohar@unomaha.edu,,,,,,,65,18,18,1,27,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

Levered banks take excessive risk as their actions are not fully priced at the margin by debt holders. The impact of government guarantees on bank risk taking depends critically on the portion of bank investors that can observe bank behavior and hence price debt at the margin. Greater guarantees increase risk taking (moral hazard) when informed investors hold a sufficiently large fraction of liabilities. But, otherwise, they reduce risk taking by increasing the profits of the bank (franchise value effect). The results extend to the case in which information disclosure and, thus, the portion of informed investors is endogenous but costly. The model also shows that, when bank capital is endogenous, public guarantees lead unequivocally to an increase in bank leverage and an associated increase in risk taking. The analysis points to a complex relationship between prudential policy and the institutional framework governing bank resolution and bailouts.","[Cordella, Tito] World Bank, Dev Econ, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Dell'Ariccia, Giovanni] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Dell'Ariccia, Giovanni] CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA; [Marquez, Robert] Univ Calif Davis, Finance, Davis, CA 95616 USA",The World Bank; International Monetary Fund; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); University of California System; University of California Davis,"Dell'Ariccia, G (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.;Dell'Ariccia, G (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA.",gdellariccia@imf.org,"Marquez, Robert/C-4963-2017; Cordella, Tito/AAN-1891-2020","Cordella, Tito/0000-0001-5520-165X",,,,,38,15,15,3,28,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

Both policies are committed to welfarism - i.e. to respecting individuals' subjective reflected attitudes as the basis of judgment about what is good for them. However, because the two policy types affect behavior change in different ways, different normative requirements arise from this commitment. Nudges affect the choice context so as to change behavior, making use of behavioral evidence for stable relations between contextual features and behavioral outcomes. This intervention works irrespective of the nudged individual's understanding, evaluation or participation. Consequently, it is the nudge proponent who must argue that in the planned intervention, the nudge corrects a mistake and leads to a better outcome that is not compromised by the nudging procedure. Boosts, in contrast, affect behavior by training people in the use of decision tools. This intervention works only with the boosted individual's understanding, approval and active participation. Consequently, the boost proponent does not need to answer the difficult normative questions of mistake, welfare improvement or procedural compromise. Although it might be that nudge proponents can answer these questions for many situations, they constitute a normative burden for nudges that boosts can avoid. In this regard, boosts are therefore preferable to nudges.","[Grune-Yanoff, Till] Royal Inst Technol KTH, Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology,"Grüne-Yanoff, T (通讯作者)，Royal Inst Technol KTH, Stockholm, Sweden.",gryne@kth.se,,,,,,,43,12,13,5,19,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Measured in terms of volatility exposure, the market is economically small, but it embeds a significant latent exposure to large price changes. Out-of-the-money puts are the dominant component of open positions. Variation in options use is well described by a stochastic trend driven by equity market activity and a significant negative response to increases in risk. Using a rich collection of uncertainty proxies, we distinguish distinct responses to exogenous macroeconomic risk, risk aversion, differences of opinion, and disaster risk.

In this paper we extract market expectations for UK CPI inflation with the help of UK RPI-linked gilt prices, which is a novelty in the literature. To better extract useful information about expectations for CPI inflation, we develop a no-arbitrage term structure model and decompose the forward inflation curve into: measures of CPI inflation expectations; the expected wedge between RPI and CPI inflation; estimates of inflation risk premia and estimates of liquidity risk premia. We show that long-horizon expectations of CPI inflation fell in the 1990 s, after the introduction of inflation targeting and the creation of the MPC, and have since remained fairly stable at around 2%.
