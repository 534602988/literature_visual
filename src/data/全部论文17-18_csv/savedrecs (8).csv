The authors use instrumental variable quantile regression and data from the Swiss Labor Force Survey to identify the causal link between education and wages at different quantiles of the conditional distribution of wages. The results provide evidence that there is no unique causal effect of schooling and that for each individual the effect may deviate from those extensively documented by ordinary least squares or two-stage least squares. In particular, while ordinary quantile regression estimates increasing returns in the quantile index, once the endogeneity of schooling is taken into account the authors instead observe higher returns at lower quantiles of the wage distribution. Interpreting the quantile index as a measure of unobserved ability, the results suggest that higher ability individuals have higher wages, but the slope of their wage-education profile is flatter than that for lower ability individuals.","[Balestra, Simone; Backes-Gellner, Uschi] Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Balestra, S (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",simone.balestra@uzh.ch,"Backes-Gellner, Uschi/D-6652-2014","Backes-Gellner, Uschi/0000-0002-7511-9757","Swiss National Science Foundation [PBZHP1-147219]; Swiss Federal Office for Professional Education and Technology through Leading House on the Economics of Education, Firm Behavior and Training Policies; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [PBZHP1_147219] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)","Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss Federal Office for Professional Education and Technology through Leading House on the Economics of Education, Firm Behavior and Training Policies; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF))","We are grateful to Joshua Angrist, Eric Bettinger, Giorgio Brunello, David Card, Thomas Dee, Yingying Dong, Joop Hartog, Guido Imbens, Simon Janssen, Matthias Krapf, Edward Lazear, Pedro Martins, Hessel Oosterbeek, Aderonke Osikominu, Eric Taylor, Niels Westergaard-Nielsen, and Ludger Woessmann for their constructive comments and valuable help.

We propose new approaches, related to Reny's work, and obtain tight conditions for the existence of approximate equilibria and of sharing rule solutions in pure and mixed strategies (Simon and Zame, 1990).

These preferences have been shown to lead to price premiums and subsequent underperformance. This study extends this growing body of literature by testing whether the underperformance of stocks with positive skewness is driven by periods of high investor sentiment. The motivation for these tests is based on a broad literature in Psychology that an individual's mood can directly affect the individual's subjective probability assessments. In the framework of our tests, more optimism among investors may strengthen investors' skewness preferences. The empirical results in this study support this idea as the underperformance of positively skewed stocks is shown to be primarily driven by periods of high investor sentiment.","[Blau, Benjamin M.] Utah State Univ, Jon M Huntsman Sch Business, 3565 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Blau, BM (通讯作者)，Utah State Univ, Jon M Huntsman Sch Business, 3565 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",ben.blau@usu.edu,,"Blau, Benjamin/0000-0002-5260-3378",,,,,28,7,7,1,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

However, there is very scant research on the factors underlying the World Trade Organization (WTO) members' regulatory process. The aim of this paper is to fill that gap, examining the main determinants for the development of SPS regulation considering the notifications presented by WTO members. A negative binomial regression was estimated, where the dependent variable was the number of SPS measures notified during the period 1995-2012 by WTO members, while the explanatory variables were related to each country: (1) agricultural production value; (2) agricultural imports weight; (3) health concerns; (4) agricultural import tariffs; and (5) scientific and legal capacities. The results provide evidence that legal and scientific capacities are major factors in the number of notifications presented by WTO members. On the other hand, those countries with a higher relative weight of the agricultural sector in the economy or of agricultural products in their imports have notified fewer SPS measures. This leads to the conclusion that it is necessary to reinforce actions that strengthen institutional and technical capacities for further convergence.","[Boza, Sofia; Munoz, Jazmin] Univ Chile, Fac Agr Sci, Dept Agr Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Boza, Sofia; Munoz, Jazmin] Univ Chile, Inst Int Studies, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile; Universidad de Chile,"Boza, S (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Fac Agr Sci, Dept Agr Econ, Santiago, Chile.;Boza, S (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Inst Int Studies, Santiago, Chile.",sofiaboza@u.uchile.cl,"Boza, Sofia/I-6122-2016",,,,,,45,5,7,0,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

From the perspective of social construction theory, the authors of the article analyze the problems of forming a common Russian identity among the citizens of Ekaterinburg (Russia) and migrants of different ethnicities from Central Asia. Using the methods of questionnaire survey, correlation analysis, analysis of social distance based on the Bogardus scale, and analysis for study groups, the authors define a set of cultural factors that determine attitudes towards migrants of different ethnicities. The authors of the article are sure that forming a common social identity for members of the host community and migrants of different ethnicities is complicated by the divergence of their cultural norms and rules and the reluctance of the host community to change under the conditions of the transformation of the external environment due to migration streams. The fact that the hosts do not understand the expedience of receiving so many external migrants also has a large impact.","[Britvina, Irina; Savchuk, Galina; Shumilova, Polina] Ural Fed Univ, Mira St 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia",Ural Federal University,"Britvina, I (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, Mira St 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia.",irina.britvina@urfu.ru; galina.savchuk@urfu.ru; polina_shumilova@mail.ru,"Britvina, Irina/N-9616-2013; Shumilova, Polina/Q-1831-2016; Savchuk, Galina/AAM-8922-2021",,Russian Foundation for Basic Research [No16-33-00010/17-O],Russian Foundation for Basic Research(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)Spanish Government),The work was supported by grant No16-33-00010/17-O Gamma OH P Phi Phi(sic) provided by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research.,,11,0,0,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,205,214,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455325300020,0

This paper is based on the thesis that the convergence process is proven if the clusters are gathering in shorter squared Euclidean distances during the time, or, alternatively, if the distances between European Union economies and Germany are shorter. First, in order to perform the cluster analysis, the convergence criteria are identified (the choice of the criteria is based on optimum currency area). Second, with regards to the criteria, we conduct thirteen cluster analyses for every year of the period 2001 - 2013. From this perspective, we focus on the differences between the analyses' outputs during the time.

The efficiency and competitiveness of territories are features that may be analysed through various parametric-type and non-parametric-type methodologies and with the construction of composite indicators. In reviewing recent literature, this article tackles the theme of measurement and assessment of the logistics and infrastructure divide with reference to the search for greater logistic efficiency and territorial competitiveness, in function of the specificities of local production systems and pursuable models of development in the global context. The purpose of this paper is twofold: to review the prevailing methods used to estimate regional efficiency and logistics competitiveness and to focus on an Italian case study. Focusing on the application of an original composite index to the Italian case study, the main insight of our analysis is that composite indicators could help policy-makers to evaluate the requirements of infrastructural interventions and logistics services, in close keeping with the characteristics of the local economic system.","[Carlucci, Fabio] Univ Salerno, Via Giovanni Paolo II,132, I-84084 Fisciano, Italy; [Cira, Andrea] Univ Messina, Via Verdi,75, I-98122 Messina, Italy; [Forte, Ennio] Univ Naples Federico II, Via Cintia Monte S Angelo, I-80126 Naples, Italy; [Siviero, Lucio] Univ Catania, Corso Italia,55, I-95129 Catania, Italy",University of Salerno; University of Messina; University of Naples Federico II; University of Catania,"Cira, A (通讯作者)，Univ Messina, Via Verdi,75, I-98122 Messina, Italy.",acira@unime.it,,"CARLUCCI, Fabio/0000-0003-2911-6528",,,,,50,12,13,0,25,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

In particular, under the assumption of the interdependence of military spending between US and European countries, we analyse whether US military spending affected European sovereign debt in the period 1988-2013. The empirical estimation is based on different steps: (i) a unit root test; (ii) an Arellano-Bond panel estimation and a linear fixed effect model; and (iii) a FMOLS estimation to highlight the long run relationship between debt and relevant variables.

Together with two standard properties, efficiency and the null player property, differential marginality characterizes the Shapley value. For games that contain more than two players, we show that this characterization can be improved by using a substantially weaker property than differential marginality.

We find that these confidence intervals are so wide (a situation not peculiar to our example) that it seems impossible to make absolute remarks about the merits of adding art-related assets to stocks portfolios. Moreover, our results suggest that previous conclusions regarding the correlation between art and stocks should be taken with some scepticism.","[Charlin, Ventura] VC Consultants, Santiago, Chile; [Cifuentes, Arturo] Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Financial Regulat Ctr, Diagonal Paraguay 257,13th Floor, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile,"Cifuentes, A (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Financial Regulat Ctr, Diagonal Paraguay 257,13th Floor, Santiago, Chile.",arturo.cifuentes@fen.uchile.cl,"Charlin, Ventura/D-5525-2014; Charlin, Ventura/C-4871-2017","Charlin, Ventura/0000-0001-6580-9837; Charlin, Ventura/0000-0001-6580-9837",,,,,13,2,4,1,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The results of U.K. banks acquiring domestic banks indicates higher and statistically significant abnormal returns of 1.628% at 5% significance level as compared to cross-border returns gained by U.K. acquiring banks. The research found an overall insignificant abnormal return of -0.448% for shareholders of the acquiring banks for the entire portfolio.

Using NFL (1995-2014) and NBA (2005-2014) data from preseason games, we examine the pricing efficiency of point spreads in these markets and consider evidence of systematic mispricing. Findings suggest point spreads are too large in these situations, providing a profitable betting opportunity for those willing to systematically wager on underdogs. Similar findings are not seen within the context of NFL or NBA regular seasons. These findings are more pronounced as preseason point spreads become larger. Further stratification by week of the NFL preseason demonstrates that underdogs discontinue their superior performance for the one week (Week 3) in which clubs tend to expel a higher level of effort.","[Davis, Justin L.] Univ West Florida, Dept Management & MIS, Pensacola, FL USA; [Krieger, Kevin] Univ West Florida, Dept Accounting & Finance, Bldg 76,Room 224,11000 Univ Pkwy, Pensacola, FL 32514 USA",State University System of Florida; University of West Florida; State University System of Florida; University of West Florida,"Krieger, K (通讯作者)，Univ West Florida, Dept Accounting & Finance, Bldg 76,Room 224,11000 Univ Pkwy, Pensacola, FL 32514 USA.",kevinkrieger@uwf.edu,"Davis, Justin/ITV-7226-2023",,,,,,20,3,3,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Collusion had a smaller effect on first and second class service relative to third class service. Its effects were proportionately stronger eastbound, but less important in absolute numbers given smaller eastbound traffic. Collusion-driven consumer substitution across classes was small but non-negligible. Thus, collusion affected migrant traffic far more than tourist/business traffic. We also confirm that collusion led to higher fares across all cabin classes, especially for steerage. We construct and calibrate an analytical model and show that the pattern of observed prices and volumes are consistent with a profit-maximizing cartel, thus buttressing the hypothesis that the collusion effects were causal.

Unit root tests, consistent momentum threshold autoregressive (M-TAR) models and vector error correction models (asymmetric and symmetric) are employed to achieve research objectives. The results suggest that provincial wheat and flour markets may have a long-run relationship with principal market of Kabul. Afghan wheat and flour markets may also be cointegrated with their respective global, Kazakh and Pakistani markets. While provincial wheat markets might adjust to divergence from their long-run equilibrium with Kabul wheat market, some of the provincial flour markets may not respond to deviation from their long-run equilibrium with Kabul flour market. The speed of adjustment towards the long-run Afghan-Pakistani and Afghan-Kazakh equilibrium may be faster for Afghan flour than wheat markets. The equilibrium adjustment coefficients are generally small and market imperfections may exist, however. A shock in Kabul wheat and flour markets may have long-lasting effect on the respective provincial markets whereas a shock in global wheat and Pakistani, and Kazakh wheat and flour markets might have transitory effect on the corresponding Afghan markets.","[Hassanzoy, Najibullah] Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Bioresource & Bioenvironm Sci, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Fukuoka, Japan; [Ito, Shoichi; Isoda, Hiroshi] Kyushu Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Fac Agr, Fukuoka, Japan; [Amekawa, Yuichiro] Kyushu Univ, Fac Agr, Fukuoka, Japan",Kyushu University; Kyushu University; Kyushu University,"Hassanzoy, N (通讯作者)，Kyushu Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Grad Sch Bioresource & Bioenvironm Sci, Higashi Ku, Hakozaki 6-10-1, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan.",hassanzoyn@gmail.com,,"Hassanzoy, Najibullah/0000-0002-1991-8466",Kyushu University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17H04549] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Kyushu University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",The journal submission fee for this work is paid by the Kyushu University.,,34,6,7,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This review surveys work on nonparametric welfare analysis, focusing on work that allows for general heterogeneity in demand, such as that of Hausman & Newey (2016).","[Hausman, Jerry A.; Newey, Whitney K.] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Hausman, JA (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",jhausman@mit.edu; wnewey@mit.edu,,,,,,,39,8,9,3,6,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4609-6,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

This contribution primarily concentrates on a particular quantitative approach to measuring the systemic risk, which seems to be a significant risk in today's financial world (not solely in banks and insurance companies). The marginal expected shortfall measure is based on the well-known concept of the expected shortfall. More specifically, it can be regarded as a conditional version of the expected shortfall in which the global returns exceed a given market drop. We shall demonstrate that the marginal expected shortfall is a useful risk measure when studying the Prague Stock Exchange index and all its constituents. The corresponding modelling scheme is introduced and discussed. It is extended in such a way that one can describe time-varying dependencies using the multivariate GARCH modelling class. Moreover, such an econometric approach enables to forecast the capital shortfall over a potentially long period (e.g. a quarter or half year), which might be appreciated in financial and insurance practice.","[Hendrych, Radek; Cipra, Tomas] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Dept Probabil & Math Stat, Sokolovska 83, Prague 18675 8, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Hendrych, R (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Dept Probabil & Math Stat, Sokolovska 83, Prague 18675 8, Czech Republic.",hendrych@karlin.mff.cuni.cz; cipra@karlin.mff.cuni.cz,"Hendrych, Radek/O-8266-2017; Cipra, Tomáš/N-8668-2019; Hendrych, Radek/HJH-3526-2023","Hendrych, Radek/0000-0003-3222-3148; Cipra, Tomáš/0000-0003-0604-324X; Hendrych, Radek/0000-0003-3222-3148",[GA P402/12/G097],,This work was supported by the grant GA P402/12/G097.,,12,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,459,468,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455325300045,0

A possibility, that we cannot prove or reject with the current specification of our models and available data, is that process innovation associated with product innovation raise marginal cost.

Efforts to mitigate these impacts have relied predominantly on the use of ramp rate restrictions, which limit the magnitude of hour-to-hour changes in reservoir discharge. Ramp rate restrictions shift hydropower production towards less valuable off-peak hours, imposing a financial penalty on dam owners that is a function of the spread (difference) between peak and off-peak electricity prices. This study examines how low natural gas prices in the U.S. have reduced the cost of implementing ramp rate restrictions at dams by narrowing the peak/off-peak price spread. Significantly lower costs of ramp rate restrictions could open new opportunities for improving environmental flows at dams, including the purchase of more natural streamflow patterns by downstream stakeholders, a type of arrangement for which there is growing precedent. We also explore the role that uncertainty in the cost of ramp rate restrictions could play in precluding downstream stakeholders from forming these types of agreements with dam owners. Results suggest that financial collar contracts could mostly eliminate inter-annual variability in the net cost of restrictions and provide those purchasing more natural flows with greater certainty.

Simulation results show that the Chinese will increase income after the formation of the RCEP. The increased income is partly attributed to rising investment income in the domestic market and partners' markets. Increased income, combined with reduction in commodity prices, results in higher consumption.

However, most GVCs-related literature about China focuses on country-to-country relations; less attention has been paid to China's domestic value chains (DVCs). GVCs should have their domestic foundations since strong linkages across domestic firms and regions can improve productivity through gains from specialization, which make domestic industries more competitive in GVCs in turn. This paper applies the so-called Trade in Value-added (TiVA) concept and the decomposition of domestic-regional trade in TiVA terms to re-measure the inter-industrial and interregional linkages in China's DVCs. We show that TiVA-based measures can significantly enrich our understanding on both the structure change of China's regional economy and the position and participation degree of Chinese regions in DVCs.","[Meng, Bo] IDE JETRO, Chiba, Japan; [Fang, Yong] Nanjing Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Guo, Jiemin] OECD, Stat Directorate STD, Paris, France; [Zhang, Yaxiong] China State Informat Ctr, Dept Econ Forecasting, Beijing, Peoples R China",Nanjing University; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Fang, Y (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",fangyong@nju.edu.cn,"liping, sun/AAW-1808-2021; Li, Zilong/JEZ-8642-2023; Meng, Bo/AAP-5042-2020","liping, sun/0000-0002-4711-3518; Meng, Bo/0000-0003-1179-5390","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFA0602800]; Natural Science Foundation of China [71573150, 71573062]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This paper was also supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No.2016YFA0602800) and the general project of Natural Science Foundation of China (No.71573150 and 71573062).,,36,37,40,10,87,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

Specifically, the connections among daily and weekly growth rates of the 10-year government bond yields of the U.S., Germany and Greece from July 13, 2006 to January 29, 2016 are considered and an empirical illustration of those, based on the vector autoregressive (VAR) model with stochastic volatility (SV) disturbances, is provided. Finally, sufficient weak and strong exogeneity conditions in the VAR-SV models are tested. Our results indicate that during the time period covered by the analysis, the weekly growth rates of the 10-year U.S. bond yields were not affected by the past growth rates of the 10-year German and Greek bond yields. Contagion effects were absent among all the 10-year bond markets considered. From October 2008 to April 2015 a 'flight to quality' effect between Germany and Greece, as well as between the U.S. and Greece seems to have occurred. Since the strong exogeneity hypothesis of the 10-year US bond yields' weekly growth rates has not been rejected by the data, they can be predicted from the marginal model only, i.e. without taking the German and Greek bond yields into consideration.","[Modrzejewska, Anita] Cracow Univ Econ, Fac Econ & Int Relat, Dept Foreign Trade, Krakow, Poland; [Pajor, Anna] Cracow Univ Econ, Fac Finance & Law, Dept Math, Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics; Cracow University of Economics,"Modrzejewska, A (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Fac Econ & Int Relat, Dept Foreign Trade, Krakow, Poland.",,"Pajor, Anna/T-3865-2018","Pajor, Anna/0000-0001-5643-0649; Modrzejewska, Anita/0009-0006-4086-7452",Faculty of Finance and Law at Cracow University of Economics; STAIR PROJECT within ALTANTIS PROGRAMME - EU-US Cooperation in Higher Education and Training [2008-1747/001-001],Faculty of Finance and Law at Cracow University of Economics; STAIR PROJECT within ALTANTIS PROGRAMME - EU-US Cooperation in Higher Education and Training,"The initial version of this article came into being within the STAIR PROJECT Studies in Trans-Atlantic International Relations project no: 2008-1747/001-001 CPT-USTRAN realized within the ALTANTIS PROGRAMME - EU-US Cooperation in Higher Education and Training.

Because these profits are often hard to separate from other firm profits, patent boxes have been argued to be prone to tax shifting of firms, and tax competition between nations, as they might shift the location of the profits without affecting the location of R&D activities. Whether or not this occurs may also depend on conditions set in the patent box. We evaluate the innovation box policy instrument in the Netherlands, which is essentially a patent box, but without the formal requirement of a patent. We ask whether the innovation box has an effect on local R&D investment of the firm ('additionality'), thereby putting the hypothesis of tax shifting to the test. We find that the innovation box indeed has a positive effect on R&D investment, but the average firm that uses the policy tends to use only a part of the tax advantage for extra R&D investment.","[Mohnen, Pierre; Verspagen, Bart] UNU MERIT, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Mohnen, Pierre] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University; Maastricht University,"Mohnen, P (通讯作者)，UNU MERIT, Maastricht, Netherlands.;Mohnen, P (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands.",p.mohnen@maastrichtuniversity.nl; vankan@dialogic.nl; verspagen@merit.unu.edu,"van Kan, Adrian/KCY-8056-2024; Verspagen, Bart/ABE-6732-2020; Mohnen, Pierre/ACL-4047-2022","Verspagen, Bart/0000-0001-6975-8141; Mohnen, Pierre/0000-0002-2289-7379",,,,,17,24,26,5,47,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

The latter is nothing but a staff of employees safeguarding the main technology to guarantee the existence and development of the university education.

We also reveal that increases in interest rates intending to prevent capital outflows may lead to decrease in stock returns, which in turn may deteriorate the real economic activity in Indonesia, while changes in short-term interest rates in Brazil, Indonesia and Turkey cannot be used as a tool to stabilize the value of their home currencies against the USD.

The objective of this study is to analyze the relationships between the emissions caused by countries from a demand point of view, the carbon footprints and the demand for goods and services in these countries, and especially in the European countries. With this aim, a two-step process was carried out. Firstly, carbon footprints were calculated during the 1995-2009 period. Secondly, the EKC hypothesis between these carbon footprints and the total final demands were tested by using panel data and a multilevel mixed effects model. The results show that the EKC hypothesis is not supported when considering carbon footprints with respect to final demand. It is also shown that carbon footprints are slightly increasing with respect to final demand beyond proportionality. The carbon footprint elasticities are different between countries, their values increasing with the final demand per capita of countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis shows during 2001-2013 that inefficiency peaked during the 2008 crisis period and has fallen back to levels close to pre-crisis periods. The model also performs well in out-of-sample forecasts of the financial firms' future market values. These results suggest that large financial firms have been adjusting to the new normal' of the post-crisis period and thus are able to use capital and labour more efficiently within the constraints of current market conditions. In addition, a non-linear pattern between inefficiency and a firm's asset size suggests that there might be an optimal scale for such firms in the $450-650 billion range.","[Pagano, Michael S.] Villanova Univ, Dept Finance, Villanova, PA 19085 USA",Villanova University,"Pagano, MS (通讯作者)，Villanova Univ, Finance, 800 Lancaster Ave, Villanova, PA 19085 USA.",michael.pagano@villanova.edu,,,,,,,11,2,2,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We propose that ML models can be used as upper bounds for the explainable variance in a given data set and thus serve as upper bounds for the potential power of a theory. We demonstrate this method in the domain of uncertainty. We ask over 600 individuals to make a total of 6000 choices with randomized parameters and compare standard economic models to ML models. In the domain of risk, aversion of expected utility that allows for non-linear probability weighting (as in cumulative prospect theory) and individual-level parameters performs as well out-of sample as ML techniques. By contrast, in the domain of ambiguity, two of the most widely studied models (a linear version of maximin preferences and second order expected utility) fail to compete with the ML methods. We open the black boxes of the ML methods and show that under risk we rediscover expected utility with probability weighting. However, in the case of ambiguity the form of ambiguity aversion implied by our ML models suggests that there is gain from theoretical work on a portable model of ambiguity aversion. Our results highlight ways in which behavioral scientists can incorporate ML techniques in their daily practice to gain genuinely new insights. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The phenomenon of economic development is treated not only as a multivariate problem, but it is also assumed that it should be considered as a latent variable. Thus, in the research Structural Equation Model (SEM) was applied. SEM model is the result of a merger between confirmatory factor analysis and path analysis applied in econometrics. Its advantage in the context of the aim of the research is its high elasticity.

The method of spatial autocorrelation is mostly used at the lower territorial level of NUTS 3 regions or municipalities. The method is employed to analyse the spatial differentiation not only economic but also a social phenomenon. Results of presented studies show the positive or negative spatial autocorrelation of selected economic or social variables based on the most commonly used of global spatial autocorrelation statistics - Moran's I coefficient. Currently, a majority of researchers improve the spatial autocorrelation knowledge by using of modified geographic weights matrix or by computation of the local spatial autocorrelation using the Local indicator of spatial association (LISA). Based on the conducted literature review, spatial autocorrelation can be considered as the suitable tool in regional development evaluation which helps to understand the spatial processes in the EU area.","[Polednikova, Eva] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava 70200 1, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Poledníková, E (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava 70200 1, Czech Republic.",eva.polednikova@vsb.cz,"Polednikova, Eva/J-5333-2018","Polednikova, Eva/0000-0001-8645-5716","SGS project of Faculty of Economics, VSB-TUO [SP2017/111]; Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296]","SGS project of Faculty of Economics, VSB-TUO; Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness","The paper is supported by SGS project (SP2017/111) of Faculty of Economics, VSB-TUO and Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness (CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296).",,24,1,1,0,5,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-349-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,116,124,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6CS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426486500013,0

This article examines the extent to which this relatively large pay increase affects case outcomes. Efficiency wage theory would suggest paying workers higher rates can improve their productivity, and the results of this analysis are consistent with this. Using a difference-in-difference approach, I find that after the assigned counsel rate increase, case outcomes significantly improved in counties with higher poverty rates relative to those with lower poverty rates. The likelihood of conviction and the likelihood of pleading guilty both fell by more than two percentage points in high-poverty counties compared to low-poverty counties after the rate increase, and the differences in the likelihood of being convicted are especially pronounced for cases involving violent felonies. The results suggest raising assigned counsel rates can be an effective policy tool to improve indigent defence systems that are in need of reform.","[Roach, Michael A.] Middle Tennessee State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, MTSU Box 27, Murfreesboro, TN 37130 USA",Middle Tennessee State University,"Roach, MA (通讯作者)，Middle Tennessee State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, MTSU Box 27, Murfreesboro, TN 37130 USA.",Michael.Roach@mtsu.edu,,,Middle Tennessee State University Faculty Research and Creative Activity Committee,Middle Tennessee State University Faculty Research and Creative Activity Committee,This work was supported by the Middle Tennessee State University Faculty Research and Creative Activity Committee.,,10,3,7,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We have also provided an algorithm to correct related infeasibilities. Using this approach, we investigate the performance of Iranian banks and credit risk management in the sector for the period 1998-2012. Non-performing loans (NPLs) have been used as an undesirable output and proxy for credit risk in our models. Based on our empirical results, although the banks generally exhibited efficiency improvements over time, their credit risk performance deteriorated considerably after the regulatory changes introduced in 2005.

Czech agrarian trade has been suffering especially because of two weaknesses: very limited territorial structure focused especially on European countries, the second problem is limited competitiveness especially in relation to territories outside of the European Union, and the third problem is still very low added value generated by Czech agrarian sector. The aim of this paper is to identify the current state of comparative advantages distribution. On the base of provide analyses the following statements can be highlighted. The Czech agrarian trade comparative advantages are existing especially in relation to the following set of aggregations: Cereals, Live animals, Oil seeds, Tobacco products, Dairy products, Sugar, Vegetable oils, saps and plaiting materials, Milling products, Beverages and alcohol.

The aim of the paper is to identify the long-term socioeconomic determinants of the nonprofit sector serving households in the Czech Republic and confirm the supply-side theory and/or demand-side theory of the nonprofit sustainability. The regression analysis of socioeconomic indicators from the Czech Republic in the long term (2000-2014) revealed that the demand-side theory and supply-side theory of nonprofit sustainability are mutually compatible and should not be confronted. The size of the Czech nonprofit sector is externally driven by the condition of economy (supply-side) as well as by the needs of socially vulnerable people (demand-side). Another important finding is that there is a competition between nonprofit and governmental public sector in health care but not in social care where the government encourages the involvement of non-governmental organisations in the provision of social services.","[Spicka, Jindrich] Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic; [Arltova, Marketa] Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Spicka, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",jindrich.spicka@vse.cz; marketa.arltova@vse.cz,"Arltová, Markéta/P-4315-2018; Spicka, Jindrich/C-9855-2013","Spicka, Jindrich/0000-0001-5699-9544",Czech Science Foundation Project DYME - Dynamic Models in Economics [P402/12/G097]; [VSE IP309075],Czech Science Foundation Project DYME - Dynamic Models in Economics;,"This paper was supported by the institutional support for long-term conceptual development of the research organization University of Economics, Prague (project Best practice in non-governmental organizations, VSE IP309075) and by the Czech Science Foundation Project No. P402/12/G097 DYME - Dynamic Models in Economics.",,14,0,0,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,1653,1662,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455325300165,0

However, adoption still lags in many economies and, even where there is universal adoption, product innovation over the rails of these digital accounts has been slow.

Our analysis is distinct from previous work because it systematically examines the interactions between immigration, trade and FDI. Previous studies treated FDI-immigration relationships as being independent of the modes of foreign market access. Using bilateral data of Japan and 28 other economies for the period 1996-2011, our analysis shows that FDI inflows become more dominant compared to imports when skilled immigration flows increase and less dominant when unskilled immigration flows increase. The results suggest that the relevant policy instruments as regards the promotion of trade, FDI and immigration should vary depending on economic goals, such as current account balances and labour shortages.","[Tomohara, Akinori] Aoyama Gakuin Univ, Tokyo, Japan; [Tomohara, Akinori] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Tomohara, Akinori] RIETI, Tokyo, Japan",Aoyama Gakuin University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Tomohara, A (通讯作者)，Aoyama Gakuin Univ, Dept Int Econ, Shibuya Ku, Bldg 8 421,4-4-25 Shibuya, Tokyo 1508366, Japan.",jujodai@yahoo.com,,,Aoyama Gakuin University; [16K03650]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K03650] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Aoyama Gakuin University; ; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work was supported by the financial support from Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [No. 16K03650] and Aoyama Gakuin University.,,17,1,1,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The stock returns of 22 stock markets worldwide are analyzed to determine which region's EPU exhibits the greatest effect on regional systematic risk in the global stock market and on volatility risk in individual stock markets. First, all of the samples, the markets of different continents and the spillover indices of the developed and emerging markets, are calculated to observe the dynamic correlation among these markets with the aim of quantifying regional systematic risk and further examining the contagion risk effect of EPU. The results indicate the following: EPU in China is the most influential, and its contagion risk spreads to different regional markets, except for Europe; the effect of EPU in the United States is inferior to that in China; EPU in Japan merely influences contagion risk in emerging markets; contagion risk in European markets is not influenced by the four EPU indices; and EPU in Europe is not influenced by contagion risk in the global stock market. However, according to the volatility risk in each market, the EPU in Europe and China respectively influence Asian countries and European countries the most. These results may be attributable to the extremely high trade dependence among these countries because the performance of international enterprises is mainly determined by the economic policies of their trading partners.","[Tsai, I-Chun] Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Finance, 700 Kaohsiung Univ Rd, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan",National University Kaohsiung,"Tsai, IC (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Finance, 700 Kaohsiung Univ Rd, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan.",,"Tsai, I-Chun/H-6503-2018","Tsai, I-Chun/0000-0001-8277-2327",,,,,21,129,133,9,78,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

A gender difference is also observed in the effect of parental absence: girls suffer more from the effect of both parents being absent on their mathematics test scores than do boys.","[Wu, Jia] Jinan Univ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Junsen] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Jinan University; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Zhang, JS (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jszhang@cuhk.edu.hk,,,Ministry of Education of China; Guangdong Collaborative Innovation Center of Industrial Transformation and Upgrading,"Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Guangdong Collaborative Innovation Center of Industrial Transformation and Upgrading",The authors are grateful to the funding support provided by the Ministry of Education of China in 2016 and the Guangdong Collaborative Innovation Center of Industrial Transformation and Upgrading.,,33,30,32,8,57,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1832-8105,1748-3131,,ASIAN ECON POLICY R,Asian Econ.

Yet, mathematical programming techniques are rarely used despite overwhelming evidence of their superiority in selecting projects that yield higher levels of total benefits. We present a novel hybrid selection model' that combines binary linear programming and heuristic rank-based models applied to two case studies. The first case focuses on providing services to women and shows a hybrid model would have selected the top three signature' projects and maintained an above-average overall project benefit while securing a 180% improvement in the number of projects funded, a 66% improvement in the number of women served and a 132% improvement in the total benefit achieved. In the second case, we apply the hybrid approach to data from the US government's largest forest preservation programme and demonstrate that the hybrid approach could allow the programme to select up to 11 top-scoring projects while still achieving a 97% gain in the total overall benefit compared to their traditional method. These case studies show that the hybrid approach has the potential to be applied in a variety of settings and improve how foundations and programmes achieve their goals.","[Wu, Shang; Messer, Kent D.] Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Toussaint, Jenna] Univ Delaware, Dept Econ, Newark, DE USA",University of Delaware; University of Delaware,"Messer, KD (通讯作者)，Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",messer@udel.edu,"Messer, Kent/AAK-8811-2020",,National Science Foundation EPSCoR [1301765],National Science Foundation EPSCoR(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work was supported by the National Science Foundation EPSCoR under Grant number 1301765.,,25,1,1,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The first one considers an acceptable percentage of changes in resources to ensure practical feasibility. The second one further considers a situation where resources can only be allowed to shift within specific units. The proposed models are applied to an empirical study based on a hospital system in Taiwan. To demonstrate the practical feasibility of the suggested plans, we compare our reallocation suggestions to a plan that can make the whole system be perfectly efficient. The main conclusion is that the plans derived from our models are more practically feasible than that with perfect efficiency.","[Yang, Chih-Ching] Cent Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mkt Management, Taichung, Taiwan",Central Taiwan University Science & Technology,"Yang, CC (通讯作者)，Cent Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mkt Management, Taichung, Taiwan.",107103@ctust.edu.tw,,,Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [MOST 104-2410-H-166-002],"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [MOST 104-2410-H-166-002.].,,30,5,5,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Over the last two decades the use of high-frequency data has greatly advanced the research on volatility modelling. This article makes the first attempt in the real estate literature to employ intraday data for volatility forecasting. We examine a wide range of commonly used methods and apply them to several major global REIT markets. Our findings suggest that the group of reduced form methods deliver the most accurate one-step-ahead forecast for daily REIT volatility. They outperform their GARCH-model-based counterparts and two methods using low-frequency data. We also show that exploiting intraday information through GARCH does not necessarily yield incremental precision for forecasting REIT volatility. Our results are relatively robust to the choice of realized measure of volatility and the length of evaluation period.","[Zhou, Jian] Univ Guelph, Coll Business & Econ, Real Estate & Housing,50 Stone Rd E, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Guelph,"Zhou, J (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Coll Business & Econ, Real Estate & Housing,50 Stone Rd E, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",jian@uoguelph.ca,,,,,,,45,8,8,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It has been extraordinary in its social cost and its cost to European taxpayers. The causes of this failure are multiple. The main burden lies with consecutive Greek governments that did not carry out the necessary fiscal adjustment and reforms. In their lack of urgency they were strongly supported by American economists, especially Paul Krugman, who opposed austerity and instead called for fiscal stimulus, ignoring the need for financial stability. Much of this discussion was devoted to the benefits or harm of the Eurozone, which eventually hardly mattered. The crisis resolution was complicated by the European Union wanting to play a big role but not knowing how and weakening the traditional role of the International Monetary Fund. The key lessons are back to basics: A government needs to act hard and fast to resolve a severe financial crisis. The IMF is the best leader for financial stabilization. Early and fast fiscal adjustment brings about early financial stabilization, more structural reforms and early and higher growth.","[Aslund, Anders] Atlantic Council, Washington, DC 20005 USA",,"Åslund, A (通讯作者)，Atlantic Council, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",aaslund@atlanticcouncil.org,,,,,,,16,1,1,0,3,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

Thereby, we propose an alternative view to assess core inflation as a complementary tool to better monitor underlying inflation with respect to its main drivers. Empirical findings show that about one-third of the consumer basket is affected by the output gap. Remaining items that are found to be insensitive to business cycle extensively co-move with import prices and exchange rate.The results imply that controlling inflation through counter-cyclical policies may be a more challenging issue, especially when external factors work in the opposite direction.

This paper proposes the value and volume approach, which has not been considered in an aggregative way for a long time in the economic literature. Purpose of the article: The aim of the paper is to present changes in the global art market in the period 2002-2015. The results of dynamic analysis of the art market are presented, including two approaches: value of transactions and volume of transactions. The impact of the global crisis on the art market is considered. Methods: In order to present the changes on the global art market, statistical indexes of dynamics (single base and chain indexes) are used. Moreover, trend analyses have been conducted for the value and volume of transactions on the art market. The sources of data on the global art market are from Artprice, ArtTactic, and TEFAF (The European Fine Art Foundation). Findings & Value added: In the analysed period of 2002-2015, sales on the global art market generally increased. The value and volume of sales peaked in 2007 and 2014. The art market was considerably affected by the economic recession in 2009, but in the next year it recovered. The trend analyses allow the changes on the market to be described by means of mathematical functions, and the countries with the largest share in the global art market can be identified. Particular attention has been paid to the existence of a triad on the art market consisting of Europe, the USA and China. It is noteworthy that Europe and the USA have rapidly lost market share to China.","[Bialynicka-Birula, Joanna] Cracow Univ Econ, Rakowicka St 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Bialynicka-Birula, J (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Rakowicka St 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",bialynij@uek.krakow.pl,,,,,,,45,5,6,5,28,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

Consumers do not overweight gas prices in their perception of inflation, relative to the expenditure share of gas.

Instead of feminist radical political economy fitting under a broader body of political economy that coheres around radicalism, it is in feminist insight that radical political economy finds roots: according to the series' authors, it is what makes radical political economy radical. Yet although the Union for Radical Political Economics hosted the development of the building blocks of feminist theory in economics between 1968 and 1991, feminist contributions remain largely unacknowledged.

Using data from an important charity, we perform baseline difference-in-differences regressions to investigate the impact of this emergency rule on the probability of migrants regularizing their legal status. We exploit the timing of the enactment of the ENA accessibility criteriasuch that potential beneficiaries learned of its existence only after the realization of the state of entitlementto identify the effects of the emergency policy provision on treated and control groups of immigrants. The results show an increased number of successful applications in favor of eligible individuals, although a dramatic boost in the denial rate for other migrants is also observed. This suggests either that some migrants suffered displacement due to the emergency rule, and/or that improper submissions of ENA-oriented applications have occurred. We extend our analysis to the use of multilevel models to shed light on these possible (non-mutually excludable) explanations. Results seem to support the presence of some rule-displacement effects, although the existence of a set of wrongful submissions cannot be excluded.

This study analyzes, through inflation reports, the disclosure of information from the Central Bank of Brazil concerning the credit market. We consider credit risk and capital buffers as measures of financial stability in this analysis. Furthermore, in order to measure the perception of the monetary authority on the credit market, we built two indices based on the central bank's communication on credit development. We performed a panel data analysis based on a sample of 125 banks for the period from June 1999 to September 2014 (7000 observations). The findings suggest that central bank communication regarding expectations concerning the credit market contributes to financial stability. Therefore, this kind of communication of central banks (about credit development) may constitute an important macroprudential tool to improve financial stability.","[de Mendonca, Helder Ferreira] Fluminense Fed Univ, Dept Econ, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil; [de Mendonca, Helder Ferreira] Natl Council Sci & Technol Dev CNPq, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [de Moraes, Claudio Oliveira] Cent Bank Brazil, Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Universidade Federal Fluminense; Central Bank of Brazil,"de Mendonça, HF (通讯作者)，Rua Dr Sodre 59, BR-26900000 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.;de Moraes, CO (通讯作者)，Ave Presidente Vargas 730, BR-20071900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",helderfm@hotmail.com; claudio.moraes@bcb.gov.br,"De Moraes, Claudio/AAB-8866-2022; de Mendonca, Helder Ferreira/A-7415-2009","de Mendonca, Helder Ferreira/0000-0003-1465-1755; De Moraes, Claudio/0000-0002-9746-8106",,,,,53,12,12,2,18,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0939-3625,1878-5433,,ECON SYST,Econ.

I argue that linguistic distance imposes a cost on idea flows, whereas genetic distance captures an incentive to communicate when dissimilar countries have more to learn from each other. Consistent with this hypothesis, I find that linguistic distance is negatively associated with book translations, whereas genetic distance is positively associated with book translations after conditioning on linguistic and geographic distance. In particular, the benchmark estimate indicates that a one standard deviation increase in linguistic distance reduces book translations by 12%, while a one standard deviation increase in genetic distance increases book translations by 10%.","[Dickens, Andrew] Brock Univ, Dept Econ, 1812 Sir Issac Brock Way, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A2, Canada",Brock University,"Dickens, A (通讯作者)，Brock Univ, Dept Econ, 1812 Sir Issac Brock Way, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A2, Canada.",adickens@brocku.ca,,,,,,,34,3,4,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

In a laboratory setting, all subjects went through twelve rounds of multiple-price-list decisions between a risky alternative and a safe alternative. In the first six rounds, subjects were randomly assigned to a high-, moderate-, or low-risk environment, which differed in the variances of the lotteries they were exposed to. In the last six rounds, subjects in all treatments made decisions on an identical set of lotteries. We found that subjects who had experienced a riskier environment exhibited a higher degree of risk aversion. Our experimental design allows us to conclude that this effect is driven by the risk environment per se, rather than the realized outcomes of the risk.

We use panel data of 342 MFIs from 61 countries covering the period 2003-2013. Results show that MFIs are operating at a low level of productivity with an overall annual rate of decline in TFP of 1.7 percent. Although technical progress, technical efficiency change and mix efficiency change components of TFP have increased over the study period, overall, TFP actually declined over time due to declining scale efficiency, residual scale-efficiency and/or residual mix efficiency changes. We found variations in regional performance with Sub-Saharan Africa experiencing the highest decline in TFP despite improvements in technical and mix efficiency changes. In contrast, Eastern Europe, Central Asia and South Asian regions have experienced a growth in TFP. Policy implications of these results are that MFIs should continue to pursue technical progress and aim to improve technical, scale and mix efficiency components by reallocating resources optimally. As well, MFIs should operate at an optimal scale and derive economies of scope by changing input and output mixes. (C) 2018 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Based on cross-country panel data, it is revealed that a greater share of elderly workers in the labor force is associated with more service employment relative to that in the industrial sector. To rationalize this finding, a two-sector overlapping generations model is constructed. The model highlights two forces, namely the scale effect (SE) and the composition effect (CE), that drive the correlation between the labor force age structure and the service-industry employment ratio. Calibrating main model parameters with China's micro level data, simulation results well fit the country's historical trajectory of structural change. According to population forecast data, the model predicts a substantial growth of services relative to the industrial sector in China up to 2050.","[Mao, Rui] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Publ Policy, 866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Xu, Jianwei] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Business, 19 Xinjiekou Outer St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Zou, Jingxian] Renmin Univ China, Natl Acad Dev & Strategy, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Beijing Normal University; Renmin University of China,"Zou, JX (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Natl Acad Dev & Strategy, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",zou_jingxian@163.com,,,,,,,27,10,10,5,44,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

We systematically test the WTP of a good with no related market value, using two standard, hypothetical stated preference data collections and an incentivized stated preference data collection, using a real donation mechanism. The investigations into the nature of hypothetical bias typically involve changes in more than just the elicitation format. Therefore, we explicitly test the importance of changes in bid range, payment vehicle, and elicitation format upon the estimated hypothetical bias, while keeping the survey context constant. Our results show that depending on the characteristics of the good in question, the choice of payment vehicle, bid range and elicitation format may affect the results. In many cases, the importance of payment vehicle itself is negligible - especially when the good in question is distant to people. The implication of our study is that caution should be applied when conducing stated and revealed preference comparisons in the context of public good with strong moral components, as even very small design decisions may influence the observed WTP disparities.","[Svenningsen, Lea S.; Jacobsen, Jette Bredahl] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Jacobsen, Jette Bredahl] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen; University of Copenhagen,"Svenningsen, LS (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark.",leasvenningsen@ifro.ku.dk,"Jacobsen, Jette Bredahl/C-9354-2015","Jacobsen, Jette Bredahl/0000-0002-1313-6228","Danish National Research Foundation for the Centre for Macro-ecology, Evolution and Climate [DNRF96]","Danish National Research Foundation for the Centre for Macro-ecology, Evolution and Climate","The authors would like to thank Julian Sagebiel for providing his user-written Stata command, poetest.

Data from the Chinese Household Income Project survey (CHIP2002 and CHIP2013) were used with a decomposition analysis based on the Brown et al. model. It is found that although both inter-sector differentials and intra-sector differentials affect the gender wage gap, the effect of intra-sector differentials was greater, and the influence of intra-sector differentials was greater for 2013 than for 2002. The influence of unexplained components of intra-sector differentials was greater than the explained components, and it was greater for 2013 than for 2002. The results indicate that the problem of discrimination against female workers in a given ownership sector is becoming more serious and was the main factor causing the gender wage gap expansion in urban China from 2002 to 2013.","[Ma, Xinxin] Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, Tokyo, Japan",Hitotsubashi University,"Ma, XX (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, Tokyo, Japan.",maxx@ier.hit-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,60,11,12,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,NOV 2,2018,30.0,6,,,,,775,804,,10.1080/14631377.2018.1458476,0.0,,,30,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GW9IO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447298700004,0

First, we found that the main arguments against launching an IPO in both countries involve information disclosure and limitations on decision-making control. Surprisingly, the majority of the managers do not see the capital market as a source of cheaper and more flexible financing compared to bank loans and other sources. In terms of exogenous factors, Polish CFOs are opportunistic with regard to the timing of an IPO. They view the window of opportunity in terms of overall business and industry conditions as significantly more important than do their Czech counterparts. Czech CFOs rank IPO-related demands on time and costs as the main obstacle to going public. Finally, Czech CFOs agree that a lack of confidence in the capital market is their major concern more frequently than do their Polish peers.","[Meluzin, Tomas; Zinecker, Marek] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Kolejni Brno, Czech Republic; [Balcerzak, Adam P.; Pietrzak, Michal B.] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Dept Econ, Torun, Poland",Brno University of Technology; Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Zinecker, M (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Kolejni Brno, Czech Republic.",zinecker@fbm.vutbr.cz,"Pietrzak, Michal Bernard/I-4919-2014; Zinecker, Marek/AAL-5760-2021; Balcerzak, Adam/D-7224-2016","Pietrzak, Michal Bernard/0000-0002-9263-4478; Balcerzak, Adam/0000-0003-0352-1373; Meluzin, Tomas/0000-0001-5238-5166","Institute of Economic Research Torun, Poland [2016/1]; Brno University of Technology, Faculty of Business and Management, Czech Republic [2016/1]","Institute of Economic Research Torun, Poland; Brno University of Technology, Faculty of Business and Management, Czech Republic","This work was supported by the Institute of Economic Research Torun, Poland, and Brno University of Technology, Faculty of Business and Management, Czech Republic (grant number 2016/1).

Using patents from the United States Patent and Trademark Office, I compare the frequency with which headquarters patents are cited by third-party firms in the satellite's host country relative to a control group of patents, and this both before and after the establishment of the satellite (using a difference-in-differences approach). The results suggest that the satellite increases the flow of knowledge from the multinational's headquarters to firms in the satellite's host country. This satellite effect on knowledge diffusion is largest in host countries and sectors with strong but not world-class capabilities that have both the motivation and absorptive capacity to learn from foreign parties. The findings also suggest that knowledge diffusion is greatest when satellites are staffed with inventors that have previously either patented with other local firms (thus having stronger local social networks) or with the headquarters (thus having headquarters knowledge).","[Blit, Joel] Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Blit, J (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",jblit@uwaterloo.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) [430-2016-00143]; Institute for New Economic Thinking; Centre for International Governance Innovation,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Institute for New Economic Thinking; Centre for International Governance Innovation,"I am grateful to Ajay Agrawal, Ignatius Horstmann, Joanne Oxley and Daniel Trefler for their indispensable guidance, helpful comments and discussions.

We find that new goods trade increased disproportionately after the FTAs came into effect, and that least-traded goods (LTG)those accounting for the lowest 10% of trade prior to the FTAsended up accounting for 37% of post-FTA trade with FTA partners. In contrast, the corresponding share for a comparable group of countries that did not sign FTAs with Korea was only half as large, averaging close to 20%. We also find that only less than 2% of all least-traded products accounted for most of the growth in LTG trade, and that those goods tended to be clustered in the same industries as the intensively-traded goods. Furthermore, a larger fraction of LTG became heavily traded for the case of FTA partners than for non-FTA countries. Finally, we find evidence that least-traded imports were subject to higher pre-FTA tariff protection than other products.","[Cho, Sang-wook (Stanley)] Univ New South Wales, Sch Econ, UNSW Business Sch, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Choi, Hansoo] Korea Inst Publ Finance, 336 Sicheong Daero, Sejong Si, South Korea; [Diaz, Julian P.] Loyola Univ, Dept Econ, Quinlan Sch Business, 820 N Michigan Ave, Chicago, IL 60611 USA",University of New South Wales Sydney; Loyola University Chicago,"Choi, H (通讯作者)，Korea Inst Publ Finance, 336 Sicheong Daero, Sejong Si, South Korea.",s.cho@unsw.edu.au; choihs@kipf.re.kr; jdiaz17@luc.edu,"Cho, Sang-Wook/AAS-3855-2020; Diaz, Julian P./O-7641-2017","Cho, Sang-Wook/0000-0002-8435-9322; Diaz, Julian P./0000-0003-0058-7086",,,,,21,2,2,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

A welfare analysis for teacher attendance in Ugandan primary schools,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Performance pay; Monitoring; Campbell's law; Field experiment; Education; Welfare; Uganda,CONSEQUENCES; IMPACTS; ABSENCE,"To achieve the twin objectives of incentivizing agent performance and providing information for planning purposes, public sector organizations often rely on reports by local monitors that are costly to verify. Received wisdom has it that attaching financial incentives to these reports will result in collusion, and undermine both objectives. Simple bargaining logic, however, suggests the reverse: pay for locally monitored performance could incentivize desired behavior and improve information. To investigate this issue, we conducted a randomized controlled trial in Ugandan primary schools that explored how incentives for teachers could be designed when based on local monitoring by head teachers. Our experiment randomly varied whether head teachers' reports of teacher attendance were tied to teacher bonus payments or not. We find that local monitoring on its own is ineffective at improving teacher attendance. However, combining local monitoring with financial incentives leads to both an increase in teacher attendance (by 8 percentage points) and an improvement in the quality of information. We also observe substantial gains in pupil attainment, driven primarily by a reduction in dropouts. By placing a financial value on these enrollment gains, we demonstrate that pay for locally monitored performance passes both welfare and fiscal sustainability tests.

This research examined the determinants of microcredit loan repayment based on a sample of 752 microcredit loans granted in Portugal by the National Association for the Right to Credit, adopting individual lending mechanisms and granting loans through partnerships with several credit institutions. This is the first study to ascertain the influence that a set of factors - grouped into three categories: borrowers' individual characteristics; loan characteristics; and characteristics of business projects implemented by borrowers - has on the repayment ability of microcredit programs, in a developed country of the Eurozone. Moreover, this is the first study using an ordered logistic regression (OLR) in estimating the determinants of microcredit loan repayment. Similar to previous studies, married borrowers tend to repay loans faster as they tend to be more responsible than single borrowers. Nationality seems to be an issue as foreigners tends to default the repayment loans. Finally, those involved in manufacturing activities perform better than those involved in service activities in repaying their loans. This clearly indicates that in developed countries special attention needs to be provided to minority groups as well as market/supply conditions, which are not normally considered in less favored economic countries.","[Mota, Jorge; Moreira, Antonio Carrizo; Brandao, Cristovao] Univ Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal",Universidade de Aveiro,"Moreira, AC (通讯作者)，Univ Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal.",amoreira@ua.pt,"Mota, Jorge/AAC-1432-2021; Mota, Jorge H.

Second, the predictive ability of most predictors can be improved using parameter-related constraints, but those improvements are not large. Third, combining the two types of constraints can achieve a remarkably better performance in forecasting oil price returns than an individual strategy both in terms of the number of predictors and the magnitude of improvements.

We find that macroeconomic status, bank structure and regulatory, political institution, legal system and deposit insurance design characteristics have a significant effect on deposit insurance coverage. Moreover, empirical results show that the impact factors are different between developing and developed countries, especially the design characteristics. Specifically, for developing countries, the scheme with the Foreign currency will support a higher coverage. And for developed countries, the Interbank deposits will lead to a lower coverage, but the No coinsurance shows the opposite effect. It is noteworthy that both the Payouts and Backstop from government influence the coverage setting conversely in different samples, which implies that there may be higher banks' risk-taking incentives in developing countries after setting up explicit deposit insurance system.","[Chang, Yiming; Zhao, Shangmei; Yang, Haijun; He, Jiang; Hu, Fei] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Shangmei; Yang, Haijun] Beihang Univ, Inst Econ & Business, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yang, Haijun] Beihang Univ, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Big Data & Brain Comp, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beihang University; Beihang University; Beihang University,"Yang, HJ (通讯作者)，Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Yang, HJ (通讯作者)，Beihang Univ, Inst Econ & Business, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Yang, HJ (通讯作者)，Beihang Univ, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Big Data & Brain Comp, Beijing, Peoples R China.",changyiming@buaa.edu.cn; beihangzsm@163.com; navy@buaa.edu.cn; hejiang686@163.com; hufeijr@sina.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71771006, 71373017]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The authors appreciate the support provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 71771006 and 71373017.,,26,4,4,4,15,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Controlling for observables, we find a gap that peaks at 10% points at ages 55-59 years. The marriage health gap is similar for men and women. If we allow for unobserved heterogeneity in innate health (permanent and age-dependent), potentially correlated with timing and likelihood of marriage, we find that the effect of marriage on health disappears below age 40 years, while about 5% points difference between married and unmarried individuals remains at older ages (55-59 years). This indicates that the observed gap is mainly driven by selection into marriage at younger ages, but there might be a protective effect of marriage at older ages. Exploring the mechanisms behind this result, we find that better innate health is associated with a higher probability of marriage and a lower probability of divorce, and there is strong assortative mating among couples by innate health. We also find that married individuals are more likely to have a healthier behavior compared to unmarried ones. Finally, we find that health insurance is critical for the beneficial effect of marriage. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This paper constructs a tax rate matrix to represent a real-world network of tax treaties between 70 countries and develops a computation algorithm to study the structure of tax-minimizing (direct or indirect) investment routes in the tax treaty network. The treaty shopping rate, defined as the difference between the foreign tax rates of the direct route and a tax-minimizing route, is about 3.66 percentage points on average. This paper also examines the relationship between FDI and the structure of tax-minimizing routes. Empirical results show that the existence of a tax-minimizing direct route is positively and significantly related to FDI. The inward FDI stock via a tax-minimizing direct route is about 2.14 times larger than the inward FDI stock via a direct route that is not tax-minimizing. By making a direct route tax-minimizing, countries can encourage FDI via the direct route and reduce treaty shopping.","[Hong, Sunghoon] Korea Inst Publ Finance, 336 Sicheong Daero, Sejong 30147, South Korea",,"Hong, S (通讯作者)，Korea Inst Publ Finance, 336 Sicheong Daero, Sejong 30147, South Korea.",sunghoonhong@kipf.re.kr,,,,,,,27,17,18,3,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

We introduce abatement cost uncertainty in a standard coalition formation model and let countries choose their preferred regulatory instrument. It is shown that a coalition of cooperating countries is more likely to prefer a quantity regulation than non-cooperating countries. However, uncertainty also aggravates free-riding whenever the endogenous preference of the coalition is to implement quantities, which implies lower equilibrium participation than in the benchmark case without uncertainty. A restriction to price-based agreements can lead to higher participation, but does not necessarily raise global welfare. Tradable quantities can both increase participation in the agreement and achieve higher global welfare.

The developed artificial markets are multi-assets, order-driven and populated by agents having heterogeneous behaviors and information. Agents are defined by their information and their herd behavior levels. Agents trade multiple risky assets based on their wealth, their behaviors and their available information which spread among multiple behavioral networks. In a novel contribution to artificial stock markets literature, agents' behaviors modeling is mixed with social network simulation to reproduce different degrees of information asymmetry and herd behavior based on several assortative topologies. Several simulations validated the proposed model since univariate and multivariate stylized facts were reproduced both for mature and immature stock markets. The proposed artificial stock market can be considered as a first step toward decision and simulation tools for optimal management, strategy analysis and predictions evolution of immature stock markets.","[Krichene, Hazem] Univ Tunis, LARODEC, ISG Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia; [Krichene, Hazem] Univ Hyogo, Grad Sch Simulat Studies, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan; [El-Aroui, Mhamed-Ali] Univ Carthage, FSEG Nabeul, Tunis, Tunisia; [El-Aroui, Mhamed-Ali] Univ Carthage, LARODEC, Tunis, Tunisia",Universite de Tunis; University of Hyogo; Universite de Carthage; Universite de Carthage,"Krichene, H (通讯作者)，Univ Tunis, LARODEC, ISG Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia.;Krichene, H (通讯作者)，Univ Hyogo, Grad Sch Simulat Studies, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.",krichene.hazem@gmail.com,"El-Aroui, Mhamed-Ali/AAQ-9420-2021","El-Aroui, Mhamed-Ali/0000-0002-0508-1095",,,,,35,9,10,0,35,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

I analyze this question in the context of the East German fertility decline after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. I exploit differential pressure for restructuring across East German industries which led to unexpected, exogenous, and permanent changes to labor demand. I find that throughout the 1990s, women more severely impacted by the demand shock had relatively more children than their less-severely-impacted counterparts. Thus, the demand shock did not only depress the aggregate fertility level but also changed the composition of mothers. My paper shows that these two effects do not necessarily operate in the same direction.","[Liepmann, Hannah] Humboldt Univ, Dept Econ & Business, Spandauer Str 1, D-10099 Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Liepmann, H (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Dept Econ & Business, Spandauer Str 1, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",hannah_liepmann@gmx.de,,,German Science Foundation (DFG) through the Research Training Group 1659; Collaborative Research Center 649; Collaborative Research Center 190,German Science Foundation (DFG) through the Research Training Group 1659(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Collaborative Research Center 649; Collaborative Research Center 190,"I thank Alexandra Spitz-Oener for her support of this project.

The estimation results indicate that surviving exporters experiencing antidumping would reduce their overall export product scope and concentrate on fewer more successful products, although the overall export value does not change. Specifically, they drop many pre-existing peripheral export products and simultaneously introduce new products that are closer to their main industry into the U.S. market. The analysis also finds that the sophistication of surviving exporters' export product mix increases in response to antidumping, and they export more products that have higher upstreamness.","[Lu, Yi] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Tao, Zhigang] Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yan] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Room 426,Econ Sch Bldg,Guoding Rd, Shanghai 777, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; University of Hong Kong; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Zhang, Y (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Room 426,Econ Sch Bldg,Guoding Rd, Shanghai 777, Peoples R China.",zhang_yan@mail.shufe.edu.cn,"Lu, Yi/A-4448-2010; Tao, Zhigang/A-4443-2010","Lu, Yi/0000-0002-3544-7131; Tao, Zhigang/0000-0002-6041-1210","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71703085, 71703099]; Special Research Fund of China-ASEAN Collaborative Innovation Center for Regional Development and Development Program of Ministry of Education for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Teams [CWZ201514]; Shanghai Pujiang Program [15PJC046, 16PJC048]",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Special Research Fund of China-ASEAN Collaborative Innovation Center for Regional Development and Development Program of Ministry of Education for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Teams; Shanghai Pujiang Program(Shanghai Pujiang Program),"We are grateful to the Editor and two anonymous referees for comments that substantially improved the paper.

The unpredictability of conventional fuel markets makes the revenues and costs associated with biofuel production uncertain. In addition, policy uncertainty, in the form of annual revisions and adjustments to the program, make the cost of complying with the Renewable Fuel Standard uncertain. This paper is the first to decompose the aggregate uncertainty facing biofuel producers and isolate the effect of fuel market uncertainty and policy uncertainty on the decision to enter and exit the biofuel market. Results indicate that the uncertainty in the conventional fuel markets and the uncertainty in status of the Renewable Fuel Standard program influence incentives to enter and exit the biofuel market in different ways. Annual adjustments to the standard coupled with the unpredictable expiration and reinstatement of blender tax credits can work to discourage investment in biofuels and undermine effectiveness of the program.

We show that there always exists a cost threshold such that all agents participating in the favor exchange system receive strictly positive expected utility, and the system is a stable system. For systems involving stars and regular networks, we provide an ordering of the highest cost threshold supporting their stability. We also identify the conditions under which systems are efficient and show that, among all efficient systems, the one with the complete network provides the highest sum of expected utilities.

We show that both the ability of educated and non educated workers have sizable effects on the incentives of firms regarding the type of vacancies they open and also regarding the incentives of educated workers as of where to search for a job. Therefore education outcomes are relevant to understand the overeducation phenomena observed in the labor market. According to our quantitative analysis had the quality of education observed in Spain been similar to the European average then the overeducation rate would have been between 5 and 10 percentage points lower and the unemployment rate of the two types of workers would be reduced by 40%, but the tertiary education wage premium would be slightly smaller than in the benchmark economy.","[Obiols-Homs, F.] UAE, MOVE, Unitat Fonaments Anal Econ, Barcelona, Spain; [Obiols-Homs, F.] Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain; [Sanchez-Marcos, V.] Univ Cantabria, Dept Econ, Santander, Spain",Barcelona School of Economics; Universidad de Cantabria,"Obiols-Homs, F (通讯作者)，UAE, MOVE, Unitat Fonaments Anal Econ, Barcelona, Spain.;Obiols-Homs, F (通讯作者)，Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain.",francesc.obiols@uab.es,"Obiols-Homs, Francesc/H-3344-2015; Sanchez-Marcos, Virginia/H-2543-2015","Obiols-Homs, Francesc/0000-0003-2316-0288; Sanchez-Marcos, Virginia/0000-0001-9260-4327","Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology [ECO2015-64467-R]; Spanish Government [ECO2015-67602, ECO2012-32392]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Severo Ochoa Programme for Centers of Excellence in RD [SEV-2015-0563]",Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government); Spanish Government(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Severo Ochoa Programme for Centers of Excellence in RD(Spanish Government),"An earlier version of this paper circulated under the title Education, Occupation-Mismatch and Unemployment.

On the other hand, social interaction through online networking sites is steeply rising. To analyze these societal dynamics, we have built an evolutionary game model in which agents can choose between three strategies of social participation: 1) interaction via both online social networks and face-to-face encounters; 2) interaction by exclusive means of face-to-face encounters; 3) opting out from both forms of participation in pursuit of social isolation. We illustrate the dynamics of interaction among these three types of agent that the model predicts, in light of the empirical evidence provided by previous literature. We then assess their welfare implications. We show that when online interaction is less gratifying than offline encounters, the dynamics of agents' rational choices of interaction will lead to the extinction of the sub-population of online networks users, thereby making Facebook and similar platforms disappear in the long run. Furthermore, we show that the higher the propensity for discrimination of those who interact via online social networks and via face-to-face encounters (i.e., their preference for the interaction with agents of their same type), the greater the probability will be that they all will end up choosing social isolation in the long run, making society fall into a social poverty trap.","[Antoci, Angelo] Univ Sassari, Dept Econ & Business, Sassari, Italy; [Sabatini, Fabio] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Econ & Law, Rome, Italy",University of Sassari; Sapienza University Rome,"Sabatini, F (通讯作者)，Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Econ & Law, Rome, Italy.",antoci@uniss.it; fabio.sabatini@uniroma1.it,"Antoci, Angelo/AAG-2800-2021","Antoci, Angelo/0000-0003-3719-0437; Sabatini, Fabio/0000-0002-1228-3322",Regione Autonoma della Sardegna (Autonomous Region of Sardinia),Regione Autonoma della Sardegna (Autonomous Region of Sardinia),The research of Angelo Antoci and Fabio Sabatini has been funded by Regione Autonoma della Sardegna (Autonomous Region of Sardinia) in the context of the research project Social capital and growth differentials.

Nonetheless, a growing amount of empirical evidence reveals that applicants misrepresent their preferences when this mechanism is used. This paper shows that no mechanism that implements a stable matching is obviously strategy-proof for any side of the market, a stronger incentive property than strategy-proofness that was introduced by Li (2017). A stable mechanism that is obviously strategy-proof for applicants is introduced for the case in which agents on the other side have acyclical preferences. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

There are two different approaches to the problem: the normative and the data-driven. Indices derived from data-driven weights have the limitation that they may violate normatively desired properties. This paper asks whether it is possible to obtain normatively acceptable inequality indices from a data-driven approach. A multidimensional Gini index is derived from an endogenous weighting scheme and is shown to possess a number of desired properties.

Using a comprehensive data set of Portuguese firms and workers spanning two decades, we find that foreign acquisitions lead to: (1) an expansion in the scale of operations; (2) a higher number of hierarchical layers; and (3) higher wage inequality between the top and bottom layers. These results accord with a theory of knowledge-based hierarchies in which foreign takeovers lead to improved productivity, higher demand, or reduced internal communication costs, and thereby induce the acquired firms to reorganize. Evidence from auxiliary survey data reveals that acquired firms are more likely to use information technologies that reduce internal communication costs.

This paper shows that a double duality both in the production and the higher-education sectors as well as heterogeneous ability of individuals might explain the differences in labor productivity between tradable and non-tradable industries. The double duality in the economy enables a separation of individuals by their ability, and in consequence, human capital in both industries is different. The heterogeneity in human capital can explain that despite an increase in human capital in both sectors there is still a gap in productivity and in wage premium. In other words, the productivity gap between sectors is fueled by the double duality in labor markets, leading to heterogeneity in human capital. In consequence, there is a contrast between on one hand, more mobility across countries, and on the other hand, less mobility between sectors.","[Brezis, Elise S.; Brand, Gilad] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, Ramat Gan, Israel; [Brand, Gilad] Taub Ctr, Jerusalem, Israel",Bar Ilan University,"Brezis, ES (通讯作者)，Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, Ramat Gan, Israel.",elise.brezis@biu.ac.il; giladb@taubcenter.org.il,,,,,,,38,3,3,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

The originality of our approach is in our reliance on the structural estimation of a system of first order conditions to identify the deep parameters. Another new dimension is our use of gendered education data, allowing us to have a richer theory having implications for the gender wage and education gaps. Results indicate that the parsimonious rational-choice model explains 38 percent of the variation of fertility over time and across counties, as well as 71 percent and 83 percent of school enrollment of boys and girls, respectively.

We look into patterns of structural change and sectoral competitiveness in all EU member countries and assess their linkages by means of a descriptive analysis as well as through econometric estimations.

This often takes time, and therefore, even if the expert's learning process is unobservable, the timing of advice can be informative in itself. If, in addition, the expert can choose which experiments to perform, the timing of her advice may reveal not only the amount but also the type of information at her disposal. This paper studies a dynamic information transmission problem where a biased expert acquires information by performing a sequence of experiments, which cannot be observed by the decision maker. It is shown that, even in the absence of an objective reason to expedite information transmission, artificial time pressure can increase the amount of information transmitted and be beneficial to both players.

Factor analysis of responses from nearly 2000 participants across three studies is used to create and validate a multidimensional scale consisting of five distinct components of market attitudes.

We show that nationally optimal tax systems generally incorporate both thin-capitalization rules, which tax discriminate between purely national and multinational firms, and controlled-foreign-company (CFC) rules, which discriminate between home-based and foreign-based multinationals. In the non-cooperative policy equilibrium both thin-capitalization rules and CFC rules are set more lenient than if tax policies were chosen cooperatively, implying an 'excessive' tax discrimination in favor of multinationals. We also analyze the effects of reduced transaction costs for FDI and reduced costs for debt shifting on the optimal policy mix.

In addition, we closely examine the relationship between industrial policy, foreign investment and China's high-technology export success using the development of an indigenous integrated circuits industry as a case study. This paper finds that China's efforts to raise the productivity and innovative capacity of indigenous enterprises is consistent with rising domestic shares of high-technology assets and profits. Nevertheless, foreign-funded enterprises remain the source of most high-technology manufactured exports, primarily from wholly foreign-owned firms. In sum, despite indigenous development, Chinese high-technology manufacturing and exports remain deeply tied to foreign investment.","[Lovely, Mary E.] Syracuse Univ, Maxwell Sch Citizenship & Publ Affairs, Econ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Huang, Zixuan] Peterson Inst Int Econ, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Syracuse University; Peterson Institute for International Economics,"Lovely, ME (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Maxwell Sch Citizenship & Publ Affairs, Econ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",melovely@syr.edu; zhuang@piie.com,,,,,,,30,10,11,5,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,SEP-OCT,2018,26.0,5,,,SI,,104,126,,10.1111/cwe.12258,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GT4FU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000444460400007,0

This paper studies the adjustment dynamics of the real exchange rate towards its long-run equilibrium and presents empirical evidence that capital controls increase the persistence of misalignments. Allowing the speed of adjustment to vary according to the intensity of restrictions on capital flows, it is shown that the real exchange rate converges to its long-run level at significantly slower rates in countries with capital controls. This result is stronger when the exchange rate is undervalued and is independent of confounding factors such as the exchange rate regime and other forms of heterogeneity affecting the speed of adjustment. I also find evidence that controls on capital inflows have greater effects than controls on outflows. In addition, while the combination of capital controls with a fixed or managed exchange rate regime significantly increases the persistence of misalignments, controls appear to loose traction under more flexible exchange rate arrangements.

Differently from the traditional approach, we deviate from affine models by specifying a flexible Wishart jump-diffusion for the co-precision (the inverse of the covariance matrix). The optimal portfolio weights that solve the dynamic programming problem are genuinely dynamic and proportional to the instantaneous co-precision, reconciling optimal dynamic allocation with the static Markowitz-type economic intuition. An application to the optimal allocation problem across hedge fund investment styles illustrates the importance of having jumps in volatility associated with jumps in price. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Using an estimated model of demand and costs in a laundry detergent market, I find that some firms' profits initially rise and then fall with search costs. Overall, the magnitude and direction of the search costs' effects on prices and profits are heterogeneous. This is because search costs create conflicting incentives for a firm to reduce prices to attract the attention of searching consumers, yet also raise prices to harvest profit from consumers who are unaware of competing products. These effects can vary with the relationship between the firms' actual prices and the consumers' pre-search beliefs about prices.

Comparing migrants' heights to the height distributions of their birth cohorts in their provinces of origin produces a measure of selection that is exogenous to migration, representative, and generated by almost unrestricted migration. The Italian migration was negatively selected at the national level, but positively selected at the local level. Selection varied systematically within Italy, with more positive local selection from shorter and poorer provinces. Selection was more negative among individuals with stronger connections in the United States and became more positive after imposition of the literacy test in 1917.

Using multivariate model, the empirical results from this study have established key relationships which have important policy implications. First, at the global and regional levels, economic growth does not cause energy consumption. Second, with the exception of the global and Caribbean-Latin America, economic growth has no causal impact on carbon emissions, however, economic growth has a negative impact on carbon emissions at the global level and the Caribbean-Latin America. Third, carbon emissions positively cause economic growth. Fourth, energy consumption positively causes economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa while it negatively causes economic growth at the global, Middle East and North Africa (MENA), Asia-Pacific and Caribbean-Latin America. Fifth, energy consumption positively causes carbon emissions in MENA but causes carbon emissions negatively in sub-Saharan Africa and Caribbean-Latin America. Lastly, with the exception of MENA and the global sample, carbon emissions do not cause energy consumption.

The model incorporates rich interactions between the balance sheets of households, firms and banks, long-term household and business debt, macroprudential policy instruments and nominal and real rigidities and is calibrated to match dynamics in Canadian macroeconomic and financial data. We study the transmission of monetary policy and financial and real shocks in the model economy and analyze the effectiveness of various policies in simultaneously achieving macroeconomic and financial stability.

We study the relationship between ethnicity and conflict in South Africa during the fall of apartheid. Migration flows following the implementation and repeal of apartheid segregation laws induce cross-sectional and time variation in the ethnic composition of districts. Using Census data from the years before and after democratization, we compare the evolution of conflict across districts experiencing differential changes in ethnic composition. We find that ethnic polarization and inequality within the Black majority correlate strongly and positively with the incidence of armed confrontations between Black-dominated groups. Results suggest that during democratic transitions ethnic markers can become a salient technology to separate individuals into well-identified groups and mobilize them for political violence.

More specifically, we use unique data from the US, UK, and Italy to show that two major classes of social resource-personality and social capital-are significant predictors of planning capacity. We use the data to estimate frontier models that help establish three empirical facts about the ability to plan. First, planning ability depends on a rich array of social resources including networks, the freedom to participate, neighbourhood co-operation, and trust (social capital) and personality traits such as extroversion, conscientiousness, and emotional stability. Secondly, we provide evidence that some personalities are more efficient than others in using resources to help them plan. Thirdly, we develop evidence of three personality profiles, referred to as 'over-controlled', 'resilient' and 'under-controlled,' and highlight the fact that these three profiles benefit differently from various aspects of social resources capital. We discuss these findings and conclude that a wide range of economic policies designed to facilitate individual planning may need to allow for heterogeneities in social resources if they are to be successful.","[Anand, Paul] Open Univ, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England; [Anand, Paul] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Anand, Paul] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Poggi, Ambra] Univ Milano Bicocca, Milan, Italy; [Poggi, Ambra] Coll Carlo Alberto, Lab R Revelli, Turin, Italy",Open University - UK; University of Oxford; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Milano-Bicocca; Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Anand, P (通讯作者)，Open Univ, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England.;Anand, P (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford, England.;Anand, P (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",paul.anand@open.ac.uk,,"Anand, Paul/0000-0002-7701-6903",,,,,127,9,9,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,AUG,2018,71.0,3,,,,,343,373,,10.1111/kykl.12173,0.0,,,31,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GO4RL,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440000700001,0

We analyze the optimal design of capacity demand parameters. The presence of price-responsive capacity demand reduces firms' abilities to exercise market power, alleviates the volatile bimodal capacity market pricing structure, reduces market concentration, and increases expected consumer surplus. While capacity payments expand investment, the first-best aggregate level of capacity is not achieved at the optimal capacity payment parameters. We demonstrate that the addition of subsidized renewable generation capacity puts downward pressure on energy prices. When renewable output is not sufficiently positively correlated with energy demand, renewable capacity expansion reduces the expected available production capacity and increases the probability of capacity scarcity for a given level of capacity demand parameters. Consequently, the regulator must expand capacity payments to achieve the same level of resource adequacy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We show that improving an airport's position in the network of air links has a positive effect on local economic activity, as captured by satellite-measured night lights. We find that air links increase business links, showing that the movement of people fosters the movement of capital. In particular, this is driven mostly by capital flowing from high-income to middle-income (but not low-income) countries. Taken together, the results suggest that increasing interconnectedness induces links between businesses and generates economic activity at the local level but also gives rise to increased spatial inequality locally, and potentially globally.","[Campante, Filipe] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Campante, Filipe] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland",Johns Hopkins University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Zurich,"Campante, F (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",,,,Weatherhead Center for International Affairs at Harvard; Harvard Kennedy School Dean's Research Fund; Taubman Center for State and Local Government,Weatherhead Center for International Affairs at Harvard; Harvard Kennedy School Dean's Research Fund; Taubman Center for State and Local Government,"We thank the editor, Pol Antras, and five anonymous referees for very helpful comments and suggestions.

However, it also brings manure disposal problems. New Mexico ranks number one in the U.S. in dairy herd size. Dairy manure is a significant source of nitrates, and improper management of manure from large dairy farms can produce adverse environmental and health effects. We use a combination of life-cycle assessment, cost-benefit analysis, and sensitivity analysis to assess environmental and economic impacts of three alternative dairy manure management cases: direct land application (DLA), anaerobic digestion (AD), and anaerobic digestion coupled with microalgae cultivation (ADMC). By modeling a typical large dairy farm in New Mexico, four environmental impacts and the present value of net benefits of each case are evaluated under a baseline scenario and different policy scenarios. Our results show that, for a typical large dairy farm in New Mexico, the DLA case is the least sustainable regarding any of the environmental impacts. AD is most profitable in the baseline, tax credit, and carbon credit scenarios while ADMC is most profitable in the presence of a market for nutrient credits. Policy implications are discussed for dairy manure management coupled with bioenergy production on large dairy farms in arid regions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

If the product quality is endogenously chosen, we find that third-degree price discrimination increases welfare if a sufficiently pronounced complementarity between the willingness to pay and variable cost heterogeneity is given. This is due to the fact that the monopolist's incentive for employing a pronounced price dispersion strategy is directly influenced by the consumers' willingness to pay for the quality of a product. With endogenous product quality, the paper shows that the standard welfare result of third-degree price discrimination compared to uniform monopoly pricing (e.g. that total welfare and consumer surplus both fall if total output does not rise) can be only reversed given the complementarity is sufficiently pronounced.","[Klarl, Torben] Univ Bremen, Fac Business Studies & Econ, Hsch Ring 4, D-28259 Bremen, Germany; [Klarl, Torben] Indiana Univ, SPEA, 1315 E Tenth St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",University of Bremen; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Klarl, T (通讯作者)，Univ Bremen, Fac Business Studies & Econ, Hsch Ring 4, D-28259 Bremen, Germany.;Klarl, T (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, SPEA, 1315 E Tenth St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",tklarl@uni-bremen.de,,,,,,,14,1,1,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

The valuation model comprises two items and three bidders: two 'local' bidders demand one item only, while the third (global) bidder only wants both. The rules I compare include the Vickrey and first-price auctions, the Nearest-Bid Rule and the Reference Rule. Auction-level tests find the first-price auction revenue dominant overall without losing efficiency, while the Vickrey auction performs worst; the other two rules rank intermediate. Bidder-level tests of the experimental data reject the competitive equilibrium bidding functions: overbidding is widespread in all four auctions, and bidders are averse to submitting boundary bids. In core-selecting auctions bidders do not revert to truth-telling rules of thumb. I also observe behavior consistent with collusive bidding in the Vickrey auction. Contrary to theoretical predictions, the Vickrey auction performs worst on efficiency, primarily for this reason. Overall, my results suggest that even in the presence of complementarities, the simple first-price rule may not perform as poorly as feared. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, this observed correlation may be due to other unobserved factors affecting both alcohol consumption and working accidents (such as the type of job). Thus, in this paper we establish the causal impact of alcohol consumption on working accidents by exploiting a reduction in Spanish bar opening hours that was introduced progressively throughout regions and time. We first show that the policy effectively reduced working accidents. Although there may be many channels by which bar closing hours affect working accidents, we provide evidence that alcohol consumption, which stands as one of these potential channels, is also reduced after the introduction of the policy.

I also show that in a two country version of the model correlations between the two countries induces yardstick comparisons, and the borrowing decision of one government affects the bond price received by the other.

We re-examine the well known liability side equivalence principle in the light of the concept of salience. While these two topics have been extensively investigated in isolation, this paper innovates on the previous literature in that it focuses on their joint effects. Is tax incidence dependent on whether the subjects face a salient rather than a nonsalient tax? Does the salience of a tax exert a different effect depending on who is legally committed to bear the tax burden? We address these questions through a laboratory experiment in which one unit of a fictitious good is being traded through a double-auction market institution. Based on a panel data analysis, our contribution shows that point of collection matters and determines the economic incidence of tax. Additionally, we find that the joint effect of salience and statutory incidence does not alter the informative efficiency, but has a positive effect on buyers' allocational efficiency when the tax is levied on sellers.","[Morone, Andrea; Nemore, Francesco; Nuzzo, Simone] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro,"Morone, A; Nemore, F; Nuzzo, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dipartimento Econ Management & Diritto Impresa, Largo Abbazia Santa Scolast 53, I-70124 Bari, Italy.;Nuzzo, S (通讯作者)，Univ Katolik Zoja & Keshillit Mire, Ctr Ric Econ Paesi Transiz, Tirana, Albania.",andrea.morone@uniba.it; francesco.nemore@outlook.it; simone.nuzzo@uniba.it,,"NEMORE, FRANCESCO/0000-0001-8997-903X",,,,,39,3,5,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

This paper investigates the impact of exports concentration on fiscal pro-cyclicality in sub-Saharan Africa. The concentration of exports limits the sources of revenues for governments and restrains the fiscal room for maneuver. Using a sample of 40 countries over the period 1995-2015, we find that export concentration increases the degree of fiscal policy pro-cyclicality, and this result is driven by the behavior of public investment. Our findings highlight the importance of diversifying exports in order to widen the range of revenue sources for governments and pave the way of countercyclical public investment capable of generating sustainable growth.","[Ouedraogo, Rasmane] Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Sourouema, Windemanegda Sandrine] Univ Ouaga II, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso",International Monetary Fund,"Ouedraogo, R (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",ruedraogo@imf.org; sandrinewsourouema@yahoo.fr,,,,,,,40,10,10,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

However, specifically in energy systems optimization models, heterogeneity of consumer preferences for competing energy technologies (e.g., vehicles), has not been adequately represented, leading to behaviorally unrealistic modeling results. This can lead to policy analysis results that are viewed by stakeholders as clearly deficient. This paper shows how heterogeneous consumer behavioral effects can be introduced into these models in the form of perceived disutility costs, to more realistically capture consumer choice in making technology purchase decisions. We developed a novel methodology that incorporates the theory of a classic consumer choice model into a commonly used long-term energy systems modeling framework using a case study of light-duty vehicles. A diverse set of consumer segments (thirty-six) is created to represent observable, identifiable differences in factors such as annual driving distances and attitude towards risks of new technology. Non-monetary or disutility costs associated with these factors are introduced to capture the differences in preferences across consumer segments for various technologies. We also create clones within each consumer segment to capture randomly distributed unobservable differences in preferences. We provide and review results for a specific example that includes external factors such as recharging/refueling station availability, battery size of electric vehicles, recharging time and perceived technology risks. Although the example is for light-duty vehicles in the US using a specific modeling system, this approach can be implemented more broadly to model the adoption of consumer technologies in other sectors or regions in similar energy systems modeling frameworks.

Estimates of future emissions from car transport tend, though, to ignore technological change in electricity generation and bounded rationality of consumers. In this article we address these two shortcomings by developing a novel approach that captures the dynamic interdependence between the car industry and electricity generation. We assess how incorporating realistic behaviors affects estimates of emissions from passengers cars in four models of vehicle adoption, namely with rational, myopic, habit-oriented and loss aversive consumers. This is then combined with three behavioral models of travel distance, describing rational, habitual and loss-averse drivers. In the electricity sector, technological change occurs through installation of new power plants embodying different energy technologies. This allows us to study the impact of policies promoting renewable energy on the price of electricity, and indirectly on the rate of adoption of electric cars. The findings indicate that substituting renewable energy for fossil fuels in electricity generation by 2050 can triple the electricity price. This undermines the positive effect of subsidies on electric car adoption, with the specific effect depending on particular behaviors assumed to hold. In addition, we show that myopic and loss-averse consumers buy on average less fuel-efficient cars than rational agents. Habitual drivers tend to commute larger distances than rational ones, as they do not adjust their behavior optimally to changes in fuel prices and improvements in fuel efficiencies. These behavioral effects contribute to the rebound effect. Our findings indicate that vehicle choice and driving under rational behavior generate consistently the lowest estimates of life-cycle emissions. By ignoring more realistic behaviors consistent with bounded rationality, current studies underestimate emissions from passenger cars, in turn contributing to overly optimistic expectations about policy impacts.

The first scenario is a standard wind power investment, where the investor rents the land from local farms. In the second scenario, the wind power investor buys the land and commercializes both electricity and crop production, thus reducing the revenue risk through the diversification. Both scenarios have a waiting option, with the wholesale prices leading the installation decision. We model the electricity price as a mean reverting process with jumps and with different jumping probabilities for the different seasons of the year. Corn prices follow a mean reverting process. The waiting flexibility was modeled as a bundle of European options. The results indicate that the waiting option is exercised in 100% of our simulations in both scenarios, suggesting the still important role of government policies to stimulate wind power. More importantly, in more than 90% of the simulations, the second scenario brought value to the investment. Furthermore, net present values are more sensitive to reductions in capital costs than electricity prices. These results can form the basis for more effective policies for the wind power sector.

While foreign investment is providing much needed capital, through the conduct of monetary policy, the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV), which is an integral part of the government of Vietnam, is also playing an important role in nurturing the economic growth. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the success of the SBV policies. Monetary policy actions affect all sectors of real economies with a significant lag. Without a good understanding of the transmission mechanism, monetary policy actions may not achieve the desired outcomes. Using quarterly data from 1995 to 2010, this paper focuses on monetary policy transmission mechanisms in Vietnam. Specifically, we consider the dynamic response of the Vietnamese economy to interest rate, exchange rate and foreign shocks. The estimated results based on structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) methodology suggest that monetary shocks tend to have a strong influence on Vietnam's output. We find that Vietnam's monetary policy is relatively more susceptible to foreign shocks. (C) 2018 The Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

So long as the investors' marginal utility function is convex and the investors differ only in their risk-sharing needs, three substantive results hold: (1) a full disclosure policy minimizes the value of the firm; (2) lifting a mandate of full disclosure does not imply that firms will necessarily choose to withhold information maximally; and (3) with many firms that strategically choose disclosure policies, all Nash equilibria display only partial disclosure. Our insight is based on the role that the firm's equity can play as a risk-sharing device: if the firm chooses to keep some information private, its stock can be used by investors to hedge against risk. The problem that we study is of theoretical interest, but it is also topical: the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act, which was signed into law in April 2012, substantially eases securities regulations for small companies going public. The declared intent of this change in regulation was to promote capital formation in new and small companies.

We propose three new explanations for this puzzle. First, a large majority of the recent rise in measured remittances may be illusory - arising from changes in measurement. Second, cross-country regressions may lack power to detect such growth effects. Third, remittances rise primarily with rising emigration, whose opportunity cost to GDP creates endogeneity bias. Migration and remittances clearly have first-order effects on poverty, migrant households' welfare and global GDP but detecting the effect of remittances on economic growth faces important challenges.","[Clemens, Michael A.] Ctr Global Dev, 2055 L St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA; IZA, Washington, DC USA; World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; BREAD, Washington, DC USA; CReAM, Washington, DC USA",The World Bank,"Clemens, MA (通讯作者)，Ctr Global Dev, 2055 L St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",mclemens@cgdev.org,,,William and Flora Hewlett Foundation; Good Ventures; Center for Global Development; World Bank,William and Flora Hewlett Foundation; Good Ventures; Center for Global Development; World Bank(The World Bank India),"We thank the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and Good Ventures for generous financial support, and we thank Yuvraj Pathak and Nabil Hashmi for excellent research assistance.

In this paper we show, more generally, that these changes in wholesale/manufacturing prices can be offset and even dominated by adjustments in retail markups. Retailers have an incentive to charge the highest markups on the lowest-cost products and to adjust the markups on these products most actively. Thus, if the procurement costs of some foreign products rise, retailers will absorb these cost increases by raising prices relatively more on their relatively more efficient products, thereby mitigating the benefits of a protectionist tariff. We show that this effect can dominate the traditional substitution effect, which highlights the need to better understand the role of retailers in trade policy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In a nutshell, this term refers to the process by which even agents who are geographically far apart come to interact, thus being able to overcome what would otherwise be a fast saturation of local opportunities. Akey feature of our model is that the social network is the main channel through which agents exploit new opportunities. Therefore, only if the social network becomes global (heuristically, it reaches far in few steps) can global interaction be steadily sustained. An important insight derived from the model is that, for the social network to turn global, the long-range links required (bridges) cannot endogenously arise unless the matching mechanism displays significant local structure (cohesion). This sheds novel light on the dichotomy between bridging and cohesion that has long played a prominent role in the socio-economic literature. Our analysis also relates the process of globalization to other features of the environment such as the quality of institutions or the arrival rate of fresh ideas. The model is partially studied analytically for a limit scenario with a continuum population and is fully solved numerically for finite-population contexts.","[Duernecker, Georg] Univ Munich, Munich, Germany; [Vega-Redondo, Fernando] Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy; [Vega-Redondo, Fernando] IGIER, Milan, Italy",University of Munich; Bocconi University; Bocconi University,"Duernecker, G (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Munich, Germany.",,,"Duernecker, Georg/0000-0002-6088-2522",,,,,54,16,18,3,43,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Tracking reduces low-scoring students' GPAs and has little effect on high-scoring students, leading to lower and more dispersed GPAs. I also directly estimate peer effects using random variation in peer groups across dormitories. Living with higher-scoring peers raises students' GPAs, particularly for low-scoring students, and peer effects are stronger between socially proximate students. This shows that much of the treatment effect of tracking is attributable to peer effects.

We consider a model of international trade that features the home market effect-where there are differences in income and productivity between sectors and between countries-to identify additional channels by which to determine the effects of international trade on industrialization. The introduction of non-homothetic preferences and differences in productivity can aid in interpreting of some apparent paradoxes within international trade, such as the commercial relations between more populated countries as China and India and large economies in term of their GDP as the U.S. Population size, demand composition, and productivity levels constitute the three main channels by which to determine the effects of international trade. Interactions among these channels define the results obtained, especially in terms of the countries' industrialization levels.

If the firm finds itself in an operating mode with a price just above the abandonment threshold, it is un-clear whether to exercise the abandonment option or to exercise the mothballing option. If the price goes down, the firm may exit, but, surprisingly, if it goes up, it may mothball. We find that two different strategies could be optimal: one where mothballing is not a viable option and one where mothballing does occur. In the latter case a hysteresis region arises in which the firm produces at a loss, while a further price decrease induces exit and a sufficient price increase results in the firm entering the mothballing stage. Mothballing being optimal requires sufficiently large values of the price trend and the uncertainty parameter. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A second model (disintegrated) assumes such expansion decisions as independent, such that the expansion of the network follows an exogenous process. This duality of approaches has been the subject of academic and public-policy discussion in various systems, as is the case of the German electricity system. The two models are simulated for the transmission network of Baja California Sur, which is a self-contained system with relatively few nodes and lines allowing a realistic study on the characteristics of efficient expansion within its electricity network.

I use a dynamic general equilibrium model to show that changes in the distribution of global production and absorption explain this pattern. For advanced economies, whose share of world output fell as their trade openness rose, the model predicts an unambiguous drop in home bias. By contrast, emerging economies' growth in both size and trade openness have opposing implications for portfolios. To quantify these forces I calibrate the model to real and counterfactual input-output tables. Jointly, changes in the global production structure account for much of the decline in home bias in advanced economies and lack thereof in emerging economies.

The model shows that any type of shock - monetary or fiscal - can generate either a negative or positive relationship between short-run volatility and long-run growth, critically depending on the size of government and the elasticity of output with respect to labor/capital. In particular, given the labor income share, it shows that excessive government spending may cause the impact of fiscal volatility on long-run growth to turn from positive to negative. In addition, a rise in the volatility of the monetary shock is capable of generating either an increase or decrease in the mean of growth. With the range of the labor share values in reality, the model produces results consistent with the fact that the relationship between volatility and growth is generally found empirically to be more negative in developing than in developed countries. The model can be seen as a further explanation for the ambiguous empirical evidence in the existing literature.","[The Anh Pham] Natl Econ Univ, Hanoi, Vietnam",National Economics University - Vietnam,"Pham, TA (通讯作者)，Natl Econ Univ, Hanoi, Vietnam.",pham.theanh@yahoo.com,,,,,,,34,1,1,0,1,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1617-982X,1617-9838,,PORT ECON J,Port.

My hypothesis is that along with the financialisation of economies that has taken place since 1990, inequality increased because labour flexibility intensified, labour market institutions weakened as trade unions lost power, and public social spending started to retrench and did not compensate for the vulnerabilities created by the globalisation process. Using data from 25 high-income OECD countries from 1990 to 2013, I empirically evaluate this hypothesis. My results clearly suggest that the increase in inequality over the past two decades is caused by an increase in financialisation, a deepening of labour flexibility, the weakening of trade unions and the retrenchment of the welfare state.","[Tridico, Pasquale] Roma Tre Univ, Rome, Italy",Roma Tre University,"Tridico, P (通讯作者)，Roma Tre Univ, Dept Econ, Via Silvio Damico 111, I-00154 Rome, Italy.",Tridico@uniroma3.it,,,,,,,92,54,55,1,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

In addition to generalize many previous semi-and non-parametric specifications, LML is computationally very efficient due to a computationally-convenient likelihood equation that does not require computation of choice probabilities in iterative optimization. However, the original LML formulation assumes all utility parameters to be random. This study extends LML to a combination of fixed and random parameters (LML-FR), and motivates such combination in random parameter choice models in general. We further show that the likelihood of the LML-FR specification loses its special properties, leading to a much higher estimation time. In an empirical application about preferences for alternative fuel vehicles in China, estimation time increased by a factor of 20-40 when introducing fixed parameters. Despite losses in computation efficiency, we show that the flexibility of LML-FR is essential for retrieving eventual multimodality of mixing distributions.","[Bansal, Prateek] Cornell Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 301 Hollister Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Daziano, Ricardo A.] Cornell Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 305 Hollister Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Achtnicht, Martin] Dresden & Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Leibniz Inst Ecol Urban & Reg Dev IOER, Mannheim, Germany",Cornell University; Cornell University; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Leibniz Institut fur okologische Raumentwicklung,"Bansal, P (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 301 Hollister Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",pb422@cornell.edu; daziano@cornell.edu; m.achtnicht@ioer.de,"Daziano, Ricardo A/N-4604-2014","Bansal, Prateek/0000-0001-6851-8461",National Science Foundation [CMMI-1462289],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This research is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation Award No. CMMI-1462289.

This paper argues that this may explain the relationship between executive constraints and inflows of foreign investment. It uses a novel dataset of Dutch sector-level investments between 1983 and 2012 to explore this issue. It formulates an economic model of investment and uses data on the mean and variance of productivity growth to explain the relationship between investment inflows and executive constraints. The model can account for the aggregate change in inflows when strong executive constraints are adopted in terms of the reduction in the volatility in productivity growth. The data and model together suggest a natural way of thinking about country-level heterogeneity in investment inflows following the adoption of strong executive constraints.,"[Besley, Timothy] LSE, London, England; [Besley, Timothy] CIFAR, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Mueller, Hannes] CSIC, IAE, Madrid, Spain; [Mueller, Hannes] Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE); Barcelona School of Economics,"Besley, T (通讯作者)，LSE, London, England.;Besley, T (通讯作者)，CIFAR, Toronto, ON, Canada.",t.besley@lse.ac.uk; h.mueller.uni@gmail.com,"Mueller, Hannes/ABC-1470-2020","Mueller, Hannes/0000-0001-7667-3971",IGC; Ramon y Cajal programme; MINECO/FEDER [ECO2015-66883-P]; MINECO through the Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence in RD [SEV-2015-0563],IGC; Ramon y Cajal programme(Spanish Government); MINECO/FEDER; MINECO through the Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence in RD,"We thank the editor and five anonymous referees for valuable comments and suggestions.

In view of this, the commercialization and diffusion of knowledge/technology, developed in academia, have increased the attention of policy makers as strategic and key element, supporting and fostering the regional socio-economic development and competitiveness. University spin-offs (USOs), companies created to exploit the knowledge and technology developed within a university, are a potential and active way to stimulate the knowledge growth of economies in different regional contexts. The paper tests the hypothesis that USOs may partly determine the competitive advantage of the regions. Based on a longitudinal sample of 952 USOs located in 20 Italian administrative regions and by applying 6 linear-mixed models, the results show that USOs effectively contribute in fostering regional competitiveness only in terms of number (count) of USOs from a given university, while the effect of their patent activity is weak.

We focus our research on marathon races with pace setters as their presence allows for us to identify exogenous peer effects by identifying variation in peer performance and ability that is exogenous. Using data on elite male runners from 2009 to 2014 marathons in Berlin, Chicago, and London, we find the presence of negative exogenous peer effects and this result is robust to a number of peer performance variables.

As such, the question is how to analyze the impact of various macroeconomic variables on gold. We use the GARCH-MIDAS (mixed data sampling) model to investigate whether macroeconomic variables can improve the predictions on the volatility structure of U.S. gold futures. Our empirical results reveal that macroeconomic variables have a significant influence on gold volatility, especially during and after the global financial crisis, indicating macroeconomic variables are driving factors of the long-term volatility on the U.S. gold futures market. Additionally, we use principal component analysis to obtain key information on different macroeconomic variables and further investigate their joint effects on the volatility of gold futures, finding that the first and second principal components are good proxies of macroeconomic variables. Our results show that principal components improve forecast accuracy, as do macrovariables, which are robust to various forecast rolling window schemes.","[Fang, Libing; Yu, Honghai; Xiao, Wen] Nanjing Univ, Sch Management & Engn, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University,"Yu, HH (通讯作者)，22 Hankou Rd, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",hhyu@nju.edu.cn,,,,,,,39,29,30,3,64,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

However, the equivalence parameters traditionally applied to market income do not plausibly apply to non-market income. Economies of scale in the relationship between living standards and household income are greater for non-market income from household production than market income, and the costs of children relative to adults are higher in household production time than in cash expenditures. Also, the presence of a full-time family caregiver significantly reduces cash expenditures on child care. This paper proposes equivalence scales that can be separately applied to the components of extended income, and demonstrates their empirical relevance with pooled data from the American Time Use Survey for 2010-2014. The proposed parameters significantly alter the relative contribution of non-market income to extended income and modify comparisons of extended income across different family household types, with particularly significant implications for the relative well-being of those with and without full-time family caregivers.","[Folbre, Nancy] Univ Massachusetts, Polit Econ Res Inst, Program Gender & Care Work, Amherst, MA 01351 USA; [Murray-Close, Marta] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01351 USA; [Suh, Jooyeoun] Univ Oxford, Ctr Time Use Res, Oxford OX2 6HP, England",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; University of Oxford,"Murray-Close, M (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01351 USA.",nancy.folbre@gmail.com; mmurrayclose@gmail.com; jooyeouns@gmail.com,,"Gershuny, Jonathan/0000-0001-5011-0257","ESRC [ES/F037937/1, ES/L011662/1] Funding Source: UKRI",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,59,8,8,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Emerging economies with high inflation persistence need to adjust macroeconomic policies in a significant way to price shocks (e.g., at the cost of substantial output decrease), since these shocks can affect expectations and inflation for a much longer period. We propose a novel way to estimate inflation persistence by using a quantile autoregression (QAR) model, which allows for asymmetric dynamics and quantile-specific unit roots. An empirical exercise with Brazilian data from January 1995 to May 2017 illustrates the method. The results indicate that inflation is globally stationary, but exhibits non-stationary behavior in 28% of the observations. In addition, shocks occurring when inflation is higher seem to have greater dissipation time compared to shocks that occur when inflation is lower.","[Gaglianone, Wagner Piazza; Rodrigues Figueiredo, Francisco Marcos] Banco Cent Brasil, Res Dept, Av Presidente Vargas 730,14th Floor, BR-20071900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [de Carvalho Guillen, Osmani Teixeira] Banco Cent Brasil, Open Market Operat Dept, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [de Carvalho Guillen, Osmani Teixeira] Ibmec, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Central Bank of Brazil; Central Bank of Brazil,"Gaglianone, WP (通讯作者)，Banco Cent Brasil, Res Dept, Av Presidente Vargas 730,14th Floor, BR-20071900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",wagner.gaglianone@bcb.gov.br; osmani.guillen@bcb.gov.br; francisco-marcos.figueiredo@bcb.gov.br,"Gaglianone, Wagner P/M-7586-2017; Figueiredo, FRANCISCO/ABF-6119-2020","Gaglianone, Wagner P/0000-0003-0796-2117; Teixeira de Carvalho Guillen, Osmani/0000-0002-3507-0901",CNPq; INCT,CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); INCT,"The views expressed in the paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect those of the Banco Central do Brasil.

After firms completed the reform, their float increased by 31% on average, while turnover and trading volume also increased substantially. We use information from firms' reform plan to derive an estimate of the price premium of tradable shares over non-tradable shares before the reform and find that, after controlling for differences in liquidity and profitability, the price premium is significantly related to proxies for the level of speculative trading in tradable shares. Moreover, firms that were highly speculated before the reform had significantly smaller increase in turnover and trading volume than firms that were less speculated. Overall, our evidence confirms that there is a significant speculative component in the market price of tradable shares in China and a large increase in float dampens speculative trading.","[Hwang, Chuan-Yang] Nanyang Technol Univ, Nanyang Business Sch, S3-01B-46 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Zhang, Shaojun] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Sch Accounting & Finance, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Yanjian] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Econ, 38 Zheda Rd, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Nanyang Technological University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Zhejiang University,"Zhu, YJ (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Coll Econ, 38 Zheda Rd, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",cyhwang@ntu.edu.sg; afszhang@inet.polyu.edu.hk; zhuyanjian@zju.edu.cn,,"Zhang, Shaojun/0000-0001-6138-0308",Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [LQ13G030002]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403238]; Zhijiang Youth of Social Science Scholar Supporting Project; Hong Kong Polytechnic University [G-YM74],Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Zhijiang Youth of Social Science Scholar Supporting Project; Hong Kong Polytechnic University(Hong Kong Polytechnic University),"Yanjian Zhu would like to thank the financial supports by the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (LQ13G030002), National Natural Science Foundation of China (71403238), and the Zhijiang Youth of Social Science Scholar Supporting Project.

Both tools reinforce each other when a foreign exchange risk premium shock hits the economy. A contractionary U.S. monetary policy shock has significant real effects in EMEs. Conventional wisdom tells us that a free floating exchange rate with inflation targeting is better when a country faces foreign shocks. However, we show that a flexible exchange rate with less capital controls is not the best option in EMEs based on vector autoregression analysis. Moreover, we set up a small open economy new Keynesian model with real wage and price rigidities. It shows that the small economy with labor market frictions is more vulnerable to exogenous shocks such as a foreign exchange rate shock under a fixed exchange rate regime than under a flexible exchange regime. We show that maintaining price stability is not desirable when there are substantial frictions in the labor market and the intratemporal elasticity of substitution is high. Finally, the model shows that the welfare cost difference between a policy of maintaining purchasing power and a policy aimed at price stability reverses as the intratemporal elasticity of substitution between home and foreign goods increases.","[Jung, Yongseung] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Econ, 26 Kyungheedae Ro, Seoul 02447, South Korea; [Kim, Soyoung] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Yang, Doo Yong] Kyung Hee Univ, Coll Int Studies, 1732 Deogyeong Daero, Yongin 17104, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Kyung Hee University; Seoul National University (SNU); Kyung Hee University,"Jung, Y (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Econ, 26 Kyungheedae Ro, Seoul 02447, South Korea.",jungys@khu.ac.kr; soyoungkim@snu.ac.kr; yangdy@khu.ac.kr,"Jung, Yongseung/AAI-1058-2020",,National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2014S1A3A2044637],National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from National Research Foundation of Korea grant NRF-2014S1A3A2044637.,,34,0,0,0,9,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

Yet, little is known about the roles played by road width vs road length. This paper attempts to fill this gap by estimating the effects of road infrastructure on PM10 using city-level data from China. Our robust modeling results show that the road density index, defined as the ratio of road surface area to city territory size, is negatively correlated with PM10. More importantly, when the road width and length components of the road density variable are separately included in the regression models, the width is found to be significantly and negatively correlated with PM10, whereas the correlation with the length variable is insignificant. This is expected as increases in road width can help mitigate congestion, improve fuel efficiency, and thus reduce emissions. On the contrary, extending roads to new or unconnected areas is likely to bring more vehicles onto the roads and extend average driving time. Our findings appeal for careful consideration of the trade-off between road width (lane numbers) and road length when planning and constructing urban road infrastructure.","[Luo, Zhi] Wuhan Univ, Econ Dev Res Ctr, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Luo, Zhi] Wuhan Univ, Econ & Management Sch, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wan, Guanghua] Chongqing Technol & Business Univ, Sch Econ, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Wan, Guanghua] Asian Dev Bank, Mandaluyong, Philippines; [Wang, Chen] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Urban & Reg Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chen] Leiden Univ, Dept Econ, Leiden, Netherlands; [Zhang, Xun] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Stat, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xun] Peking Univ, Inst Digital Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; Wuhan University; Chongqing Technology & Business University; Asian Development Bank; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Beijing Normal University; Peking University,"Wang, C (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Urban & Reg Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",luozhi@whu.edu.cn; gwan@adbi.org; wang.chen@mail.shufe.edu.cn; zhangxun@bnu.edu.cn,,"Zhang, Xun/0000-0002-1991-4975","Bairen Program of Yunnan province; NSF of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [71133004, 71373186, 71603026]; National Social Science Foundation of China [15ZDA027, 16ZDA006]; Major Program of Minister of Education, China [13JZD008]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2015M580055, 2016M591645, 2016T90048]; Youth Scholars Program of Beijing Normal University","Bairen Program of Yunnan province; NSF of the National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Major Program of Minister of Education, China; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Youth Scholars Program of Beijing Normal University","We are indebted to Professor Siqi Zheng, Dr. Cong Sun, and Dr. Shuai Chen for providing some of the data and useful suggestions.

Our theoretical model yields two main predictions: First, an increase in the risk aversion of a player worsens her odds unless she already has a sufficiently large advantage. Second, if the prize money is sufficiently large, a less able but less risk averse contestant can achieve an equal or even higher probability of winning than a more able but more risk averse opponent. In a laboratory experiment we confirm both, the non-monotonic impact and the compensating effect of risk aversion on winning probabilities.

Further, given the degree of importance of each firm's relative performance and the number of private firms, we find that the optimal degree of privatisation can decrease as the degree of product differentiation declines.

The results indicate that there is a significant long-run relationship between the variables under study.

The author tests this hypothesis using data on 74 countries from 1993 to 2012. His explanatory variable is a dichotomous democracy measure, but he alters his analysis from previous research by assuming that democracy is not an exogenous variable. Instead, he uses the theory of Huntington (The third wave: Democratization in the late twentieth century, 1991) and the methodology of Acemoglu et al. ( Democracy does cause growth, 2014) about democratization waves. According to this theory, democratizations occur in regional waves; consequently, diffusion of demand for or discontent with a political system is easier to happen in neighbouring countries due to economic, political and historical similarities. This measure shows us that demand for or discontent with a given political system in a geographical area, influences a country's political system and its tax choices. Using a 2SLS fixed effects model the author finds that democratization waves positively affect democracy, and in turn democracy increases direct and indirect taxes. These results remain the same using several robustness tests.","[Balamatsias, Pavlos] Univ Ioannina, Dept Econ, Ioannina, Greece",University of Ioannina,"Balamatsias, P (通讯作者)，Univ Ioannina, Dept Econ, Ioannina, Greece.",pavlosbalamatsias@yahoo.com,,,,,,,28,5,5,0,9,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAY 7,2018,12.0,,,,,,,,201827,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2018-27,0.0,,,28,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GF2UE,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431794400001,0

So far, the economic literature has neglected the relationships existing between illegal markets, money laundering and the business cycle. We propose a dynamic model where the business cycle influences the criminal economy via two different channels. On the one side, illegal markets grow at variable rates, depending on the health of the legal economy. Second, a pass-through effect can exist, since the business cycle affects the legal markets which criminal operators use to launder their revenues. Furthermore, we analyze the consequences of a saturation effect' limiting maximum accumulation of illegal capital. We find that overall illegal capital is affected by the business cycle through a capital multiplier; in addition to this, the dynamics of interest rates in financial markets can influence such multiplier.","[Barone, Raffaella; Delle Side, Domenico] Univ Salento, Lecce, Italy; [Delle Side, Domenico] Natl Inst Nucl Phys INFN, Sect Lecce, Lecce, Italy; [Masciandaro, Donato] Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy; [Masciandaro, Donato] SUERF, Milan, Italy",University of Salento; Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN); Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI); Bocconi University,"Barone, R (通讯作者)，Univ Salento, Dept Law, Via Arnesano Sn, I-73100 Lecce, Italy.",raffaella.barone@unisalento.it,"Delle Side, Domenico DDS/E-9245-2014",,Development and Cohesion Fund,Development and Cohesion Fund,Development and Cohesion Fund 2007-2013,,62,9,11,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,MAY,2018,69.0,2,,,,,409,426,,10.1111/meca.12193,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GB2MW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428888200005,0

Two workhorse models dominate the literature analyzing these policies: Learning by Doing (LBD) and Ben-Porath (BP). This paper makes two novel findings related to these models. First, LBD and BP generate different predictions for life-cycle earnings growth. BP predicts that the heterogeneity in earnings growth rates across workers should disappear over the life-cycle because the workers stop investing as they age. The LBD model cannot replicate this feature because workers accumulate human capital automatically throughout the life-cycle. Second, the same model features that generate different life-cycle predictions between BP and LBD also generate different implications for policies that affect the payoff to human capital accumulation. To illustrate this quantitatively, I show that increasing marginal labor tax rates for top earners depresses human capital accumulation more under BP. As a result, the Laffer curve for top marginal income tax rates is flatter, and peaks 10 percentage points lower, with BP versus LBD. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The members of a team are guided both by economic incentives and by personal norms, weighed according to their prevailing level of materialism. We assume that personal norms evolve following a dynamic driven by a combination of psychological mechanisms such as consistency and conformism. The different vectors of materialism, consistency and conformism shared by the group result in a continuum of cultures characterized by different combinations of individualism and collectivism. Team culture turns out to be a fundamental determinant for long term group performance. When income distribution is not completely egalitarian or the members of the team display heterogeneous levels of skills, there is an optimal culture that maximizes steady state team production and its characteristics depend on the specific distribution of income and skills.

In the past decade, terrorism fears remained relatively subdued as groups such as Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA) and the Irish Republican Army (IRA) relinquished their arms. However, Europe now faces renewed fear and elevated threats in the form of Middle Eastern and religious extremism sourced in the growth of the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL), who remain firmly focused on maximising casualty and collateral damage utilising minimal resources. Our results indicate that acts of domestic terrorism significantly increase domestic stock market volatility, however international acts of terrorism within Europe does not present significant stock market volatility in Ireland and Spain. Secondly, bombings and explosions within Europe present evidence of stock market volatility across all exchanges, whereas infrastructure attacks, hijackings and hostage events do not generate widespread volatility effects. Finally, the growth of ISIL-inspired terror since 2011 is found to be directly influencing stock market volatility in France, Germany, Greece, Italy and the UK.

While such inequality can be due to superstar dynamics or factor complementarities, Tervio (Superstars and Mediocrities: Market Failure in The Discovery of Talent, the Review of Economic Studies, 2009) first proposed a market failure that was previously unknown to the literature, pointing to long-term contracts as a solution. I extend the model in Tervio (2009) to include personal income tax policy reforms and demonstrate that tax design can be employed as a solution to the market failure when long-term contracts are unfeasible. With reasonably small enough entry payments that novice workers would sustain to compensate employers for the possibility to be discovered as high-talent types, both a progressive tax and a tax incentive on entry wages are found effective. The tax incentive on entry wages, though, can be used even with very large deductible entry payments and with overall negative net entry wages. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

In principle this allows different agents in the same player role to have different beliefs and play differently, and this is known to occur in laboratory experiments. To explore the impact of this heterogeneity, along with the idea that subjects use their information about other players' payoffs, we define rationalizable partition confirmed equilibrium (RPCE). We provide several examples to highlight the impact of heterogeneous beliefs, and show how mixed strategies can correspond to heterogeneous play in a large population. We also show that every heterogeneous-belief RPCE can be approximated by a RPCE in a model where every agent in a large pool is a separate player. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The success of private schools in Britain in delivering high academic achievements and better-paid jobs has been attributed to these schools engendering high self-evaluations, greater aspirations and social networks. Using recently repaired data on secondary school type from the 1970 British Cohort Study, we find that internal locus of control, aspirations and access to networks, but not self-esteem, are raised by private schooling. Locus of control and aspirations (but not networks or self-esteem) each have modest effects on earnings at age 42. Yet only a small part of the private school earnings premium is accounted for by all these factors. Much of the premium is due, rather, to educational attainments. This evidence suggests that strategies to strengthen self-evaluations or aspirations in state schools will contribute little on their own to the objective of greater equality or social mobility.","[Green, Francis; Parsons, Samantha; Sullivan, Alice; Wiggins, Richard] UCL, Inst Educ, London, England",University of London; University College London; UCL Institute of Education,"Green, F (通讯作者)，UCL, Bedford Way, London WC1H 0AL, England.",,"Li, Wang/M-1612-2019","Green, Francis/0000-0002-6786-5012","ESRC [ES/K007238/1]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M001660/1, ES/K007238/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K007238/1, ES/M001660/1] Funding Source: UKRI",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),UCL Institute of Education.

Our results reveal that - in descending order of importance - tangible assets (positive sign), market-to-book ratio (negative sign), and profitability (negative sign) are significant determinants of corporate debt level. In addition, we find evidence for publication selection bias in academic literature. Accordingly, specific results are systematically over-represented, as authors prefer reporting statistically significant estimates in line with theory or existing empirical results. Significant determinants, as well as publication selection bias, are more pronounced for characteristics like market-based measures of capital structure, total debt measures of capital structure, and for top articles in highly renowned journals, compared to book-based measures of capital structure or long-term debt measures of capital structure or randomly selected articles including more unknown and unpublished studies.

For instance, industry partners pay today for R&D that may or may not deliver a cure to some viruses, agents pay for the edges of a network that will cover their connectivity needs, but the edges may fail, etc. Each user has a binary inelastic need that is served if and only if certain subsets of items are actually functioning. We ask how should the cost be divided when individual needs are heterogenous. We impose three powerful separability properties: Independence of Timing ensures that the cost shares computed ex ante are the expectation, over the random realization of the projects, of shares computed ex post. Cost Additivity together with Separability Across Projects ensure that the cost shares of an item depend only upon the service provided by that item for a given realization of all other items.

The seller knows the quality of his product, while the buyer does not. During bargaining, the seller may receive an outside option, the value of which depends on the quality of the product. If the outside option is sufficiently important, there is an equilibrium in which the buyer's belief about the product's quality stays constant and she continues to make the same randomized offer throughout the bargaining process. As a result, the equilibrium behavior produces an outcome path that resembles a bargaining deadlock and its resolution. The equilibrium outcome exhibits bargaining delay that does not vanish even with frequent offers, and the limiting delay may exist even without a static adverse selection problem. Under stronger parametric assumptions, the equilibrium with deadlock is the only one in which behavior is monotonic in the buyer's belief. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Contrary to standard tax competition theory, there is also strong evidence that corporate income taxes are increasing with respect to the LDCs' openness, as measured by capital mobility.

Scratch-off players are as well more impatient and more likely to sacrifice expected value for positive skewness and they overestimate the probability of winning at least the price of the ticket.

Based on mixed multivariate proportional hazard models with competing risks, we find a significant negative relationship between the contemporaneous probability of having a child and horizontal career transitions for women and a positive significant association of the hazard of parenthood with upward career transitions for men. These effects persist when we apply fixed-effects panel data models allowing for correlation of individual parenthood hazards with unobserved individual characteristics.

None have done so more eagerly than Ethiopia. The present paper draws on Justin Yifu Lin's framework of New Structural Economics to assess Ethiopia's industrial policies and engagement in the leather industry. Making use of two rounds of semi-structured interviews (2012 and 2015) with all of the foreign firms and more than a dozen local firms in the leather sector, as well as other key stakeholders, it examines seven steps the government took to build the industrial policy: Create a high-level focus on the sector; make strategic use of international development partners; attract a lead goose (Chinese) in the footwear sector; build government capacity to support the sector; strengthen business associations; shock-to-shape upgrading; improve input supply. Ultimately, while government interventions have led to improvements across several steps of the value chain, the paper identifies a number of factors that have prevented the country from fully realizing a latent comparative advantage in the leather sector.

Our theory predicts that people who are more altruistic are more likely to take a public service job and, for a given job, make higher donations to charity. Comparing equally altruistic workers, those with a regular job make higher donations to charity than those with a public service job by a simple substitution argument. We subsequently test these predictions using cross-sectional data from Germany on self-reported altruism, sector of employment, and donations to charity.

We examined the educational divide between the Centre-North and the South using the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition and we estimated the Educational Kuznets Curve through a dynamic panel model. According to the results, the Southern educational gap is mainly influenced by the relative ineffectiveness of public expenditure in Southern Italy, where private economic wealth has a stronger educational impact. We verified Kuznets's hypothesis concerning the inverted U-shaped relationship between educational inequality and attainments. Moreover, individual educational inequality appears to be path dependent, positively linked to economic inequality and negatively influenced by educational public expenditure.","[Guarini, Giulio; Laureti, Tiziana; Garofalo, Giuseppe] Tuscia Univ, Dept Econ Engn Soc & Business Org, Via Paradiso 37, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy",Tuscia University,"Laureti, T (通讯作者)，Tuscia Univ, Dept Econ Engn Soc & Business Org, Via Paradiso 37, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy.",giulioguarini@unitus.it; laureti@unitus.it; garofalo@unitus.it,"Garofalo, Giuseppe/HNQ-0582-2023",,,,,,127,6,6,2,20,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Higher values for robbery reflect people's aversion to the violence implicit in this type of crime. The annual value of avoiding a statistical case of crime ranges between 7,011 pound for theft and 90,087 pound for robbery. WTP-WTA ratios range from 1: 4.8 to 1: 16.9 and are influenced by type of crime and elicitation method.

We derive sufficient-statistics formulae capturing the marginal insurance value and incentive costs of unemployment-benefits paid at different times during a spell. Our approach allows us to revisit separate arguments for inclining or declining profiles put forward in the theoretical literature and to identify welfare-improving-changes in the benefit profile that account for all relevant arguments jointly: For the empirical implementation, we use administrative data on unemployment, linked to data on consumption, income, and wealth in Sweden. First, we exploit duration-dependent kinks in the replacement rate and find that, if anything, the moral hazard cost of benefits is larger when paid earlier the spell. Second, we find that the drop in consumption affecting the insurance value of benefits is large from the start of the spell, hut further increases throughout tie spell. In trading off insurance and incentives, our analysis suggests that the flat benefit profile in Sweden has been too generous overall. However, both from the insurance and the incentives side, we find no evidence to support the introduction of a declining tilt in the profile.","[Kolsrud, Jonas] Natl Inst Econ Res, Box 3116, SE-10362 Stockholm, Sweden; [Landais, Camille; Spinnewijn, Johannes] London Sch Econ, Houghton St, London WC21 2AE, England; [Nilsson, Peter] Stockholm Univ, Inst Int Econ Studies, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Stockholm University,"Kolsrud, J (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Econ Res, Box 3116, SE-10362 Stockholm, Sweden.",jonas@kolsrud.se; c.landais@lse.ac.uk; peter.nilsson@ites.su.se; j.spinnewijn@lse.ac.uk,"Spinnewijn, Johannes/AAR-7532-2020",,ERC [716485]; FORTE [2015-00663]; Sloan foundation (NBER grant) [22-2382-15-1-33-003]; STICERD; CEP; Formas [2015-00663] Funding Source: Formas; Forte [2015-00663] Funding Source: Forte; European Research Council (ERC) [716485] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); FORTE(Swedish Research Council for Health Working Life & Welfare (Forte)); Sloan foundation (NBER grant); STICERD; CEP; Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas); Forte(Swedish Research Council for Health Working Life & Welfare (Forte)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We thank Tony Atkinson, Richard Blundell, Raj Chetty, Liran Einav, Hugo Hopenhayn, Philipp Kircher, Henrik Kleven, Alan Manning, Arash Nekoei, Nicola Pavoni, Torsten Persson, Jean-Marc Robin, Emmanuel Saez, Florian Scheuer, Robert Shimer, Frans Spinnewyn, Ivan Werning, Gabriel Zucman, and seminar participants at the NBER PF Spring Meeting, SED Warsaw, EEA Mannheim, DIW Berlin, Kiel, Zurich, Helsinki, Stanford, Leuven, Uppsala, IIES, Yale, IFS, Wharton, Sciences Po, UCLA, Sussex, Berkeley, MIT, Columbia, LMU, and LSE for helpful discussions and suggestions.

He found that optimal monetary policy in such an economy must strike a balance between stabilization of the bubble and stabilization of aggregate demand. This paper extends Gali (Am Econ Rev 104(3):721-752, 2014)'s model by introducing various financial frictions in the bubbly economy with a Samuelson 2-period overlapping agents and examine how 'leaning against the wind' macro-prudential policies like capital adequacy affect the size and volatility of bubble, inflation and aggregate demand. While the results of the model with financial frictions vindicate Gali (Am Econ Rev 104(3):721-752, 2014) that a leaning against the wind monetary policy generates a larger volatility in the bubble than a policy of benign neglect, the paper finds that minimisation of bubble volatility requires an active macro-prudential policy. It is also observed that stronger interest rate response of monetary policy to the bubble necessitates a stronger macroprudential response possibly to absorb the excess volatility generated by the monetary policy. However, the paper also finds that tightening macroprudential policy parameter beyond a threshold value may encourage banks to take more risks and increase credit supply, aggravating the bubble in the process. With respect to macroprudential policy, there is no conflict between stabilization of current aggregate demand and stabilization of future aggregate demand and both call for a strong macroprudential response, at least until the macroprudential parameter attains the threshold value, although the conflict between the two objectives persists with respect to monetary policy as in Gali (Am Econ Rev 104(3):721-752, 2014). Empirical verification of the provisioning cost channel through structural vector autoregression confirm that a positive provisions shock can contract asset bubbles by restricting credit, output and a delayed marginal response of interest rate spreads.","[Manna, Indrani] Reserve Bank India, Dept Econ & Policy Res, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",Reserve Bank of India,"Manna, I (通讯作者)，Reserve Bank India, Dept Econ & Policy Res, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.",mannaindrani@yahoo.co.in,,,,,,,64,3,3,1,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

The author studies a situation in which two goods jointly generate an externality but only one of them is regulated. The two instruments differ because of the presence of uncertainty regarding the private value of the two goods. To ignore the unregulated good and apply Weitzman's classical result on the comparison of the slopes of marginal benefit and cost could be misleading because of the randomness of the unregulated good's quantity. Beside the relative slope of the marginal damage, the substitutability and the distribution of shocks play a role in the comparison. If there is a cocktail effect and the regulated and unregulated goods' quantities are negatively correlated, which occurs if they are substitutes, this reinforces the appeal of a price instrument. Furthermore, if the two goods are weak substitutes with correlated demands, the variance of the quantity of the unregulated good is larger under a quota than a tax, which further reinforces the appeal of the tax instrument.","[Meunier, Guy] INRA, Ivry, France; [Meunier, Guy] Ecole Polytech, Ivry, France",INRAE,"Meunier, G (通讯作者)，Ecole Polytech, Ivry, France.;Meunier, G (通讯作者)，INRA, UR1303ALISS, Ivry, France.",guy.meunier@ivry.inra.fr,"Meunier, Guy/E-8948-2018","Meunier, Guy/0000-0002-9052-921X",Business Sustainability Initiative at Europlace Institute of Finance; Ecole Polytechnique chair EDF-Sustainable Development,Business Sustainability Initiative at Europlace Institute of Finance; Ecole Polytechnique chair EDF-Sustainable Development,Financial support from the Ecole Polytechnique chair EDF-Sustainable Development and the Business Sustainability Initiative at Europlace Institute of Finance is gratefully acknowledged.,,40,3,3,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

The model decomposes the volatility series into short- and long-run components, thereby enabling us to test whether the macroeconomic variables can determine the long-run variance. We find that there exists a long-run volatility component in the commodity futures, and most of the tested low-frequency macroeconomic variables are positively related to the long-run variance of commodity futures.

In particular, a rise in directors' busyness by one standard deviation results in an improvement in Tobin's q by 6.41 %. Directors with multiple board seats appear to help firms navigate the crisis more successfully, supporting the notion that multiple board seats signal higher quality. Outside the crisis period, however, we find that busy directors reduce firm value, consistent with many prior studies. Our results are crucial as they show that governance mechanisms function differently during stressful times than they do during normal times.

From the official statistics' point of view, households choose between spending, which generates additional income and consumption in the economy, and setting money aside, which does not. Formally, households may not (if the authors disregard housing investment) choose to save, because the aggregate saving statistical indicator is a residual concept defined as the ensuing difference between aggregate disposable income and consumption. It measures the change in net worth, which, in a closed economy, may only be generated by the production of capital goods and an increase in inventories. Using an agent-based model, the authors show that shocks unrelated to structural changes in households' behavior may generate positively correlated fluctuations in the aggregate saving rate, productivity growth and lending.

The potential emission and energy savings due to EEI may however not fully materialize due to the rebound effect.

We use a detailed firm-level panel data set for 2000-2008 and apply Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) for measuring the rebound effect. We find that neither fuel nor electricity rebound effects fully offset the potential energy and emission savings.

Simultaneously, the rate of nonemployment for working age men has nearly tripled over the last 50 years, generating a social problem that is disproportionately centered in the eastern parts of the American heartland. Should more permanent economic divisions across space lead U.S. economists to rethink their traditional skepticism about place-based policies ? We document that increases in labor demand appear to have greater effects on employment in areas where not work- ing has been historically high, suggesting that subsidizing employment in such places could reduce the rate of not working. Proemployment policies, such as a ramped-up Earned Income Tax Credit, that are targeted toward regions with more elastic employment responses, however financed, could plausibly reduce suffering and materially improve economic performance.","[Austin, Benjamin; Glaeser, Edward; Summers, Lawrence] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Austin, B (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,132,85,97,1,6,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

If the 2019 provisions of the law are made permanent, these numbers are 4.8 percent for long-run corporate productivity, 1.2 percent for GDP after 10 years, and 0.13 percentage point for the increase in the growth rate. We perform a sensitivity analysis, and conclude that if interest rates rose as a result of fiscal crowding out, the 10th-year GDP increases would be 0.2 percent and 1.0 percent for the two scenarios, respectively. We assess the short-run impact of the 2.3 percentage point reduction in average marginal tax rates for individuals under the law.

We propose an analytical framework that encompasses several models of search for differentiated products, with a high-quality firm being more likely to offer a product that meets each consumer's need. An intermediary improves consumer search efficiency by providing a search platform on which positions are sold to high-quality firms through competitive bidding. While the intermediary may admit too many or too few firms to its platform, compared to what would maximize consumer surplus or total welfare, its presence can nevertheless benefit consumers and improve welfare. However, the intermediary may reduce search efficiency when firms are differentiated only horizontally, when they sell experience or credence goods, or when the intermediary is biased (possibly due to vertical integration).

The predator is the part of the financial sector that issues credit money for non-output transactions. It increases the indebtedness ratio and inflates bubbles that eventually have a negative impact on the real rate of growth (the prey). From this basis, we build a couple of models that may lead to self-contained or explosive cycles. Even in the first case, there is a risk of a financial collapse when certain variables move far away from their longterm equilibrium positions. In order to tame the cycle and avoid extreme positions, governments should ban the expansion of credit money for the purchase of assets and introduce permanent checks to risky credit.","[Dejuan, Oscar] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Albacete, Spain; [Dejuan-Bitria, Daniel] London Sch Econ, London, England",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Dejuán, O (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Albacete, Spain.",oscar.dejuan@uclm.es,"Dejuan, Oscar/E-9203-2017","Dejuan, Oscar/0000-0002-9319-6609",European Fund for Regional Development; Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha [PPII-2014-006-P],European Fund for Regional Development(European Union (EU)); Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha(Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha),Richard Werner (Southampton Management School) made useful comments on a first draft of this paper.

Advertisements on a broadcasting channel induce nuisance costs on viewers. Advertising patterns also determine the degree of competition among producers by controlling the extent consumers are informed of rival products in an industry. In equilibrium, some advertisements have the role of intensifying competition among producers, and create an additional information surplus for consumers. The model emphasizes the role of information diffusion technologies among consumers, which influence the organization of advertising on competing broadcasters. We characterize all equilibria of the model, as well as the socially optimum level and allocation of advertising on media. Surprisingly, in equilibria with informative advertisements, consumers surplus is lower compared to the case in which no advertisement is informative. This is because the information benefits of advertising allow broadcasters to air too many advertisements in equilibrium. Hence, consumers are worse off precisely when they are in a position to benefit from the informational advantages of advertising. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Exploiting a geographically staggered expansion of cable television after the liberalization of Norwegian broadcasting in 1981, we show that higher cable television penetration significantly reduced turnout in municipal elections. Using individual-level data, we find that cable television coverage had a negative effect on the extent to which respondents were exposed to political information through mass media. The effect is more pronounced for individuals that on average watch more cable television; namely individuals with fewer years of schooling. Consistent with an increased difference in political participation and exposure to information between more and less educated groups, we find that commercial television led to reduced public spending and increased the share spent on education. The results are evidence that commercial mass media can influence electoral politics by reducing political participation and exposure to information of its target audiences.","[Ellingsen, Sebastian] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Business, Barcelona, Spain; [Hernaes, Oystein] Ragnar Frisch Ctr Econ Res, Gaustadalleen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway",Pompeu Fabra University,"Ellingsen, S (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Business, Barcelona, Spain.",sebastian.ellingsen@upf.edu,,,"Institute for Social Research (ISF), Department of Political Science, University of Oslo; Ministry of Regional Development and Local Government","Institute for Social Research (ISF), Department of Political Science, University of Oslo; Ministry of Regional Development and Local Government","Some of the data applied in the analysis in this publication are based on Local Election Survey 1995-2007, financed by Institute for Social Research (ISF), Department of Political Science, University of Oslo and the Ministry of Regional Development and Local Government, and Media Use Survey 1991-2004.

For this purpose, we employ a detailed panel of monthly gasoline consumption data from 160 distribution hubs during the period 2005-2014. We apply two different approaches which are diff-in-diff and panel data estimations. The results suggest that the foreign-to-home gasoline price ratios have a significant impact on the time-varying elasticity of demand. This finding supports the hypothesis that an increase in domestic gasoline prices will significantly reduce the demand for smuggling. In addition, as the distance of a region from its closest higher price neighboring country diminishes, the price elasticity of demand for gasoline smuggling for that region declines as well. Finally, we find that when the ratio of foreign to domestic prices is higher, the gasoline demand sensitivities to price in neighboring countries go up.

We structurally estimate search costs distributions for two different baskets of goods using price data while accounting for vertical product differentiation. The analysis suggests that the extent of search is low. According to our estimates more than two thirds of consumers do not compare prices among supermarkets. We also find that more frequently purchased products have lower search cost and also lower price-cost margins.","[Gonzalez, Xulia; Miles-Touya, Daniel] Fac Econ, Campus Lagoas Marcosende, Vigo 36210, Spain",Universidade de Vigo,"González, X (通讯作者)，Fac Econ, Campus Lagoas Marcosende, Vigo 36210, Spain.",xgzlez@uvigo.es; dmiles@uvigo.es,"Touya, Daniel Miles/R-9665-2018; Gonzalez, Xulia/K-3261-2014","Touya, Daniel Miles/0000-0003-3968-8298; Gonzalez, Xulia/0000-0002-8142-2285",Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad; FEDER [ECO2015-69334-R],Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government),"We thank J.

We find that, due to the costs and benefits associated with different rating levels, credit ratings are a major consideration for corporate cash management. Specifically, firms that become relatively sensitive to rating changes increase their cash holdings, either to improve the chances of an upgrade, or to avoid a downgrade. Furthermore, this effect is driven by chaebol business groups that increasingly rely on external financing that depends on credit ratings following the attenuation of their internal capital markets. Finally, we show that the impact of credit ratings on firms' cash holdings is more noticeable when firms are more prominent in the market. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

To overcome selection in course taking, we exploit the timing of TA assignments, which occur after students enroll in a course, and use within class and within student variation in TA-student race composition. Focusing on an Asian vs. non-Asian split, results show a positive and significant increase in course grades when students are assigned TAs of a similar race/ethnicity. These effects are largest in classes where TAs were given advanced copies of exams and when exams were not multiple choice. We find positive racial correlations between students and TAs at office hours and discussion sections, suggesting student attendance responds to TA race. We also find some evidence of persistent effects: Racial match improves subsequent student performance in sequenced courses, and positively influences decisions on majoring and future course enrollment for Freshmen and Sophomores. Overall, our evidence is consistent with TA-student match quality gains and role model effects.","[Lusher, Lester] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Campbell, Doug] New Econ Sch, Moscow, Russia; [Carrell, Scott] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Carrell, Scott] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; New Economic School; University of California System; University of California Davis; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Carrell, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, One Sheilds Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",secarrell@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,38,25,36,1,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0047-2727,,,J PUBLIC ECON,J.

In this procedure a decision-maker first divides the set of available alternatives into some groups and in each group she chooses the best element (winner) for her preference relation. Then, among the winners in the first round, she selects the best one as her final choice. We characterize grouping choice methods in three different ways. First, we show that a choice function is a grouping choice method if and only if it is a rational shortlist method (Manzini and Mariotti ) in which the first rationale is transitive. Second, grouping choice methods are axiomatically characterized by means of a new axiom called elimination, in addition to two well-known axioms, expansion and weak WARP (Manzini and Mariotti ). Third, grouping choice methods are also characterized by a weak version of path independence.","[Matsuki, Jun] Konica Minolta Japan, Tokyo, Japan; [Tadenuma, Koichi] Hitotsubashi Univ, Tokyo, Japan",Konica Minolta Inc.; Hitotsubashi University,"Tadenuma, K (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Tokyo, Japan.",koichi.tadenuma@r.hit-u.ac.jp,,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan [24330062]","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT))","We are grateful to Sean Horan for his detailed comments, which improved a part of the proof of the main results in this paper.

Some of that criticism is warranted; but, in our view, much is not. This paper contributes to the debate over the adequacy of benchmark DSGE models by showing how three extensions, which are features that have characterized the global economy since the early 2000s, are necessary to improve our understanding of global shocks and policy insights. The three extensions are to acknowledge and model the entire global economy and the linkage through trade and capital flows; to allow for a wider range of relative price variability by moving to multiple-sector models rather than a single good model; and to allow for changes in risk perceptions which propagate through financial markets and adjustments in the real economy. These extensions add some complexity to large-scale macro-models, but without them policy models can oversimplify things, allowing misinterpretations of shocks and therefore costly policy mistakes to occur. Using over-simplified models to explain a complex world makes it more likely there will be 'puzzles'. The usefulness of these extensions is demonstrated in two ways: first, by briefly revisiting some historical shocks to show how outcomes can be interpreted that make sense within a more complex DSGE framework; then, by making a contemporary assessment of the implications from the proposed large fiscal stimulus and the bans on immigration by the Trump administration which have both sectoral and macroeconomic implications that interact.","[McKibbin, Warwick J.; Stoeckel, Andrew] Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Appl Macroecon Anal, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [McKibbin, Warwick J.] Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Australian National University; Brookings Institution,"McKibbin, WJ (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Appl Macroecon Anal, Canberra, ACT, Australia.;McKibbin, WJ (通讯作者)，Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",warwick.mckibbin@anu.edu.au; abstoeckel@gmail.com,"McKibbin, Warwick J/A-4919-2008","McKibbin, Warwick J/0000-0002-1604-1021",,,,,24,11,11,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Menger's Aristotelian realism (or classical realism) ran against the nominalist trend of his own and subsequent time, but it may have a more sympathetic hearing now, with remarkable parallels between Aristotelian essentialism and the thesis of theory-laden facts, associated with Rorty, Feyerabend and others. The most important aspect of his Aristotelian realism was his belief that economic theory had to be abstracted from the phenomena by a rational grasp of economic phenomenal forms, Menger explicitly stating that he was not dealing with deductions from a priori axioms. Instead, he was eager to promote what he called exact science. The pursuit of exact science is simply a certain way of treating any subject matter whatever it may be, a certain direction of cognitive endeavour. An exact law provides a theoretical understanding of only one aspect of actual phenomena and neither can be nor need be verified by full empirical actuality. One can still find significance in our time in Menger's ideas on how to do economics.","[Mittermaier, Karl] Univ Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Mittermaier, K (通讯作者)，Care of Stettler M, Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, ZA-2001 Johannesburg, South Africa.",,,,,,,,30,5,5,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

A number of studies have suggested both positive and negative impacts on financial stability, but very few empirical studies have been made. This study focuses on the implications of greater financial inclusion for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) for financial stability. It estimates the effects of measures of the share of bank lending to SMEs on two measures of financial stability - bank nonperforming loans and bank Z scores. We find some evidence that an increased share of lending to SMEs aids financial stability by reducing non-performing loans (NPLs) and the probability of default by financial institutions.","[Morgan, Peter J.] ADBI, Chiyoda Ku, Kasumigaseki Bldg 8F,3-2-5 Kasumigaseki, Tokyo 1006008, Japan; [Pontines, Victor] South Asian Cent Banks SEACEN, Res & Training Ctr 80416 M, Sasana Kijang Bank Negara Malaysia, Level 5,2 Jalan Dato Onn, Kuala Lumpur 50480, Malaysia",,"Pontines, V (通讯作者)，South Asian Cent Banks SEACEN, Res & Training Ctr 80416 M, Sasana Kijang Bank Negara Malaysia, Level 5,2 Jalan Dato Onn, Kuala Lumpur 50480, Malaysia.",pmorgan@adbi.org; vpontines@seacen.org,,"Pontines, Victor/0000-0002-1709-5523",,,,,23,31,33,4,71,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Knowing whether or not OECD economies optimize their resources in production is, therefore, an important policy issue. The purpose of this paper was to make cross-country comparisons of production efficiency, and its determinants, using mainly a parametric approach. Our proposed model was a stochastic frontier version of Battese and Coelli's (1995) which includes both a stochastic error term and a term that can be characterized as inefficiency. The non-negative technical inefficiency effects are assumed to be a function of explanatory variables. The empirical analysis of macroeconomic performance done in this paper confirmed that OECD countries with a greater sophistication of their production processes and a higher capacity for innovation tend to be less inefficient Alternative non-parametric methods for evaluating the impact of process/contextual variables on efficiency also corroborated that business sophistication and innovation contribute to efficiency improvements across OECD countries.

(2015). The model is estimated using quarterly data over the period 1970Q1-2015Q4. The results indicate that the relationship is quantile-dependent, which may reveal misleading results in studies using traditional analyses that address the averages. The Wald test confirms our findings by rejecting the null hypothesis of parameter constancy for both the Netherlands and Ireland. The changes in energy consumption are more responsive to past levels and past changes in globalization than the adjustment provided by the error-correction method (ECM). Interestingly, the findings indicate that globalization is positively correlated with energy consumption in the long-term for the two countries. Furthermore, globalization shares a robust long-term relationship with energy consumption. Energy consumption is strongly related to globalization in the long-term. However, the short-term effects of globalization on energy demand are limited for those countries. Important policy implications are then suggested based on the empirical results.

The sustainability of the natural resources that are used as energy sources and in the production of goods is a global issue that is not specific to developing nations. We contribute to the need for quantitative targets for natural resources by calculating the shadow prices and production inefficiency levels of 32 mineral resources by using a stochastic frontier analysis and panel data from 1980 to 2010 in 162 countries. In addition, we provide estimated shadow prices and production inefficiency levels up to 2020 with various levels of production restrictions. The results show the following: (1) The shadow prices and production inefficiency levels of major metals are generally higher in Asian countries than in non-Asian countries; (2) there is an upward trend in the inefficiency levels in Asian countries, whereas the inefficiency levels remain rather stable in non-Asian countries; (3) production restrictions do not guarantee an increase in shadow prices, but the magnitude of the impact of such restrictions seems to be larger in Asian countries compared to non-Asian countries; (4) production restrictions do not seem to affect production inefficiency; thus, they may not be effective in reducing gaps in production inefficiency between Asian and non-Asian countries.

A fleet of 89 BEVs were deployed in a test-bed that was concluded in 2013. The paper conducts a cost-effectiveness analysis and financial analysis of the Renault Fluence ZE and its comparable gasoline model to assess the economics of BEVs. It concludes that BEV adoption in Singapore is both undesirable (due to higher social costs) and unlikely (due to higher private costs) in the immediate and near future. Where 94% of the population live in high-rise apartments, there will be a heavy reliance on costlier communal charging stations, thereby mitigating the operating savings that BEVs could have offered if home chargers were used. Lifetime costs are not as sensitive to changes in oil prices as expected. For the BEV to be socially viable, the breakeven carbon price amounts to S$9,700 per tonne of CO2, which suggests that BEVs are not a cost-effective means of reducing carbon emissions in Singapore, or battery prices would need to be halved. Nevertheless, the study demonstrates that exempting the BEV batteries from taxation could support BEV adoption if that were to be a government objective.","[Yuen, Kah-Hung] Natl Univ Singapore, Energy Studies Inst, 29 Heng Mui Keng Terrace,Block A 10-01, Singapore 119620, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Yuen, KH (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Energy Studies Inst, 29 Heng Mui Keng Terrace,Block A 10-01, Singapore 119620, Singapore.",oliveryuen87@gmail.com,,,,,,,26,1,1,3,18,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

A local leader makes policies primarily to secure his political survival, which is contingent on the support from either his higher-level patrons or his local grassroots constituents. Using a simple model, we show that a local politician with close factional ties to high-level patrons will invest more in sending loyalty signals to the latter to receive their protections, while a poorly-connected politician will make more effort to spur a broad-based economic growth that economically benefits his local constituents. Using a unique county level data on the factional politics of Zhejiang Province, China, we find that counties with weaker (closer) factional ties have lower (higher) tax burdens per capita, while spending more (less) on local public goods provision. The results are stable after various robustness tests.","[Li, Daniel Z.] Univ Durham, Business Sch, Dept Econ & Finance, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England; [Zhang, Qi] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, China Ctr Econ Studies, 600 Guoquan Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Durham University; Fudan University,"Zhang, Q (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, China Ctr Econ Studies, 600 Guoquan Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",daniel.li@durham.ac.uk; zhangqifd@fudan.edu.cn,"Li, Daniel Z./W-1994-2018",,Natural Science Foundation of China [71773019],Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),We thank the Editor and two anonymous reviewers for providing numerous insightful suggestions for improvements along the road to publication.

Globalization has also, though not unanimously, been found to affect growth outcomes. Bridging the gap between the two strands of the literature, this paper investigates the existence and strength of the interaction between institutional quality and globalization on real economic growth using a panel dataset covering 82 countries and spanning 25 years (1986-2010). Dimensionality reduction techniques are employed to identify key components of 'institutional quality': the rule of law, civil liberties and political rights. The empirical results reveal that while 'institutional quality' robustly and positively affects growth, the direct effect of economic globalization is not significant and the interaction effects, perhaps as a consequence, are muted over the review period. Direct and interaction effects of institutional quality and economic globalization on growth are, however, observed for the sub-sample of developing countries.","[Mullings, Robert] Nottingham Trent Univ, Nottingham Business Sch, Nottingham, England",University of Nottingham; Nottingham Trent University,"Mullings, R (通讯作者)，Nottingham Trent Univ, Nottingham Business Sch, Nottingham, England.",robert.mullings@ntu.ac.uk,"Mullings, Robert/GYV-1181-2022","Mullings, Robert/0000-0002-5569-9117",,,,,45,14,15,1,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

On a sample of 258 EU banks during the 2007-2014 period, we apply System Generalized Method of Moments. First, we argue that the banks facing higher competition tend to expand more aggressively into non-traditional activities, and therefore they report a higher share of fee income in total income. Second, we found that a higher equity to assets ratio is related with higher shares of fee income since the bank needs more capital to prevent or manage the potential risks of the non-traditional activities. Finally, a high deposits to assets ratio tends to increase the fee income share, which may be possibly attributed to relatively high switching costs and to close depositor-bank relationship in the EU banks.","[Vozkova, Karolina] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic; [Teply, Petr] Univ Econ, Fac Finance & Accounting, Prague, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Vozková, K (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic.",vozkova.karol@gmail.com; petr.teply@vse.cz,"Teply, Petr/E-9785-2018",,"GACR [GA15-00036S]; GAUK [105815, 488317]; VSE [VSE IP100040]",GACR(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); GAUK; VSE,"Financial support from GACR (Project No. GA15-00036S), GAUK (Projects No. 105815 and No. 488317) and VSE (Project No. VSE IP100040) is gratefully acknowledged.",,33,9,9,0,5,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

This context allows us to test both the reputation of the first half winner and the league standing effect on demand. Examination of game-level data from the 2010 Southern League reveals fans are unaffected by measures of both team quality and league standing in the second half of the season. On the other hand, the first half winners saw an 11% increase in attendance as a percent of stadium capacity, suggesting that in the second half of the season winners matter more than winning.","[Agha, Nola] Univ San Francisco, Sport Management, San Francisco, CA 94117 USA; [Rhoads, Thomas] Towson Univ, Dept Econ, Towson, MD 21252 USA",University of San Francisco; University System of Maryland; Towson University,"Rhoads, T (通讯作者)，Towson Univ, Dept Econ, Towson, MD 21252 USA.",trhoads@towson.edu,"Agha, Nola/H-3418-2013","Agha, Nola/0000-0002-9277-7559",,,,,40,7,7,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

A deeper investigation shows that owning bank subsidiaries outside the home country is a source of increased fragility during normal times, yet a source of higher stability during the local crisis but not during the international crisis. Moreover, owning foreign subsidiaries in one or two world regions is insufficient to neutralize both types of crises, while being present in three or more regions is more stabilizing during a local crisis but also more destabilizing during an international crisis.

The analysis covered the period 2003-2013. Smart growth was described by using three pillars: smart specialization, creativity and innovation, whereas social cohesion was defined from the perspective of the most important problems grouped in five categories: income, young people in the labour market, unemployment, gender equality and demography. Panel (LSDV) and cross-section models were used for the assessment of relations between smart growth and social cohesion. LSDV models allow for including in the model, specific for a given region, the factors derived from location, resources, economic, cultural and political determinants, as well as other aspects which are unobservable and not included in the model. One-year models allow for identifying cross-section relations. The obtained results emphasize the significance of growth factors, related to human capital, for social cohesion. Regional creativity, manifested by the skills and education of the workforce presented the highest consistency with social cohesion improvement (especially in terms of unemployment including youth unemployment and income categories). The relations with smart specialization, defined as human resources and human capital in high and medium high-technology manufacturing and knowledge-intensive services, were also recognized as significant. The least significant relationships were identified for regional innovation, estimated based on expenditure on research and development in the business sector.","[Bal-Domanska, Beata] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Reg Econ, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Bal-Domanska, B (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Reg Econ, Wroclaw, Poland.",,"Bal-Domańska, Beata M./B-3193-2012","Bal-Domańska, Beata M./0000-0003-0395-4259",NCN [2011/01/13/HS4/04743],NCN,The first version of the study was conducted within the framework of the research grant NCN No. 2011/01/13/HS4/04743 entitled: European regional space classification in the perspective of smart growth concept a dynamic approach.,,37,0,1,1,17,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,2720-5088,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

The strategic interaction is particularly favoured by the fact that prices are easily observable online by all competitors. The analysis focuses on selected Italian city-pair markets that differ from one another with respect to the degree of inter-and intra-modal competition and to the characteristics of the transport services provided. We exploit this heterogeneity to study transport operators' strategic interactions in different competitive environments. We find evidence of the existence of price leadership, even though results differ across city-pair markets. In particular, it emerges that the incumbent operator, in either the air or the rail sector, always holds the role of leader.","[Bergantino, Angela S.] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dept Econ Management & Business Law, Bari, Italy; [Capozza, Claudia] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Ionian Dept Law Econ & Environm, Bari, Italy; [Capurso, Mauro] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro; Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro; University of Leeds,"Bergantino, AS (通讯作者)，Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dept Econ Management & Business Law, Bari, Italy.",as.bergantino@gmail.com,,"Capurso, Mauro/0000-0001-7599-4431; BERGANTINO, Angela Stefania/0000-0001-9490-9917",,,,,59,7,7,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The CMS model is able to quantify the export performance of the food industry compared to the rest of the world and individual foreign markets (the EU 27, new member states). The analysis revealed rather disappointing results in terms of the competitive position of the Croatian food industry in the period after 2010. The CMS was able to decompose change in the market share based on the geographic and product component and competitiveness effect, and the results confirmed the hypothesis that the loss in competitiveness of the Croatian food industry is the most important factor which determined the decreasing share of Croatian companies in world trade. The impact of the product mix of exported food products was neutral while its geographical effect was also negative. A regional reorientation of exports to more dynamic markets is an option which could boost the exports of the Croatian food industry.","[Buturac, Goran; Lovrincevic, Zeljko; Mikulic, Davor] Inst Econ, Dept Econ Growth, Zagreb, Croatia",Institute of Economics Zagreb (EIZ); University of Zagreb,"Buturac, G (通讯作者)，Inst Econ, Dept Econ Growth, Zagreb, Croatia.",,"Mikulić, Davor/AAA-2279-2020; Buturac, Goran/Y-6211-2019","Mikulić, Davor/0000-0002-9847-6116; Buturac, Goran/0000-0002-0903-4587",,,,,32,7,7,4,20,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

We develop an asymmetric information model and use the tools of contract theory in order to understand (1) how the level of industry protection is endogenously determined, and (2) why some industries decide to engage in large lobbying costs to become politically active. Our model offers plausible explanations to phenomena such as the loser's paradox, where weak industries receive the most protection although strong industries are the ones that spend more resources on lobbying activities.

We use the model based on the monetary policy rule as a theoretical framework that explains the relations between the exchange rate and price level, risk premium, output gap, and expected inflation. It allows for endogeneity of the monetary policy - the issue ignored in the widely used monetary model. The sample covers the period January 2000 - December 2014, so the data are not plagued by high-inflation differentials characteristic for the early transition period and include countries with relatively flexible exchange rates. Our empirical strategy employs the panel error correction model that allows for cross-sectional dependence and a series of panel causality tests. The main finding is that the nominal exchange rates in CEE countries are not disconnected from macrofundamentals implied by the Taylor rule-based model. More specifically, we find that there is a strong cross-sectional dependence among CEE countries, exchange rates Granger-cause macrofundamentals and tend to revert to the long-run relation, and that the results are robust to the 'extraordinary circumstances' argument, i.e. do not rest on the dynamics during the global financial crisis.","[Dabrowski, Marek A.] Cracow Univ Econ, Fac Econ & Int Relat, Dept Macroecon, Krakow, Poland; [Papiez, Monika; Smiech, Slawomir] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Stat, Fac Management, Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics; Cracow University of Economics,"Dabrowski, MA (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Fac Econ & Int Relat, Dept Macroecon, Krakow, Poland.",marek.dabrowski@uek.krakow.pl,"Papież, Monika/I-3257-2018; Dąbrowski, Marek A./V-2257-2018; Smiech, Slawomir/I-3253-2018","Papież, Monika/0000-0003-3597-2080; Smiech, Slawomir/0000-0002-6704-8661; Dabrowski, Marek A./0000-0003-3079-1811","Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education; Cracow University of Economics [062/WE-KMA/01/2017/S/7062, 044/WZ-KS/03/2016/S/ 6044]; National Science Centre in Poland [DEC-2013/11/B/ HS4/00489]","Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education(Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Poland); Cracow University of Economics; National Science Centre in Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","This work was supported by the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education and Cracow University of Economics [062/WE-KMA/01/2017/S/7062, 044/WZ-KS/03/2016/S/ 6044].

Half of all firms (of those with some non-zero debt and at least one employee) are found to face an unsustainable debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio beyond 4, accounting for almost 80% of total outstanding debt. Moreover, a good quarter of all firms experience debt-to-EBITDA ratios exceeding 10 and hold almost half of total aggregate net debt. We then examine how this financial distress affects firm performance in terms of productivity, employment, exports, investment and survival. We find that, while less important during the good times (pre-recession period), lack of firms' financial soundness during the period of financial distress becomes a critical factor constraining firm performance. The extent of financial leverage and ability to service the outstanding debt are shown to inhibit firms' productivity growth as well as the dynamics of exports, employment and investment. Micro and small firms are found to suffer relatively more than larger firms from high leverage in terms of export and employment performance during the recession period.","[Damijan, Joze P.] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Damijan, Joze P.] Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Damijan, Joze P.] Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium",University of Ljubljana; University of Ljubljana; KU Leuven,"Damijan, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia.;Damijan, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.;Damijan, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.",joze.damijan@ef.uni-lj.si,,"Damijan, Joze/0000-0001-9150-1174",European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) [C28070/EBSF-2013-12-225],European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD),"The study was financed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Contract no.

Due to the limited and transportable characterizes of natural gas, sharing pipelines for natural gas with other nations can either bring peace and stability or create chaos. To avoid insoluble strategies, it is wry explicit to decide scientifically for these kinds of global issues. To do so, a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) - ANP (Analytic Network Process) integrated approach is presented to evaluate natural gas policies for Turkey in terms of East Mediterranean Region. In the first step, the appropriate strategies, SO (strengths-opportunities), ST (strengths-threats), WO (weaknesses-opportunities) and WT (weaknesses-threats) are determined via SWOT analysis including four criteria, 20 sub-criteria and seven strategies. Due to inability of SWOT analysis to prioritize the criteria and rank the strategies, ANP approach which also considers the dependency between criteria is applied in the second step. Finally, the proposed SWOT-ANP approach is compared with other multi criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques to represent the effectiveness and applicability of the model.","[Genc, Tolga] Near East Univ, Ataturk Fac Educ, CY-99138 Nicosia, Cyprus; [Kabak, Mehmet] Gazi Univ, Dept Ind Engn, TR-06570 Ankara, Turkey; [Ozceylan, Eren] Gaziantep Univ, Dept Ind Engn, TR-27310 Gaziantep, Turkey; [Cetinkaya, Cihan] Adana Sci & Technol Univ, Dept Management Informat Syst, TR-01250 Adana, Turkey",Near East University; Gazi University; Gaziantep University; Adana Alparslan Turkes Science & Technology University,"Çetinkaya, C (通讯作者)，Adana Sci & Technol Univ, Dept Management Informat Syst, TR-01250 Adana, Turkey.",cihancetinkaya@gantep.edu.tr,"Çetinkaya, Cihan/JXM-1867-2024; Özceylan, Eren/AAG-4840-2019; Kabak, Mehmet/ABI-8118-2020","Çetinkaya, Cihan/0000-0002-5899-8438; Özceylan, Eren/0000-0002-5213-6335; Kabak, Mehmet/0000-0002-8576-5349; genc, tolga/0000-0002-6134-5964",BAGEP Award of the Science Academy in Turkey,BAGEP Award of the Science Academy in Turkey,The authors express sincere appreciation to the editor and anonymous reviewers for their efforts to improve the quality of this paper.

We use public data to analyze how veterans' utilization of health care services varies with these factors. We also analyze how the reliance on VA services varies when alternative sources of health insurance are available to veterans. Based on the estimated relationships, we use a micro-simulation model to forecast future health care utilization, both inside and outside of VA.","[Ghosh, Projesh P.; Negrusa, Sebastian; Warner, John T.] Lewin Grp, Falls Church, VA 22042 USA; [Warner, John T.] Clemson Univ, Dept Econ, Clemson, SC USA",Optum; Lewin Group; Clemson University,"Ghosh, PP (通讯作者)，Lewin Grp, Falls Church, VA 22042 USA.",projesh.ghosh@lewin.com,"Negrusa, Sebastian/X-4108-2019",,"Office of the Actuary, within the Department of Veterans Affairs","Office of the Actuary, within the Department of Veterans Affairs","The authors acknowledge the support provided by the Office of the Actuary, within the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Following a standard empirical growth model, a dynamic panel regression model is estimated using time-series data from 1995 until 2012 for a cross section of seven countries. The interaction of international tourism and various established sustainability indicators is employed allowing ecotourism to be consistently quantified across countries, while numerous country-specific structural characteristics are controlled for. The estimation results show that international ecotourism has a statistically significant positive effect on both traditional economic development (real GDP per capita) and comprehensive economic development (adjusted net savings; ANS per capita), which is a measure of a society's potential future well-being, thus providing evidence in support of the tourism-led growth hypothesis and pointing towards an important role for ecotourism in driving comprehensive economic convergence.","[Gunter, Ulrich] MODUL Univ Vienna, Dept Tourism & Serv Management, Kahlenberg 1, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Ceddia, M.

Our sample consists of male factory workers in a manufacturing facility in a Muslim country. In our between-subjects' design, each worker is asked to allocate an amount of money between himself and a stranger. Specifically, we examine behavior of observants and nonobservants before and after the daily break of the Ramadan fast. We also examine behavior outside of Ramadan, where we treat alimentary abstention as akin to a long fasting period. We hypothesize and confirm that outside Ramadan, decision makers who abstain from any alimentary intake transfer less money to recipients relative to decision makers who do not abstain. Strikingly, this effect is reversed during the month of Ramadan. Specifically, observant workers who are in the midst of their Ramadan fast are far more generous to recipients than workers who have had their evening meal. Interestingly, observant and nonobservant workers after the daily break of the Ramadan fast and workers outside Ramadan that consumed aliments make statistically similar transfers. Our findings suggest that it is the interaction between alimentary abstention and religious observance that amplifies prosocial behavior during Ramadan, where fasting is part of the ritual.","[Haruvy, Ernan E.] Univ Texas Dallas, Mkt Program, Jindal Sch Management, Richardson, TX 75083 USA; [Ioannou, Christos A.] Univ Southampton, Dept Econ, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Golshirazi, Farnoush] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas; University of Southampton; University of Oxford,"Haruvy, EE (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Dallas, Mkt Program, Jindal Sch Management, Richardson, TX 75083 USA.",eharuvy@utdallas.edu; christos.a.ioannou@gmail.com; farnoush.golshirazi@univ.ox.ac.uk,"Haruvy, Ernan/AAH-3467-2022; Haruvy, Ernan/AFM-0896-2022; Ioannou, Christos/AAN-8975-2020","Ioannou, Christos/0000-0001-7928-9158; Haruvy, Ernan/0000-0001-8077-1363",Strategic Research Development Fund of the University of Southampton; University of Texas at Dallas,Strategic Research Development Fund of the University of Southampton; University of Texas at Dallas,"The paper has benefited greatly from the comments of Shai Danziger, Raymond O'Brien, Alexis Antoniades, Manos Mentzakis, Carmine Ornaghi, Miltos Makris, Abbas Zabihzadeh, Mohammad Reza Abedi, Jean-Yves Pitarakis, Hamid Taher Neshat Doost, and Mohammad Ali Mazaheri.

The analysis is conducted through Beveridge-Nelson trend decomposition within a cointegrated vector autoregressive model based on the New Keynesian framework. We suggest an augmented test of the conventional co-integration test on the nonstationarity of the real interest rate, which checks whether the co-integration coefficient of inflation is one and the output gap affects the co-integration equilibrium of the nominal interest rate. We further suggest decomposing the long-run expectation of the non-stationary real interest rate into three trends: the interest rate shock (including the monetary shock), inflation shock and output gap shock. According to empirical analyses using monthly US data after the Korean War, the long-run expectation of the non-stationary real interest rate contains an interest rate shock trend and the impulse of the federal fund target rate induces a significant response of the interest rate shock trend. However, the interest rate shock trend has a very small portion of the long-run expectation of the non-stationary real interest rate, which may explain why the monetary policy was not particularly effective in the economic recovery after the global financial crisis.","[Kim, Yun-Yeong] Dankook Univ, Dept Int Trade, 126 Jukjeon Dong, Yongin 448701, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Dankook University,"Kim, YY (通讯作者)，Dankook Univ, Dept Int Trade, 126 Jukjeon Dong, Yongin 448701, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",yunyeongkim@dankook.ac.kr,,,,,,,41,1,1,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The empirical results show the first evidence that long-term interest rate comovement indeed has predictive power for future Chinese business cycle for both in-sample and out-of-sample. This result implies the growing importance of the regional factor along with the global factor.

This study evaluates the effects and performance of public cluster policy in three ways: firstly, by evaluating public cluster policy per se; secondly, whether positive effects are shaped as a consequence of the 'picking-the-winner' competition or by the subsidizing effects afterwards; and finally, whether effects of public cluster policy spill over to neighboring regions or are mainly bounded locally. Based on a unique panel dataset encompassing all German labor market regions and covering a 15-year period, we apply difference-in-difference estimations and quantile regression techniques to identify and separate the different effects. Our results confirm positive cluster effects of the chosen industries, but also show that positive externalities are spatially limited.

However, due to the imperfect transferability of skills and knowledge across countries, migration trips are also career interruptions, especially for return migrants who may meanwhile experience depreciation of home country-specific skills. This article demonstrates that migration experience increases return migrants' earnings in the home country on the condition that the migration stay is sufficiently long and mostly uninterrupted. Employing the revised human capital earnings function, the empirical study shows that only a barely interrupted US experience longer than five years, regardless of the legal status of the migration trips, predicts higher earnings of male return migrants in Mexico than comparable non-migrants. Robust findings emerge controlling for unobserved individual \]acteristics or using instrumental variables to deal with the self-selection and endogeneity.

The new human capital variable is a measure of average human capital efficiency per hour worked that considers the role of both the quantity and quality of education. Our methodology is based on the framework proposed by Jess Benhabib and Mark A. Spiegel (2005) that uses a logistic function of technology diffusion. The analysis employs panel econometrics and tackles the endogeneity bias. Empirical results show robust evidence of the significance of this human capital variable as a driver of innovation and diffusion. The effects of cognitive skills on technological progress are higher the closer the economies are to the technology frontier. Furthermore, as technological progress has been measured using the improved total factor productivity (TFP) variables built in Penn World Table (PWT) 8.0, we confirm the existence of social returns to human capital.","[Lopez-Pueyo, Carmen; Barcenilla, Sara; Gimenez, Gregorio] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Business, Zaragoza, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"López-Pueyo, C (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Business, Zaragoza, Spain.",clopez@unizar.es; sbarceni@unizar.es; gregim@unizar.es,"Gimenez, Gregorio/AAB-5838-2019","Gimenez, Gregorio/0000-0003-3702-4017; Lopez Pueyo, Maria del Carmen/0000-0001-9441-7859","European Social Fund; Government of Aragon (Spain); University of Zaragoza [269-165, 269-190]",European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)); Government of Aragon (Spain)(Gobierno de Aragon); University of Zaragoza,"This research has been supported by the European Social Fund, the Government of Aragon (Spain) and the University of Zaragoza (research projects 269-165 and 269-190).",,39,12,13,5,26,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2018,65.0,2,,,,,163,181,,10.2298/PAN151002014L,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GP3QZ,,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440769600002,0

Estimated autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bound testing approach to cointegration followed by error correction representation of the ARDL model have found that current account is caused by capital account and exchange rate, where capital account causes to produce a deficit in current account. In the dynamic adjustment of current account due to exchange rate, an evidence of J-curve phenomenon is noticed. Capital account is neither caused by current account nor by exchange rate but interest rate has a positive impact on it. Robustness of these findings is testified by the vector autoregression model, Wald test of Granger causality followed by an impulse response analysis and a variance decomposition analysis. These analyses, in addition, establish a negative impact of interest rate on current account. With the best of knowledge this is the first study that reveals the dynamics of current and capital account of Sri Lanka. Such a dynamics is critical from the policy perspective.

We propose the concept of constitutional stability to study the group structures that are going to emerge at equilibrium. This concept generalizes previous stability concepts in the literature in which the constitutional rules were exogenously given or not explicitly considered. We combine requirements on constitutions and preferences for guaranteeing both the existence and the emergence of constitutionally stable group structures.

A larger ratio of banking assets to gross domestic product and lower interest spread lead to a higher level of diversification. Moreover, national banks and regional banks have different strategic responses to the macroeconomic, and indeed, regulatory environment.

However, although the relationship between innovation and economic growth has been extensively explored, few studies have investigated the impacts of crucial dimensions of innovation on economic growth. This paper presents one of the first empirical attempts to analyze how the diversity aspect of technological progress (or innovation) influences economic performance by considering the possible bidirectional causal effects between these two factors. A series of econometric techniques, including a two-stage-least-squares instrumental variable and dynamic autoregressive distributed lag model, are applied on a dataset of 55 countries. The dataset includes patent data from the United States Patent and Trademark Office and combined macroeconomic data from the World Bank's development indicators and International Monetary Fund's economic outlook databases. The results show that generally, technological diversity does not directly affect economic growth.

By introducing a new global value chain measure of comparative advantage, we relate a sector's share in domestic final demand to that in production and separate the direct effect of trade on its income share. This method identifies the declining share of manufacturing value added in domestic final expenditures to be the main cause of de-industrialization. Differences in comparative advantage between countries do matter, especially in the case of employment shares, but have a limited impact via the direct trade effect on value added. The findings point to a peculiar paradox of industrial policy: precisely when it is successful in raising competitiveness and hence productivity growth of manufacturing, it also furthers the global decline of relative prices in manufacturing. In contrast to the national objectives of re-industrialization, effective industrial policies accelerate de-industrialization in the global economy.","[Peneder, Michael; Streicher, Gerhard] Austrian Inst Econ Res, Arsenal Obj 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria",,"Peneder, M (通讯作者)，Austrian Inst Econ Res, Arsenal Obj 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",michael.peneder@wifo.ac.at,,,,,,,61,14,16,6,51,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

Using a difference-in-differences approach, our estimates isolate the effect of the lack of credit on the labour market from that of the general decline in aggregate economic activity. We find large and negative impacts of the credit shock on total employment, particularly on temporary, unskilled and young workers. These impacts were significantly larger in countries with stronger legal protection of permanent workers from dismissal. This suggests that the differential impact of the crisis across countries was not entirely driven by the heterogeneity of the credit shock, but also by labour regulations. Given regulatory inflexibility in adjusting the permanent workforce, firms responded to tightening financial constraints by disproportionately laying off temporary workers (who tend to be younger and less skilled than permanent workers).","[Sharma, Siddharth; Winkler, Hernan] World Bank Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Sharma, S (通讯作者)，World Bank Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",ssharma1@worldbank.org; hwinkler@worldbank.org,,"Winkler, Hernan/0000-0002-2980-5676",,,,,46,8,9,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

In the model, parents use gifts (early in life) and bequests (later in life) to provide insurance against income shocks, but take into account that children would shirk if offered large transfers. We show in a simple model that parents can provide better incentives later in life by giving equal bequests.

We analysed a representative sample of the Indonesian population (13,870 men and 15,858 women) by applying censored maximum likelihood regressions. We exploited the randomized ordering of two series of delay questions (1- and 5-year delays) and estimated the causal effect of the ordering on elicited time preferences. Respondents who considered the longer-delay questions exhibited more patience, and the effects were larger for women.

With recursive preferences the marginal utility of consumption today depends on innovations in future utilities. Productivity shocks with a unit root have long-term effects and home bias implies that the effects differ across countries. A positive shock in one country therefore leads to a larger drop in marginal utility in that country. There is then a strong depreciation of the real exchange rate and resources are transferred abroad due to risk-sharing between households. This leads to a volatile real exchange rate and can imply positive cross-country correlations in both investment and employment. Innovations to future utilities imply volatile stochastic discount factors which are necessary to price financial assets. The paper therefore bridges the gap between models in international macroeconomics and finance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

I argue that, given the basic characteristics of such an economy, a financial system may be considered as a public utility and financial stability as a public good. I then maintain that the provision of the latter could not rely on private market mechanisms, such as self-regulation and price-directed incentives. As capitalism develops through more financialized forms, new institutions and regulatory rules must be designed to reframe the market's boundaries in order to consolidate systemic stability, which is a basic condition for continuous and sustainable economic relations in society. I then suggest a precautionary-principle-based macro-prudential approach to financial regulation in order to ensure a sustainable provision of finance and financial stability that is consistent with the characteristics of a money economy.","[Ulgen, Faruk] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble Fac Econ, Grenoble, France; [Ulgen, Faruk] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble Fac Econ, Dept Distance Learning Programs & Int Relat & Con, Grenoble, France",Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA),"Ülgen, F (通讯作者)，Univ Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble Fac Econ, Grenoble, France.;Ülgen, F (通讯作者)，Univ Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble Fac Econ, Dept Distance Learning Programs & Int Relat & Con, Grenoble, France.",,"Ulgen, Faruk/T-9908-2019","ULGEN, Faruk/0000-0003-2625-6293",,,,,19,2,3,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Our results indicate that a reduced capital controls on foreign direct investment (FDI) would lead to a significant increase in FDI capital in China and a significant reduction in the cost of capital in China relative to the rest of the world. Furthermore, we observe an increase in capital stocks in most regions, which benefits most regions in terms of GDP and GNP. The Chinese economy grows by 3.3% driven by a significant fall in the rental price of capital that, in turn, lowers domestic costs, causes a real depreciation of the exchange rate and thus increased exports relative to other regions. We also observe an across-the-board increase in the saving rate driven by the rise in the price of consumption relative to investment (saving) in all regions.","[Verikios, George] KPMG Econ, Ripararian Plaza,71 Eagle St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Verikios, George] Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Nathan, Qld, Australia",Griffith University,"Verikios, G (通讯作者)，KPMG Econ, Ripararian Plaza,71 Eagle St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia.;Verikios, G (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Nathan, Qld, Australia.",g.verikios@griffith.edu.au,,,United States International Trade Commission,United States International Trade Commission,This work was supported by United States International Trade Commission.,,33,0,0,3,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

According to Friedman, 'the theoretical developments initiated by Haberler but named for Pigou' provide sufficient grounds for rejecting Keynes's 'key theoretical proposition' and the economics of Keynes in its entirety. The problem with this claim is that it turns out, given the scrutiny that it clearly deserves, to be false. The 'theoretical developments initiated by Haberler but named for Pigou' do not provide sufficient grounds for rejecting Keynes's 'key theoretical proposition', and thus the economics of Keynes as a whole.

Keynes; portfolio management; speculation,EQUITY; UK; INVESTOR; MARKETS; MODEL,"In the earlier part of his portfolio management career, J. M. Keynes pursued a short-term, asset allocation-based speculative approach to portfolio management, only to abandon it in the early 1930s in favor of a long-term, security selection approach based on identifying intrinsic value. It was the earlier Keynes who endorsed E. L. Smith's 1924 U.S. monograph, Common Stocks as Long Term Investments, encouraging his insurance company contacts to conduct a similar study in the United Kingdom. This suggestion was taken up in the 1920s and 1930s by U.K. insurance actuaries, whose lead was followed post-1945 by pension fund actuaries. Among the latter, George Ross Goobey is the most well-known, his name being closely associated with the Cult of the Equity, which, with the increasing formalization of institutional portfolio management over the last two or three decades, has transmuted into the Cult of the Benchmark. Underlying this latter cult is the emphasis on asset allocation, which can be traced back to Smith's monograph. It is ironic that Keynes' enduring influence is more likely to be felt through his endorsement of Smith rather than by the adoption of the genuine investment approach of his later career.",,,,,,,,,,,51,2,2,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

The relationship between actual and expected inflation is more robust for frequencies longer than four years than short to medium term ones. We find leading effects of actual inflation on inflation expectations in most periods over medium and low frequencies. However, the structural changes that occurred in 2011 appear to have weakened this effect and no leading role of inflation expectations is found.

From the perspective of stake-holders, we analyse the moderating effects of different proportions of institutional investor holdings and types of enterprises on the relationship between environmental disclosure and environmental innovation. The results indicate that corporate environmental disclosure has a positive role in promoting environmental innovation; the proportion of institutional investor holdings has a positive moderating effect between environmental disclosure and environmental innovation. However, there is no significant difference between state-owned enterprises and private enterprises in terms of the effect of the environmental disclosure on environmental innovation, which possibly arises because both types of enterprises make full use of their own advantages to instigate environmental innovation through environmental disclosure.

The tax experts mostly support real estate taxation, dividends and capital gains taxation, personal income tax reliefs, the preferential treatment of small and medium enterprises and reinvested profits, as well as financial activities tax The experts mostly oppose a flat tax, the lower taxation of capital incomes (compared to labor incomes) and a single rate value-added tax. The paper proves that the experts' tax attitudes influence their responses on particular taxes, although not uniformly and not in all cases.","[Blazic, Helena; Stambuk, Ana] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia; [Simovic, Hrvoje] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, JF Kennedy 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Lazovic-Pita, Lejla] Univ Sarajevo, Sch Econ & Business, Trg Oslobodjenja 1, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia & Herceg; [Klun, Maja] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Adm, Gosarjeva Ulica 5, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",University of Rijeka; University of Zagreb; University of Sarajevo; University of Ljubljana,"Simovic, H (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, JF Kennedy 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",helena@efri.hr; ana@efri.hr; hsimovic@efzg.hr; lejla.lazovic@efsa.unsa.ba; Maja.Klun@fu.uni-lj.si,"Simovic, Hrvoje/H-7676-2018; Lazovic-Pita, Lejla/AAP-4342-2021; Blažić, Helena/Q-3836-2018; Štambuk, Ana/Y-9689-2018","Simovic, Hrvoje/0000-0002-4040-0899; Lazovic-Pita, Lejla/0000-0001-9421-1842; Blažić, Helena/0000-0003-4602-3665; Štambuk, Ana/0000-0002-5138-1662",Croatian Science Foundation [IP-2013-11-8174]; University of Rijeka [13.02.1.2.02]; University of Zagreb [DP 097-2015],Croatian Science Foundation; University of Rijeka; University of Zagreb,"This work has been supported in part by the Croatian Science Foundation under project number IP-2013-11-8174, in part by the University of Rijeka under project number 13.02.1.2.02, and in part by the University of Zagreb under project number DP 097-2015.",,40,4,4,1,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0939-3625,1878-5433,,ECON SYST,Econ.

The eight countries are among the most developed in emerging Europe, their banking sectors having been modernized by the middle of the last decade. We consider a data period that includes an initial credit boom (2005 - 2007) followed by the global financial crisis (2008 & 2009) and the onset of the Eurozone crisis (2010). Our two innovations with respect to the existing literature on banking during the financial crisis are to separate foreign banks into two categories, namely, subsidiaries of the Big 6 European multinational banks (MNBs) and all other foreign-controlled banks, and to take account of the impact of exchange rates during the period. Our results show that bank lending was impacted adversely by both crises but that the two types of foreign banks behaved differently. The Big 6 banks remained committed to the region in that their lending behavior was not different from that of domestic banks supporting the notion that these countries are treated as a second home market by these European MNBs. Contrariwise, the other foreign banks active in the region were involved in fueling the credit boom but then decreased their lending aggressively during the crisis periods. Our results also indicate that bank behavior in countries having flexible exchange rate regimes differs from that in those in (or effectively in) the Eurozone. Our results suggest that both innovations matter for studying bank behavior during crisis periods in the region and, by extension, to other small countries in which banking sectors are dominated by foreign financial institutions having different business models.

First, we note that one measure of heterogeneity is the slope of the hazard function, expressed in terms of a simple crossing condition. We then show that marginal price schedules, for distributions of buyers which are more heterogeneous by this measure, are less negatively sloped in that they cross schedules for more homogeneous distributions from below. Intuitively, quantity discounts are a response to an individual buyer's declining marginal utilities, and buyer heterogeneity interferes with this response.","[Conlon, John R.] Univ Mississippi, University, MS 38677 USA",University of Mississippi,"Conlon, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Mississippi, University, MS 38677 USA.",jrconlon@olemiss.edu,,,,,,,25,1,1,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0741-6261,1756-2171,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

In view of strong trade and financial linkages, the Eurozone crisis may have marred prospects of recovery in the aftermath of the recent Great Recession in both China and India.

Our regression results show that the respective home country, culturally more similar countries, and countries to which home-country banks have a larger risk exposure receive higher ratings than justified by their economic and political fundamentals. Cultural proximity, as measured by linguistic similarity, is shown to be the main transmission channel that explains the advantage of the home country. Further empirical tests that control for the existence of foreign offices and rated countries' levels of information transparency suggest that a more optimistic perception of risks rather than informational advantages drives this cultural home bias.

In the context of a duopoly, our results show that social welfare is not monotonic with the regulatory threshold. In particular, we obtain the paradoxical result that a policy decision of increasing the threshold might involve a dramatic decrease in welfare in some markets. An interesting consequence of this result is that the positive discrimination towards small firms is a rather subtle issue. Our results suggest that the relevant regulatory thresholds should differ across industries.

This study analyses the effect of disinvestment on enterprise performance, conditioned on political context as characterized by the ideological leanings of the parties in power at state and central levels. Using stochastic frontier analysis, measures of firm efficiency are generated for 238 central public sector enterprises for the period 1991-1992 to 2010-2011. The relationship between efficiency so measured and disinvestment is then estimated using a two-stage instrumental variables approach to control for endogeneity between firm efficiency and selection for disinvestment. Initial disinvestment is associated with substantial efficiency gains, but subsequent disinvestment much less so and the proportion of shares disinvested only loosely so. This may be explained by the transformative effect of initial stock market listing on accountability and profit orientation that is not repeated with further rounds of disinvestment. The effect of disinvestment on performance is stronger if the enterprise is located in a state governed by a right leaning party or one that is ideologically aligned with the party in power at the centre.

Monthly data are drawn from the National Employment Service's Employment Exchange, India's only public employment service. The results show that trade liberalization leads to a decline in the number of new hires. This implies the exacerbation of matching efficiency, described by an outward shift of the Beveridge curve. This finding is in accordance with a widely held public view that trade liberalization increases unemployment. Therefore, the Indian government should continue carrying out structural reforms for the Indian economy to deal with the inefficiencies in the labor market due to external liberalization.","[Lee, Woong] Korea Inst Int Econ Policy, Dept Asia Pacific, Bldg C,Sejong Natl Res Complex,370 Sicheongdaero, Sejong Si 339007, South Korea",Korea Institute for International Economic Policy (KIEP),"Lee, W (通讯作者)，Korea Inst Int Econ Policy, Dept Asia Pacific, Bldg C,Sejong Natl Res Complex,370 Sicheongdaero, Sejong Si 339007, South Korea.",woonglee@gmail.com,,"Lee, Woong/0000-0003-4365-973X",,,,,26,2,2,0,33,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

We use longitudinal EU-SILC data for 2005-2012 following the approach of Goedhart et al. (1977) as employed by Bishop et al. (2014). The use of longitudinal data shows that previous results on the subjective minimum income that were based on the OLS estimates for cross-section data overestimated the impact from current income and underestimated the role of economies of scale. Subjective equivalence scales imply a decreasing marginal cost of children in the three countries, which makes them distinct from the OECD scale. The marginal cost of a first child is similar to the values assumed in the OECD scale, but the cost of a second child is much lower.","[Morawski, Leszek] Vistula Univ, Warsaw, Poland; [Morawski, Leszek] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Warsaw, Poland; [Kalbarczyk-Steclik, Malgorzata] Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland; [Mista, Rafal] Univ Warsaw, Robert B Zajonc Inst Social Studies, Warsaw, Poland",Vistula University; Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Economics of the Polish Academy of Sciences; University of Warsaw; University of Warsaw,"Morawski, L (通讯作者)，Vistula Univ, Warsaw, Poland.;Morawski, L (通讯作者)，Polish Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Warsaw, Poland.",lmorawski15@gmail.com; mkalbarczyk@wne.uw.edu.pl; rmista@wne.uw.edu.pl,"Kalbarczyk, Małgorzata/AAZ-9537-2020; Morawski, Leszek/ABA-3220-2020","Morawski, Leszek/0000-0003-3464-3963; Mista, Rafal/0000-0002-7309-6352; Kalbarczyk, Malgorzata/0000-0002-9431-1947",Polish National Science Centre (NCN) [DEC-2013/09/B/HS4/01923],Polish National Science Centre (NCN),This work was supported by the Polish National Science Centre (NCN) under Grant No. DEC-2013/09/B/HS4/01923.,,22,0,0,0,5,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

Despite some differences in the characteristics of generation Y, the authors involved in this issue agree that generation Y is focused on education and development with simultaneous desire to maintain a balance between work and personal life. More often than older generations, they are willing to use the various programs, offered by their company, supporting reconciliation of professional and personal life. Purpose of the article: The aim of the article is to present issues concerning the functioning of the representatives of generation Y in the labor market with particular emphasis on the issue of balancing professional work and personal life. Methods: The conducted research aimed to analyze the opinion of representatives of generation Y about the expectations associated with their professional work with special emphasis on creating a balance between work and personal life. In order to obtain answers to the research questions, the methods of diagnostic survey and questionnaire technique were used. To complement the obtained data, the additional qualitative research unstructured interviews were conducted. The researches were conducted in Poland, at one of the technical universities in the Silesian voivodeship. Findings & Value added: Respondents have confirmed the hypothesis that for their generation balance between work and personal life is very important. The collected respondents' opinions showed the image of flexible employment as a good way to reconcile work and other obligations, which gives the ability to have multiple sources of income. It is a good solution especially for young people and people entering the labor market. The results of the conducted interviews pointed to a number of factors which in the opinion of young workers are important values in life and are related to the maintaining work-life balance.","[Robak, Elzbieta] Czestochowa Tech Univ, Ul Armii Krajowej 19B, PL-42202 Czestochowa, Poland",Technical University Czestochowa,"Robak, E (通讯作者)，Czestochowa Tech Univ, Ul Armii Krajowej 19B, PL-42202 Czestochowa, Poland.",elarobak@wp.pl,"Robak, Elzbieta/AAN-2217-2021",,,,,,18,8,9,6,23,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

He argues that group selection should be taken especially seriously for humans, since cultural evolution is especially important for us. Economists' view of basic human motivations should then include altruism. Wilson promotes a strong form of pervasive altruism, which seems bound to be inconsistent with many economic phenomena. Although a moderate version of the position he advocates is not easily dismissed, it is unclear what such an extended theory would look like.","[Robson, Arthur J.] Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Robson, AJ (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC, Canada.",,,,,,,,23,1,1,2,22,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

Among other things, we find that pre-existing relationships are a primary consideration in the selection of the lead manager and other syndicate members. Pre-marketing feedback figures prominently throughout the pricing process. The width of the price range of book-built IPOs is especially driven by valuation uncertainty. There is evidence of strategic underpricing in anticipation of subsequent equity issues and because of management's interest in satisfying new shareholders. Many interviewees believe that the lead manager's business interests have had a strong influence on the allocation of shares. Managerial perceptions of IPO success are largely driven by how well the firm fared in terms of stock price performance, changes in media attention and visibility, and changes related to the retention and recruitment of staff.","[van den Assem, Martijn J.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business Adm, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van der Sar, Nico L.] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Versijp, Philippe] Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; University of Amsterdam,"van den Assem, MJ (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business Adm, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",m.j.vanden.assem@vu.nl; vandersar@ese.eur.nl; p.j.p.m.versijp@uva.nl,"van den Assem, Martijn/HNJ-3993-2023","van den Assem, Martijn/0000-0001-5166-1288",,,,,62,0,1,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,DEC,2017,165.0,4,,,,,381,410,,10.1007/s10645-017-9302-y,0.0,,,30,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FM8SB,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000415358700001,0

Drawing from the trade-off theory of capital structure, the paper argues and finds that overleveraged firms do face significant investment constraints in the form of a reduced ability to initiate and complete M&As. Furthermore, the paper shows that the financing and investment constraints are reduced when firms undertake diversifying acquisitions compared to when they pursue related acquisitions.

Goods differ in the kinds of contracts that are appropriate for their production, and so strategic complementarities between contracts and social norms may result in a multiplicity of cultural-institutional equilibria. The resulting country differences in culture and institutions provide the basis for comparative advantage. In our evolutionary model of endogenous preferences and institutions, transitions among persistent cultural-institutional configurations occur as a result of decentralized and uncoordinated contractual or behavioral innovations by employers or employees. We show that the gains from trade raise the cost of deviations from the prevailing culture and institutions. As a result, trade liberalization impedes decentralized transitions, even to Pareto-improving cultural-institutional configurations. International factor mobility has the opposite effect.","[Belloc, Marianna] Sapienza Univ Rome, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Bowles, Samuel] Santa Fe Inst, 1399 Hyde Pk Rd, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA",Sapienza University Rome; The Santa Fe Institute,"Belloc, M (通讯作者)，Sapienza Univ Rome, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",marianna.belloc@uniroma1.it; samuel.bowles@gmail.com,,,Behavioral Science Program of the Santa Fe Institute; US National Science Foundation; Sapienza University of Rome,Behavioral Science Program of the Santa Fe Institute; US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Sapienza University of Rome,"We would like to thank two anonymous referees for valuable comments, and Alberto Alesina, Pol Antras, Pranab K.

In the optimal scheme, the sponsor uses reinsurance to screen insurers with bad and good risks, in order to lower premiums for enrollees with high expected healthcare costs. We then explore the effects of adding a community-rating requirement to complement this risk-adjustment scheme. With community rating, insurers have incentives to distort contract generosities to cherry-pick low-cost consumers. However, the reduced generosity for low-cost types makes screening through reinsurance easier, allowing the sponsor to redistribute more. When costs for reinsurance are low, or the sponsor's bias towards high-cost consumers is high, community rating dominates risk rating. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, this paper presents an innovative analysis by comparatively analyzing the ESC's historical data from 1998 to 2014 and the BSC's data from its beginning in 2005 until 2014 with the same econometric methodology.

This treatment effect is solely driven by those most associated with the local Gisu identity, for whom contributions are 43-74% higher in the national language. This difference fits with Gisu culture's high value on self-reliance and low value on reciprocity and cooperation, due to a violent history of intense competition over land.

We also use various standard gravity model variables to maintain consistency with the current literature. The results provide some important insights into the determinants of bilateral trade and offer policy implications regarding the promotion of international trade for governments worldwide. In particular, we find that output asymmetry between countries positively explains bilateral trade. Moreover, the findings suggest that making use of comparative advantage by differentiating the export product structure is important in promoting international trade. We do not find a consistent impact from bilateral exchange rate volatility on bilateral trade. This result points to the importance of providing opportunities for the hedging of currency uncertainty to avoid its adverse effects on trade.

In the absence of political reform, the regime does not possess the powers required by the new conditions of a market economy and an increasingly open society. Designed for Soviet totalitarianism, and without popular support or authority, the formal political institutions are anachronistic and thus limit the range of powers available to the Party. As the regime is thus unable to reliably deploy policy unless it feels threatened, politics becomes a competition over spoils. Thus, if macroeconomic instability actually or potentially threatens the regime, the Politburo gains authority to act, and policy is deployed.

Dynamics are characterized by a two-dimensional system of delay differential equations. The main aim of this work is to show that regular and non-regular fluctuations may emerge endogenously because of the existence of heterogeneous interacting agents that choose production over time in a myopic way. Chaotic dynamics in the discrete-time model of Puu (Chaos Soliton Fract 1(6):573-581, 1991) appear to be close enough to the origin of axes (implying that quantities produced by both firms are close to zero). In contrast, in our continuous-time version of the model with discrete delays, the dynamic system is more suitable of generating complex dynamics far enough from the origin when marginal costs vary. This is because of the role played by time delays and inertia. From a mathematical point of view, we show the existence of Hopf bifurcations and detect how time delays and inertia affect the stability of the system by using the recent techniques of stability crossing curves introduced by Gu et al. (J Math Anal Appl 311(1):231-253, 2005) and generalized by Lin and Wang (Can Appl Math Quart 20(4):519-533, 2012). The article also provides some findings about global bifurcations and chaotic dynamics by combining analytical studies and simulation exercises.","[Gori, Luca] Univ Genoa, Dept Polit Sci, Piazzale E Brignole 3a, I-16125 Genoa, GE, Italy; [Guerrini, Luca] Polytech Univ Marche, Dept Management, Piazza Martelli 8, I-60121 Ancona, AN, Italy; [Sodini, Mauro] Univ Pisa, Dept Econ & Management, Via Cosimo Ridolfi 10, I-56124 Pisa, PI, Italy",University of Genoa; Marche Polytechnic University; University of Pisa,"Guerrini, L (通讯作者)，Polytech Univ Marche, Dept Management, Piazza Martelli 8, I-60121 Ancona, AN, Italy.",luca.gori@unige.it; luca.guerrini@univpm.it; mauro.sodini@unipi.it,"Guerrini, Luca/C-4262-2013; Sodini, Mauro/R-1776-2016","Sodini, Mauro/0000-0002-8237-8941; Gori, Luca/0000-0003-1967-0840",,,,,24,5,5,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

The threat of large retaliatory tariffs and fears of a 1930s style downturn in trade have been associated with numerical trade modelling, which projects post retaliation optimal tariffs in excesses of 100%. In the relevant numerical modelling, it is common to use the Armington assumption of product heterogeneity by country. Here, we argue and show by numerical calculation that the widespread use of this assumption gives a large upward bias to optimal tariffs, both first step and post retaliation, relative to alternative homogenous good models used in trade theory. The reason is that optimal tariffs equal the inverse of the foreign export supply elasticity and are negatively related to the elasticity of the foreign offer curve. The Armington assumption model has a much more bowed foreign offer curve, which generates unrealistic larger optimal tariffs.","[He, Chuantian] Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies, Sch Econ & Trade, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Li, Chunding] Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies, Res Ctr Int Trade & Econ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Li, Chunding] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, 5 Jianguomen Nei St, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jing; Whalley, John] Western Univ UWO, Dept Econ, London, ON, Canada; [Whalley, John] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Guangdong University of Foreign Studies; Guangdong University of Foreign Studies; Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Li, CD (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, 5 Jianguomen Nei St, Beijing, Peoples R China.",cthe@gdufs.edu.cn; chundingli@gmail.com; jwang624@uwo.ca; jwhalley@uwo.ca,,"He, Chuantian/0000-0001-6118-2707",Ontario Research Fund; Chinese National Social Science Foundation [15ZDC017],Ontario Research Fund; Chinese National Social Science Foundation,We are grateful to the Ontario Research Fund and the Chinese National Social Science Foundation (15ZDC017) for financial support.,,29,5,5,0,25,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

By defining the parameter of birth rate of a new product as the probability that a new product is derived from an existing one and identifying the time path of this parameter with the firm's R&D plan, we derive the optimal R&D plan and examine the growth rate of the firm's expected total revenue along this optimal plan. We then find that the optimal birth rate of a new product is influenced positively by the speed of diffusion of demand and the initial level of demand but negatively by the unit cost of production and the interest rate and that the growth rate of the firm converges to the optimal birth rate of a new product.","[Murakami, Hiroki] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Econ, Japan Soc Promot Sci, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",University of Tokyo; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science,"Murakami, H (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Econ, Japan Soc Promot Sci, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",leafedclover@gmail.com,,"Murakami, Hiroki/0000-0002-3074-9528",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [14J03350]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [14J03350] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Grant Number: 14J03350.",,29,3,3,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,NOV,2017,68.0,4,,,,,966,985,,10.1111/meca.12159,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FL1GT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413963400015,0

Data were obtained from 505 respondents via an Internet-based questionnaire between May and October 2015. All of the respondents were Polish Internet users. Individuals who both sought information on tourist services and purchased the services offline indicated that the websites of hotels, travel agencies, and tour operators are the most credible. Another group who held a high opinion of hotels and tourist intermediaries' websites was composed of people characterised by the 'research online, purchase offline' (ROPO) effect or the reverse-ROPO effect. People who searched for information on holiday packages and bought them via the Internet held a lower opinion of websites of hotels, travel agents, and tour operators. Research indicates that with respect to the assessment of the credibility of websites offering tourist services, there are significant differences between individuals seeking information on tourist services online and those who purchase such services online.","[Szopinski, Tomasz] Univ Finance & Management Warsaw, Fac Management & Finance, Warsaw, Poland",,"Szopinski, T (通讯作者)，Univ Finance & Management Warsaw, Fac Management & Finance, Warsaw, Poland.",tszopinski@wp.pl,,"Szopinski, Tomasz/0000-0002-9314-1886",,,,,58,5,5,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The systems approach depicts sustainable development as the intersection of the goals attributed to three interlinked systems: environmental (or ecological), economic and social. The authors illustrate how each of the 17 SDGs can be characterized as a goal primarily attributed either to the environmental, economic or social system, and as suggested by the systems approach, there may be important tradeoffs in attempting to attain all these goals simultaneously. By adopting standard methods of the theory of choice and welfare under imposed quantities, the authors show that is possible to measure the welfare effects of an increase in the indicator level for one SDG by identifying the tradeoffs that occur with achieving another goal. They present a quantitative assessment of current progress and tradeoffs among the 17 SDGs, using a representative indicator for each goal. They then conduct a preliminary welfare analysis of these tradeoffs through employing the approach developed in this paper. Although this analysis focuses on the potential tradeoffs among SDGs, the approach could also be applied to show complementarities, or winwins, in simultaneous progress among two or more SDGs. Such an analysis can help in the design of appropriate policy interventions to achieve specific SDGs, minimizing the potentially negative knock-on effects on some goals whilst capitalizing on the positive win-win impacts on other SDGs.","[Barbier, Edward B.; Burgess, Joanne C.] Colorado State Univ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Colorado State University,"Barbier, EB (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",Edward.barbier@colostate.edu,,,,,,,22,115,124,6,75,DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics-Kiel,OCT 10,2017,11.0,,,,,,,,2017-28,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2017-28,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FK3FR,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413371500001,0

The analysis characterizes stewardship inefficiencies not previously identified by stewardship theorists. This inefficiency is minimized via a menu of contracts that emphasizes the fixed component of pay for stewards.

In this paper we unify a two-box climate model, which allows for heat and moisture transport from the southern region to the northern region, with an economic model of welfare optimization. Our main contribution is to show that by ignoring spatial heat and moisture transport and the resulting polar amplification, the regulator may overestimate or underestimate the tax on greenhouse gas emissions. The direction of bias depends on the relations between marginal damages from temperature increase in each region. We also determine the welfare cost when a regulator mistakenly ignores polar amplification. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical results, while ballpark estimates indicate that the tax bias could be as high as 20%, while welfare cost could reach 2% of global effective steady-state consumption.

In many real-world economic environments, such feedback can at best be acquired through costly monitoring, raising questions of how trust and efficiency can be maintained. In the lab, we conduct a modified finite-horizon binary trust game in which we vary the observability of the trustee's actions. In the baseline condition,trustors can perfectly observe their trustee's actions. We compare this to a condition in which that actions are unobservable and three conditions in which they must be actively monitored, at zero, low or high cost, respectively. Counter-intuitively, differences in observability do not lead to significant differences in trust and efficiency, but the levels are supported by very different information structures: while trustors monitored every action under zero observation costs, most of trusting actions were blind trustors did not learn whether their trust was honored or not under costly monitoring. Even under complete unobservability almost half of the available surplus was realized. There are distributive impacts, however: the gains from trust favor trustees under the more adverse informational conditions. The behavioral patterns are consistent with the fact that trustors' beliefs about their trustee's conduct are almost invariant across conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

These patterns suggest that before the reform matrilineal groups invested more in education than they would if unconstrained, to substitute for land inheritance, underscoring the importance of cultural norms.","[La Ferrara, Eliana] Bocconi Univ, Via Roentgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [La Ferrara, Eliana] IGIER, Milan, Italy; [La Ferrara, Eliana] LEAP, Milan, Italy; [Milazzo, Annamaria] World Banks Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC USA",Bocconi University; Bocconi University,"La Ferrara, E (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Via Roentgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy.;La Ferrara, E (通讯作者)，IGIER, Milan, Italy.;La Ferrara, E (通讯作者)，LEAP, Milan, Italy.",eliana.laferrara@unibocconi.it; amilazzo14@gmail.com,"Milazzo, Annamaria/C-5620-2019","Milazzo, Annamaria/0000-0003-0176-9439",European Commission under its Seventh Framework Programme [214705 PITN-GA-2008-214705],European Commission under its Seventh Framework Programme(European Union (EU)),"A micro-empirical approach (AMID), a Marie Curie Initial Training Network (ITN) funded by the European Commission under its Seventh Framework Programme-Contract Number 214705 PITN-GA-2008-214705.

The participants' common identity is primed to make neighborhood membership salient before individuals make donations to local non-profit organizations. We find that the identity treatment is sensitive to community context. It decreases the likelihood of giving in the struggling, poor neighborhood, but its impact is positive, albeit statistically insignificant, in the low to middle-income neighborhood. In addition, the identity treatment triggers participants' perceptions or memories of experiences with their communities which in turn lead to the treatment differences across the two communities. Our findings reveal the limitations on the power of common group identity in influencing individual economic decision making, which has been largely overlooked in the literature.

Our results suggest the EKC significantly holds for all but one pollutant (i.e. carbon monoxide) and that this relationship is significantly characterized by spatial dependence. Specifically, we find significant neighbourhood effects as well as significant positive economic spillovers at low income which turns negative at high income on both within and inter -municipality air emissions.

This paper intends to contribute to the debate by ranking the sectors that have the power to pull the economy out of the recession when they are stimulated, employing the eigenvector method developed by Dietzenbacher (1992). To that end, we first estimated the input-output (I-O) matrix for 2013 applying Guilhoto and Sesso (2005)'s methodology and build an I-O matrix from the National Statistical Accounts. Later, we employed the eigenvector method to find the inter-sector backward linkages and ranked them. The results highlight the importance of petroleum refining and coke, resin manufacturing and elastomers, various chemical products and preparations, and chemicals to boost the recovery of the economy.

We examine the tail risk of 24 commodities over a 12 year period. Tail risk is measured using Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), which measures volatility beyond a specified threshold. We classify tails for individual commodities as long and short based on their CVaR relative to the market. Overall, livestock commodities have the lowest CVaR risk, with some of the energy and metals commodities having the highest. However, the most interesting finding is that there is no consistency in relative tail risk rankings among commodities over time, and commodities having among the shortest tails in one period can have some of the longest in another period. Thus the relative tail risk of commodities changes significantly over time. We find that measured by CvaR, commodities generally have higher risk than Asian equities and that the relationship between equities and commodities is inconsistent in both strength and direction over time.

Established trade relations may open the gate to new trade opportunities, as they allow meeting new trade partners over time. We test this prediction and its implications for aggregate trade patterns by using the experience of ancient trade linkages between former colonies and their former colonizers (colonial trade linkages). We first show, using aggregate trade data, that former colonies have more trade with former colonizer's neighbors (colonial trade spillovers). We then show that the past export and import experience of former colonies with the colonizer have an impact on the propensity to trade similar products with third countries. In particular, the trade spillover effect is negatively related to geographical distance between third countries and the colonizer, and positively affected by their degree of economic integration.","[Berthou, Antoine] Banque France, 31 Rue Croix des Petits Champs, F-75001 Paris, France; [Berthou, Antoine] CEPII, Paris, France; [Ehrhart, Helene] Agence Francaise Dev, Paris, France",European Central Bank; Bank of France,"Berthou, A (通讯作者)，Banque France, 31 Rue Croix des Petits Champs, F-75001 Paris, France.",antoine.berthou@banque-france.fr,,,,,,,48,9,9,4,44,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

For this, we decompose the price of imported capital into common and country-specific components, where the common component is the price of capital in the US. Empirically, we document that, in contrast to small industrialized countries, consumption in developing countries responds more than output to unexpected changes in the price of capital in the US. As such, fluctuations in the price of capital in the US contribute to a high volatility of consumption relative to that of output in developing countries. We then show that a small open-economy real business cycle model driven by fluctuations in the price of imported capital can account for the responses of consumption and output to innovations of the price of capital in the US and for the high relative volatility of consumption observed in developing country. Finally, confronting the model to the data, we further find that fluctuations in the price of capital in the US contribute substantially to fluctuations of consumption in countries that display a low volatility of output and a large relative volatility of consumption.

However, despite their intuitive appeal, partial linear models have tended to produce implausible and/or erratic price effects. Blundell et al. (2012) propose a solution to this problem that involves using Slutsky shape restrictions to improve the precision of the nonparametric estimate of the demand function. They propose estimating a constrained partially linear model through three steps, where the weights are optimized by minimizing an objective function under the Slutsky constraint, bandwidths are selected through least squares cross-validation, and linear coefficients are estimated using profile least squares. A limitation of their three-step estimation method is that bandwidths are selected based on pre-estimated parameters. We improve on the Blundell et al. (2012) solution in that we derive a posterior and develop a posterior simulation algorithm to simultaneously estimate the linear coefficients, bandwidths in the kernel estimator and the weights imposed by the Slutsky condition. With our proposed sampling algorithm, we estimate a constrained partially linear model of household gasoline demand employing household survey data for the United States for 1991 and 2001 and for Canada for 2006-2009 and find plausible price effects.

We use the LCEA model to examine impacts of a pure carbon tax and a revenue-neutral tax-subsidy policy on lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from cellulosic ethanol using forest residues as feedstock in Washington State. In a model allowing for input substitution in the cellulosic ethanol feedstock, conversion, and transportation process, we consider energy source substitution (woody biomass for coal in the cellulosic ethanol conversion plant and biodiesel for diesel in feedstock production and feedstock and ethanol transportation) as well as substitution of capital and labor for energy in all stages of the lifecycle. We find that ignoring endogenous input substitution by using standard LCA leads to substantial underestimation of the impact of carbon tax policies on carbon emissions. Both tax policies can substantially reduce carbon emissions by inducing substitution among inputs. The revenue-neutral tax-subsidy policy reduces emissions more effectively than the carbon tax policy for carbon tax rates currently in place throughout most of the world. It stimulates substitution of woody biomass for coal and biodiesel for diesel at much lower tax rates when accompanied by corresponding subsidies for reduced emissions from renewable sources.

This paper outlines the Reserve Bank of Australia's investigation into this issue. Three areas are examined: aggregate trends in housing prices, debt and household incomes; the distribution of household debt and their effect on the economy as a whole. It is found that part of the cause of the rising ratio of house prices to household debt has been a recent slowdown in household income, strong demand from overseas buyers and strong population growth. While borrowing has added to the upward pressure on prices the underlying cause is embedded in the supply-demand dynamics. It is concluded that the recent increase in household debt relative to incomes has made the economy less resilient to future shocks.

A neoclassical migration equilibrium model is used to analyze the current nominal income tax system in Norway. The analysis is based on estimated regional income differences accounting for both observable and unobservable individual characteristics and the value of experience. Given regional differences in incomes and housing prices, quality of life and productivity are calibrated to model equilibrium. Compared to an undistorted equilibrium with lump-sum taxation, nominal income taxation creates a disincentive to locate in productive high-income regions. The deadweight loss due to locational inefficiencies is 0.18% of gross domestic product (GDP). We study real income taxation and equal real taxes as alternative tax systems. Both alternatives generate a geographic distribution of the population closer to the undistorted equilibrium, and hence with lower deadweight loss. In an extension of the analysis, we take into account payroll taxes. The existing regionally differentiated payroll taxes to the disadvantage of cities generate a deadweight loss of 0.22% of GDP in an economy with lump-sum income taxation. The two distortionary taxes interact and strengthen each other and the combined distortionary effect of income and payroll taxation in the Norwegian system is 0.46% of GDP.","[Rattso, Jorn; Stokke, Hildegunn E.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Stokke, HE (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",jorn.rattso@svt.ntnu.no; hildegunnes@svt.ntnu.no,,"Stokke, Hildegunn E./0000-0003-4633-4172",Norwegian Center for Taxation NoCeT NHH,Norwegian Center for Taxation NoCeT NHH,"We appreciate research collaboration with Rolf Aaberge and Audun Langorgen at Statistics Norway, access to housing data arranged by Fredrik Carlsen, financing from Norwegian Center for Taxation NoCeT NHH, comments at the 2014 Norwegian Research Forum on Taxation, the 2015 Meeting of the European Public Choice Society, the 2015 LAGV Conference in Public Economics, and the 2015 European Meeting of the Urban Economics Association, and in particular suggestions from David Albouy, Pierre-Philippe Combes, Jorge De la Roca, Erik Fjaerli, Bas Jacobs, Agnar Sandmo, Nicholas Sheard, Jens Suedekum, Peter Birch Sorensen, Dave Wildasin and two anonymous referees.

The main findings regarding the stabilizing role of real wage flexibilities can be summarized as two-fold. First, the more flexible real wage leads to smaller fluctuation in the output gap, reduces welfare losses regardless of exchange rate regimes. The increase in real wage flexibilities, however, may have destabilizing effects on domestic price and real wage inflation and may have a negative effect on welfare for both exchange rate regimes. Overall, contrary to conventional wisdom, increase in real wage flexibilities may be welfare-reducing. Second, in the presence of real wage rigidities smoothing the exchange rate fluctuations may increase the welfare loss.","[Rhee, Hyuk Jae] Univ Windsor, Dept Econ, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada; [Song, Jeongseok] Chung Ang Univ, Sch Econ, 84 Heukseok Ro, Seoul 06974, South Korea",University of Windsor; Chung Ang University,"Song, J (通讯作者)，Chung Ang Univ, Sch Econ, 84 Heukseok Ro, Seoul 06974, South Korea.",jayrhee@uwindsor.ca; jssong@cau.ac.kr,,"Song, Jeongseok/0000-0003-4814-8904",,,,,31,2,2,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

On average, wage expectations reflect observed market wages, but with large dispersion among individuals. We collected data from a full cohort of healthcare trainees in their third year of training on upper-secondary level. Those trainees who expected a greater return from nursing college (tertiary level) were more likely to enroll in nursing college later on; the effect is substantial and almost orthogonal to individuals' characteristics.

When I apply the method to rice farming villages in Thailand I find surprisingly little misallocation. Optimal reallocation would increase output by less than 19 percent. By 2007 most misallocation comes from factor market failures. I derive a decomposition of aggregate growth that accounts for misallocation. Declining misallocation contributes little to growth compared to factor accumulation and rising farm productivity. I use a government credit intervention to test my measures. I confirm that credit causes a statistically significant decrease in financial market misallocation, but has no effect on factor market misallocation.","[Shenoy, Ajay] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, MS Econ Dept, Rm E2-455,1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Shenoy, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Cruz, MS Econ Dept, Rm E2-455,1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",azshenoy@ucsc.edu,,,Center for Southeast Asian Studies at the University of Michgian,Center for Southeast Asian Studies at the University of Michgian,"Special thanks to Raj Arunachalam, Chris House, David Lam, Dan Ackerberg, Jagadeesh Sivadasan,.

However, existing empirical evidence on this point is mixed. Potential reasons for these conflicting results include differences in the level of economic development of the countries studied, different estimation methods and different measures of government transfers. By conducting a meta-analysis of 149 estimates reported in 23 studies, we sought to understand if - and if so, to what extent - government transfers are harmful to economic growth, as well as how important the abovementioned reasons are in explaining different findings in the literature. We found that government transfers are more detrimental to economic growth in developed countries compared to less-developed countries because such transfers can have a non-monotonic effect on growth. When government transfers are substantial, as they are in developed countries, they tend to reduce growth. We also found that the growth effects of government transfers are sensitive to the measurement of the transfers, i.e., studies that use unemployment benefits instead of social security tend to report a stronger negative growth effect.","[Churchill, S.

We examine wage-employment effects for a typical program in Eastern Europe with average loan sizes that are considerably above what has been studied so far. We apply propensity score matching extended by a difference in-differences estimator to panel data from an individual-lending program to firms in Bulgaria. Our results indicate that microcredit has very positive effects on job creation. Participating firms have on average 2.5 (or 33 percent) more employees two years after receiving a microcredit than matched non-participants. This strong effect seems to be related to a certain loan size threshold necessary for positive impacts to unfold. Effects are largest for the smallest firms, supporting findings from other studies that small firms are more constrained by credit than large firms. Investigating dynamic effects for up to six years after treatment, we furthermore show that effects are long lasting.","[Erhardt, Eva Christine] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Jakob Welder Weg 4, D-55128 Mainz, Germany",Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,"Erhardt, EC (通讯作者)，Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Jakob Welder Weg 4, D-55128 Mainz, Germany.",erhardt-eva@t-online.de,,"Erhardt, Eva/0000-0003-4987-6807",ProCredit Group; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD),ProCredit Group; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),"I am grateful to Thorsten Schank for his advice and encouragement.

The reverse relation between performance and bureaucrats' compensation and turnover has received only limited attention. Due to the distinct features of public-sector organizations, bureaucrats are traditionally argued to require either permanent positions and fixed wages, or low-powered performance incentives. This article studies how the performance of top civil servants in Norwegian local governments affects their compensation and turnover. We thereby build on a unique new dataset over the period 1991-2014. Our results indicate that better performing top civil servants obtain a higher compensation and are less likely to be replaced. Nonetheless, these incentives remain low-powered in line with agency theory prescriptions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We offer an evolutionary explanation for FLB in pari-mutuel betting using a simple market model. A bettor is forced to quit with some probability if his total net gain in one day is negative. Because of a positive track take, the expected returns of any strategy are negative, and so every agent must eventually lose and disappear in the long run. Those who favor longshots have a better chance of getting ahead with rare but large gains, enabling them to survive for longer than those who bet on favorites. This relative advantage results in overvaluation of longshots in the long run. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We use data from the Austrian components of the European Statistics of Income and Living Conditions from 2004 to 2012. Own-wage elasticities are very small for males and slightly higher for females. Cross-wage elasticities are practically zero for males and slightly negative for females. Male and female own-wage elasticities decrease with higher incomes. Over time female labour supply elasticities decrease. Furthermore, we assess the labour supply and fiscal effects of the Austrian tax reform of 2016. We find a total increase in working hours by 0.71%. The labour supply effects are stronger on the intensive margin, for females and for low-income earners. On total the tax reform induces a tax relief of 4.7 billion Euros.

In this paper, we examine an open access approach to the integration of storage, which enables the complete decoupling of a storage facility's ownership structure from its operation. In particular, we analyze a nodal spot pricing system built on a model of economic dispatch in which storage is centrally dispatched by the independent system operator (ISO) to maximize social welfare. Concomitant with such an approach is the ISO's collection of a merchandising surplus reflecting congestion in storage. We introduce a class of tradable electricity derivatives-referred to as financial storage rights (FSRs)-to enable the redistribution of such rents in the form of financial property rights to storage capacity; and establish a generalized simultaneous feasibility test to ensure the ISO's revenue adequacy when allocating such financial property rights to market participants. Several advantages of such an approach to open access storage are discussed. In particular, we illustrate with a stylized example the role of FSRs in synthesizing fully hedged, fixed-price bilateral contracts for energy, when the seller and buyer exhibit differing intertemporal supply and demand characteristics, respectively.","[Munoz-Alvarez, Daniel; Bitar, Eilyan] Cornell Univ, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Bitar, Eilyan] Cornell Univ, Sch Operat Res & Informat Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University; Cornell University,"Bitar, E (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.;Bitar, E (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Sch Operat Res & Informat Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",dm634@cornell.edu; eyb5@cornell.edu,,"Munoz-Alvarez, Daniel/0000-0002-1755-9121","NSF [ECCS-1351621, CNS-1239178, CNS-1135844]; US DoE under the CERTS initiative; Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); US DoE under the CERTS initiative; Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing,"The authors would like to thank Shmuel Oren, Pravin Varaiya (UC Berkeley), Michael Swider (New York ISO), Eugene Litvinov, Feng Zhao, Chris Geissler, Tongxin Zheng, Jinye Zhao (New England ISO), participants of the 2014 CERTS Reliability and Markets Internal Program Review, and an anonymous referee for their helpful comments and feedback.

Males are more affected than females, consistent with growing evidence that boys are less resilient to early environmental insults.

We exploit the cross-province variation in the roll-out of the reform and apply a difference-indifferences strategy to identify the causal effects of the reform on the outcomes. We find that the reform exposure, measured by the number of semesters that an individual is supposed to be exposed to the free compulsory education, is positively associated with individuals' educational attainment and cognitive achievement measured by math test scores in early adulthood. The reform effects on educational attainment become greater in the longer term. Moreover, the reform effect on educational attainment is stronger for individuals with less-educated fathers.

To cope with rocketing development costs, companies engage in Research and Development (R&D) cooperations. We study the impact of R&D cooperations on firms' research activities and drugs offered on the market. Using a comprehensive dataset, we find that R&D cooperations formed at the early stage of the drug development process increase the number of R&D projects and the number of drugs offered on the market. Late stage R&D cooperations, formed among larger firms in technology and product markets, increase firms' research activities, but reduce the number of drugs launched on the product market. Results suggest that large firms cooperating in the late research stage re-optimize their R&D pipelines and eliminate similarly aligned research projects.","[Banerjee, Tannista] Auburn Univ, Dept Econ, Haley Ctr 0326, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Siebert, Ralph] Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, Dept Econ, 403 West State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Banerjee, T (通讯作者)，Auburn Univ, Dept Econ, Haley Ctr 0326, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",tzb0018@auburn.edu; rsiebert@purdue.edu,"Banerjee, Tannista/K-1702-2014","Banerjee, Tannista/0000-0003-3137-0058",,,,,57,3,6,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

To assess the relative importance of collateral constraints versus market incompleteness, we study a calibrated incomplete markets model and solve it with and without collateral constraints.

This article provides further insights into the spillovers from China to the U.S. as well as the time horizon and dynamics of the bidirectional spillovers through the application of a multivariate extension of the heterogeneous autoregressive model, in relation to four commodities - soybean, wheat, corn and sugar. The results confirm the existence of significant spillovers from the U.S. to China for four commodities, which are primarily generated by the shorter-term volatility components in the U.S., and provide evidence for the increasing pricing power of the Chinese market.

The main contribution of this paper is a thorough comparison of the welfare effects of the various fiscal closures of the pension system reform. In addition, we decompose the welfare effects to the parts attributable to changing the way pensions are financed (PAYG double right arrow prefunding) and to changing the way pensions are computed (DB double right arrow DC). We show that depending on the fiscal closure, the welfare effects differ substantially for the same pension system reform.

The economy consists of a continuum of players drawn from a finite set of types. Players exogenously enter the market over time and exit upon trading. At every date, matching probabilities for each pair of types are determined by the endogenous distribution of trader types in the market. The balance of bargaining power at any stage depends on variations in potential gains from trade, the inflows of new traders, the structure of agreements at future dates, and the induced frequency of trading opportunities. We establish that an equilibrium always exists. Moreover, all equilibria that lead to the same evolution of the economy are payoff equivalent. However, we show that multiple self-fulfilling expectations about the trajectory of the economy, generating distinct equilibrium dynamics and payoffs, may coexist.

We implement a household survey in both northern and southern Italy to investigate preferences for financing rehabilitation programs for juvenile offenders, a particularly vulnerable group exposed to social exclusion. We find that although societies can be equally socially inclusive, families' propensity towards leaving no child behind varies depending on the presence of children in the family, and household income. We also show that differences in preferences do not depend only on socio-demographic characteristics but also on the subjective concern about crime risk, the immigration rate as well as on altruistic motives.

Based on these theoretical underpinnings, the present paper describes a structural input-output analysis of the inter-sectoral linkages and main activity clusters of the Greek economy, which is modeled as a complex network. Such an analysis employs suitable network metrics to measure the centrality and influence of each sector-agent on the other ones, and the possibilities for clustering of related (groups of) activities. Key sectors related to the production of tradable goods and services are identified, in terms of their marginal ability to pull the total economic activity. Critical sectors are also determined in terms of their ability to retain the interconnectivity and strengthen the stability of the whole economic system. It is argued that more synergies within and among the activity clusters, through the creation of integrated value chains, would allow better coordination of policies, more efficient allocation of resources and enhanced diffusion of knowledge.","[Tsekeris, Theodore] Ctr Planning & Econ Res KEPE, 11 Amer, Athens 10672, Greece",,"Tsekeris, T (通讯作者)，Ctr Planning & Econ Res KEPE, 11 Amer, Athens 10672, Greece.",tsek@kepe.gr,"Tsekeris, Theodore/H-5838-2019",,,,,,46,17,18,2,33,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

The effect of interest is identified from within-firm changes in workforce composition, controlling for person effects, firm effects, and sector-specific time trends. My estimates are based on a linked employer employee dataset for the population of workers and firms of the Italian region of Veneto for years 1982-2001. I find that a 0.1 increase in the average labour market value of coworkers' skills (which is around one within-person standard deviation) is associated with a 3.6 percent wage premium. I also find that a sizeable share of the wage variation previously explained by unobserved individual and firm heterogeneity may be due to variation in coworker skills. An event-type study, a Placebo exercise and a series of heterogeneity analyses lend credibility to the baseline results. I also evaluate the role of the spillover effects for wage differentials between specific groups of workers. I find that around 12 percent of the gender wage gap and 10 to 16 percent of the immigrant wage gap can be explained by differences in coworker characteristics.","[Battisti, Michele] Univ Munich, Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Ifo Inst, Munich, Germany",Ifo Institut; University of Munich,"Battisti, M (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Ifo Inst, Munich, Germany.",,,,Leibniz Association [SAW-2012-ifo-3],Leibniz Association,"Financial support by the Leibniz Association (SAW-2012-ifo-3) is gratefully acknowledged.

Existing studies focus mostly on narrow (reserve) money, and estimate a high degree of sterilisation. Empirical work on the long-run relationship between money and prices emphasises broad money, yet the long-run effect of foreign exchange inflows on broad money has been almost entirely ignored. Using a sample of quarterly data from 28 countries over the period 1990-2010, it is shown that broad money is sterilised to a significantly smaller degree than reserve money, raising concerns about the implications for financial imbalances and inflation. This pattern of sterilisation is not confined to any particular group of countries and is unrelated to the nature of the flows (e.g. current account versus capital account surpluses). Sterilisation rates have increased in Asia during the recent period of persistent accumulation of foreign exchange reserves.","[Bleaney, Michael] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Devadas, Sharmila] Cent Bank Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",University of Nottingham,"Bleaney, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",michael.bleaney@nottingham.ac.uk,,,,,,,19,3,3,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

J,"Cherrier, B",,,,"Cherrier, Beatrice",,,Classifying Economics: A History of the JEL Codes,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC LITERATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,AMERICAN; JOURNALS,"In this paper, I suggest that the history of the classification system used by the American Economic Association (AEA) to list economic literature and scholars is a relevant proxy to understand the transformation of economics science throughout the twentieth century. Successive classifications were fashioned through heated discussions on the status of theoretical and empirical work, data and measurement, and proper objects of analysis. They also reflected the contradictory demands of users, including economists but also civil servants, journalists, publishers, librarians, and the military, and reflected rapidly changing institutional and technological constraints. Until the late 1940s, disagreements on the general structure of the classification dominated AEA discussions. As the subject matters, methods, and definition of economics rapidly evolved after the war, methodological debates raged on the status of theoretical and empirical work and the degree of unification of the discipline. It was therefore the ordering and content of major categories that was closely discussed during the 1956 revision. The 1966 revision, in contrast, was fueled by institutional and technical transformations rather than intellectual ones. Classifiers essentially reacted to changes in the way economists' work was evaluated, the nature and size of the literature they produced, the publishing industry, and the use of computer facilities. The final 1988-90 revision was an attempt by the Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) editors to translate the mature core fields structure of their science into a set of codes and accommodate the new types of applied work economists identified themselves with. The 1990 classification system was only incrementally transformed in the next twenty years, but that the AEA is currently considering a new revision may signal more profound changes in the structure of economics.

In stark contrast, others have noted that interest rates on long-term federal debt are extremely low and have argued that such persistently low interest rates justify additional federal borrowing and investment, at least for the short and medium term. We analyze this controversy focusing on two main issues: the aging of the US population and interest rates on US government debt. It is generally understood that these factors play an important role in the projected path of the US debt-to-GDP ratio. What is less recognized is that these changes also have implications for the appropriate level of US debt. We argue that many-though not all-of the factors that may be contributing to the historically low level of interest rates imply that both federal debt and federal investment should be substantially larger than they would be otherwise. In conclusion, although significant policy changes to reduce federal budget deficits ultimately will be needed, they do not have to be implemented right away. Instead, the focus of federal budget policy over the coming decade should be to increase federal investment while enacting changes in federal spending and taxes that will reduce deficits gradually over time.","[Elmendorf, Douglas W.] Harvard Kennedy Sch, Publ Policy, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Elmendorf, Douglas W.] Congress Budget Off, Washington, DC USA; [Sheiner, Louise M.] Brookings Inst, Econ Studies, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Sheiner, Louise M.] Brookings Inst, Hutchins Ctr Fiscal & Monetary Policy, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Harvard University; Congressional Budget Office; Brookings Institution; Brookings Institution,"Elmendorf, DW (通讯作者)，Harvard Kennedy Sch, Publ Policy, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",Doug_Elmendorf@hks.harvard.edu; lsheiner@brookings.edu,,,,,,,55,14,15,1,7,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

The main findings of this study reveal that there is a U relationship between per capita CO2 emissions and income in China. The indirect effect that household income inequality affects CO2 emissions through household consumption is positive. The reasons for this positive effect are as follows: (1) an increase in household income inequality results in lower consumer demand and higher scale of investment, which leads to excess capacity, a rise in the waste of energy consumption and an increase in CO2 emissions. (2) The total consumption amount is inhibited and the consumption structure is influenced by household income inequality. The energy-intensive and lowquality-preferred consumption structure is an obstacle to the upgrading of the industrial structure and to technological innovation from the demand side. Thus, reducing CO2 emissions by upgrading the industrial structure and developing energy-saving technologies is inhibited by the consumption structure.","[Guo, Lin] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, 10 Huixin Dongjie, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics,"Guo, L (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, 10 Huixin Dongjie, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",linguo211@uibe.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71603050]; Social Science Foundation of Beijing [16YJC057]; the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in UIBE [14QD02],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Social Science Foundation of Beijing; the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in UIBE,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71603050), by Social Science Foundation of Beijing (16YJC057) and by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in UIBE (No. 14QD02).",,49,16,17,5,59,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

We find that in traditional classrooms, appearance matters: both below- and above-average-appearance female students earn lower grades. In regressions including student fixed effects, we find that students of above-average appearance earn significantly lower grades in online courses than those in traditional courses, a finding driven mainly by courses taught by male instructors.

It is based on a behavioral portfolio approach using prospect theory. Multiple job holdings is often a result of economic hardship but also because of peer comparisons. Workers may decide to take on a risky job like self-employment and engage into new ventures but also hold on to a safe employment in order to stay as close as possible to their reference level. While multiple job holdings might be the case for some, many others might decide to keep on working only at a safe job and do not engage into new risky ventures. This paper presents a behavioral economics model to explain such decisions. We find that the decision to hold multiple jobs depends on the degree of loss aversion, the value of the reference level and on the expected return in the risky venture. The worker will not seek for a risky job if she has an income reference level equal to what she can earn from a safe job. At any other reference level, the worker will seek new ventures provided she is compensated with a higher expected wage and is sufficiently loss averse.","[Hlouskova, Jaroslava] Inst Adv Studies, Dept Econ & Finance, Vienna, Austria; [Hlouskova, Jaroslava; Tsigaris, Panagiotis] Thompson Rivers Univ, Dept Econ, Kamloops, BC, Canada; [Caplanova, Anetta] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dept Econ, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Sivak, Rudolf] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dept Finance, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava; University of Economics Bratislava,"Tsigaris, P (通讯作者)，Thompson Rivers Univ, Dept Econ, Kamloops, BC, Canada.",hlouskov@ihs.ac.at; ptsigaris@tru.ca; anetta.caplanova@euba.sk; rudolf.sivak@euba.sk,,"Tsigaris, Panagiotis/0000-0002-7965-4554; Caplanova, Anetta/0000-0003-3767-7042; Hlouskova, Jaroslava/0000-0002-2298-0068","Faculty of National Economy, University of Economics in Bratislava' [ITMS 26140230005]; European Union","Faculty of National Economy, University of Economics in Bratislava'; European Union(European Union (EU))","We appreciate the valuable feedback and suggestions from the editor Shoshana Grossbard and the two anonymous referees of the journal.

We show that reducing the bond supply induces agents to increase their demand for money, which can enhance welfare by improving the allocation of the medium of exchange. However, this effect fails for high inflation rates, because agents hold so little money in the first place that manipulating the bond supply is not enough to correct the misallocation.

We first identify the conditions under which aid will be granted and characterize how the quantity of aid varies with the host country's development stage. We then endogenize the host country's institutions and identify the conditions under which institutional reform (adoption of a commitment technology) will be carried out, as well as the conditions that give rise to an expropriation trap-a situation where neither will the host country reform its institutions voluntarily nor will the donor country provide incentives for the institutional reform.","[Jin, Yi] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, Chengdu 610074, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Zhixiong] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Wenlan Sch Business, Wuhan 430073, Peoples R China",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Zhongnan University of Economics & Law,"Zeng, ZX (通讯作者)，Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Wenlan Sch Business, Wuhan 430073, Peoples R China.",zengzhxng@163.com,"Zeng, Zhixiong/K-2295-2019","Zeng, Zhixiong/0000-0003-3143-9756",,,,,24,2,2,1,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Abstracting from behavioral effects, we find that inheritances received during this period accounted for 30 percent of the increase in wealth of inheritors. Regression estimates of the effect of inheritance on wealth accumulation suggest that households spend 30 percent of their inheritances on average, and that there is substantial heterogeneity in household responses. Households that accumulated more wealth saved a larger share of their inheritances, as did middle aged households and those with lower initial wealth. Although inheritances are highly unequal they had a small impact on overall wealth inequality. This mainly reflected the fact that their size relative to other sources of wealth was very small.","[Karagiannaki, Eleni] London Sch Econ, Ctr Anal Social Exclus, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Karagiannaki, E (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Ctr Anal Social Exclus, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",e.karagiannaki@lse.ac.uk,,,Nuffield Foundation,Nuffield Foundation,"Data for the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) were made available by the UK Data Archive.

I describe how experimental and non-experiniental methods have been used, across the social sciences, to investigate how happiness drives, and is driven by, particular behavioural tendencies. I consider interpersonal behaviour (selfishness, trust and reciprocity) and individual behaviour (risk and time preferences). Regarding interpersonal behaviour, a general conclusion is that happiness results from pro social behaviour. Happiness negatively correlates with selfishness and positively correlates with trust; in both cases there is stronger evidence that the behaviour is a cause of happiness than a consequence of it. Individuals also gain happiness from inflicting costly punishment on those who have harmed them, although being happy reduces the degree to which people are willing to dole out such punishment in the first place. Regarding individual behaviour, the relationship between happiness and risk preferences remains unclear despite a large body of research on the topic, while there is evidence that happiness affects time preferences by reducing impatience. In all cases, I draw distinctions between the long- and short- term relationships between happiness and behaviour. (C) 2017 The Author.

If a resource bust hits, the affected economies contract through declining export revenues, and possibly face increased default risk. Thus, both booms and busts can create macroeconomic instability. Using a dynamic growth model, we model regime changes which reveal nonlinear effects of debt on the economy, depending on the level of leveraging. We find a change from stable to unstable dynamics if the external debt to capital ratio rises above a certain threshold. Risk premia are introduced highlighting the state-dependent borrowing costs for the dynamic paths. We study excess debt and over-leveraging as deviations from sustainable ratios. We find country-specific risk premia that are likely associated with booms and busts for the given debt assessment. Our empirical estimates suggest that certain oil-exporting countries are at a heightened risk for debt crises. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Based on incomplete contracting theory, we analyze the influence of various factors on these control structures in venture capital models, from the perspectives of investors, entrepreneurs, and startups. In particular, we show how factors such as bargaining power, monitoring costs, private benefits, and risk aversion impact the allocation of control rights. Using the survey data on a heterogeneous group of venture capital-backed startups in China, we empirically examine the impacts of various factors on the control structures of these enterprises. Based on the full sample of enterprises, we find that the stronger the venture capitalist's bargaining power and the higher the monitoring costs, the more likely investors and entrepreneurs are to prefer joint control. Further, the greater the entrepreneur's financing need and private benefits, the more likely investors and entrepreneurs are to choose joint control. High-tech startups are more likely to choose a joint control model than those in traditional industries. This is especially true for high-tech startups at an early stage of development. In addition, for hightech startups, the probability of choosing joint control shows a negative relationship with investors' strategic benefits and a positive relationship with investors' risk aversion. Regarding startups in traditional industries, investors' strategic benefits and risk aversion have an insignificant impact on their control structures.","[Wang, Lei; Zhou, Fangzhao] Jiangnan Univ, Sch Business, Wuxi 214122, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [An, Yunbi] Univ Windsor, Odette Sch Business, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada",Jiangnan University; University of Windsor,"An, YB (通讯作者)，Univ Windsor, Odette Sch Business, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada.",wanglei0663@163.com; traveloguezfz@qq.com; yunbi@uwindsor.ca,,,,,,,47,9,12,1,61,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

In this effort, issues of banking production are interpreted from the standpoint of two competing approaches to banking behaviour, the production approach and the intermediation approach, which permits treating the core essence of banking production from two different angles and comparing results. To this end, the Malmquist index methodology developed originally for group performance comparison is extended and modified to quantify productivity change and decompose it into its sources for the situation when there are multi-year structurally different periods of economic development, between which production technology remains intact and free of structural shift. This methodology is utilized in conjunction with the non-oriented slacks-based model of Tone and with the decomposition of productivity change as proposed by Ray and Desli. Besides the fact that the Slovak banking sector recorded a productivity increase between the first sub-period (2000-2003) and the third subperiod (2009-2012) of its development, it is symptomatic that innovation capacity and espousal of new technologies was tied with large commercial banks and smaller banks were only able to follow up these tendencies. As to the difference between the two approaches, they differ especially in how they view improvement or deterioration of relative technical efficiency of individual banks over the investigated period from 2000 to 2012. This complies with the difference that naturally exists between financial intermediation and provision of banking services.","[Bod'a, Martin] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Dept Quantitat Methods & Informat Syst, Fac Econ, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia; [Zimkova, Emilia] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Dept Finance & Accounting, Fac Econ, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia",Matej Bel University; Matej Bel University,"Bod'a, M (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Dept Quantitat Methods & Informat Syst, Fac Econ, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia.",martin.boda@umb.sk; emilia.zimkova@umb.sk,"Boďa, Martin/J-3602-2016; Zimková, Emília/ABA-2577-2022","Boďa, Martin/0000-0002-7503-6898; Zimková, Emília/0000-0003-1648-8103",VEGA [1/0757/15],VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),The paper originated in fulfilment of the grant scheme VEGA 1/0757/15 Augmentation of the theoretical construct of the SCP paradigm and of the efficient structure hypothesis in banking and insurance by the aspect of risk and their empirical validation in the conditions of the Slovak Republic.,,42,4,4,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1573-9414,1574-0277,,ECON CHANG RESTRUCT,Econ.

Using data from university campuses and national research laboratories we find that, after exclusive licensing, forward citations by private sector nonlicensees actually increase. An unanticipated exclusive license appears to be a signpost pointing to commercially relevant innovation pathways that nonlicensees follow with successful patented research.

Using a firm-product level dataset on Chinese exports to the United States and the European Union in the years surrounding China's WTO accession, we provide strong evidence that reduction in trade policy uncertainty simultaneously induced firm entries to and firm exits from export activity within fine product-level markets. In addition, we uncover accompanying changes in export product prices and quality that coincided with this-reallocation: firms that provided higher quality products at lower prices entered the export market, while firms that had higher prices and provided lower quality products prior to the changes, exited. To explain the simultaneous export entries and exits, as well as the fact that new entrants are more productive than exiters, we provide a model of heterogeneous firms which incorporates trade policy uncertainty, tracing the effects of the changes in policy uncertainty on firm-level payoffs and the resulting selection effects.

For example, estimates using the Laubach-Williams (2003) model indicate the natural rate in the United States fell to close to zero during the crisis and has remained there into 2016. Explanations for this decline include shifts in demographics, a slowdown in trend productivity growth, and global factors affecting real interest rates. This paper applies the Laubach-Williams methodology to the United States and three other advanced economies- Canada, the Euro Area, and the United Kingdom. We find that large declines in trend GDP growth and natural rates of interest have occurred over the past 25 years in all four economies. These country-by-country estimates are found to display a substantial amount of comovement over time, suggesting an important role for global factors in shaping trend growth and natural rates of interest.

An econometric method that incorporates dynamic factor analysis is used for estimating the pricing equation of oil stocks. The results indicate that oil investors care about long-run risks associated with future growth prospects. Long-run risks account for almost half of the total risk-premium of oil stocks. Long-run risks associated with future growth prospects are significantly shaped by latent factors related to the labor market, the price indices, and financial markets. Moreover, our estimated model captures some historical events including the oil crisis of the seventies, the economic crisis of the mid-eighties, the stock market crash of 1987, and the economic crises of 1998 and 2000.

Due to relatively moderate variations in the variables, we have applied quantile regression, since it is mainly the large changes (above the median) that essentially tend to have a considerable effect on the consumer prices. Moreover, in order to adjust for stochastic- and deterministic trends, autocorrelation, structural breaks as well as to measure APT effects in the short- and in the medium-run, we apply a wavelet decomposition approach. Our results show evidence that significantly positive asymmetric price transmission (APT) effects exist in this market. More specifically, in the short-run (based on the wavelet decomposition D1 for 1-2 months cycles), we find that that there is a higher propensity to rapidly and systematically increase the consumer prices subsequently to an increase in the NordPool market price, compared with the propensity to decrease their customers prices subsequently to a corresponding drop in the NordPool market prices. However, no significant APT effects were detected in the medium- or in the long-run (i.e. the asymmetric price transmission effects are observed only in the short-run). In summary, we could isolate significant APT effects in the short-run (1-2 months decomposition cycles), and for large changes in the dependent variable (percentiles = 0.9). Therefore, only large changes in the NordPool prices lead to feedback effects in the form of asymmetric price transmission effects. Our evidence supports the notion of firms' downward stickiness of retail prices for maximizing profit, which are not expected to be found on a fully efficient market. Although our finding shows that the price inefficiency is short-lived, these large temporal inefficiencies are still costly for the consumers. It should be noted that blunt traditional powerless methods do not detect these APT effects, while our wavelet quantile methods are powerful and make a significant contribution in the literature by providing new empirical evidence.","[Karlsson, Peter; Mansson, Kristofer; Sjolander, Par] Jonkoping Univ, JIBS, Jonkoping, Sweden; [Karlsson, Hyunjoo Kim; Karlsson, Peter] Linnaeus Univ, Vaxjo, Sweden",Jonkoping University; Linnaeus University,"Månsson, K (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Univ, JIBS, Jonkoping, Sweden.",kristofer.mansson@ju.se,"Karlsson, Hyunjoo Kim/IYJ-3753-2023","Karlsson, Peter/0000-0002-3623-5034",Torsten Soderberg Foundation,Torsten Soderberg Foundation,We would like to gratefully acknowledge the financial support by the Torsten Soderberg Foundation.,,21,3,3,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,MAY,2017,44.0,2,,,,,249,260,,10.1007/s10663-016-9318-6,0.0,,,12,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,ES6WW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000399692300003,0

Then we construct an ascending auction that implements the truth-telling equilibrium of a VCG-L mechanism in ex-post equilibrium.

We design a customized contract to optimally mitigate the risk of joint fluctuations in price and size terms. The hedge is sought out among contingent claims written on price and any quoted index that is statistically dependent on commitment size. Closed-form solutions are derived for the optimal custom hedge pay-off and for the asset holdings of two market strategies, one based on price-linked forwards, the other based on price-linked and index-linked forwards. Analytical hedges are obtained using a stylized lognormal market model. Detailed comparative statics provide a thorough analysis of optimal hedging pay-off functions. Performance assessment is conducted in the context of the US gas market and a prototypical urban region. Results suggest that hedging through suitable custom claims written on price and an additional index significantly outperforms standard price-based as well as mixed price-index forward hedging alternatives. Our optimal custom hedge could be adopted as a benchmark for the relative assessment of any risk management solution. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The study is conducted over three crisis periods in the Eurozone, namely, the ERM crisis, the dot-com crisis, and the global financial crisis (GFC). The results of successive Bayesian estimations demonstrate that during these crises, the nonseparable model generally provides better out-of-sample output forecasts than the baseline model. We also demonstrate that money shocks have some impact on output variations during crises, especially in the case of the GFC. Furthermore, the response of output to a money shock is more persistent during the GFC than during the other crises. The impact of monetary policy also changes during crises. Insofar as the GFC is concerned, this impact increases at the beginning of the crisis, but decreases sharply thereafter.","[Benchimol, Jonathan] Bank Israel, POB 780, IL-91007 Jerusalem, Israel",Bank of Israel,"Benchimol, J (通讯作者)，Bank Israel, POB 780, IL-91007 Jerusalem, Israel.",jonathan.benchimol@boi.org.il,"Benchimol, Jonathan/C-4676-2014","Benchimol, Jonathan/0000-0002-3205-3196",,,,,44,15,15,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

A union which sets centralized wages in a multi-unit firm can both decentralize and change the agenda to prevent the market entry of a non-unionized firm. The adoption of the efficient bargaining agenda is especially effective to deter entry because it lowers the fixed-cost threshold the entrant can bear.

Complex tasks are defined as those requiring higher order skills, such as the ability to abstract, solve problems, make decisions, or communicate effectively. We measure the task complexity of an occupation by performing Principal Component Analysis on a broad set of occupational descriptors in the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) data. We establish four main empirical facts for the U.S. over the 1980-2005 time period that are robust to the inclusion of a detailed set of controls, subsamples, and levels of aggregation: (1) There is a positive relationship across occupations between task complexity and wages and wage growth; (2) Conditional on task complexity, routine-intensity of an occupation is not a significant predictor of wage growth and wage levels; (3) Labor has reallocated from less complex to more complex occupations over time; (4) Within groups of occupations with similar task complexity labor has reallocated to non-routine occupations over time. We then formulate a model of Complex Task Biased Technological Change with heterogeneous skills and show analytically that it can rationalize these facts. We conclude that workers in non-routine occupations with low ability of solving complex tasks are not shielded from the labor market effects of automatization. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In 2011 the retail chain made it a mandatory part of the job instruction to approach every customer who entered the store. To ensure compliance, the chain also adopted a system for feedback and monitoring. Critical to our empirical strategy, this change in management practice was introduced in some stores only and at different points in time. This allows us to estimate the effects of the change on performance in a quasi-natural field experiment using a triple-difference approach. We find that the change in management practice increased sales by 5.6% and transactions by 4.7%. The effect seems to be persistent, suggesting that a more detailed job instruction, combined with systematic feedback and control, may increase performance in low-skilled narrowly defined jobs.

For the examination of its short term labour market consequences, this unprecedentedly huge and sudden policy change might be regarded as a natural experiment. After providing a theoretical framework for analysis, the paper uses urban labour market surveys to analyse how the labour market adjusted to the supply shock. Three outcomes are examined: the effect of the expansion on wages, on unemployment, and on access to 'good jobs'. The shock is found to reduce relative wages, raise the unemployment rate, and reduce the proportion in good jobs, but only for the entry-year or entry-period cohort of graduates. The effect is fairly powerful for entrants, especially university rather than college graduates, but incumbent graduates are largely protected from the supply shock. An attempt is made to examine the labour market effects of the quantitative expansion on educational quality. The paper provides insight into the operation of China's labour market in recent years.

I argue that the predicted inequality redistribution relationship can break down when voters face uninsurable idiosyncratic risk with respect to future labor income and a timing differential between tax collections and government outlays. This is formalized using an incomplete market heterogeneous-agent DSGE model with majority voting and 'time-to-build' policy, which suggests the collective demand for redistribution will not necessarily increase with growing income or wealth inequality. This result implies that even with equal political power among voters, democracies do not have a systematic mechanism to offset rising inequality as contrary to popular belief. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, I conduct a laboratory experiment to investigate two potential determinants of inertia in uncertain environments: (i) regret aversion and (ii) ambiguity-driven indecisiveness. I use a between-subjects design with varying conditions to identify the effects of these two mechanisms on choice behavior. In each condition, participants choose between two simple real gambles, one of which is the status quo option. The findings indicate that regret aversion and ambiguity-driven indecisiveness are equally important determinants of inertia, which in turn plays a major role in individual decision making.

But, how do values form and what causes them to change? This paper proposes a theory of value formation. In the model, agents choose values, motivated by economic considerations and, crucially, also by the desire for esteem. The comparative statics are driven by the following tension: agents obtain more esteem from peers if they conform in their choice of values; but they may obtain more self-esteem if they differentiate. This tension explains why, for instance, peer effects are sometimes positive and sometimes negative. Three applications are considered, related to: schools, inner cities, and organizational resistance. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

To adequately address potential selection bias, we apply a variant of propensity score matching as well as an instrumental variable technique based on the distance from the nearest financial institution to account for endogeneity in our estimates. Our analysis reveals that access to credit tends to improve food security and allows households to achieve greater dietary diversity. In particular, food security is proxied by calorie consumption, and households with credit access tend to have greater calorie consumption per capita. Dietary diversity is measured through a number of dietary diversity scores, such as the food consumption score and the household dietary diversity score, and households with access to credit score higher than those without according to such measures. The results have been found to be robust following correction for endogeneity issues, and the paper therefore provides empirical evidence in favor of policies supporting accessible credit for poor households in Bangladesh.

We use individual data collected quarterly within the health and demographic surveillance system of the rural community of Niakhar (Fatick, Senegal). Birth histories of 2,884 women born between 1932 and 1961 are analyzed. The determinants of completed fertility are investigated using a standard Poisson Regression Model. The global effect of child mortality on total and net fertility is found to be positive. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to provide evidence for the child survival hypothesis-an effect of child mortality on net fertility-at the micro level.

There has been ample evidence that stress influences decision making, but still very little is known about whether individual attitudes to risk change with exposure to acute stress. To directly evaluate the causal effect of psychosocial stress on risk attitudes, we adopt an experimental approach in which we randomly expose participants to a stressor in the form of a standard laboratory stress-induction procedure: the Trier Social Stress Test for Groups. Risk preferences are elicited using a multiple price list format that has been previously shown to predict risk-oriented behavior out of the laboratory. Using three different measures (salivary cortisol levels, heart rate and multidimensional mood questionnaire scores), we show that stress was successfully induced on the treatment group. Our main result is that for men, the exposure to a stressor (intention-to-treat effect, ITT) and the exogenously induced psychosocial stress (the average treatment effect on the treated, ATT) significantly increase risk aversion when controlling for their personal characteristics. The estimated treatment difference in certainty equivalents is equivalent to 69 % (ITT) and 89 % (ATT) of the gender-difference in the control group. The effect on women goes in the same direction, but is weaker and insignificant.","[Cahlikova, Jana] Max Planck Inst Tax Law & Publ Finance, Dept Publ Econ, Marstallpl 1, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Cahlikova, Jana] CERGE EI, Polit Veznu 7, Prague 11121, Czech Republic; [Cingl, Lubomir] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Fac Social Sci, Opletalova 26, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic; [Cingl, Lubomir] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Econ, Dept Inst Environm & Expt Econ, Nam Winstona Churchilla 4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic",Max Planck Society; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague; Charles University Prague; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Cingl, L (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Fac Social Sci, Opletalova 26, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic.;Cingl, L (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Econ, Dept Inst Environm & Expt Econ, Nam Winstona Churchilla 4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic.",lubomir.cingl@vse.cz,"Cingl, Lubomír/C-2801-2019; Cahlikova, Jana/JXY-4485-2024; Cahlikova, Jana/H-2873-2014","Cingl, Lubomír/0000-0001-8842-4876; Cahlikova, Jana/0000-0002-5757-6145",GA UK grant [4046/11]; [SVV-2012-265 801]; [SVV-2012-265 504],GA UK grant; ;,"We want to express special gratitude to Michal Bauer for his help and encouragement.

In this paper we seek its sources to assess whether this convergence will remain once the Great Recession ends. We use Social Security records to study the determinants of unemployment ins and outs for men and women separately, over the course of a whole business cycle, i.e. 2000-2013. We focus on Spain-a country hit hard by unemployment increases in downturns. We find that unemployment outs are crucial in understanding changes in unemployment rates in Spain as well as to understand the gender convergence in unemployment rates. Among the determinants of the large drop in unemployment outs, lack of demand and negative state dependence emerge as key sources, which affect men more negatively than women. In a scenario of upcoming recovery, unemployment outs will increase for short-term unemployed, particularly for males. On the contrary, both male and female long-term unemployed workers will face enormous difficulties to access a job, as the job access rates for long-term unemployed is not sensitive to the economic cycle. Hence, we expect that the gender convergence in unemployment rates will persist only when considering the long-term unemployed.","[De la Rica, Sara] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Bilbao, Spain; [De la Rica, Sara] FEDEA, Madrid, Spain; [Rebollo-Sanz, Yolanda F.] Univ Pablo Olavide, Seville, Spain",University of Basque Country; Universidad Pablo de Olavide,"Rebollo-Sanz, YF (通讯作者)，Univ Pablo Olavide, Seville, Spain.",yfrebsan@upo.es,"Rebollo-Sanz, Yolanda F./K-6940-2012; De la Rica, Sara/H-6637-2015","Rebollo-Sanz, Yolanda F./0000-0003-1876-7093; De la Rica, Sara/0000-0001-9872-6798","Spanish Ministry of Science [ECO2012-35820, ECO2013-43526-R]; Basque Government [IT793-13]; Andalusian regional government [PAI-SEJ479]",Spanish Ministry of Science(Spanish Government); Basque Government(Basque Government); Andalusian regional government,"We gratefully acknowledge financial support from research projects from the Spanish Ministry of Science (ECO2012-35820, ECO2013-43526-R), the Basque Government (IT793-13) and the Andalusian regional government (PAI-SEJ479).

Conditional on productivity shocks, our model reconciles with the data by closing the gap between cross-country correlations of consumption and output. It also predicts positive international correlations of investment and employment of the magnitude observed in the data. In other words, a rather parsimonious departure from a canonical two-country, two-good model goes a long way toward addressing two long-standing puzzles: the quantity anomaly and the international comovement puzzle.

Fieldwork has shed light on three registers of discourse for referring to food security in Russia since the end of the USSR. The original one was voiced during food shortages or at times of risks of famine and malnutrition in the Russia of the 1990s. Validated by the president's office, it argued for keeping the doors of trade open as wide as possible to food imports and opposed attempts to subsidize a national agriculture. The second, heard during the first decade of the new century in the context of membership in the WTO, switched perspectives by promoting farming and a negotiated integration into international trade. The third has prevailed in the context of the financial melt-down and the downturn in trade with Western countries. This discourse on developing a national agriculture advocates closing the doors to international trade. These registers of discourse have had quite real effects on productive structures and, during each period, realigned political forces in the country and the social consensus.","[Dufy, Caroline] Sci Po Bordeaux, Pessac, France; [Barsukova, Svetlana] Univ Natl Rech, Lab Sociol Econ, Ecole Super Econ, Moscow, Russia",,"Dufy, C (通讯作者)，Sci Po Bordeaux, Pessac, France.",c.dufy@sciencespobordeaux.fr; sbarsukova@hse.ru,"Barsukova, Svetlana/ABG-2575-2021",,,,,,46,1,1,0,9,PRESSES UNIV FRANCE,PARIS CEDEX 14,"6 AVENUE REILLE, 75685 PARIS CEDEX 14, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

The model accounts for the life-cycle consumption behavior, with the short-run and long-run consumption functions linking consumption to wealth. We show that the random walk model of consumption violates the relevant stability condition and delivers predictions that are inconsistent with the PIH.

We obtain two main results. First, if the production costs are equal across qualities, the undistorted equilibrium is the unique unprejudiced separating equilibrium. Furthermore, in a pooling equilibrium, low-type firms are able to coordinate their prices upwards to be pooled with high-type firms. Second, if the production costs differ across qualities, no (universally divine) pooling equilibrium exists and the undistorted equilibrium is the unique unprejudiced, universally divine equilibrium. The implication of our results is that high quality is signaled by high but undistorted prices in the case of experience composite goods, contrary to the case of single experience goods.","[Kim, Jeong-Yoo] Kyung Hee Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Kyung Hee University,"Kim, JY (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",,,,,,,,22,2,2,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

This study summarize management and policy lessons from the GEJE. The recovery efforts that followed the triple disasters: the earthquake, tsunami and meltdown of the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant are in progress. The experience of the GEJE and tsunami prompted the building of embankments throughout the Pacific coastal side of the Tohoku region. The Cabinet's Reconstruction Headquarters used at least 19 trillion yen ($ 158 billion) for intensive reconstruction over five years through 2015. The local government of the affected area accelerated the decontamination of commercial land which is an important action for the recovery. The central government introduced the Electricity Business Act for implementing voluntary energy conservation measures for peak energy seasons. The GEJE has had an indirect effect on the health of the disaster victims via job uncertainty as well. Decontamination is crucial in bringing people and businesses back to the affected area and promoting sustainable economic recovery because it reduces uncertainty about the short and long-term health risks. An efficient health and occupation plan for the victims is essential for the integrated approach to multiple disaster management. (C) 2017 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland.

Of the 63 sample companies reorganised in bankruptcy proceedings between 2009 and 2015, the ownership structure remained unchanged in 49 companies, while in 35, the existing owners or their family members remained in charge of key management positions. Using binary logistic regression, we observed that two factors influenced the change in ownership structure: the length of time it takes to resolve the insolvency process and whether the owners were involved in the running of the distressed company before it filed for bankruptcy.

Our main focus is on the case of a proportional tax on positive profits. Such a piecewise-linear tax scheme induces a kink in the firms' profit functions, and may lead to abrupt changes in a market's dynamics, coexisting attractors and hysteresis problems. Since these phenomena can also be observed in more general models, a proper understanding of their basic mechanism may be helpful to explain the intricate behavior of many economic systems.

Previous works have tackled the exposure problem with heuristic strategies that employ probabilistic price predictions so-called price-prediction strategies. We introduce a concept of self-confirming prices, and show that within an independent private value model, Bayes-Nash equilibrium can be fully characterized as a profile of optimal price prediction strategies with self-confirming prices. We operationalize this observation by exhibiting a practical procedure to compute near-self-confirming price predictions given a price-prediction strategy. An extensive empirical game-theoretic analysis demonstrates that bidding strategies that use such predictions are effective in simultaneous auctions with both complementary and substitutable preference structures. In particular, we produce one such strategy that finds near-optimal bids, thereby outperforming all previously studied bidding heuristics in these environments. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Not so, however, in classical political economy. Through close analysis in this paper, I wish to trace the concept's prominence in Adam Smith's thought and to fine-tune its definitional aspects. The thrust of Smith's argument is to delineate the mechanism via which the needs of the poorest in society are satisfied. Grounded in an understanding of need as limited and exhaustive rather than infinite, like desire or preference, his theory is one of affluence rather than scarcity. But his justification of commercial society (from which the neoclassical school only lifts the conclusion) rests on becoming actually satisfied that these needs are, indeed, satisfied-an erroneous belief (at least according to the terms of Smith's own definition) and an internal contradiction in the development of his argument, occasioned, I wish to suggest, by certain colonialist discourses. Finally, Smith's ontology of need, as reconstructed here, corresponds to similar enquiries recently undertaken in philosophy and in some heterodox schools of economics.","[Yamamori, Toru] Doshisha Univ, Kyoto, Japan",Doshisha University,"Yamamori, T (通讯作者)，Doshisha Univ, Fac Econ, Kamigyo Ku, Genbucho 601, Kyoto 6028580, Japan.",,"Yamamori, Toru/S-8831-2018","Yamamori, Toru/0000-0003-3533-1064",Faculty of Economics at the University of Cambridge,Faculty of Economics at the University of Cambridge,"Doshisha University.

We also find another cluster with less competitive market structures that, although not interconnected, strongly converge towards their own trend.

We employ, for the first time in the earning losses literature, a Poisson pseudo-maximum-likelihood estimator with fixed effects that has several advantages with respect to conventional fixed effects models. The Poisson estimator allows considering the full set of involuntary separations, including those with zero labor market earnings because of unemployment. By including individuals with zero earnings and by using our new method, the loss in the year of separation becomes larger than in previous studies. The loss starts with roughly 30% and, although it quickly shrinks, it remains at around 15% in the following years. In addition, we find that compared to other reasons for separation, the earning loss pattern is unique for involuntary separations, because no other type of separation implies such permanent scarring. This latter finding makes us confident that the self-reported involuntariness of a separation is a reliable source of information.","[Balestra, Simone] Univ Zurich, Grad Sch Business, Zurich, Switzerland; [Backes-Gellner, Uschi] Univ Zurich, Dept Business Adm, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich; University of Zurich,"Balestra, S (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Grad Sch Business, Zurich, Switzerland.",simone.balestra@uzh.ch,"Backes-Gellner, Uschi/D-6652-2014","Backes-Gellner, Uschi/0000-0002-7511-9757","Swiss Federal Office for Professional Education and Technology through its Leading House on the Economics of Education, Firm Behavior and Training Policies","Swiss Federal Office for Professional Education and Technology through its Leading House on the Economics of Education, Firm Behavior and Training Policies","We thank the Swiss Federal Statistical Office for data provision and John Addison, Isabel Baumann, Eric Bettinger, Simon Janssen, Edward Lazear, and the participants at the 15th colloquium on personnel economics in Paderborn for helpful comments.

While past research has shown that high income inequality occurs alongside low trade union membership, we show that past income inequality actually increases trade union membership with a time lag, as trade unions recruit more members after inequality has been high. But we also show that strengthened trade unions then fight inequality, thereby destroying what helped them to recruit new members in the past. As trade union density decreases, inequality increases and eventually re-incentivises workers to join unions again. By showing this empirically, we reconceptualise the relationship between inequality and union density as a prey and predator model, where predators eat prey - unions destroy inequality, but thereby also destroy their own basis for survival. By empirically showing that trade union density and social inequality influence each other in this way over long periods, this article contributes to a dynamic approach on how social problems and social movements interact.","[Chauvel, Louis] Univ Luxembourg, Res Unit INSIDE, Maison Sci Humaines 11, L-4366 Porte Des Sci, Esch Sur Alzett, Luxembourg; [Schroeder, Martin] Univ Marburg, Inst Sociol, Ketzerbach 11, D-35037 Marburg, Germany",University of Luxembourg; Philipps University Marburg,"Chauvel, L (通讯作者)，Univ Luxembourg, Res Unit INSIDE, Maison Sci Humaines 11, L-4366 Porte Des Sci, Esch Sur Alzett, Luxembourg.",louis.chauvel@uni.lu; martin.schroeder@uni-marburg.de,"Schroeder, Martin/HJI-0172-2023","Schroeder, Martin/0000-0001-6387-7158; Chauvel, Louis/0000-0001-5865-9404","Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg (FNR) [FNR/P11/05, FNR/P11/05bis]",Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg (FNR)(Luxembourg National Research Fund),"This work was supported by the Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg (FNR), FNR/P11/05 & FNR/P11/05bis.

Using a large administrative change in reimbursements for surgical versus medical care, we find that private prices follow Medicare's lead. A $1.00 increase in Medicare's fees increases corresponding private prices by $1.16. A second set of Medicare fee changes, which generates area-specific payment shocks, has a similar effect on private reimbursements. Medicare's influence is strongest in areas with concentrated insurers and competitive physician markets, consistent with insurer-doctor bargaining. By echoing Medicare's pricing changes, these payment spillovers amplify Medicare's impact on specialty choice and other welfare-relevant aspects of physician practices.","[Clemens, Jeffrey] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Clemens, Jeffrey; Gottlieb, Joshua D.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Gottlieb, Joshua D.] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada",University of California System; University of California San Diego; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of British Columbia,"Clemens, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.;Clemens, J (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,"Gottlieb, Joshua/0000-0001-8730-0468",National Institute on Aging [P01AG031098]; Institute for Humane Studies; NIA [T32-AG000186-23],National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); Institute for Humane Studies; NIA(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),"We gratefully acknowledge support and data provided by the National Institute on Aging under grant P01AG031098 to the National Bureau of Economic Research, and the Institute for Humane Studies.

We show that failure to account for transitory income fluctuations in current income may overestimate the degree of underreporting by around 40 percent. Previous studies typically use instrumental variable methods to address the issue. In contrast, our access to registry based longitudinal income measures allows a direct approach based on more permanent income measures. This also allows us to evaluate the performance of a list of instruments widely used in the previous literature. Our analysis shows that capital income is the most suitable instrument in our application, while education and housing related measures do not seem to satisfy the exclusion restrictions.","[Engstrom, Per; Hagen, Johannes] Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ Ekonomikum, Box 513, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University,"Hagen, J (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ Ekonomikum, Box 513, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden.",per.engstrom@nek.uu.se; johannes.hagen@nek.uu.se,"Engström, Per/L-9193-2018; Hagen, Johannes/AAZ-9932-2020","Hagen, Johannes/0000-0003-3093-726X","Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation [P2015-0147:1, P2013-0025:1]; Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare [2012-00455]; Uppsala Center for Fiscal Studies (UCFS) (Per Engstrom); Forte [2012-00455] Funding Source: Forte","Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation; Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare(Swedish Research Council for Health Working Life & Welfare (Forte)); Uppsala Center for Fiscal Studies (UCFS) (Per Engstrom); Forte(Swedish Research Council for Health Working Life & Welfare (Forte))","We thank Bertil Holmlund, Wojciech Kopczuk, Anders Bjorklund, Soren Blomquist, Adrian Adermon, Torsten Persson, Monika Butler, Spencer Bastani, Niels Johannesen, Christian Wittrock, Mikael Blinder, Che-Yuan Liang, Katinka Hort, Thor Olav Thoresen, and Hakan Selin for valuable comments.

Second, we exploit the large time span of our dataset to study the evolution of the relationship between electoral competition and political selection over time.

One example is the information provided by charity ratings organizations. I ask how information about the quality of a public good should be communicated in order to minimize free-riding. I propose that coarse or pooled messages about the quality of the public good can increase contributions and, in turn, social welfare. If individuals cannot distinguish between a public good that they would like to contribute to and a public good that would otherwise suffer from a high degree of free-riding, contributions to the latter may approach the efficient level of provision. Experimental results suggest that, in practice, some participants are averse to giving without having complete information and - as a result - coarse messages may decrease welfare.

This paper investigates the effect of surprises disguised in the macroeconomic announcements made by the European Monetary Union on CIVETS (Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey, and South Africa) stock markets. Daily stock market data starting from January 1,2007 to December 31, 2012 is analysed. The impact of macroeconomic announcements is estimated by using EGARCH model. The results show that the returns of four out of six CIVETS stock markets significantly react on the day of macroeconomic announcements, whereas the market volatility of all markets is affected due to the EMU's announcements. The results also show that not all types of announcements have significant impact on returns and volatilities in CIVETS, highlighting the importance of the contents of macroeconomic surprises.","[Wallenius, Laura; Fedorova, Elena; Ahmed, Sheraz; Collan, Mikael] Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Sch Business & Management, Lappeenranta, Finland",Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT,"Wallenius, L (通讯作者)，Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Sch Business & Management, Lappeenranta, Finland.",laura.wallenius@lut.fi; elena.fedorova@lut.fi; sheraz.ahmed@lut.fi; mikael.collan@lut.fi,"Collan, Mikael/AAF-6840-2020; Ahmed, Sheraz/I-9346-2012","Collan, Mikael/0000-0003-2976-2829; Ahmed, Sheraz/0000-0001-6836-2030",,,,,43,1,1,1,2,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

More recently concern about high compliance costs of oil companies due to mandates led to reductions in US biofuel mandates. To gain insights into the policy impacts of mandates on agricultural commodity prices and compliance costs requires development of dynamic models that can capture the fact that many agricultural commodities used to produce biofuels can be stored and that flexible compliance mechanisms allow for banking and borrowing of tradable permits. US biofuel mandates are enforced using a system of tradable permits, called RINs. RIN market dynamics are important because RINs can be banked for the future or borrowed from the future. Corn is the primary U.S. biofuel feedstock and is storable. Rational expectations competitive storage models are well suited to capture the dynamic behavior of commodity markets. Such a model is developed here for corn and RIN markets to estimate the impacts of alternative future ethanol mandate levels. The model considers corn use for ethanol, storage and all other uses in each period, accounting for two random variables: oil prices and corn yields. Borrowing and banking provisions of the Renewable Fuels Standard mandate are explicitly integrated into the model. We use the model to provide estimates of the impact on corn prices, corn plantings and ethanol production under two ethanol mandate scenarios for six marketing years from 2016/17. Our scenarios are a combination of volume requirements and infrastructure investment. The first scenario is one in which corn ethanol mandates stay the same as required in the current and proposed RFS and additional E85 stations are introduced that allow for compliance with higher mandates. The second scenario is one in which no investment occurs and the Environmental Protection Agency reduces the mandate to 13.87 billion gal, a level that can just be met with 10 percent ethanol blends. Comparing the results for two scenarios, we find that average corn prices are about 5 to 6% lower with the reduced mandates or about 22 to 30 cents per bushel, while average RIN prices drop from around 60 to 40 cents per RIN.

Considering a one-sector neoclassical growth model with a large class of nonseparable utility functions, we find that expectations-driven fluctuations occur easily when consumption and labor are Edgeworth substitutes or weak Edgeworth complements.

Rewarding self reporting theoretically sows distrust between parties tempted to exchange bribes and may reduce bribery even where authorities are otherwise ineffective in uncovering corruption. We test regimes where both the client and official may self-report and regimes where only one party may self report. We find that enabling both parties to self report is highly effective in deterring bribes being exchanged and corrupt favours being granted. Permitting only one party to self-report does not significantly deter corruption. The effect is most pronounced when agents are uncertain of whether they will interact with one another in future.

Assembling a disaggregated public spending dataset of 83 countries over the 1970-2011 period, we show that spending reallocations toward education, from health and social protection, have significant growth-promoting effects across a wide range of countries' income levels. However, income heterogeneity matters, particularly when reallocations involve infrastructure spending. Specifically, a reallocation from this spending to education also promotes growth, albeit primarily when a country's income level is low. This occurs because the effects of infrastructure spending are particularly weak in low-income countries, possibly due to the low quality of governance.

The effective timing of policy actions is an open challenge issue to researchers and also a much needed rule of thumb to policy makers and private agents. This paper aims to (a) derive the influencing factors of a tourism demand function and (b) identify the time impact of these factors, thus, allowing the formulations of effective policy actions, by both, governmental tourism authorities and private tourism agents in Singapore. Our findings suggest that tourism government authorities and private tourism agents in Singapore should choose the timing of their actions depending upon the anticipated factor changes and their estimated impact. That is, if exchange rate variability is anticipated then policy actions should start at least twelve months prior to the start of the tourist period. If, a keen price competition is expected to prevail then the best timing of policy actions is nine months ahead the tourism period. If income improvements in origin countries could be expected, then a rather shorter timing action of six months would be available to tourism authorities and private agents in Singapore.

In addition to monetary benefits from tax avoidance (incentives), the opportunity to participate in tax avoidance (access), as well as information and knowledge about these opportunities (awareness), are important factors for the individual's tax avoidance decision.

We compare the in-sample statistical performance of the MS Beta-t-EGARCH model with that of the single-regime Beta-t-EGARCH model. For both models we consider leverage effects for conditional volatility. We use data from the Standard Poor's 500 (S&P 500) index and also a random sample that includes 50 components of the S&P 500. We study the outlier-discounting property of the single-regime Beta-t-EGARCH and MS Beta-t-EGARCH models. For the S&P 500, we show that for the MS Beta-t-EGARCH model extreme observations are discounted more for the low-volatility regime than for the high-volatility regime. The conditions of consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator are satisfied for both the single-regime and MS Beta-t-EGARCH models. All likelihood-based in-sample statistical performance metrics suggest that the MS Beta-t-EGARCH model is superior to the single-regime Beta-t-EGARCH model. We present an application to the out-of-sample density forecast performance of both models.

For this purpose, six board characteristics were chosen: (1) equilibrium between non-executive and executive members of the board of directors; (2) independence of board members; (3) selection of board members by the assistant role of the Nomination Committee; (4) training the members' competences; (5) remuneration policy of board members by the assistant role of the Remuneration Committee; (6) improuving the accountability and transparency of financial information by the assistant role of the Audit Committee. The financial performances are represented by Return on assets (ROA) and Tobin's Q. The present study sample consists of 55 Romanian non-financial companies which are listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange (BSE) in 2012. We found the following characteristics in the majority of boards of directors: equilibrium between non-executive and executive members, independence of the members and concerns on training competences. On the other hand, the majority of companies do not have, within their governance system, advisory committees (such as Nomination, Remuneration or Audit Committees), which are meant to help the board in its decision-making. No statistically significant association was found between any of the board characteristics and performances represented either by Tobin's Q or ROA, but the findings are in line with numerous studies conducted in developing countries and may be explained by various shortcomings which characterise the lagging of transition economies.","[Borlea, Sorin Nicolae] West Vasile Goldis Univ Arad, Fac Econ Informat & Engn, Arad, Romania; [Achim, Monica Violeta; Mare, Codruta] Univ Babes Bolyai, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Cluj Napoca, Romania",Vasile Goldis Western University of Arad; Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Borlea, SN (通讯作者)，West Vasile Goldis Univ Arad, Fac Econ Informat & Engn, Arad, Romania.",snborlea@yahoo.com,"MARE, Codruta/AAZ-9390-2020; Achim, Monica/C-5811-2017; Mare, Codruta/ADC-6680-2022; Borlea, Sorin Nicolae/AAP-9288-2020","MARE, Codruta/0000-0002-4920-7462; Achim, Monica/0000-0003-4701-041X; Mare, Codruta/0000-0002-4920-7462; Borlea, Sorin Nicolae/0000-0002-9987-3682",,,,,58,36,43,1,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We formulate two combined measures of tax incentives: one is a measure of effective marginal tax reductions on R&D incentives, referred to as the b-index in the literature, of which existing data sets cover up to 38 countries; a second, novel one is the effective average tax rate on profits from R&D investments (EATR(R&D)), which is not available from other databases. Marginal tax incentives are mainly relevant for marginal R&D investments, while average effective tax rates matter for discrete R&D investments (e.g. plant or lab location). The paper assesses effects of these incentives on the filing and trading of patents (conditional on other drivers of patenting) based on some two million patent incidents from the European Patent Office. The results suggest that a higher level of effective average front-end R&D tax incentives raises the propensity to file and acquire patents, and reduces the incentive to sell patents. Moreover, more extensive effective average back-end R&D tax incentives raise the propensity to acquire patents. Statutory tax rates and super deductions are particularly important for patent filing, and tax credits and super deductions have the biggest impact on patent trading. Patent boxes seem to influence patent trading negatively.","[Bosenberg, Simon] Swiss Natl Bank, Bern, Switzerland; Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland; CEPR, Washington, DC USA; Univ Nottingham, Nottingham, England; Oxford Ctr Business Taxat, Oxford, England; Norwegian Ctr Taxat, Oslo, Norway; Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Vienna, Austria",Swiss National Bank (SNB); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); University of Nottingham; University of Oxford,"Bösenberg, S (通讯作者)，Swiss Natl Bank, Bern, Switzerland.",,,"Egger, Peter/0000-0002-0546-1207",Swiss Science Foundation (SNF) [132513],Swiss Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"First of all, the authors gratefully acknowledge numerous helpful comments by three anonymous reviewers, by the discussants Camille Landais and Elias Papaioannou, by the editor in charge (Nicola Fuchs-Schundeln) and her research assistant (Hannah Paule-Paludkiewicz).

Consistent with the existing literature evaluating insurer market concentration and the theory of compensating differentials, we find evidence of higher premiums and reduced net compensation for employees in markets with more concentrated insurers. Furthermore, we find evidence that the magnitude of these effects is distinctly smaller for large employers. This implies that mergers of large health insurance companies may have a significant impact on small businesses but that the effect is mitigated for larger employers.","[Brunt, Christopher S.] Georgia Southern Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, POB 8152, Statesboro, GA 30458 USA; [Bowblis, John R.] Miami Univ, Dept Econ, Oxford, OH 45056 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Southern University; University System of Ohio; Miami University,"Brunt, CS (通讯作者)，Georgia Southern Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, POB 8152, Statesboro, GA 30458 USA.",cbrunt@georgiasouthern.edu,,,,,,,22,0,0,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We find the interplay between cross-country differences in financial frictions and cross-industry differences in financial vulnerability to be an important determinant of the geographical and sectoral variation in average product quality. We show that this effect mostly occurs along an intensive margin, whereby financial imperfections distort the quality of existing exports to a given destination market.

We set up an optimal linear regulator problem and derive policy rules to compare the dynamics of pre-IT and IT eras. We find that while the optimal monetary policy rule in the pre-IT period is best described with a loss function that attaches equal weight to price stability, financial stability and output stability; the IT era is dominated by the price stability objective followed by the financial stability and output stability, consecutively. Moreover, we do not find an explicit role for exchange rate stability in the objective function of the Bank of Canada for both monetary policy eras. We, then, compare the properties of the derived optimal rules with those of an ad hoc Taylor rule for the IT period. In response to inflationary shocks, Taylor rule brings down inflation rates more quickly compared to the derived policy rules, but at the cost of a higher sacrifice ratio and more volatile interest rates.","[Eksi, Ozan] TOBB Univ Econ & Technol, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey; [Eksi, Neslihan Kaya] Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, Ankara, Turkey; [Ozlale, Umit] Ozyegin Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey",TOBB Ekonomi ve Teknoloji University; Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey; Ozyegin University,"Eksi, O (通讯作者)，TOBB Univ Econ & Technol, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey.",ozaneksi@gmail.com,"Ozlale, Umit/AAE-5222-2019",,,,,,26,1,1,1,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The results of the panel data analysis indicate that there is a weak relationship between economic globalization and primary school enrollment, whereas the relationship between social globalization and primary school enrollment is both robust and highly significant. Examining the data by groups of countries indicates that relationship between economic globalization and school enrollment is positive and significant in Latin America and the Caribbean and in Asia, while it is weakly negative in Eastern Europe. The positive relationship between social globalization and school enrollment on the other hand is driven by countries in Latin America and the Caribbean and the Middle East and Africa.","[Fors, Heather Congdon] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Fors, HC (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden.",heather.fors@economics.gu.se,"Fors, Heather/JQI-8189-2023",,,,,,38,0,0,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Specifically, the goal is to learn whether these other species can be considered as mackerel substitutes. To that end, a fractional cointegration analysis of different series of historical prices is performed using a novel method never before used in studies of this type. The results indicate that mackerel have no substitutes, and thus form a mono-species regional market. This implies, among other things, that their price is not influenced by the prices of other species, and this should be taken into account by managers when designing management measures and policies to improve the sustainability of the fishing of this species.","[Garcia-Enriquez, Javier; Arteche, Josu] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Dept Econ Aplicada Econ & Estadist 3, Bilbao, Spain; [Murillas-Maza, Arantza] AZTI Sustainable Fisheries Management, Sukarrieta, Spain",University of Basque Country; AZTI,"García-Enríiquez, J (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Dept Econ Aplicada Econ & Estadist 3, Bilbao, Spain.",javier.garcia@ehu.eus,"Arteche, Josu/X-1797-2019; Murillas-Maza, Arantza/M-8167-2015; Arteche, Josu/HZJ-0572-2023; Arteche, Josu/B-7649-2011; Garcia-Enriquez, Javier/A-5945-2015","Arteche, Josu/0000-0002-6700-3615; Garcia-Enriquez, Javier/0000-0002-2160-0369","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2013-40935, ECO2016-76884-P]; ERDF; Basque Government [IT-783-13]; Socioec project [FP 7-KBBE-2011-5]",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); ERDF(European Union (EU)); Basque Government(Basque Government); Socioec project,The authors acknowledge funding from project ECO2013-40935 and ECO2016-76884-P of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and ERDF.

After analysing and comparing these methods, we came to the conclusion that the most suitable method for developing the model was the decision tree technique. Using this technique we were able to extract classification rules for bankruptcy prediction and achieve predictive ability of about 85% which, in comparison with other models, showed higher predictive performance by about 10%. Moreover, we confirmed that by applying the dynamic approach predictive ability of the decision tree increased; however we did not derive the same result using the discriminant analysis method.","[Gavurova, Beata; Janke, Frantisek; Packova, Miroslava] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Banking & Investment, B Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia; [Pridavok, Mojmir] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, B Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice; Technical University Kosice,"Gavurová, B (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Banking & Investment, B Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",beata.gavurova@tuke.sk; frantisek.janke@tuke.sk; miroslava.packova@tuke.sk; mojmir.pridavok@tuke.sk,"Packova, Miroslava/AAE-5555-2020; Janke, Frantisek/AAH-3715-2019; Pridavok, Mojmir/AAE-6021-2020; Gavurová, Beáta/N-9159-2018","Janke, Frantisek/0000-0002-2688-3505; Gavurová, Beáta/0000-0002-0606-879X; Pridavok, Mojmir/0000-0002-4229-1892; Packova, Miroslava/0000-0001-7042-0981",[VEGA c. 1/0978/16],,This paper is supported by VEGA c. 1/0978/16 Financial health of companies and its importance in the context of supplier-customer relations.,,45,19,19,0,9,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

We analyze data on grape and vineyard prices in the Champagne region of France to,determine whether current prices are anchored on past prices set under a discontinued price-setting system. The key feature of this system is a vineyard quality rating called the Echelle Des Crus (EDC). The econometric challenge is to separately identify anchoring effects from the effects of relevant information EDC era prices may convey about grape and vineyard quality. Our empirical approach controls for observable attributes of vineyards and time-invariant unobserved determinants of vineyard quality that may be revealed to market participants through EDC era prices. In addition, we use an instrumental variables strategy to mitigate confounding influences of time-varying unobservables. We find strong evidence that anchoring has large effects on prices for grapes and vineyards. We also examine whether the anchoring effect is diminishing over time as market participants come to rely more on objective information to determine prices. We find, instead, a persistent effect of the EDC many years after it became obsolete. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Ethanol producers make a modest competitive profit in the mandate-induced region of production. A low price of gasoline increases the demand for blend ethanol and consequently increases the profit of ethanol producers. On the other hand, when gasoline becomes costlier than ethanol, the capacity constraints of the biofuels sector bind and ethanol producers gain large quasi-monopoly margins. This is an interesting example of a market where two commodities are complement up to a point and then substitute after that. We postulate the value of an ethanol producer as a strangle option consisting of two real options: the option to substitute gasoline at times of expensive crude oil and the option to expand supply of blend at times of cheap gasoline. Using a dynamic model we show that the higher volatilities of crude oil and ethanol costs increase biofuels firms' value. We also find non-monotonic relationships between the value of an ethanol plant and several underlying variables, including gasoline price level. We estimate the value provided by a 10% blend mandate to be around $150,000,000 for a representative ethanol unit. Our results offer a novel view of oil and feedstock price risks in contrast to the common belief that considers those risks as a negative factor for the biofuels sector. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Using a simple estimation strategy based on professional factor shares and rooted in economic theory, we generate estimates of market value for college players across seven National Collegiate Athletic Association conferences using professional football and basketball salaries from 2011 to 2013 as shadow prices. With this method, market value of an average starting football player in a Bowl Championship Series (BCS) conference ranges from $120,000 to $1.7 million per year.

We first benchmark the crisis against all episodes of sudden stops, sovereign debt crises, and lending booms / busts in emerging and advanced economies since 1980. The decline in Greece's output, especially investment, is deeper and more persistent than in almost any crisis on record over that period. We then propose a stylized macrofinance model to understand what happened. We find that a severe macroeconomic adjustment was inevitable given the size of the fiscal imbalance; yet, a sizable share of the crisis was also the consequence of the sudden stop that started in late 2009. Our model suggests that the size of the initial macro / financial imbalances can account for much of the depth of the crisis. When we simulate an emerging-market sudden stop with initial debt levels (government, private, and external) of an advanced economy, we obtain a Greek crisis. Finally, in recent years, the lack of recovery appears driven by elevated levels of nonperforming loans and strong price rigidities in product markets.","[Gourinchas, Pierre-Olivier] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gourinchas, Pierre-Olivier; Philippon, Thomas; Vayanos, Dimitri] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Gourinchas, Pierre-Olivier; Vayanos, Dimitri] CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA; [Philippon, Thomas] NYU Stern, New York, NY USA; [Vayanos, Dimitri] London Sch Econ, London, England",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Gourinchas, PO (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Gourinchas, PO (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Gourinchas, PO (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA.",,"Vayanos, Dimitri/AAW-9373-2021","Vayanos, Dimitri/0000-0002-0944-4914",,,,,46,42,46,0,11,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0889-3365,1537-2642,,NBER MACROECON ANNU,NBER Macroecon.

During the on-going recession in a number of major sectors, MNCs have undertaken only a very limited number of divestments and, instead, have commissioned a record number of new manufacturing facilities (by opening new plants and expanding the capacities of existing plants). To explain this phenomenon, we first provide an overview of existing theoretical and empirical studies on investments in difficult locations and divestments of foreign subsidiaries, and identify the major weaknesses of the prevailing approaches and underlying assumptions of such studies. Next, we present a detailed picture of both industrial investments and divestments in Russia from January 2015 to March 2017. Finally, we indicate how a combination of systemic and contingent factors (pressure from the host country's government, subsidiaries' orientation towards the host country's markets, and the absence of potential local and international acquirers for existing Russian manufacturing facilities of Western MNCs) has created cul-de-sac' conditions for foreign-owned industrial assets in Russia.","[Gurkov, Igor; Saidov, Zokirzhon] Natl Res Univ, Dept Gen & Strateg Management, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia; [Kokorina, Alexandra] Natl Res Univ, Inst Innovat Management, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Gurkov, I (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ, Dept Gen & Strateg Management, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia.",gurkov@hse.ru,"Saidov, Zokirzhon/L-5905-2015; Kokorina, Aleksandra Olegovna/N-5062-2015; Gurkov, Igor/H-1501-2015","Saidov, Zokirzhon/0000-0001-8721-9723; Gurkov, Igor/0000-0001-8116-0425",,,,,21,7,7,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2017,29.0,4,,,SI,,538,548,,10.1080/14631377.2017.1339536,0.0,,,11,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FN1DC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000415724200008,0

I build a small open-economy business cycle model that accounts for foreign aid shocks, with no preference shocks. The model is calibrated to reflect the structural empirical regularities of Cote d'Ivoire, a typical aid-dependent developing country. The parameters of the exogenous shocks are estimated using Bayesian methods and time series data for Cote d'Ivoire. The model produces business cycle patterns that are consistent with the data and key stylized facts. Specifically, the excess volatility of consumption with respect to output is successfully replicated. The results suggest that the unpredictability of foreign aid contributes to explain the volatility of business cycles in the recipient economy and has negative welfare effects.","[Houndonougbo, Ahiteme N.] Rollins Coll, Dept Business, Winter Pk, FL 32789 USA",Rollins College,"Houndonougbo, AN (通讯作者)，Rollins Coll, Dept Business, Winter Pk, FL 32789 USA.",ahoundonougbo@rollins.edu,,,,,,,39,3,3,0,3,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Developing a dynamic extension of the traditional Heckscher-Ohlin model with imperfect labor mobility and tracking overall dynamic paths from the autarky to free-trade steady states, we demonstrate that in the presence of inter-sectoral migration barrier, bilateral free-trade agreements can be welcomed (opposed) by the majority of workers in a capital-abundant (labor-abundant) country, which is inconsistent with the welfare prediction by Stolper and Samuelson. This paper also proposes a numerical algorithm to solve for the entire transition path of the model under rational expectation. Our simulation experiments further reveal that preannounced and delayed implementation can facilitate a bilateral free-trade agreement by partially neutralizing short-run transitional gains and losses so as to persuade the losers to support the reform without affecting the beneficiaries' trade preferences.","[Ishimaru, Shoya] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Oh, Soo Hyun] Korea Inst Int Econ Policy KIEP, Seoul, South Korea; [Sim, Seung-Gyu] Univ Tokyo, Dept Econ, Tokyo, Japan",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Korea Institute for International Economic Policy (KIEP); University of Tokyo,"Oh, SH (通讯作者)，Korea Inst Int Econ Policy KIEP, Seoul, South Korea.",socialplanner@gmail.com,"Sim, Seung-Gyu/AAD-9199-2019",,Tokyo Marine Kagami Memorial Foundation,Tokyo Marine Kagami Memorial Foundation,Tokyo Marine Kagami Memorial Foundation [2013].,,43,5,5,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

I examine this process of intangible asset accumulation within the context of the American pharmaceutical industry using Veblen's theory of the business enterprise as a lens. I show that intangible assets have come to dominate productive capital on pharmaceutical enterprise balance sheets, suggesting that pharmaceutical profits are accumulated through rent-seeking channels rather than productive ones, in line with Veblen's theory, and provide evidence of the financialization of this industry.","[Izhar Baranes, Avraham] Rollins Coll, Winter Pk, FL 32789 USA",Rollins College,"Izhar Baranes, A (通讯作者)，Rollins Coll, Winter Pk, FL 32789 USA.",,,"Baranes, Avraham/0000-0001-9141-3385",,,,,29,20,23,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Such biased expectations are of interest because of their capacity to drive sub-optimal labour market behaviour. Specifically, people with unemployment experience of three to five years significantly underestimate their probability of re-employment. Simply having information about the individuals' previous unemployment experience is sufficient to produce more accurate predictions than those of the individuals themselves. People who underestimate their re-employment probability are less likely to search actively for a job and more likely to exit the labour force. If re-employed, they are more likely to accept lower wages, work fewer hours, work part-time and experience lower levels of life satisfaction. By improving the accuracy of re-employment expectations, employment agency caseworkers may use this information to enhance their clients' labour market decision-making and prevent adverse job-seeking behaviours.","[Kassenboehmer, Sonja C.] Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Ctr Hlth Econ, Bldg 75,15 Innovat Walk, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Kassenboehmer, Sonja C.] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Schatz, Sonja G.] Univ Duisburg Essen, Mercator Sch Management, Lotharstr 65, D-47057 Duisburg, Germany",Monash University; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Duisburg Essen,"Kassenboehmer, SC (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Ctr Hlth Econ, Bldg 75,15 Innovat Walk, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.;Kassenboehmer, SC (通讯作者)，Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany.",sonja.kassenboehmer@monash.edu; soaja.schatz@uni-due.de,"de New (nee Kassenboehmer), Sonja/B-4385-2019","de New (nee Kassenboehmer), Sonja/0000-0003-4348-2049",Faculty of Business and Economics at the University of Melbourne,Faculty of Business and Economics at the University of Melbourne,Sonja Kassenboehmer would also like to thank the Faculty of Business and Economics at the University of Melbourne for supporting this research with a Faculty Research Grant.,,55,2,4,3,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5371,1879-1034,,LABOUR ECON,Labour Econ.,JAN,2017,44.0,,,,,,161,176,,10.1016/j.labeco.2016.12.005,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EQ8LI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000398337200011,0

We use the least-traded-products methodology of Kehoe et al. (2015) to provide guidance on how improvements can be made.

From DCC-copula model the authors derive time-varying probability of crisis transmission and dynamic correlations. The main findings of the paper are: (i) Euro adoption did not make Slovakia more vulnerable to the pan-European problems. (ii) The country is still identified by investors as an emerging Central-European region, rather than a country of the Eurozone.","[Kliber, Agata] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Poznan, Poland; [Pluciennik, Piotr] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business; Adam Mickiewicz University,"Kliber, A (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Poznan, Poland.",agata.kliber@ue.poznan.pl,"Płuciennik, Piotr/AAG-3385-2020; Kliber, Agata/P-6227-2019","Kliber, Agata/0000-0003-1996-5550; Pluciennik, Piotr/0000-0001-6535-9995",,,,,59,3,4,0,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Several of the criticisms he levelled at Ricardo cannot be sustained. The paper then has a closer look at Schumpeter's pronouncements on economic policy issues and shows that in a number of respects his views did not differ that much from Ricardo's and in some respects were remarkably similar. This concerns especially the problem of paying off the public debt, with regard to which both Ricardo after the Napoleonic Wars and Schumpeter after World War I advocated a once for all capital levy.","[Kurz, Heinz D.] Graz Univ, RESOWI Zentrum FE, Graz Schumpeter Ctr, Univ Str 15, A-8010 Graz, Austria",University of Graz,"Kurz, HD (通讯作者)，Graz Univ, RESOWI Zentrum FE, Graz Schumpeter Ctr, Univ Str 15, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",heinz.kurz@uni-graz.at,,,"University of Graz, Austria","University of Graz, Austria","Open access funding provided by University of Graz, Austria.

The main part of the work focuses on the trend of social influencers, whose role is gradually evolving. Social influencers are no longer merely a tool for marketing communication and an intermediary of brand marketing of well-known brands; they now are directly involved in brokering sales and thus function as distributors to a certain degree. The work deals with the question of how small businesses can use this trend to increase their ability to compete on the market and presents a sales model that takes into account the new role of social influencers. The proposed model was created on the basis of the theory of autopoiesis, i.e. a system capable of maintaining itself without external help, and also builds on one of the basic principles of general systems theory. In the second part of the work, a study was conducted between social influencers in the Czech and Slovak republics with the aim of determining the current state of partnerships between social influencers and the commercial sphere and to identify the attitude of the survey participants toward the commission remuneration system on which the proposed innovative model is built. Given the focus of the work on small businesses, the survey addressed social influencers with a small number of fans, i.e. those whose services are not as expensive as in the case of the leading social influencers.","[Ladrova, Jitka] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Informat, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Ládrová, J (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Informat, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic.",jitka.ladrova@tul.cz,,,[SGS-EF-3320-21188],,Research presented in this paper was supported by the funds from the project SGS-EF-3320-21188 Possibilities how to involve social influencer to increase the competitiveness of small entrepreneurs and family businesses.,,15,1,1,0,43,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-349-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,506,512,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6CS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426486500057,0

Measured by income mobility, Denmark is a more mobile society, but not when measured by educational mobility. There are pronounced non-linearities in income and educational mobility in both countries. Greater Danish income mobility is largely a consequence of redistributional tax, transfer, and wage compression policies. While Danish social policies for children produce more favorable cognitive test scores for disadvantaged children, they do not translate into more favorable educational outcomes, partly because of disincentives to acquire education arising from the redistributional policies that increase income mobility.","[Landerso, Rasmus] Rockwool Fdn, DK-1307 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Heckman, James J.] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Landerso, R (通讯作者)，Rockwool Fdn, DK-1307 Copenhagen, Denmark.",rl@rff.dk; jjh@uchicago.edu,,,"Pritzker Children's Initiative; Buffett Early Childhood Fund; NIH [NICHD R37HD065072, NICHD R01HD054702, NIA R24AG048081]; Rockwool Foundation; Successful Pathways from School to Work, an initiative of the University of Chicago's Committee on Education; Hymen Milgrom Supporting Organization; Human Capital and Economic Opportunity Global Working Group, an initiative of the Center for the Economics of Human Development; Institute for New Economic Thinking; American Bar Foundation; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Pritzker Children's Initiative; Buffett Early Childhood Fund; NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Rockwool Foundation; Successful Pathways from School to Work, an initiative of the University of Chicago's Committee on Education; Hymen Milgrom Supporting Organization; Human Capital and Economic Opportunity Global Working Group, an initiative of the Center for the Economics of Human Development; Institute for New Economic Thinking; American Bar Foundation; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This paper was presented at a Conference on Social Mobility held at the University of Chicago on 5 November 2014, under the title The Role of Income and Credit Constraints in Human Development, Part II.

An ex-post fair matching mechanism (for example, Serial Dictatorship) can be undesirable in that it is not exante fair: it may not match students with higher abilities to better schools, although it always matches students with higher scores to better schools. In this paper we consider a potential way of improving ex-ante fairness a Boston mechanism with the requirement that students submit their preferences before the exam score is realized (the pre-BOS mechanism). This mechanism is more likely to achieve complete ex-ante fairness, in that students with higher ability are always matched with better schools. However, the other mechanisms (pre-/post-SD and post-BOS) can always implement stochastic ex-ante fairness (students with higher ability having higher probability of admission to better schools), while pre-BOS may not.

Data in the research is collected electronically through a questionnaire, on a sample of 977 consumers in the largest supermarkets on the Western Balkans market. Chi-square test, P value test and contingency (C) coefficient were used to test the hypotheses and interpret results. The findings showed that differences between the indicators of social responsibility are not statistically significant, depending on the retailers where products are sold. Indicators show a statistically significant dependence of the countries, observed at the level of the region of Western Balkan countries that are members of the EU and transition countries outside the EU. Analysis of indicators of socially responsible behaviour of sales staff is significant in practice: a) it can assist the management of trading companies in defining and creating a socially responsible workplace and a seller who will meet consumers' needs and desires in a socially responsible manner; b) it provides the management of supermarkets from transition countries the insight into indicators that should be developed and strengthened in order to be competitive in the retail sector of the developed EU countries.

The deadline for the MCD transposition expired over one year ago, and it is highly illustrative to research, analyze and critically discuss its nature and impact across the EU, and in the Czech Republic in particular. Indeed, what will a holistic study and year-long experience indicate, i.e. what is the target of the MCD and was it hit? The tested hypotheses are that (i) the target of the MCD can be identified and it is not what is prima facia worded in the MCD, and (ii) this partially hidden target, namely the market integration, is hit, while missing other EU objectives. This is not fully satisfactory and the EU should engage in a deeper understanding of the cause-effect for mortgages and truly reaching the expectations and needs of stakeholders.

The extent to which that can happen depends largely on how one's surrounding institutions support a sense of autonomy, connectedness, and competence. I argue that the systematical prevalence of such conditions within an institution requires experiencing (i) exploration of the new in the emergence of the institution, and/or (ii) positive impact of its work on beneficiaries. The former is associated with the early phases of organizational evolution. The latter could be the source of flourishing in more established institutions, but hierarchies of power typically block it. Those with power are distanced from experiencing the impact of the institution on beneficiaries, structurally leading to priming through extrinsic motivations and vested interests. This leads to the need to further control those on the frontline who could experience the impact, which inhibits flourishing on their part as well.","[Pietinalho, Lauri] Aalto Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Espoo, Finland",Aalto University,"Pietinalho, L (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Espoo, Finland.",,,,Liikesivistysrahasto (the Foundation for Economic Education),Liikesivistysrahasto (the Foundation for Economic Education),Lauri Pietinalho is a doctoral candidate in the Department of Industrial Engineering and Management at Aalto University (Finland).

While a large number of recent studies have considered their design options, the aspect of group behaviour in PWYW situations has not been investigated, although a substantial part of payment decisions occur in group constellations. We provide initial evidence by running a field experiment implementing a PWYW mechanism in a cinema characterized by group attendance, finding that groups chose to pay similar amounts as individuals. Group payments can be increased by a prosocial framing of the decision, while an increase in group size and repeated participation reduce voluntary payments.

This paper develops a model of trade in intermediate inputs in which heterogeneous producers face irreversibilities in adjusting their importing status. Changes in aggregate imports are accounted for by adjustment within importing plants, through reallocation between non importers and importers, and through changes in the importing decisions of new and existing plants. When calibrated to Chilean plant-level data, the model shows that irreversibilities are important for generating aggregate and plant-level dynamics of trade flows in line With the data. In response to a permanent trade reform, increased importing at existing plants crowds out entry, raising consumption above its long-run level, and leading to welfare gains larger than a static model would imply.

Because real estate is a key sector for economic and social development, this risk analysis is seen as critical in supporting decision processes relating to buying or selling residential properties, partly due to the pressures caused by the current economic environment. This study aims to develop a conceptual reference model for risk assessment of residential real estate using fuzzy cognitive mapping. This fuzzy model allows cause-and-effect relationships between determinants to be identified and better understood, which in turn allows for better informed investment decisions. The results show that the use of cognitive maps reduces the number of omitted criteria and favors learning with regard to how the criteria relate to each other, holding great potential and versatility in structuring complex decision problems. Practical implications, strengths and weaknesses of our proposal are discussed.","[Ribeiro, Monica I.

I show that, compared to the risk-neutral benchmark, loss aversion on the buyer's side softens the rent efficiency trade-off for the seller. The reason is that the higher the buyer's valuation is, the more he has to lose by rejecting the seller's offer. Thus, in equilibrium the seller's profits and overall efficiency are both higher than in the risk-neutral case. Moreover, I also show that loss aversion has a redistributive effect by increasing the equilibrium payoff of some low-valuation buyers and decreasing that of high-valuation ones.","[Rosato, Antonio] Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Rosato, A (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",Antonio.Rosato@uts.edu.au,"Rosato, Antonio/E-4145-2017","Rosato, Antonio/0000-0003-1789-0225",Bank of Italy,Bank of Italy,"This paper is a revised version of the third chapter of my doctoral dissertation submitted to UC Berkeley.

It used a promising alternative causal identification strategy for profit-shifting based on earnings shocks, which has over a short time period been frequently cited in the literature. Using data from the same database, albeit for a period 10years later, for 2006-2015, the significant causal evidence for profit-shifting from European parent firms to their lower taxed European subsidiaries cannot be reproduced. Neither can similar results be obtained by considering profit-shifting to subsidiaries located anywhere in the world. Results in line with those of the original study can however be found when using effective rather than statutory corporate tax rates. While these findings raise concerns about the external validity of earlier studies' result, it should not put the existence and extent of profit-shifting into question. It rather raises concerns about the focus on statutory tax rates in measuring profit-shifting. Moreover, rather than a decrease in profit-shifting, it may illustrate the database's and the methodology's limitations and ability to capture all shifts and channels.","[Schimanski, Caroline] UNU WIDER, Helsinki, Finland; [Schimanski, Caroline] Hanken Sch Econ, Arkadiankatu 7, FI-00100 Helsinki, Finland",Hanken School of Economics,"Schimanski, C (通讯作者)，Hanken Sch Econ, Arkadiankatu 7, FI-00100 Helsinki, Finland.;Schimanski, C (通讯作者)，United Nations Univ, World Inst Dev Econ Res, Katajanokanlaituri 6B, FI-00160 Helsinki, Finland.",caroline@wider.unu.edu,,,UNU-WIDER; Nordisk Skattevidenskabeligt Forskningsrad (Nordic Tax Research Council); University of Tampere,UNU-WIDER; Nordisk Skattevidenskabeligt Forskningsrad (Nordic Tax Research Council); University of Tampere,"I would like to thank UNU-WIDER, the Nordisk Skattevidenskabeligt Forskningsrad (in English: Nordic Tax Research Council), as well as the University of Tampere for their funding to work on this study.",,9,1,2,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Based on the survey responses, we empirically analysed which factors influence these youths' tendencies to choose a high-risk career option over a lower risk one. Our results seem to indicate that such risk taking in competitive environments can be explained by potential benefits expected from this decision, as well as judgments about the likelihood of achieving the desired career. Risk attitudes towards career choices vary by differences in individuals' estimates of the potential benefits and in particular, in their own assessments of the likelihood of success, which is an important driver of risk acceptance. We also found that opportunity cost considerations influence risk acceptance: the better the low-risk option, the less willing the individual to give it up for a high-risk alternative. In addition, both national origin and level of cultural integration play a role in attitudes towards risky career choices, with reductions in the latter increasing the risk premium of quitting school.","[Schmidt, Sascha L.] WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Ctr Sports & Management CSM, Erkrather Str 228c, D-40233 Dusseldorf, Germany; [Torgler, Benno] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Queensland Behav Econ Grp QuBE, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Jung, Verena] SPORTFIVE GmbH & Co KG, Hamburg, Germany; [Schmidt, Sascha L.; Torgler, Benno] CREMA Ctr Res Econ Management & Arts, Zurich, Switzerland",WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Schmidt, SL (通讯作者)，WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Ctr Sports & Management CSM, Erkrather Str 228c, D-40233 Dusseldorf, Germany.",sascha.schmidt@whu.edu,"Torgler, Benno/W-4556-2019","Torgler, Benno/0000-0002-9809-963X",,,,,92,9,11,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The literature analysis shows that leading indicators vary across the countries and time. Therefore the aim of this research is to analyse potential leading indicators and identify the best predictors of the economic cycles in Lithuania. Various economic, industrial, financial, real estate market indicators as well as consumer and business expectations are analysed in order to find out which indicators cause the changes in the growth rate of GDP. The analysis is based on Granger causality test and autoregressive distributed lag model. The research shows that economic indicators such as consumption expenditure of households, government debt, compensation of employees, unemployment and others are weak predictors of the growth rate of GDP. Volume index of intermediate goods production is the best predictor in the group of industry data as it holds predictive attributes even three years before the changes in economy. The same conclusion can be made considering two financial indicators, i.e. short-term interest rate and the value of stock market index. Real estate market data such as residential buildings permits and growth rate in house price index can also warn about the changes in the growth rate of GDP two years before. Nevertheless, consumer and business expectations are the most important for the prediction of the changes in the growth rate of GDP.","[Stundziene, Alina; Barkauskas, Vytautas; Giziene, Vilda] Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Stundziene, A (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",alina.stundziene@ktu.lt; vytautas.barkauskas@ktu.lt; vilda.giziene@ktu.lt,"Giziene, Vilda/HGC-9674-2022; Stundziene, Alina/AAE-1356-2020","Stundziene, Alina/0000-0001-6812-8471",,,,,28,2,2,1,11,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

After decomposing realized volatility into positive and negative semivariance, rolling estimations of the HAR model uncover the relative importance of the long-term positive semivariance and reveal the dynamics of the individual volatility components over time. Two effects are identified: The relevance of the short-term negative semivariance is rather pervasive while the impact of the positive semivariance is strongly correlated with the overall development of the gold market. The asymmetric nature of gold price volatility is multi-faceted and hence more complex than previously documented. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Following the case of the overcapitalization of farmlands, studied by Veblen (1919), I argue that modern capitalism is a financialized society dominated by vested interests that rely on financial liberalization-led speculative overcapitalization, often leading to a perverse accumulation process and resulting in systemic catastrophes. Consequently, one of the major constituent institutions of liberal finance, market-dependent self-regulation, proves unable to deal with society-level issues like financial stability. This latter issue must be handled at a systemic level, as a public good. Therefore, specific public regulation and action mechanisms must be designed to maintain society (and dominant vested-interests) within some viability limits to ensure a smooth functioning of the economy.","[Ulgen, Faruk] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble Fac Econ, Branch Campus Valence, Grenoble, France; [Ulgen, Faruk] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble Fac Econ, Int Relat & Convent, Grenoble, France",Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA),"Ülgen, F (通讯作者)，Univ Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble Fac Econ, Branch Campus Valence, Grenoble, France.;Ülgen, F (通讯作者)，Univ Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble Fac Econ, Int Relat & Convent, Grenoble, France.",,"Ulgen, Faruk/T-9908-2019","ULGEN, Faruk/0000-0003-2625-6293",,,,,16,5,5,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

The results suggest that a positive cointegration relationship exists between permanent dollarization and Minimum Variance Portfolio (MVP) share. This provides an additional empirical validation of the MVP method as the standard tool for analyzing financial dollarization. In the long-run, agents make savings decisions based on the relative volatilities of inflation and nominal depreciation rates and do not take into account the interest rate spread. Somewhat different factors affect dollarization in the short rather than in the long-run. Namely, apart from MVP share, transitory deposit dollarization is driven, also, by the real interest rate spread. Our results suggest that affecting dollarization through changes in the interest rate spread may have a short-term impact. In the long-run, however, for de-dollarization it is critical to reduce the volatility of inflation compared to the volatility of exchange rate depreciation.","[Urosevic, Branko; Rajkovic, Ivana] Natl Bank Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia; [Urosevic, Branko] Univ Belgrade, Fac Econ, Belgrade, Serbia; [Urosevic, Branko] CESifo Res Network, Munich, Germany",University of Belgrade; Ifo Institut,"Rajkovic, I (通讯作者)，Natl Bank Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia.",,"Urošević, Branko/A-7294-2014","Urosevic, Branko/0000-0002-4605-3090",Serbian Ministry for Education and Science [MNTR 179005],Serbian Ministry for Education and Science,"The authors thank Milan Nedeljkovic, Mirjana Miletic, Jelena Maravic and participants at the National Bank of Serbia research seminar for useful comments and suggestions.

Empirical findings suggest that NPLs present persistence, which is more evident after the crisis, while other regressors have also persistent effects in the post-crisis period. Moreover, NPLs are mostly shaped by bank-specific variables before the crisis, whereas, after the crisis, NPLs are also driven by macroeconomic and policy-related variables. In particular, the post-crisis significance of GDP, policy rate and sovereign debt shows that robust economic activity, tight monetary policy and strong fiscal balances restrict NPLs, thereby enhancing financial stability. The significance of inflation in both sub-periods shows that commitment to price stability objective is indispensable for limiting NPLs and promoting financial stability. In the period ahead, the speed and the direction of normalization in global monetary policies may determine the course of financial conditions, which, therefore, have implications regarding NPL dynamics and financial stability.","[Us, Vuslat] Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, Istiklal Cad 10, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey",Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey,"Us, V (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, Istiklal Cad 10, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey.",vuslat.us@tcmb.gov.tr,,,,,,,45,6,6,0,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Monthly transitions between employment, unemployment, and nonparticipation of 25-55-year-old males are examined from 1996 through 2013. Prior to the Great Recession (1996-2007), younger groups of workers are more likely to move from employment to unemployment and face an increased risk beyond that of other workers of making this transition as the economy worsens; however, this differential responsiveness no longer appears after the start of the Great Recession. Before and after the start of the Great Recession, younger groups of workers are more likely to move from unemployment to employment; however, there is no extra responsiveness among younger workers to the business cycle. Transitions into and out of the labour force nuance these findings; however, there is no evidence of differential responsiveness among younger workers since the start of the Great Recession. These findings challenge interpretation of the movements of unemployment rates by age group over the business cycle as being driven by differential hiring and firing particularly since the start of the Great Recession.","[Xu, Huanan] Indiana Univ South Bend, Econ, South Bend, IN USA; [Couch, Kenneth A.] Univ Connecticut, Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University South Bend; University of Connecticut,"Couch, KA (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",Kenneth.Couch@UConn.edu,,"Xu, Huanan/0000-0002-5750-7457",,,,,22,6,8,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

First, the initial time series of tanker freight rates is decomposed into several independent intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Next, the IMFs are composed as three components by an improved EMD: the long-term trend time series that represents the benchmark freight rates of the tanker freight market, the high-frequency time series that reflects the short-term supply-demand relation and the low-frequency time series caused by extreme events. Based on the results of EMD, the volatility spillover effects between the freight rates of Aframax, Suezmax and Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) markets are tested by the BEKK-MVGARCH model. The results indicate that there are volatility spillover effects between the reconstructed components, although the volatility spillover effects between the original freight series are not significant. The improved EMD method contributes to the retention of the economic characteristics of the original time series, thereby providing a vital approach for tanker freight market analysis. Furthermore, the potential volatility spillover among different sub-markets can be investigated through the integration of EMD and the BEKK-MVGARCH.","[Zhang, Jiao] Dalian Polytech Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jiao] Dalian Polytech Univ, Liaoning Consumer Ind Dev Res Ctr, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Qingcheng] Dalian Maritime Univ, Sch Transportat Management, Dalian, Peoples R China",Dalian Polytechnic University; Dalian Polytechnic University; Dalian Maritime University,"Zeng, QC (通讯作者)，Dalian Maritime Univ, Sch Transportat Management, Dalian, Peoples R China.",sophie2013526@163.co,,"Jayden, Cazi/0000-0002-6067-1274",,,,,24,4,5,5,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This study employs a panel of sample data from 16 East Asian countries from 1985 to 2010 to examine the effect of inward FDI on human capital accumulation. The results show that an increase in foreign presence is associated with an increase in secondary schooling, yet has a negative impact on tertiary schooling.

The authors estimate the elasticity of taxable income (ETI) with respect to the marginal net tax rate for different groups of taxpayers by sex, marital status and age, separating the substitution effect from the income effect. For the empirical analysis, the authors use microdata from the Spanish personal income tax return panel disseminated by the Spanish Institute of Fiscal Studies. The main results show that the 2007 tax reform resulted in a range of elasticity values from 0.41 to 0.43, while the estimated income effect yields a negative value of -0.18. The results for the different taxpayer groups are as follows: the removal of retired people from the sample significantly reduces the ETI; elasticity is higher for women than for men; single people have a considerably higher elasticity than married taxpayers; and the ETI decreases with age. Additionally, the authors find that the marginal cost of public funds increased after the reform, and the top marginal tax rate is above optimal.","[Diaz-Caro, Carlos] Univ Extremadura, Caceres, Spain; [Onrubia, Jorge] Univ Complutense Madrid ICEI, FEDEA, Madrid, Spain; [Onrubia, Jorge] Univ Complutense Madrid ICEI, GEN Governance & Econ Res Network, Madrid, Spain",Universidad de Extremadura,"Díaz-Caro, C (通讯作者)，Univ Extremadura, Caceres, Spain.",carlosdc@unex.es,"Onrubia, Jorge/F-4146-2016; Diaz-Caro, Carlos/AAC-9755-2019; Fernández, Jorge Onrubia/AAA-9518-2019","Fernández, Jorge Onrubia/0000-0001-8394-7387",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2016-76506-C4-3-R],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"The authors express their gratitude for the useful comments and suggestions received from referees and editor, Julio Lopez-Laborda, Pedro Pascual, Fidel Picos, Fernando Rodrigo, Daniel Santin, Andoni Montes and A.

Building on Autor's contributions, we consider temporary jobs to be a Labour Market Intermediary that deals with job-matching problems, such as information asymmetries, search cost reductions, worker-side adverse selection, and pay-productivity gaps. Assuming that wage is a proxy for workers' productivity, we examine the chances that temporary workers who are located in different quantiles of wage distribution have of making the transition towards a stable employment position in the primary labour market. Results clearly indicate that temporarily employed individuals suffer significant wage- and career penalties. Not only are these individuals overly concentrated in the lowest decile of wage distribution, but the career penalty associated with temporary jobs also remains stable independently of the wage/productivity quantile to which the workers belong. If firms use FTC or TWA at all, they do so to remove less productive workers, whose work contract is not renewed once expired. In light of this evidence, it is clear that the hypothesisproposed in the economic literaturethat temporary employment contracts might serve as a screening tool to identify the most productive workers who would then be offered a stable position in the primary labour market does not hold in the highly dualised labour market of Southern Europe.","[Barbieri, Paolo; Cutuli, Giorgio] Univ Trento, Trento, Italy",University of Trento,"Barbieri, P (通讯作者)，Univ Trento, Trento, Italy.",paolo.barbieri@unitn.it,"BARBIERI, PAOLO/X-2531-2019","BARBIERI, PAOLO/0000-0002-5493-6029",,,,,66,9,9,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,DEC,2018,166.0,4,,,SI,,477,502,,10.1007/s10645-018-9324-0,0.0,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GY7HZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448780600005,0

Our results indicate that access to a nutritious school breakfast increases education by 0.1 years and earnings by 2-3%.

We investigate the possibility of overcoming the free-riding problem through creating social capital via communication. Using data from a public goods experiment, we empirically test the effectiveness of two commonly used types of communication interventions in various organizations-structured, goal-oriented communication and unstructured, free-form communication-in creating social capital. Although both types of communication are found to reduce free-riding, when players stay in the same groups before and after communication, unstructured communication brings voluntary contributions closer to the efficient level persistently; structured communication is less successful. In contrast, structured communication is more successful when players are allocated to different groups after communication; unstructured communication has a smaller impact on voluntary contributions in this case.","[Chakraborti, Rik] Christopher Newport Univ, Dept Econ, Newport News, VA 23606 USA; [Maloney, Matt] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Roberts, Gavin] Weber State Univ, Dept Econ, Ogden, UT 84408 USA; [Shogren, Jason F.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ, Stroock Chair Nat Resource Conservat & Management, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",University of Wyoming; Utah System of Higher Education; Weber State University; University of Wyoming,"Roberts, G (通讯作者)，Weber State Univ, Dept Econ, Ogden, UT 84408 USA.",gavinroberts@weber.edu,"Shogren, Jason/N-8193-2019; Chakraborti, Rik/AAB-7880-2022","Shogren, Jason/0000-0003-3757-959X; Chakraborti, Rik/0000-0002-3649-8096",,,,,52,2,2,1,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

Specifically, in a one shot gift-exchange game between a firm and a worker, we experimentally investigate whether a worker's preference for avoiding (seeking) written expression of disapproval (approval) from the firm can induce higher effort from the worker and thereby improve efficiency. We find that, compared to the noevaluation condition, free-form evaluation increases both effort and efficiency significantly while structured evaluation does not. To identify the channel through which free-form evaluation succeeds, we run additional treatments that allow the firm to communicate its desired effort beforehand. We find that free-form evaluation still achieves the highest level of actual effort while desired efforts are similar across evaluation protocols. If the firm's desired effort serves as a proxy for the firm's expected effort, then this suggests that free-form evaluation's success is due to the saliency of these messages in the worker's preference rather than the worker's belief of the firm's expectation.","[Du, Ninghua] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Key Lab Math Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Du, Ninghua] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Shahriar, Quazi] San Diego State Univ, Dept Econ, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; California State University System; San Diego State University,"Du, NH (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Key Lab Math Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.;Du, NH (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",ninghua.du@mail.shufe.edu.cn; qshahria@sdsu.edu,,,National Social Science Fund of China [17BJY208],National Social Science Fund of China,We thank Nick Feltovich and two anonymous referees for valuable comments.

We show that a distribution in which industry is evenly dispersed among some of the regions, while the other regions have no industry, cannot be stable. A spatial distribution where industry is evenly distributed among all regions except one can be stable, but only if that region is significantly more industrialized than the other regions. When trade costs decrease, the type of transition from dispersion to agglomeration depends on the fraction of workers that are mobile. If this fraction is low, the transition from dispersion to agglomeration is catastrophic once dispersion becomes unstable. If it is high, there is a discontinuous jump to partial agglomeration in one region and then a smooth transition until full agglomeration. Finally, we find that mobile workers benefit from more agglomerated spatial distributions, whereas immobile workers prefer more dispersed distributions. The economy as a whole shows a tendency towards overagglomeration for intermediate levels of trade costs.","[Gaspar, Jose M.] Univ Porto, Fac Econ, Porto, Portugal; [Gaspar, Jose M.] Univ Catolica Portuguesa, Catolica Porto Business Sch, Rua Diogo Botelho 1327, P-4169005 Porto, Portugal; [Castro, Sofia B.

It considers whether these policies have been successful and where their effects remain uncertain. We survey both the domestic financial market and macro-economic effects of UMP in the economies where these policies were introduced and their international spillover effects. The paper considers the impact of a wide range of UMP rather than the effects of specific policy instruments. We also provide a retrospective on the important case of Japan beginning in the late1990s and ask whether the Eurozone's experience with UMP is substantively different given its structure of policymaking. Finally, we ask: if the 'old normal' is not in our future, should the 'new normal' in monetary policy routinely include what we now refer to as UMP? We conclude that UMP can prevent economic collapse but are not designed to promote stronger long-term economic growth. Apart from new communication strategies, the use of UMP under normal circumstances does not appear to be a sound monetary policy strategy. Failure to learn this lesson might also enable future policy makers to ask or expect too much from their central banks.","[Lombardi, Domenico] Banca San Marino SpA, Faetano, San Marino; [Siklos, Pierre] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [St Amand, Samantha] Ctr Int Governance Innovat, Waterloo, ON, Canada",Wilfrid Laurier University,"Siklos, P (通讯作者)，Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",psiklos@wlu.ca,,,CIGI,CIGI,"This is a CIGI-sponsored research project.

However, politicians who have served in the military tend to have a higher probability to accept proposals on neutrality and a lower probability to accept proposals linked to international human rights and the environment.

As stable inflation in normal times either stems from central bankers' desire to maintain credibility or from aversion to inflation, the private sector is unable to infer the central banker's willingness to follow through on promises from observing stable inflation, jeopardizing the efficiency of forward guidance policy. We show that this signaling motive can justify temporary deviations of inflation from target well above 2%, but also that the low inflation volatility during the Great Moderation was insufficient to ensure fully efficient forward guidance when needed.

Using a minimum distance strategy, we find that international financial risk sharing is low even for advanced small open economies. Moreover, a strong real exchange rate appreciation is key for an unexpected commodity price increase to induce a tightening of labour market conditions in the model that is in line with the empirical evidence. As in the case of technology shocks discussed by Shimer (2005), proper amplification of the commodity price shock requires a high value of the outside option for unemployed agents. However, vacancies and unemployment hardly respond whenever the real exchange rate channel is mute.

Efficiency in public input provision will remain ambiguous in the capital-importing jurisdiction unless a specific functional form is assumed for the production technology. The constrained efficient provision with public inputs can be restored with an additional tax (subsidy) on capital that is used to strategically influence the interest rate on the common capital market and to increase employment by attracting foreign capital.","[Gillet, Holger] Minist Econ Lab Energy & Transport Saarland, Saarland, Germany; [Pauser, Johannes] TU Dortmund Univ, Dortmund, Germany",Dortmund University of Technology,"Pauser, J (通讯作者)，TU Dortmund Univ, Dortmund, Germany.",johannes.pauser@tu-dortmund.de,,,,,,,22,3,3,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

Specifically, we estimate the CAPM via fractal regressions that allow studying the marginal effects at selected scales. In this way, we can reveal whether the risk is perceived differently by market participants with different investment horizons. Apart from the analysis itself, we provide new statistical insights into the issue of separating and comparing the scale-specific effects with statistical validity. We find several stocks deviating from an expected risk perception homogeneity across investment horizons. This is true for both analysed periods, i.e. before and after the global financial crisis. There are also several stocks that changed their relationship to the market portfolio in between, which has strong implications for possible portfolio construction.

In this model, firms face uncertainty about their own foreign demand, and they update their beliefs based on individual export transactions according to Bayes' rule. I estimate the model using data on firm-level production and transaction-level exports to Germany in the Chinese ceramics and glass industry. The empirical results show substantial heterogeneity in productivity and demand belief. For experienced firms, productivity is the major driving force of export participation. In contrast, for potential entrants, demand learning plays a more important role. A counterfactual exercise suggests that trade cost reduction has a significant impact on stimulating the export participation of potential entrants. Importantly, more than half of the participation increase is attributed to firms' endogenous reaction to demand learning in the foreign market. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The estimation results reveal the significant external asymmetric downside risk in individual bank systemic risk in contrast to the internal asymmetric downside risk in system itself. The individual bank systemic risk contribution is idiosyncratic and incoherent, but the system risk impact on banks is consistent and co-integrated toward all banks. The empirical results show that the larger size or leverage of the individual banks causes higher system risk impact, as they are hit and go down jointly in shocking events. The foreign banks incur and spread more symmetric external risk, whereas the domestic banks suffer and release more asymmetric external risk. Accordingly, the banks in North America and Europe not only take system risk but contribute the most systemic risk during the subprime crisis and Greek debt crisis, respectively, leading to the episode of asymmetric volatility externality effect on the Taiwanese banks in Asia.

Policies that aim to facilitate or delay this process must understand how firms differ in their ability to expand and how firms' expansions affect that of others. I propose a model that quantifies various explanations for gradual expansion, with focus on expansion costs: those due to the rate of outlet expansion. I estimate the model using entry patterns in Mexico's supermarket industry for the years 1996-2006. I find firms' incur a 33% higher cost for opening the marginal store during the expansion period rather than at the end of it. I simulate how the industry would have grown under lesser expansion costs and find that, although the industry would have added more stores on average, there are outcomes in which certain firms' accelerated expansion would have crowded out other firms' expansion, resulting in fewer long-run stores and lower consumer welfare.

Governors are more likely to be promoted to higher salaried colonies when connected to their superior during the period of patronage. Once allocated, they provide more tax exemptions, raise less revenue, and invest less. The promotion and performance gaps disappear after the abolition of patronage appointments. Patronage therefore distorts the allocation of public sector positions and reduces the incentives of favored bureaucrats to perform.","[Xu, Guo] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Xu, G (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",guo.xu@berkeley.edu,,,STICERD; IGC,STICERD; IGC,"Haas School of Business, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720 (email:guo.xu@berkeley.edu).This paper was accepted to the AER under the guidance of Esther Duflo, Coeditor.

The authors propose an optimal control model, maximizing the intertemporal profit with consumers sensitive to the selling price and to a reference price. The optimal dynamic pricing policy is solved with Pontryagin's maximum principle with a structural (general) demand function. The authors obtain an original pricing rule, which explicitly accounts for the impact of price and inventory on future profits. The dynamics of price do not have to imitate the dynamics of the reference price. Instead, the dynamics of price are tied to opposing effects linked to this reference price. The authors also discuss managerial implications with regards to behavioral pricing policies.","[Chenavaz, Regis] Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, Kedge Business Sch, Marseille, France; [Chenavaz, Regis] EHESS, Paris, France; [Paraschiv, Corina] Paris Descartes Univ, Paris, France; [Paraschiv, Corina] Inst Univ France, Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Kedge Business School; Aix-Marseille Universite; Universite Paris Cite; Institut Universitaire de France,"Chenavaz, R (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, Kedge Business Sch, Marseille, France.;Chenavaz, R (通讯作者)，EHESS, Paris, France.",regis.chenavaz@kedgebs.com,"Chenavaz, Regis Y./T-1210-2017","Chenavaz, Regis Y./0000-0002-5911-2045",,,,,25,4,5,8,53,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,OCT 23,2018,12.0,,,,,,,,201864,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2018-64,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GX9QS,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448140200001,0

By testing for the existence of potential asymmetries, the paper seeks to clarify some of the controversies surrounding the subject. It shows the RER's long-run effects to be qualitatively symmetric but quantitatively asymmetric; thus, while appreciations slow accumulation, depreciations accelerate it, but to a lesser degree. Depreciations, moreover, have dynamically asymmetric effects, expansionary in the long run but contractionary in the short run. The effects are derived from non-linear autoregressive distributed lag models for the private capital accumulation rate in the manufacturing, tradables, and non-tradables sectors, and for the aggregate level of private fixed investment. The results help to reconcile the contradictory conclusions reached by previous studies of Mexico, and to clarify the potential role of the real exchange rate as either barrier or engine of growth.","[Ibarra, Carlos A.] Univ Americas Puebla, Dept Econ, Cholula 72810, Puebla, Mexico",Universidad Americas Puebla (UDLAP),"Ibarra, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Americas Puebla, Dept Econ, Cholula 72810, Puebla, Mexico.",carlos.ibarra@udlap.mx,,,,,,,44,3,3,0,3,SPRINGEROPEN,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2198-3526,2196-436X,,LAT AM ECON REV,Latin.

Such circumstances arise in a variety of industries, often characterized by regulated input prices. The distinguishing feature of markets with an influential VIP is that the VIP is not only a retail competitor but is also concerned about wholesale profits-profits it gleans from its retail rival(s). The VIP's desire to balance profits across wholesale and retail markets leads to results that challenge conventional thinking about timing equilibria. Notably, under quantity competition, rather than the familiar cut-throat race to be a leader, the timing equilibrium prescribes a natural leader-follower sequencing, with each party in a win-win situation relative to simultaneous early play.","[Arya, Anil; Mittendorf, Brian] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Arya, A (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",arya.4@osu.edu,"Mittendorf, Brian/C-9530-2012","Arya, Anil/0000-0003-0393-2092",Fisher Designated Professorship; John J.

Immigration shocks are the source of identifying variation across cities in changes to the relative supply of skilled versus unskilled labor.

We find that higher-income families tend to live in higher-price areas, so regional mean incomes converge as real incomes fall in richer, higher-cost regions and rise in poorer, lower-cost regions. Further, the differences in poverty rates for the metro and non-metro areas vanish and we find re-rankings in poverty rates among the 9 Census Divisions. RPP adjustments also influence income inequality and effective U.S. tax progressivity. They increase effective federal tax progressivity by more than 25 %, equivalent to a $2,500 cash transfer.

Comparing the surroundings of Thai military bases used by the US army to districts close to unused Thai bases, we find that there are currently five times more commercial sex workers in districts near former US bases. The development of the sex industry is also explained by a high price elasticity of supply due to female migration from regions affected by an agricultural crisis. Finally, we study a consequence induced by the large numbers of sex workers in few red-light districts: the HIV outbreak in the early 1990s.

Platforms are allowed to discriminate prices on the consumers' side according to their past purchase behaviour. The findings of the paper depend on two dimensions: the relative cross-side externalities and the consumer discounting relative to platform discounting. Price competition is strengthened in the poaching phase compared to the case where a uniform price is charged in both sides, whereas the early price competition is relaxed if firms exhibit weaker externalities than consumers and if the latter discount sufficiently the future. The overall effect on inter-temporal profits of platforms is negative, but consumers might be harmed by BBPD when they discount sufficiently the future. Finally, depending on consumers' discounting, total welfare may increase or decrease going from the uniform pricing to the discriminatory pricing.","[Carroni, Elias] Univ Bologna, Almamater Studiorum, DSE, Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Carroni, E (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Almamater Studiorum, DSE, Bologna, Italy.",elias.carroni@unibo.it,"CARRONI, ELIAS/A-1177-2019","CARRONI, ELIAS/0000-0002-6809-5339",Programma Master & Back-Regione Autonoma della Sardegna,Programma Master & Back-Regione Autonoma della Sardegna,"I am grateful to the editor Giacomo Corneo and two anonymous referees for helpful reviews on the paper.

Once an idea is adopted, it is difficult to change. In the 1970s, the economics profession abandoned the Keynesian Phillips curve and adopted Milton Friedman's natural rate of unemployment (NRU) hypothesis. The shift was facilitated by a series of lucky breaks. Despite much evidence against the NRU, and much evidence and theoretical argument supportive of the Keynesian Phillips curve, the NRU hypothesis remains ascendant. The hypothesis has had an enormous impact on macroeconomic theory and policy. 2018 is the 50th anniversary of Friedman's introduction of the NRU hypothesis.

Math and language exam scores constitute the key measures of cognitive skills; teacher-assigned grades the key measure of noncognitive skills. The data consist of two 9-year panels of youth completing compulsory education in Denmark. Estimation of completion proceeds separately by gender and VET type, controlling for selection and right censoring. The authors find that all skills are inversely related to VET enrollment, even controlling for family-specific effects. Estimates for completion vary considerably by program type, demonstrating the methodological importance of distinguishing among different VET courses. Math scores are positively related to certification for all VET tracks, though with very different magnitudes; language skills are inversely related for the nonbusiness tracks; and noncognitive skills appear important primarily for the business track.","[Stratton, Leslie S.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Econ, 301 W Main St,Box 844000, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Stratton, Leslie S.] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Stratton, Leslie S.] LCC, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Gupta, Nabanita Datta] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Fuglesangs Alle 4,Bldg 2621,Off B-05, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark; [Reimer, David] Aarhus Univ, Danish Sch Educ, Jens Chr Skous Vej 4, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Holm, Anders] Univ Western Ontario, Social Sci Ctr, Dept Sociol, Room 5327, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada",Virginia Commonwealth University; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Aarhus University; Aarhus University; Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Stratton, LS (通讯作者)，Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Econ, 301 W Main St,Box 844000, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.;Stratton, LS (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.;Stratton, LS (通讯作者)，LCC, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",lsstratt@vcu.edu; ndg@econ.au.dk; dare@edu.au.dk; aholm@uwo.ca,"Holm, Anders/JBS-7378-2023; Datta Gupta, Nabanita/JXN-4176-2024","Datta Gupta, Nabanita/0000-0001-7904-445X; Reimer, David/0000-0002-8648-3829",Danish Strategic Research Council [2139-08-0020],Danish Strategic Research Council(Danske Strategiske Forskningsrad (DSF)),"Thanks to Anders Trolle and James Stratton for research assistance and thanks to seminar participants at the 2015 Society of Labor Economists annual meeting, the 2014 EALE Conference in Ljubljana (especially Anders Stenberg), and the College of William & Mary.

Focusing on consumer under-reaction to not-fully-salient sales taxes, we show theoretically that the efficiency costs of taxation are amplified by differences in under-reaction across individuals and across tax rates. To empirically assess the importance of these issues, we implement an online shopping experiment in which 2,998 consumers purchase common household products, facing tax rates that vary in size and salience. We replicate prior findings that, on average, consumers under-react to non-salient sales taxes- consumers in our study react to existing sales taxes as if they were only 25% of their size. However, we find significant individual differences in this under-reaction, and accounting for this heterogeneity increases the efficiency cost of taxation estimates by at least 200%. Tripling existing sales tax rates nearly doubles consumers' attention to taxes, and accounting for this endogeneity increases efficiency cost estimates by 336%. Our results provide new insights into the mechanisms and determinants of boundedly rational processing of not-fully-salient incentives, and our general approach provides a framework for robust behavioural welfare analysis.","[Taubinsky, Dmitry] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Taubinsky, Dmitry; Rees-Jones, Alex] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Rees-Jones, Alex] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Pennsylvania,"Taubinsky, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Taubinsky, D (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,"Taubinsky, Dmitry/0009-0007-6117-7415",Lab for Economic Applications and Policy (LEAP); Pension Research Council/Boettner Center for Pension and Retirement Research; Russell Sage Foundation; Wharton Dean's Research Fund,Lab for Economic Applications and Policy (LEAP); Pension Research Council/Boettner Center for Pension and Retirement Research; Russell Sage Foundation; Wharton Dean's Research Fund,"For helpful comments and suggestions, we thank Hunt Allcott, Eduardo Azevedo, Doug Bernheim, Raj Chetty, Stefano DellaVigna, Sarah Beate Eichmeyer, Emmanuel Farhi, Xavier Gabaix, Jacob Goldin, Tatiana Homonoff, Shachar Kariv, Supreet Kaur, Judd Kessler, David Laibson, Erzo F.P.

Early methods developed to identify these social effects assumed that networks had formed exogenously, and were perfectly observed, both of which are unlikely to hold in practice. A more recent literature, both within economics and in other disciplines, develops methods that relax these assumptions. This paper reviews that literature. It starts by providing a general econometric framework for linear models of social effects, and illustrates how network endogeneity and missing data on the network complicate identification of social effects. Thereafter, it discusses methods for overcoming the problems caused by endogenous formation of networks. Finally, it outlines the stark consequences of missing data on measures of the network, and regression parameters, before describing potential solutions.","[Advani, Arun] Univ Warwick, Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England; [Advani, Arun] CAGE, London, England; [Malde, Bansi] Univ Kent, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Malde, Bansi] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Warwick; University of Kent; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Malde, B (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Canterbury, Kent, England.;Malde, B (通讯作者)，Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England.",b.k.malde@kent.ac.uk,,"Advani, Arun/0000-0002-4131-0609; Malde, Bansi/0000-0003-1323-3383","ESRC-NCRM Node 'Programme Evaluation for Policy Analysis' [ES/I03685X/1]; ESRC [ES/K00123X/1]; ESRC [ES/I02574X/1, ES/K00123X/1, ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: UKRI",ESRC-NCRM Node 'Programme Evaluation for Policy Analysis'(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We are grateful to Imran Rasul for his support and guidance on this project.

A sharp discontinuity in treatment assignment at age 55 identifies the effect of increased reemployment bonuses on unemployment duration and on subsequent job duration. The results indicate that increases in the reemployment bonus boost the job-finding hazards of UI claimants early in their unemployment spells during the bonus qualification period and significantly shorten the duration of UI spells by 0.16 to 0.42 months (0.68 to 1.82 weeks). In addition, employment stability is not significantly affected by an increased bonus, which implies no negative influence of the bonus on subsequent job match quality. The simulated estimates show that the increase in tax revenue and the decrease in UI benefit payment caused by the behavioral response of UI recipients are large enough to offset the increased cost of the reemployment bonus.

So far, however, its rationale rests upon the well-known neoclassical assumptions of complete information and perfect rationality. The present value derives as the result of a calculation that requires the knowledge of the discount rate and the future returns of the evaluated assets. This paper presents a laboratory experiment that demonstrates that the present value of assets can also be discovered by participants of a production process endowed with incomplete information. The knowledge concerning future returns is not given to any one, but dispersed among the participants who, in addition, have no idea of their position in the production chain. In accordance with Hayek's theory of the market process as a discovery procedure, the present value is found without any one subject being able to determine it individually.","[Braun, Eduard] Tech Univ Clausthal, Inst Management & Econ, Julius Albert Str 2, D-38678 Clausthal Zellerfeld, Germany; [Ross, Wiebke] Tech Univ Clausthal, Inst Management & Econ, Julius Albert Str 6, D-38678 Clausthal Zellerfeld, Germany",TU Clausthal; TU Clausthal,"Braun, E (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Clausthal, Inst Management & Econ, Julius Albert Str 2, D-38678 Clausthal Zellerfeld, Germany.",eduard.braun@tu-clausthal.de; wiebke.ross@tu-clausthal.de,,"Braun, Eduard/0000-0002-1752-4287",,,,,18,1,1,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

For the median country in the world, that in the year 2015 had a PPP GDP per capita of around 10000USD, IV estimates predict that a 1 percentage point increase in the Gini coefficient decreases GDP per capita growth over a 5-year period by over 1 percentage point; the long-run effect on the level of GDP per capita is around - 5%.","[Brueckner, Markus] Australian Natl Univ, LF Crisp Bldg, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Lederman, Daniel] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Australian National University; The World Bank,"Brueckner, M (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, LF Crisp Bldg, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",markus.brueckner@anu.edu.au,"Vachadze, George/O-2680-2014",,,,,,26,70,73,3,58,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

To help a risk-neutral trader executing a target volume to minimize the execution cost by benefitting from the setting of a limit order market allowing hidden orders, we propose a multi-stage dynamic programming model to determine the optimal trading strategy involving hidden orders. We consider two settings, where in the first setting the trader uses market and hidden orders, and in the second setting the trader uses limit and hidden orders in intermediate periods and market orders at the final stage. In both settings, we derive analytical solutions to the dynamic programming model under certain assumptions and discuss economic implications of our results.

It is imperative for legitimately and effectively ascertaining responsibilities among countries to study CO2 emissions embodied in the international trade. As the largest exporter and the second largest importer in the world, the large amount of CO2 emissions embodied in China's bilateral trade have a significant impact on China's and global carbon emissions. Based on the single region input-output tables using the non-competitive imports assumption, this study estimated CO2 emissions embodied in China's bilateral trade with 219 countries/regions over the period of 2000-2014, and analyzed the contribution of China's bilateral trade to global carbon emissions under the assumption of non-trade scenario. The results show that, CO2 emissions embodied in China's exports and imports in 2014 were 2561.1 Mt and 1209.9 Mt respectively, and CO2 emissions embodied in exports were higher than those in imports throughout the period. It is indicated that China had produced a large amount of CO2 emissions for other countries through the international trade. And meanwhile, China avoided a large amount of CO2 emissions with the rapid growth of imports. And furthermore, the net CO2 emissions embodied in China's bilateral trade had been declining since 2011. At last, China's bilateral trade had extremely little impact on global carbon emissions. It is concluded that there is a possibility of reducing global carbon emissions based on the results of China's bilateral trade with countries along the routes of Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road.

A planner is in charge of selecting steps and distributing the accumulated aggregate values among a number of agents. We model this process by a directed network, whereby each edge is associated with a vector of individual values. This model applies to several new and existing problems, e.g. developing a connected public facility and distributing total values received by surrounding districts, selecting a long-term production project and sharing final profits among partners of a firm, or choosing a machine schedule to serve different tasks and distributing total benefits among task owners. Herein, we provide the first axiomatic study on path selection and value-sharing in networks. We consider four sets of axioms from different perspectives, including those related to (1) the sequential consistency of value-sharing; (2) the monotonicity of value-sharing with respect to technology improvements; (3) the independence of value-sharing with respect to certain network transformations; and (4) the robust implementation of the efficient path selection when the planner has no information about network configuration. Surprisingly, these four disparate sets of axioms characterize similar classes of solutions, namely selecting an efficient path(s) and assigning to each agent a share of total values that is independent of individual values. Furthermore, we characterize more general solutions that depend on individual values. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

As a result, quantitative easing (QE), in which central banks expand their balance sheet to lower long-term interest rates, may complement policy approaches focused on adjustments in short-term interest rates. Simulation results using a large-scale model (FRB/US) suggest that QE does not improve economic performance if the steady-state interest rate is high, confirming that such policies were not advantageous from 1960 to 2007. However, QE can offset a significant portion of the adverse effects of the ELB when the equilibrium real interest rate is low. These improvements in economic performance exceed those associated with moderate increases in the inflation target. Active QE is primarily required when nominal interest rates are near the ELB, pointing to benefits within the model from QE as a secondary tool while relying on short-term interest rates as the primary tool.","[Kiley, Michael T.] Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Kiley, MT (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC USA.",,"Kiley, Michael T/H-1132-2012","Kiley, Michael/0000-0003-0427-0131",,,,,59,14,16,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

When workers are rationed out of the formal segment of the labor market against their will, i.e., the labor market is segmented, their quality of life is limited, and their wellbeing is reduced. When they can freely choose between a formal or informal employment relationship, i.e., the labor market is integrated, their wellbeing can reach high levels even in the presence of informal employment. We, therefore, test whether the Ukrainian labor market is segmented along the formal-informal divide, slicing the data by gender and age. The analysis that we perform consist in the analysis of short-term and medium-term transitions between five employment states, unemployment and inactivity. We also analyze wage gaps of mean hourly earnings and across the entire hourly earnings distribution, controlling for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity. According to our results segmentation is present for dependent employees: for a large part of informal employees informal employment is used as a waiting stage to enter formal salaried employment and is not voluntarily chosen. As far as self-employment is concerned the evidence is mixed regarding segmentation in the Ukrainian labor market. This heterogeneity in outcomes implies that not all informal work is associated with a low quality of life and reduced wellbeing in post-transition economies.","[Lehmann, Hartmut] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Bologna, Italy; [Pignatti, Norberto] Tbilisi State Univ, Int Sch Econ, Tbilisi, Georgia; [Lehmann, Hartmut; Pignatti, Norberto] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Pignatti, Norberto] Univ Chicago, HCEO, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Lehmann, Hartmut] Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia",University of Bologna; Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Chicago; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Lehmann, H (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Bologna, Italy.;Lehmann, H (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.;Lehmann, H (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia.",hartmut.lehmann@unibo.it,,"Pignatti, Norberto/0000-0002-2807-3178",,,,,29,7,7,1,23,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-5967,1095-7227,,J COMP ECON,J.

One study reported that the Brazilian tax simplification program, SIMPLES, had a large effect on firms' formalization rates. Using the same data set, another study concluded that the program had a limited effect on formalization rates. The aim of this paper is twofold: (a) to provide a thorough discussion of methodological issues that escaped the two previous evaluations of SIMPLES and (b) to suggest two alternative empirical strategies to deal with the identification problems present in the two studies. The main finding of this paper suggests that the program did not affect formalization rates. The large effects of the program on formalization rates found previously were likely confounded by measurement error in the assignment variable and seasonal shocks that affected more intensely the sectors that the reform initially targeted.","[Piza, Caio] World Bank, Dev Impact Evaluat Unit DECIE, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Piza, C (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Impact Evaluat Unit DECIE, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",caiopiza@worldbank.org,,,,,,,15,10,10,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

At the same time, principal component analysis of the residuals of the estimated Taylor rules indicates that the shocks' structure cannot account enough for the monetary policies' co-movements. We interpret these findings as suggestive of common monetary policy patterns.","[Suda, Jacek] Narodowy Bank Polski, Warsaw, Poland; [Zervou, Anastasia S.] Texas A&M Univ, 4228 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Narodowy Bank Polski; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Zervou, AS (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, 4228 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",azervou@tamu.edu,"Zervou, Anastasia/L-7628-2019","Suda, Jacek/0000-0002-8259-533X",,,,,53,0,0,1,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

In empirical, 37 New York commercial banks during 1996: 3Q-2016: 3Q as sample objects (i.e., 2997 observations). The empirical results show that the increases in monopoly power, leverage ratio, and real federal fund rate would reduce the banks' performance as the leading indicator is below its threshold. However, long-run interest rates have a reverse effect. The opposite conclusion holds as the leading indicator is over the threshold. The associated policies to raise the performance are to create competitive environments and construct a dynamic leverage ratio varying with the change of the leading indicator. In addition, resolving the problem of high financing costs, reducing short-run interest rates and increasing long-run interest rates during recessionary periods are also available.

Increases in the size of the exchange network select for higher-fixed-cost exchange institutions, beginning with autarky, through various intermediate stages, and finally to mass monetary exchange. By identifying the relevant fixed costs of money and its institutional substitutes across time, the paper both accounts for the persistence of pre-monetary exchange institutions, despite the inevitability' of monetary exchange that seems to be a feature of traditional models of the origin of money, and illuminates the forces driving the transition from one to another.","[Harwick, Cameron] George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,"Harwick, C (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",charwick@gmu.edu,,"Harwick, Cameron/0000-0003-2703-1627",Institute for Humane Studies,Institute for Humane Studies,"I am indebted to a large number of people for comments and suggestions on this paper, including (but certainly not limited to) Roger Koppl, Jason Potts, Mark Koyama, the participants at the Institutional and Organizational Economics Academy, and three anonymous reviewers.

The retrospective evidence for the euro area suggests that these simple rules might have provided useful information about the policy stance of the ECB.

This paper studies the transmission of shocks in a two-country DSGE model where government bonds are used as collateral in interbank markets. We isolate an interbank collateral channel of transmission, which works through banks portfolio allocation between loans and government bonds, the resulting value of banks bond holdings and the tightness of collateral constraints in the interbank market. We find that, while in some scenarios this channel compounds a bank net worth channel in amplifying negative shocks, in other scenarios the interbank collateral channel can mitigate the effects of shocks.

To model this, we consider a spatial equilibrium model of price formation, where constraints on inter-regional flows result in three distinct equilibria in prices. We use this to motivate an econometric model for the distribution of observed electricity spot prices that captures many of their unique empirical characteristics. The econometric model features supply and inter-regional trade cost functions, which are estimated using Bayesian monotonic regression smoothing methodology. A copula multivariate time series model is employed to capture additional dependence both cross-sectional and serial in regional prices. The marginal distributions are nonparametric, with means given by the regression means. The model has the advantage of preserving the heavy right-hand tail in the predictive densities of price. We fit the model to half-hourly spot price data in the five interconnected regions of the Australian national electricity market. The fitted model is then used to measure how both supply and price shocks in one region are transmitted to the distribution of prices in all regions in subsequent periods. Finally, to validate our econometric model, we show that prices forecast using the proposed model compares favorably with those from some benchmark alternatives. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

It explores how the level of public debt shapes non-cooperative discretionary policies. It evaluates welfare losses for small and large member countries. The paper demonstrates that higher public debt levels hamper business cycle stabilization for the union as a whole and, in particular, penalize the stabilization performance of small country-members. While cooperation and monetary leadership is preferable to fiscal leadership for the union as whole and for the small countries, the big country prefers fiscal leadership, where it explores a larger strategic power vis-a-vis the common monetary policy authority. Political support for cooperation may be hard to achieve. Under low debt levels, cooperative stabilization outcomes are relatively similar to the non-cooperative ones. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Firstly, we construct a nonlinear and monotonous function of eigenvalues such that the function values of the first r largest eigenvalues are close to one and the rest are close to zero when both the number of cross-section units (N) and time series length (T) go to infinity, where r is the real value of the number of common factors. Secondly, we obtain the estimator of the number of common factors by maximizing the difference of function values of two adjacent eigenvalues arranged in descending order. Under some mild conditions, the resulting estimator can be proved to be consistent. Monte Carlo simulation study shows that the new estimator has desired performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Estimating the latter with State-level data for the United States (1980-2010), we find that (i) unemployment persistence increases along quantiles of the conditional unemployment distribution; (ii) disregarding State-fixed effects implies an overestimation of unemployment persistence along unemployment quantiles; (iii) a macroeconomic shock changes not only the location but also the dispersion of the distribution of the State unemployment rates; (iv) a federal policy equally applied in each State can reduce unemployment inequality among States; (v) hysteresis and natural rate hypotheses can co-exist along quantiles of the unemployment distribution, with the former being not rejected at upper quantiles.

While it can be prevented with the appropriate supplement or food fortification, these programs struggle to reach the poorest, out-of-school children, men and the elderly. This paper reports on the impact of a potential strategy to address iron deficiency anemia in rural areas: salt fortified with iron and iodine (DFS). We conduct a large-scale experiment in 400 villages in Bihar to test the impacts of both selling DFS and giving it away for free. At baseline, 45% of the sample is anemic. In 200 randomly assigned villages, we introduce DFS for the first time at half the normal retail price and sell it for roughly 30 months. In 62 of those sales villages, we deliver DFS for free directly to 7 randomly assigned households over nearly 24 months. We find no evidence that either selling DFS or providing it for free has an economically meaningful or statistically significant impact on hemoglobin, anemia, physical health, cognition or mental health. For the sales experiment, we can reject a reduction of 2.4 percent in the fraction anemic in the entire sample and 1 percent among those who were previously anemic. Using an IV strategy, we find a statistically significant, though relatively small, increase in hemoglobin and reduction in the fraction anemic for adolescents, a subgroup that responded well to supplements and fortification in earlier studies. These disappointing results are explained both by modest purchases and low impact of DFS for the majority of the population, even when consumed somewhat regularly.","[Banerjee, Abhijit; Duflo, Esther] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Banerjee, Abhijit; Duflo, Esther] MIT, J PAL, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Barnhardt, Sharon] CESS Nuffield FLAME Univ, Pune, Maharashtra, India",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Barnhardt, S (通讯作者)，CESS Nuffield FLAME Univ, Pune, Maharashtra, India.",barnhardt@post.harvard.edu,,,UK Department for International Development; Initiative for Impact Evaluation; U.S. National Institutes of Health [P01AG005842]; International Food Policy Research Institute; MIT Department of Economics,UK Department for International Development; Initiative for Impact Evaluation; U.S. National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); International Food Policy Research Institute(CGIAR); MIT Department of Economics,"For financial support we thank thank UK Department for International Development, the Initiative for Impact Evaluation, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (P01AG005842), the International Food Policy Research Institute, and the MIT Department of Economics.

We study three situations: in gain two players start with no prize and make sunk bids to win a prize; in loss both the players start with prizes and whoever loses the contest loses their prize; and in mixed only one player starts with a prize that stays with him if he wins, but is transferred to the rival otherwise. Since the differences among the treatments arise only from framing, the expected utility and the standard loss aversion models predict no difference in bids across treatments. We introduce a loss aversion model in which the property rights are made salient, and as a result the reference point varies across treatments. This model predicts average bids in descending order in the loss, the mixed, and the gain treatment; and higher bids by the player with property rights in the mixed treatment. The results from a laboratory experiment broadly support these predictions. There is no significant difference in bids in the loss (gain) treatment and bids by property rights holder (nonholder) in the mixed treatment. A model incorporating both loss aversion and social preferences explains this result.

We present a stylized model in which society is composed of heterogeneous groups and individuals have an homophily bias. The model predicts that: (i) separations, such as the split of a territory into distinct administrative units, occur when the costs of mixed communities are sufficiently large; (ii) the smaller community drives the decision to secede; (iii) welfare gains from the split are associated with positive population growth; (iv) higher payoffs under separations, however, might be related to taste for sameness only, with no (or even negative) effect on economic growth. Empirically, we exploit the secession of the Italian region of Molise from Abruzzo in 1963, a unique event in Italian history. Historical records document that the split was the result of pressures from Molise, the smaller community. Our evidence suggests that the split was associated with population inflows in both areas. Finally, by using a synthetic control approach, we show that the split caused significant benefits to per-capita GDP growth, in both regions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In a New Keynesian model consistent with these empirical properties, optimal policy in general delivers a positive inflation rate in the long run. Two special cases deliver classic outcomes under rational expectations: as the degree of low-frequency variation in beliefs goes to zero, the long-run inflation rate coincides with the inflation bias under optimal discretion; for non-zero low-frequency drift in beliefs, as households become highly patient valuing utility in any period equally, the optimal long-run inflation rate coincides with optimal commitment price stability is optimal. The optimal state-contingent response to cost-push disturbances similarly reflects properties of optimal discretion and optimal commitment, depending on the degree of low-frequency variation in beliefs. When beliefs exhibit substantial variation in response to short-run forecast errors, optimal policy is closer to commitment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Changes in product design lead to demand rotations that set the stage for our analysis. With an exogenous number of firms, we show that the degree of targeted product design tends to increase with the number of firms. Moreover, under reasonable conditions, price-increasing competition takes place, for intermediate levels of the number of firms. This effect is associated with the possibility of lower consumer welfare. With endogenous firm entry, an interesting insight from our analysis is that in some situations an increase in market size or a technological progress that reduces entry costs both might reduce consumers' welfare.

In theory, we demonstrate that the index tracking model with the CVaR constraint is a convex optimization problem. We then derive NPK estimators for tracking errors and CVaR, and thereby construct the NPK index tracking model. Monte Carlo simulations show that the NPK method outperforms the linear programming (LP) method in terms of estimation accuracy. In addition, the NPK method can enhance computational efficiency when the sample size is large. Empirical tests show that the NPK method can effectively control downside risk and obtain higher excess returns, in both bearish and bullish market environments. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Analysis of the various open or more muted controversies that underlie the history of the index throughout the twentieth century and into the first decades of the twenty-first century shows that the various challenges to the index have always been and continue to be linked, albeit to varying extents, to issues around economic distribution and representations of wealth. However, the actors engaged in these controversies and the principles around which they are organised have changed: politics, which brought into play the various social relations between government, statistical agencies and trade unions, has gradually given way to more scientific considerations, which has meant that the more recent controversies have been more technical in nature. And by giving experts a greater role to play, these controversies have also tended to play out at an even greater distance from the traditional actors.","[Jany-Catrice, Florence] Univ Lille, CLERSE, Villeneuve Dascq, France",Universite de Lille,"Jany-Catrice, F (通讯作者)，Univ Lille, CLERSE, Econ, F-59650 Villeneuve Dascq, France.",Florence.jany-catrice@univ-lille1.fr,,,,,,,61,5,5,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

It is apparent that one of these vectors reflects the relationship between income velocity and macroeconomic variables, while the other reflects the relationship between income velocity and institutional variables.

Against the background of debates around the 'Easterlin paradox', this paper seeks a compromise between two positions: one that insists on individual relative income, and one that finds similarity between individual and aggregate levels. Proposing a model which puts the emphasis on the interaction between individual and aggregate-level factors, it argues that the effect of relative income on SWB varies across countries as a function of average income, in addition to a relatively small direct effect of the latter, in partial agreement with the two major positions. The model is tested cross-sectionally on the data from the latest wave of World Values Survey. The results from hierarchical mixed-effect models confirm the main argument. But further examination reveals that there is still unaccounted variation especially in middle-income economies.","[Yasar, Rusen] Univ Konstanz, Constance, Germany",University of Konstanz,"Yasar, R (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Constance, Germany.",rusen.yasar@uni-konstanz.de,,"Yasar, Rusen/0000-0003-2014-5285",,,,,54,4,4,1,22,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,JUN 29,2018,12.0,,,,,,,,201843,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2018-43,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GL5RK,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000437226600001,0

In particular, the authors consider such conditions where the financial markets are imperfect and suffer from various frictions that the commercial bank cannot readily modulate their liquidity and capital buffers, especially at an aggregate level or within a short period. Meanwhile, as a result of maturity mismatch and fundamental uncertainty, the credit and money creation activities inevitably add to the liquidity and insolvency risks faced by the bank. Under the assumptions that the levels of bank reserves, capital and government bonds are exogenously given, and that the concerned prudential regulations are always binding, the authors examine the determinants of the broad money aggregate and the money multiplier. Specifically, they find that 1) the money multiplier under Basel III is not constant but a decreasing function of the monetary base; 2) the determinants of the bank's money creation capacity are regulation specific; 3) when multiple regulations are imposed simultaneously, the effective binding regulation and the corresponding money multiplier will vary across different economic states and bank balance sheet conditions.","[Xiong, Wanting; Wang, Yougui] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University,"Wang, YG (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",ygwang@bnu.edu.cn,"Xiong, Wan-Ting/GQR-1764-2022",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [61773069]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2015KJJCA06],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61773069) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. 2015KJJCA06).

Rather than selecting rules based on their econometric fit, we apply info-gap theory to rank the rules according to a different criterion: the trade-off between robustness to uncertainty and performance. We find that in the euro area a standard Taylor rule, based on a traditional and well understood macroeconomic model, outperforms more complicated rules that include a credit spread or a debt-to-GDP ratio.

After removing influential observations, the system-GMM estimates suggest a positive link between an undervalued RER and growth in non-industrial countries, particularly in those with upper-middle and high income levels. In turn, RER volatility is found harmful for growth. These results holds when testing for asymmetric effects of RER misalignment: a real undervaluation boosts growth in non-industrial countries, while overvaluation seems to have no effects at any income level. Besides, the magnitude of the misalignment is also relevant: an undervalued RER of about 26% on average has a positive impact on growth.","[Bermudez, Cecilia; Dabus, Carlos] Univ Nacl Sur, IIESS, CONICET, Calle San Andres S-N,Campus Palihue, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Bermudez, Cecilia; Dabus, Carlos] Univ Nacl Sur, Dept Econ, Calle San Andres S-N,Campus Palihue, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); National University of the South; National University of the South,"Bermúdez, C (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Sur, IIESS, CONICET, Calle San Andres S-N,Campus Palihue, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina.;Bermúdez, C (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Sur, Dept Econ, Calle San Andres S-N,Campus Palihue, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina.",cbermudez@uns.edu.ar; cdabus@criba.edu.ar,"BERMUDEZ, CECILIA/R-6963-2019","Dabus, Carlos/0000-0002-7558-8385",,,,,30,3,3,0,4,UNIV CHILE DEPT ECONOMICS,SANTIAGO,"DIAGONAL PARAGUAY 257, REGISTRO PROPIEDAD INTELECTUAL 112.761, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0718-5286,,,ESTUD ECONOMIA,Estud.

The aim of this research is to explore the effects of knowledge, cooperation and innovation on their internationalisation strategy. The study used a quantitative approach, based on a sample extracted from the Survey of the Scientific and Technological Potential, with KIBS activity in 2014/2015. Upon the completion of data collection, systematisation of data was done through factor analysis and multiple linear regression that allowed conclusions to be drawn about the objectives proposed. On the one hand, our results show that knowledge personalisation has a positive influence on proactive strategies of internationalisation, such as external innovation and new organisation methods. When KIBS cooperate with clients, a positive impact on reactive and cost strategies of the internationalisation can be verified. On the other hand, reactive and cost strategies of internationalisation are negatively influenced by knowledge personalisation, knowledge sharing and internal innovation. This study contributes (1) to increase academic knowledge about this subject, (2) to the management practice, allowing firms to gain insights that may develop their proactive strategies of internationalisation and (3) to reinforce the need for adjustment of public policies to encourage the development and strengthening of proactivity of this sector with regard to internationalisation.","[Braga, Alexandra] Polytech Porto, Sch Technol & Management, Rua Curral, P-4610156 Margaride, Felgueiras, Portugal; [Braga, Alexandra] CIICESI, Rua Curral, P-4610156 Margaride, Felgueiras, Portugal; [Braga, Alexandra] Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro, CETRAD Res Unit, P-5000801 Quinta De Prados, Vila Real, Portugal; [Serrasqueiro, Zelia] Univ Beira Interior, Estr Sineiro, P-6200208 Covilha, Portugal; [Serrasqueiro, Zelia] Univ Evora, CEFAGE Res Unit, Largo Marques de Marialva 8, P-7000809 Evora, Portugal",Instituto Politecnico do Porto; Instituto Politecnico do Porto; University of Tras-os-Montes & Alto Douro; Universidade da Beira Interior; University of Evora,"Braga, A (通讯作者)，Polytech Porto, Sch Technol & Management, Rua Curral, P-4610156 Margaride, Felgueiras, Portugal.;Braga, A (通讯作者)，CIICESI, Rua Curral, P-4610156 Margaride, Felgueiras, Portugal.;Braga, A (通讯作者)，Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro, CETRAD Res Unit, P-5000801 Quinta De Prados, Vila Real, Portugal.",abraga@estgf.ipp.pt; smarques@utd.pt; zelia@ubi.pt,"Serrasqueiro, Zélia/J-5662-2014; Braga, Alexandra M/B-9292-2018; Marques, Carla/U-2410-2018","Serrasqueiro, Zélia/0000-0003-1761-5426; Braga, Alexandra M/0000-0001-7548-9785; Marques, Carla/0000-0003-1557-1319","FEDER component of the European Structural and Investment Funds, through the Operational Competitiveness and Internationalisation Programme's (COMPETE) [006971 (UID/SOC/04011)]; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology's (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia) [UID/SOC/04011/2013]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [UID/SOC/04011/2013] Funding Source: FCT","FEDER component of the European Structural and Investment Funds, through the Operational Competitiveness and Internationalisation Programme's (COMPETE); Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology's (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","This research is supported by the FEDER component of the European Structural and Investment Funds, through the Operational Competitiveness and Internationalisation Programme's (COMPETE 2020) Project No. 006971 (UID/SOC/04011) and the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology's (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia) UID/SOC/04011/2013 Project.

Analysis of the system of nonlinear difference equations characterizing price dynamics in the underlying model reveal complex, quasi-cyclical price fluctuations around the unique equilibrium state. We show that time-delays arising from the unequal lengths of upstream and downstream production cycles have profound effects on price dynamics. From a policy perspective, we find that improvements in downstream production technology and declines in consumers' sensitivity to prices lead to chaotic price fluctuations. Simulations under reasonable model calibrations reproduce the stylized features of actual prices, including quasi-cyclical fluctuations, positive first-order autocorrelation and fat-tailed distributions. In doing so, we address a major criticism of the theory of endogenous price fluctuations: the failure of chaotic cobweb models to replicate positively autocorrelated prices.","[Chaudhry, Muhammad Imran] Karachi Sch Business & Leadership, Karachi, Pakistan; [Chaudhry, Muhammad Imran; Miranda, Mario J.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Miranda, MJ (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",chaudhry.33@osu.edu; miranda.4@osu.edu,"Chaudhry, Muhammad/AAX-1374-2021; Miranda, Mario Javier/D-8632-2012","Chaudhry, Muhammad Imran/0000-0002-1855-3557",,,,,45,8,8,1,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

In the absence of an appropriate legal framework, the original innovator's equilibrium exclusivity contracts block subsequent efficient entry even if there is (leader-follower) competition in the contracting phase. However, the legal framework may maximize social welfare by imposing a ban on upfront lump-sum payments in exclusivity contracts (by all suppliers) combined with an outright ban on exclusivity contracts by the derivative innovator. The former ban precludes the exclusion of socially beneficial derivative innovation by causing the incumbent supplier to resort to accommodation, rather than to pure exclusion, strategies. The latter ban complements the former by preventing inefficient or excessive derivative innovation.","[Choi, Jay Pil] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, 110 Marshall Adams Hall, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Choi, Jay Pil] Hitotsubashi Univ, Hitotsubashi Inst Adv Study, 2-1 Naka Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868601, Japan; [Stefanadis, Christodoulos] Univ Piraeus, Dept Banking & Financial Management, 80 Karaoli & Dimitriou, Piraeus 18534, Greece",Michigan State University; Hitotsubashi University; University of Piraeus,"Stefanadis, C (通讯作者)，Univ Piraeus, Dept Banking & Financial Management, 80 Karaoli & Dimitriou, Piraeus 18534, Greece.",cstefana@unipi.gr,"Stefanadis, Christodoulos/AAA-4102-2020; Stefanadis, Christodoulos/ABH-2232-2020","Stefanadis, Christodoulos/0000-0001-5974-6454",,,,,40,5,5,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

We consider both serious and minor crimes as classified by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, consider differential effects by the youth's gender and age, investigate the extent to which effects were stronger in states with more stringent work incentive policies and larger welfare caseload declines, and use a number of different model specifications to assess robustness and patterns. We find that welfare reform led to reduced arrests for minor crimes among youth ages 15-17 years by 9-11%, with similar estimates for males and females, but that it did not affect youth arrests for serious crimes. The results from this study add to a scant knowledge base about the effects of maternal employment on adolescent behavior by exploiting a large-scale social experiment that greatly increased employment of low-skilled women.

The results are robust to controlling for other institutional arrangements and endogeneity.","[Lambert, Thomas] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; CEPR, Washington, DC USA; Univ Cote dAzur, SKEMA Business Sch, Nice, France",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; KU Leuven; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Universite Cote d'Azur; SKEMA Business School,"Lambert, T (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",t.lambert@rsm.nl,"Lambert, Thomas/I-8320-2015","Lambert, Thomas/0000-0002-6517-6598; Degryse, Hans/0000-0002-0130-057X",FWO-Flanders [G.0719.13],FWO-Flanders(FWO),"We are grateful to two anonymous referees, Senay Agca, Albert Banal-Estanol, Marco Becht, Thorsten Beck, Paul Belleflamme, Helen Bollaert, Fabio Braggion, Martin Brown, Micael Castanheira, Martin Cripps (the editor), Peter Cziraki, Narly Dwarkasing, Philip Fliers, Steve Haber, Iftekhar Hasan, Tarek Hassan, Sean Hundtofte, Filippo Ippolito, Abe de Jong, Ross Levine, Alessandro Lizzeri, Humberto Llavador, Ron Masulis, Raoul Minetti, Kris Mitchener, Steven Ongena, Kim Oosterlinck, Enrico Perotti, Thomas Piketty, Marco da Rin, Richard Roll, Henri Servaes, Ernst-Ludwig von Thadden, John Turner, Harald Uhlig, Paolo Volpin, Burcin Yurtoglu, and Alberto Zazzaro for many helpful comments and discussions.

Subjects were ranked either relative to the performance of many subjects in the past or relative to three subjects working alongside themselves. Results indicate that the response from subjects in the former varies with how they perceived their own ability to solve the task. Those reporting low ability reduce their performance when provided with the feedback, whereas those reporting high ability improve. For subjects who were ranked relative to others working alongside themselves, no one respond negatively, but only those reporting high ability improve their performance. An important implication from this, especially for managers who design feedback policies in organizations, is that the way relative feedback is designed may lead to different behavioral reactions. In particular, the choice of benchmark used to relatively rank employees may result in responses that are not beneficial and lead to inefficient use of resources.","[Gjedrem, William Gilje] Univ Stavanger, UiS Business Sch, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway",Universitetet i Stavanger,"Gjedrem, WG (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, UiS Business Sch, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway.",william.g.gjedrem@uis.no,,,Norwegian Research Council [227004],Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),"I am grateful to Kristoffer W.

At the core of the model are endogenous timing, irreversible actions and private valuations. We find that strategic complementarity strongly determines follower behavior. Once a subject decides to abandon the status quo the probability that other players jump on the bandwagon increases sharply. However, there is a reluctance to lead when leading is a conditional best response. We explain this deviation from the neo-classical equilibrium by injecting some noise in the equilibrium concept.

Achieving innovation goals decreases CO2 emissions in all models, regardless of natural gas price, due to increased energy efficiency and low-carbon generation becoming more cost competitive. For the models that include domestic natural gas markets, achieving innovation goals lowers wholesale electricity prices, but this effect diminishes as projected natural gas prices increase. Higher natural gas prices lead to higher wholesale electricity prices but fewer coal capacity retirements. A CO2 electric power sector emissions cap influences electric sector evolution under reference technology assumptions but has little to no incremental influence when added to innovation goals. Long-term, meeting innovation goals achieves a generation mix with similar CO2 emissions compared to the CO2 policy but with smaller increases to wholesale electricity prices. In the short-term, the relative effect on wholesale prices differs by model. Finally, higher natural gas prices, achieving innovation goals, and the combination of the two, increases the amount of renewable generation that is cost-effective to build and operate while slowing the growth of natural-gas fired generation, which is the predominant generation type in 2050 under reference conditions.

Our simulations indicate that in 2011, had the share of trade by the sourcing economy remained at the level of 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2008 whereas the global final demand remained the same, global CO2 emissions in production processes would have been 2.8 Gt, 2.0 Gt, 13 Gt, and 540 Mt., respectively, lower than the actual emissions. As there is a general outsourcing trend shifted from developed economies to developing economies, the overall direct emission costs have always been significantly positive. Further investigations by economy and industry show that such a geographic shift was mainly dominated by developed economies themselves and occurred in high-tech industries, such as production of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) goods and machinery, leading to positive emission cost in developing economies, especially China. Moreover, there is potentially even larger influence of geographic shift of sourcing on global CO2 emissions, as such a shift would stimulate the economic growth and consumptions in developing economies, consequently this may bring additional energy demand and CO2 emissions. Our results addressed the urgency of eliminating in carbon emission intensity gap between developing and developed economies and the successful development of new, scalable low carbon energy sourcing and technologies across the world.

Against this backdrop, present study investigates the principal determinants of TFP convergence by employing data of 91 developing countries over the period 1960-2015 and with USA being the frontier country. In concordance with the existing literature, main focus remains on technology diffusion for the catch-up process and is measured by means of trade openness (TO) and foreign direct investment (FDI) with introduction of their interaction terms. However, TFP is computed by incorporating the Growth Accounting Model while empirical results are drawn from the 2-step GMM estimation technique. It is surfaced that though high degree of openness benefits TFP growth and convergence but FDI has a dominating role. Therefore, governments can play a competent role via unflagging efforts in ensuring that the right kind of policies are enacted, promoting trading activities and FDI flows.","[Maryam, Khoula; Jehan, Zainab] Fatima Jinnah Women Univ, Dept Econ, Rawalpindi, Pakistan",,"Jehan, Z (通讯作者)，Fatima Jinnah Women Univ, Dept Econ, Rawalpindi, Pakistan.",zainabjehan.fjwu@gmail.com,,,,,,,88,15,17,2,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

While many cross-sectional studies examine correlates of stunting, they largely cannot identify drivers of change in stunting. We use two waves of panel data from Ethiopia and incrementally larger sets of fixed effects to control for time-variant observable characteristics and time-invariant unobservable characteristics. After controlling for these potential confounders, our analysis reveals that many factors that are associated with stunting in the cross-section do not impact stunting dynamics. We also estimate individual fixed-effects regressions, separately, according to baseline stunting status. We find evidence suggesting that while improved societal conditions drive many children out of a stunted state, certain exogenous factors may lead previously healthy children to become stunted. Overall, policymakers and practitioners would be wise to consult research utilising both cross-sectional and panel data analyses in order to more effectively target already stunted children as well as vulnerable children who may be at risk of becoming stunted.","[Seff, Ilana] Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Populat & Family Hlth, 722 West 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Baird, Sarah] George Washington Univ, Milken Inst Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Global Hlth, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Jolliffe, Dean] World Bank, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Jolliffe, Dean] Inst Study Lab IZA, Bonn, Germany",Columbia University; George Washington University; The World Bank; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Seff, I (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Populat & Family Hlth, 722 West 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA.",ijs2120@cumc.columbia.edu,,"Seff, Ilana/0000-0002-2569-995X",UK Department for International Development Ethiopia,UK Department for International Development Ethiopia,"World Bank, Development Data Group and the Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA), Bonn.

To do this, subjects with heterogeneous working memory capacity (WMC) were placed in a double auction environment to compete against artificial traders. We considered two treatments which differ in the artificial traders. The artificial traders are truth-telling in the first treatment, but demonstrate adaptive trading behavior in the second one. Our results show that working memory capacity has a significantly positive effect on subjects' market performance, and the performance gap caused by cognitive ability, while narrowing over time, remains significant by the end of experiment. We find that differences in subjects' performance resulted from their behavior: high-WMC subjects were better at exploiting extra profit opportunities and avoiding unprofitable transactions, and they tended to underbid more than those with lower WMC. Among the five constituent abilities of WMC, we find that it is distinctive abilities which contribute to the overall significance in these two treatments. For the treatment involving truth-telling traders, the relevant factor is the ability of simultaneous processing and storing information; whereas, for the treatment involving adaptive traders, the only one that matters is subjects' ability to coordinate elements into structures.

Focusing on group identity primes, this methodological note considers the conditions under which researchers are able to identify causes and explain differences in behavior or preferences between groups. Main concern is that group identity priming (or other approaches to strengthening causal inference in such experiments) are not a panacea and that a persistent omitted variables problem continues to hamper identification of specific causes of group differences in preferences. This note develops a framework for thinking systematically about the treatment effects of priming individuals' group identity and possible approaches to clean identification of specific group-level traits explaining differences in preferences between groups. Unpacking observed effects of group membership on preferences and identifying specific causes of group differences is paramount from the perspective of policy implications and I clarify the framework's usefulness using concrete examples.","[van Hoorn, Andre] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, POB 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands; [van Hoorn, Andre] Heyendaalseweg 141,Elinor Ostrom Bldg EOS2-611, NL-6525 AJ Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen,"van Hoorn, A (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, POB 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands.;van Hoorn, A (通讯作者)，Heyendaalseweg 141,Elinor Ostrom Bldg EOS2-611, NL-6525 AJ Nijmegen, Netherlands.",A.van.Hoorn@fm.ru.nl,,"van Hoorn, Andre/0000-0001-8443-3169",,,,,37,3,3,1,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

The framework is evaluated with a longitudinal case study of a wiki in a software development company where an assessment of the business value of the wiki at two different points in time was made.

Screening eliminates trade failures that are otherwise common in the presence of adverse selection, but the downside of the bargaining institution is the cost associated with repeated offers and time frictions. This article reports an experimental test of these predictions. We find that rates of trade are substantially higher in the bargaining institution than in control treatments in which we remove the possibility to make repeated offers (take-it-or-leave-it offer) or the time frictions. However, we also observe a persistent overdelay before agreements are reached, that is, bargaining takes longer than theoretically predicted. This lowers efficiency below its predicted level and below the level observed in the take-it-or-leave-it offer institution. We identify possible channels for overdelay in the form of fairness preferences and loss aversion, concluding that there are important behavioral deviations from the standard model that are detrimental to the efficiency of bargaining under incomplete information.","[Bochet, Olivier] New York Univ Abu Dhabi, Div Social Sci, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; Univ Texas Dallas, Naveen Jindal Sch Management, Richardson, TX 75083 USA",New York University Abu Dhabi; University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas,"Bochet, O (通讯作者)，New York Univ Abu Dhabi, Div Social Sci, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.",olivier.bochet@nyu.edu,"Siegenthaler, Simon/AAT-7769-2020","Siegenthaler, Simon/0000-0002-9301-8087",SNF [100018-143757],SNF,"We are indebted to Nikos Nikiforakis for his helpful comments and suggestions on an earlier draft of this article.

More specifically, we investigate whether rental apartment buildings are less energy efficient than cooperative apartment buildings and whether public ownership has a negative impact on energy efficiency. A conceptual framework is presented to illustrate that such differences could be explained by the split incentives problem and deviations from profit maximizing interests. The empirical analysis is based on a unique dataset that combines data from energy performance certificates with ownership data on residential units. The results indicate that cooperative apartment buildings are significantly more energy efficient than buildings with rental apartments. The results also indicate that publicly owned buildings have somewhat lower energy performance than privately owned ones. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The positive impact of OFDI on provincial economic growth may be the result of reverse knowledge spillovers from OFDI to the home provincial economy through demonstration and imitation, labor movement, and backward and forward industrial linkages, thus increasing the productivity and the efficiency of home firms and promoting the growth of the home economy.","[Chen, Chunlai] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Chen, CL (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",chunlai.chen@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,47,42,44,5,111,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAY-JUN,2018,26.0,3,,,,,1,21,,10.1111/cwe.12240,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GF5AL,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431976700001,0

Our data show that both employment preference and wage offers favor in-group members. Workers positively reciprocate towards in-group employers by choosing higher effort in a gift-exchange game. Thus, favoritism can be privately rational for employers. However, unemployed subjects are allowed to burn resources (at a cost to themselves), and we document significantly increased resource destruction when unemployment can be attributed to favoritism towards others. This highlights a significant spillover and often ignored cost of favoritism, and it points to one possible micro foundation of some antisocial behavior. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The paper attempts to account for any structural breaks and nonlinearity in this relationship. The results reveal that the effect of changes in the international price of oil on stock returns differs substantially across industries. The stock returns of the coal, chemical, mining and oil industries are found to be positively affected by crude oil price movements. Conversely, electronics, food manufacturing, general equipment, pharmaceuticals, retail, rubber and vehicle industries are found to be negatively affected by movements in the price of crude oil. The results of the estimations also suggest that the majority of Chinese industries have been significantly affected by oil prices since 2004. The influence of international oil prices on Chinese stocks also has a stronger effect in the presence of high volatility but the effect varies across industries.","[Fang, Sheng] Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Lu, Xinsheng] Univ Jinan, Business Sch, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Egan, Paul G.] Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland",Tongji University; University of Jinan; University of St Andrews,"Lu, XS (通讯作者)，Univ Jinan, Business Sch, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China.",fangsheng007@126.com; normanxlu@tongji.edu.cn; pge4@st-andrews.ac.uk,,"Egan, Paul/0000-0001-9616-3987",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71173088],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The authors acknowledge the financial support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71173088).,,22,2,2,3,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAY-JUN,2018,26.0,3,,,,,43,62,,10.1111/cwe.12242,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GF5AL,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431976700003,0

When applied to U.S. data, the estimates from the best performing VAR models indicate, on average, that credit supply shocks that raise spreads by 10 basis points reduce GDP growth and inflation by 1% after one year.

Motivated by anecdotal and survey evidence suggesting that present bias plays a role in intra-household decision making, we propose a model in which hyperbolic discounting couples engage in home production activities, thereby accumulating family-specific capital over time. At any given point in time, the gains to continued marriage depend on the accumulated stock of this capital and a temporary random shock to match quality. Couples whose match quality deteriorates may choose to divorce, and this is more likely to happen if past investments in family-specific capital have been low. We obtain three main sets of results. First, present-biased preferences induce couples to underinvest in family-specific capital and to overdivorce. Second, sophisticated couples but not naive ones may choose to enter marriage on terms which make divorce more costly to obtain. Third, the inefficiencies in the behavior of time inconsistent couples can be completely undone by means of earnings and divorce taxes that vary over the marital life-cycle. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This paper formalizes the broader policy implications of this approach in general equilibrium by characterizing jointly optimal environmental and fiscal policies in a climate-economy model with differential planner-household discounting. First, I show that decentralizing the optimal allocation requires not only high carbon prices but also fundamental changes to tax policy: If the government discounts the future less than households, implementing the optimal allocation requires an effective capital income subsidy (a negative intertemporal wedge), and, in a setting with distortionary taxation, an effective labor-consumption tax wedge that is decreasing over time. Second, if the government cannot subsidize capital income, the constrained-optimal carbon tax may be up to 50% below the present value of marginal damages (the social cost of carbon) due to the general equilibrium effects of climate policy on household savings. Third, given the choice to optimize either carbon, capital, or labor income taxes, the socially discounting planner's welfare ranking is ambiguous over a standard range of parameters. Overall, in general equilibrium, a policy-maker's choice to adopt differential social discounting may thus overturn conventional recommendations for both environmental and fiscal policy.","[Barrage, Lint] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Barrage, Lint] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Brown University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Barrage, L (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA.;Barrage, L (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",lint_barrage@brown.edu,,,,,,,58,17,17,3,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0047-2727,,,J PUBLIC ECON,J.

Resulting allocations can be inefficient if agents do not internalize the consequences of their choice on others. To test this formally, we study how other-regarding behaviors vary across two decision contexts: when subjects make a pure allocation decision; and when they select a partner. In both settings each subject's decision is final and it affects their payoff and that of other subjects in the same way. We find that subjects are more likely to sacrifice their own material well-being to increase that of others when dividing a pie than when selecting a partner in a large anonymous settingeven though the consequences on the material payoffs of others are identical. These findings suggest that in assignment processes with unilateral selection, efficiency can be improved by presenting the selection process as a choice between outcomes involving multiple individuals, instead of simply selecting a match for themselves.","[Belot, Michele] European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, Via Fontanelle 18, I-50014 Fiesole, Italy; [Fafchamps, Marcel] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Encina Hall,616 Serra St, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",European University Institute; Stanford University,"Belot, M (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, Via Fontanelle 18, I-50014 Fiesole, Italy.",michele.belot@eui.eu; fafchamp@stanford.edu,,,University of Oxford,University of Oxford,"The authors are grateful to the audiences of the IZA Conference on Network Economics in Bonn in June 2013, the Workshop on Social Norms and Preferences in Lyon in October 2015, and the American Social Science Association Conference held in Chicago in January 2017.

Our results indicate that only the manufacturing sector seems to robustly decrease poverty. Growth in the service sector emerges as a meaningful predictor of a rising middle class. Allowing for regional differences, we find substantial variation across the 25 Peruvian states with large shifts in magnitudes, signs, and statistical importance. Beyond the immediate implications for Peru, these findings highlight the importance of analyzing the link between economic performance and poverty rates on a subnational level.

The threshold level of the inflation rate is found to be lower when tax rates are higher. The presence of the credit-channel effect also provides the rationale for setting positive (and smaller than 1) tax rates on consumption, labor income, and capital income. The optimal tax rates rise as the inflation target declines. Under a fiscal policy rule where labor and capital income taxes move proportionally to each other, the optimal capital income tax rate could be higher than the optimal labor income tax rate. Under a sufficiently large central bank balance sheet, the credit-channel effect will be so weak that inflation and all kinds of taxes are growth and welfare repressing. This provides a rationale for central banks that have implemented quantitative easing policies to shrink their balance sheets.

Earlier TTIP studies analyze welfare effects in a framework where output and welfare coincide. We believe that the utility function of households, which depends on consumption and employment, is the best criterion for assessing TTIP. We measure the welfare effect of TTIP as the percentage of consumption that households would be willing to pay for TTIP in order to remain as well off with it as without it. The welfare effects of TTIP, which eliminates tariffs and cuts non-tariff measures, are always positive for the US and the EU. The reason is that the welfare gain of higher consumption more than offsets the welfare loss of a change in employment. The policy implication is that the US and the EU should continue the negotiations for the TTIP agreement.","[Engler, Philipp] DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10629 Berlin, Germany; [Tervala, Juha] Univ Helsinki, Dept Polit & Econ Studies, POB 17, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; University of Helsinki,"Engler, P (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10629 Berlin, Germany.",pengler@diw.de; juha.tervala@helsinki.fi,"Tervala, Juha/AAO-2519-2020","Tervala, Juha/0000-0001-8176-5715",,,,,41,2,2,0,23,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

In contrast to theories that rely on the increased influence of financial speculators, we examine the effect of interest rates on the volatility and correlation of commodity prices via a panel GARCH model. In theory, lower interest rates decrease the volatility of prices, as lower inventory costs promote the smoothing of transient shocks, and increase price correlation if common shocks are more persistent than idiosyncratic shocks. Empirically, we find that price volatility attributable to transitory shocks declines with interest rates, whereas particularly for metals prices, price correlation increases as interest rates decline.","[Gruber, Joseph W.; Vigfusson, Robert J.] Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA,"Vigfusson, RJ (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",robert.vigfusson@frb.gov,,,,,,,20,10,10,0,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

When the leaders are selected randomly, we find that homogeneous groups tend to out-perform heterogeneous groups. This is due to lower performance of the out-group leader and not to differences in cooperation. This effect disappears when high-performance leaders are selected.

This surplus ranges from 18% to 12% of agricultural labour between 2001 and 2013. Our results reveal that China was relatively successful in reducing redundant labour in rice production.

Our results reveal that tariff evasion is prevalent in 7 of the 12 East Asian countries studied, particularly in non-high-income importers. Specifically, the tariff evasion of parts and components increases by 1.10%-1.55% compared with that of final products (0.55%-0.96%), with a one-percentage-point increase in the tariff rate. Moreover, the responsiveness of the unit price gap to the tariff level is greater for parts and components than for final products. Finally, we investigate the nonlinear issue and tariff evasion of the misclassification of imported products and obtain robust results. Our findings provide relevant economic implications for policy makers regarding the severity of tariff evasion because machinery production networks are crucial factors driving intra-regional trade in East Asia.","[Lin, Chin-Ho] Keio Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Minato Ku, 2-15-45 Mita, Tokyo 1088345, Japan",Keio University,"Lin, CH (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Minato Ku, 2-15-45 Mita, Tokyo 1088345, Japan.",chinho0929@gmail.com,,,,,,,34,3,3,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

TFP growth based on data envelopment analysis shows higher productivity for the service sector as compared to the manufacturing sector. Further, decomposition of TFP growth results indicates that both the manufacturing and services sectors are driven mainly by technical change. Comparing TFP growth at the sub-sectoral level shows that mean TFP growth is highest in the case of IT firms as compared to the chemical, textile and trade industries. Further, the determinants of TFP growth using a feasible generalised least squares model indicate that capital intensity, capital turnover ratio and debt significantly affect productivity growth in the case of manufacturing. However, none of the determinants except capital intensity affect productivity growth in the services sector. From a policy standpoint, this paper suggests greater emphasis on both the service and manufacturing sectors despite some variability among firms.","[Rath, Badri Narayan] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Liberal Arts, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Hyderabad,"Rath, BN (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol, Dept Liberal Arts, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India.",badri@iith.ac.in,"Rath, Badri Narayan/Y-6505-2019","Rath, Badri Narayan/0000-0002-6842-4278","ICSSR, Government of India; ICSSR; MHRD, Government of India","ICSSR, Government of India; ICSSR; MHRD, Government of India(Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government of India)","The author gratefully acknowledges the suggestions of Professor Russell Smyth, Professor Paresh Kumar Narayan and other participants of Economic Modelling Special Issue Conference, Melbourne, June 2017.

Secondly, non-constrained firms also expand their investment in technology because of increased competition, a pro-competitive effect.

Despite this, the long-standing consensus is that police response time has no meaningful effect on the likelihood of catching offenders. We revisit this question using a uniquely rich dataset from the Greater Manchester Police. To identify causal effects, we use a novel strategy that exploits discontinuities in distance to the response station across locations next to each other, but on different sides of division boundaries. Contrary to previous evidence, we find large and strongly significant effects: in our preferred estimate, a 10% increase in response time leads to a 4.7 percentage points decrease in the likelihood of clearing the crime. We find stronger effects for thefts than for violent offences, although the effects are large for every type of crime. We find suggestive evidence in support of two mechanisms: the likelihood of an immediate arrest and the likelihood that a suspect will be named by a victim or witness both increase as response time becomes faster. We argue that, under conservative assumptions, hiring an additional response officer would generate a benefit, in terms of future crime prevented, equivalent to 170% of her payroll cost.","[Vidal, Jordi Blanes I.; Kirchmaier, Tom] London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, London, England; [Vidal, Jordi Blanes I.] London Sch Econ, CEPR, London, England; [Kirchmaier, Tom] London Sch Econ, Copenhagen Business Sch, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Vidal, JBI (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, London, England.;Vidal, JBI (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, CEPR, London, England.",,,"Kirchmaier, Thomas/0000-0002-8938-2206",ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,76,37,41,2,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

We use the 2010/11 South African Income and Expenditure Survey as it contains exclusive goods, i.e., goods consumed by specific household members, to be used for identification. We rely on a consumption model that accounts for (potentially unequal) resource sharing and jointness in consumption (generating economies of scale). Results indicate that men tend to receive more than women (even if imprecise estimates make the difference statistically insignificant), leading to sharp gender differences in terms of poverty. Ignoring economies of scale leads to an overestimation of poverty among adult men and women living with others. Children's resource shares are in line with international standards but household resources are relatively low among African families so that ignoring intrahousehold allocation leads to an underestimation of child poverty.","[Bargain, Olivier] Univ Bordeaux, Fac Law Polit Sci Econ & Management, 16 Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France; [Kwenda, Prudence] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, POB 3, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Ntuli, Miracle] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, Inst Labor Econ IZA, POB 3, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa",Universite de Bordeaux; University of Witwatersrand; University of Witwatersrand,"Bargain, O (通讯作者)，Univ Bordeaux, Fac Law Polit Sci Econ & Management, 16 Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France.",olivier.bargain@univ-amu.fr,"Bargain, Olivier/A-5972-2019","Benhura, Miracle/0000-0002-0689-5744",,,,,52,2,3,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

In evaluating the proposals, the organization relies on the agents applying for funding to produce evidence about the merits of their own proposals. When the organization can fund all proposals, each agent engages in an independent game of Bayesian persuasion with the organization, choosing information strategies that maximize the probability of producing evidence in favor of funding. When the organization has limited capacity to implement proposals, the game becomes one of competitive Bayesian persuasion. Producing favorable evidence is not enough to secure funding; an agent must also produce more-favorable evidence than the other agent. We show that an organization's limited capacity leads agents to produce more (Blackwell) informative evidence than they do when the organization is unconstrained. We fully characterize the unique equilibrium under unlimited and limited capacity, and show that unless the prior strongly favors accepting both proposals, the funding organization is better off when its capacity is limited. The analysis highlights similarities between competitive Bayesian persuasion games and all-pay auctions and generalized Colonel Blotto games.","[Boleslavsky, Raphael] Univ Miami, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA; [Cotton, Christopher] Queens Univ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",University of Miami; Queens University - Canada,"Cotton, C (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",r.boleslavsky@miami.edu; cotton@econ.queensu.ca,,"Cotton, Christopher/0000-0002-2623-8215",Cotton,Cotton,"The paper greatly benefited from feedback from Dan Kovenock and our referees.

We focus on an open-economy model in which the capital-deepening effect of financial globalization boosts growth in a in permanent but entails an entry cost in order to access international credit markets. We show that constrained borrowing triggers substantial welfare gains, even at small levels of international financial integration, provided that the autarkic growth rate is larger than the world interest rate. Such conditional welfare benefits boosted by stronger growth-long-run gain-arise in our preferred model without investment commitment and they range, relative to autarky, from about in middle-income countries to about in OECD-type countries under international financial integration. Sizeable benefits emerge despite the fact that consumption initially falls-short-run pain-which is, however, shown not to dwarf positive growth changes.","[Boucekkine, Raouf; Fabbri, Giorgio] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, Marseille, France; [Boucekkine, Raouf; Fabbri, Giorgio] EHESS, Marseille, France; [Pintus, Patrick A.] Banque France, 41-1422 DEMFI POMONE, F-75049 Paris 01, France",Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); European Central Bank; Bank of France,"Pintus, PA (通讯作者)，Banque France, 41-1422 DEMFI POMONE, F-75049 Paris 01, France.",raouf.boucekkine@univ-amu.fr; giorgio.fabbri@univ-amu.fr; papintus@gmail.com,"Fabbri, Giorgio/O-9848-2019","Fabbri, Giorgio/0000-0003-3316-8929; Pintus, Patrick/0000-0003-2263-0655",,,,,42,4,4,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

While most of the social psychology literature emphasizes the role of autonomy, recent economic research has provided an alternative explanation based on reciprocity. To understand the behavioral mechanisms underlying such reactions, we conduct an experiment in which we compare two treatments: one in which control is exerted directly by the principal; and the other in which it is exerted by a third party enjoying no residual claimancy rights (third-party control). The results indicate that when either the principal or a third party decides to control the average level of effort that is selected by the agents is similar. What changes remarkably are the agents' reactions to the decision of the other participants not to control. When the principal decides not to control, then the agent exerts greater effort relative to the case when the third party decides not to control. Agents seem to reward principals who abstain from control for their trust, rather than punish controlling ones for their distrust. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We offer a systematic analysis of the development of secular states based on a political economy approach that is centered on the notion of legitimacy. Viewing religion as a legitimizing force for political leaders, we consider the factors affecting the cost and benefits of alternative sources of legitimacy, such as the differential abilities of religious and secular sources to legitimize political rulers and historical inertia that shaped the cost of monitoring legitimizing agents. To examine this argument empirically, we built a cross-national time-series dataset for the relationship between state and religion since the year 1000. We first use the data to examine the evolution of secularism over time and its variation across religious traditions. We then use regression analysis and an instrumental variables approach to identify the influences on the adoption of secular state, such as concentration in the religion market, religious differences between rulers and the general population, historical inertia of a state, and the prevailing political regime. We address endogeneity concerns regarding the relationship between religious concentration and state secularism by exploiting variation among territories in their geographic distance to religious capitals of the world as an instrument.

As the largest energy consumer and carbon dioxide (CO2) emitter worldwide, China has already raised great concerns for its energy consumption and the potential effect on global warming. However, the reverse impacts of climate change on China's energy consumption are still unanswered. This paper tries to fill the research gap by conducting the first estimates about the climatic impacts on residential energy consumption in China, including both intensive and extensive margins. Random and exogenous temperature shocks are used to identify the effects of climatic change on households' electricity consumption and air conditioner adoption. Differences of responses by season and by climate zone are particularly explored, especially considering the possible effect of government-provided central heating system in North China during wintertime. We find that hotter summer would result in larger impact than colder winter, implying increased electricity consumption in the whole year from global warming. Furthermore, intensive margin dominates in summer while its role is only minor in winter. We also find that there are substantial differences by climate zone in responses of electricity consumption and air conditioner adoption, potentially due to central heating system and different tolerance to temperature. The findings can help us make informed decisions on planning future energy/electricity development, as well as climate and energy policies. We also anticipate our paper to provide knowledge and broader implications directed toward alleviating global climate warming. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Establishing a system of reasonable indicators is the key to green industry evaluation. From the connotation of green industry, this paper chooses green industry evaluation indicators with the extensive inclusion of green production, green consumption and green environment. Based on the principle of the maximum information content and the principle of eliminating redundant information, it establishes the evaluation indicators system of green industry. The proposed index system exhibits universal features of selection methods. Furthermore, the indexes of green industry formulated by authorities, such as EMCA, and designed for cities, such as Beijing and Shanghai in China, are described in terms of mass-elected indexes; these indexes can also provide important reference for green industry development in other similar cities, particularly coastal cities.","[Meng, Bin; Chi, Guotai] Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China",Dalian University of Technology,"Chi, GT (通讯作者)，Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China.",mengbinfly@163.com; chigt@dlut.edu.cn,"Chi, Guotai/HJP-1386-2023",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71731003, 71471027, 71672016, 71503199, 71301017]; National Social Science Foundation of China [16BTJ017]; China National Development and Reform Commission Project [2011-47-01]; Dalian Development and Reform Commission Project [2011-10]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); China National Development and Reform Commission Project; Dalian Development and Reform Commission Project,"The research is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71731003, 71471027, 71672016, 71503199 and 71301017), National Social Science Foundation of China (No. 16BTJ017), China National Development and Reform Commission Project (No. 2011-47-01), Dalian Development and Reform Commission Project (No. 2011-10).

This has negatively affected the financial position of the country because (1) large EC subsidies are provided in its internal market, and (2) Ecuador is mostly a crude oil exporter and oil-derivatives importer country. Here, I aim to determine the Granger causal relationship between EC and economic growth (EG) in Ecuador by analyzing aggregated and disaggregated data for 1970-2015. Vector autoregressive (VAR) models considering structural breaks are estimated, and Granger causality tests are performed. I found that, in Ecuador, the following occurs: (1) EC causes EG (with no feedback effect) and is caused either directly or indirectly by the EG of its primary, secondary, and tertiary economic sectors; (2) oil and hydroelectricity consumption are the cause and the consequence, respectively, of EG; and (3) EC has a bi-directional causality relationship with transportation sector EG. Finally, for Ecuador to achieve more sustainable development dynamics, I recommend raising the price of oil-based energy (especially when it is used for unproductive activities) while subsidizing the consumption of renewable energy (specially oriented to the industrial sector).

Inputs can be workers in a firm, risk factors for a disease, securities in a financial market, or nodes in a networked economy. Each input takes its values from a finite set and uncertainty is modeled as a probability distribution over this set. First, we provide an axiomatic solution to this problem, uniquely characterizing a valuation scheme called the a priori Shapley value. Second, we solve the problem of valuing inputs a posteriori that is, after observing output, obtaining the Bayesian Shapley value. Third, we address the question of rationalizing uncertainty in labor supply in a non-cooperative production game where payoffs are given by the Shapley wage function. We also provide an intuitive condition for the existence of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium. Illustrations of the theory include an application to fidelity networks. 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Scholars might choose targets of inquiry, sources of data, or methods of analysis that support their political allegiances.

Compound simple games are built out of component games, which are, in turn, players of a quotient game. I describe a method to construct fair or symmetry-preserving stable sets of compound simple games from fair stable sets of their quotient and components. This method is closely related to the composition theorem of Shapley (1963c), and contributes to the answer of a question that he formulated: What is the set g of simple games that admit a fair stable set? In particular, this method shows that the set g includes all simple games whose factors or quotients in their unique factorization of Shapley (1967) are in g, and suggests a path to characterize g.

However, withholding information about criminal records could risk encouraging racial discrimination: employers may make assumptions about criminality based on the applicant's race. To investigate BTB's effects, we sent approximately 15,000 online job applications on behalf of fictitious young, male applicants to employers in New Jersey and New York City before and after the adoption of BTB policies. These applications varied whether the applicant had a distinctly black or distinctly white name and the felony conviction status of the applicant. We confirm that criminal records are a major barrier to employment: employers that asked about criminal records were 63% more likely to call applicants with no record. However, our results support the concern that BTB policies encourage racial discrimination: the black-white gap in callbacks grew dramatically at companies that removed the box after the policy went into effect. Before BTB, white applicants to employers with the box received 7% more callbacks than similar black applicants, but BTB increased this gap to 43%. We believe that the best interpretation of these results is that employers are relying on exaggerated impressions of real-world racial differences in felony conviction rates.","[Agan, Amanda] Rutgers State Univ, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Agan, A (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",,,,Princeton University Industrial Relations Section; University of Michigan Empirical Legal Studies Center; University of Michigan Office of Research,Princeton University Industrial Relations Section; University of Michigan Empirical Legal Studies Center; University of Michigan Office of Research,"The authors gratefully acknowledge generous funding from the Princeton University Industrial Relations Section, the University of Michigan Empirical Legal Studies Center, and the University of Michigan Office of Research, without which this study could not have taken place.

We distinguish between urban, natural and cultural qualities as different sources of regional attractiveness and estimate their influence on the observed growth of individuals with at least three years of higher education during 2001-2010.

Institutions such as the family, the clan, the guild, and the market organize who learns from whom.

Bail decisions provide a good test case. Millions of times each year, judges make jail-or-release decisions that hinge on a prediction of what a defendant would do if released. The concreteness of the prediction task combined with the volume of data available makes this a promising machine-learning application. Yet comparing the algorithm to judges proves complicated. First, the available data are generated by prior judge decisions. We only observe crime outcomes for released defendants, not for those judges detained. This makes it hard to evaluate counterfactual decision rules based on algorithmic predictions. Second, judges may have a broader set of preferences than the variable the algorithm predicts; for instance, judges may care specifically about violent crimes or about racial inequities. We deal with these problems using different econometric strategies, such as quasi-random assignment of cases to judges. Even accounting for these concerns, our results suggest potentially large welfare gains: one policy simulation shows crime reductions up to 24.7% with no change in jailing rates, or jailing rate reductions up to 41.9% with no increase in crime rates. Moreover, all categories of crime, including violent crimes, show reductions; these gains can be achieved while simultaneously reducing racial disparities. These results suggest that while machine learning can be valuable, realizing this value requires integrating these tools into an economic framework: being clear about the link between predictions and decisions; specifying the scope of payoff functions; and constructing unbiased decision counterfactuals.","[Kleinberg, Jon] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Harvard Univ, CEPR, NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; BREAD, Richmond Hts, MO USA",Cornell University; Stanford University; University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kleinberg, J (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",,,"Mullainathan, Sendhil/0000-0001-8508-4052; Leskovec, Jure/0000-0002-5411-923X",Simons Foundation; Stanford Data Science Initiative; MacArthur MacArthur; McCormick Foundation; Pritzker Foundation,Simons Foundation; Stanford Data Science Initiative; MacArthur MacArthur; McCormick Foundation; Pritzker Foundation,"We are immensely grateful to Mike Riley for meticulously and tirelessly spearheading the data analytics, with effort well above and beyond the call of duty.

We find that a system change unambiguously decreases tax revenues in the short run, in which neither firms nor governments can adjust their behavior, due to the cross-border loss offset inherent in formula apportionment. In the medium run, in which only firms can adjust their strategies, tax revenues are still lower under formula apportionment if the probability of incurring losses or the costs of profit shifting are sufficiently small. However, in the long run, where firms and governments can adjust their behavior, a switch from separate accounting to formula apportionment is beneficial under the aforementioned conditions. Furthermore, we show that a higher weight on input shares in the apportionment formula may mitigate tax competition and thus increase tax revenues because, contrary to output factors, input factors provide a backstop against a shortfall of tax revenues due to loss-making subsidiaries.

In this study, we look at whether a stacked designation (a fast-track designation with a prior orphan designation) provides stronger positive signaling effects to investors than an unstacked designation (a fast-track alone). We examine differences in average cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) following stacked and unstacked announcements using daily stock data for individual firms and the S&P 500 Composite Index for the period of 1998-2015. Results show a substantial decline in average CARs over the study period for both stacked and unstacked designations. We hypothesize that this decline could be caused by the increased availability of information caused by the growth of the internet over the study period: as more information is more readily available, the value of each piece of incremental information may decrease. We also find evidence of substantially larger average CARs for small firms than large firms for both stacked and unstacked designations. We believe that this evidence supports the conclusion that there is a strong dilution effect for incremental information, as large pharmaceutical firms make more frequent announcements than smaller firms.

An economic agent who self-protects benefits by reducing vulnerability to crime but incurs self-protection costs whether a victimization occurs or not; should a crime occur, the agent further bears the cost of the victimization itself. The agent, a school administrator in this application, must determine the optimal level of self-protection within this environment. Empirical results obtained using data from the 2004 and 2006 School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS) show that schools self-protect (use professional security personnel) much in line with theoretical predictions. Among other findings, schools located in larger cities and that have a larger and older student body self-protect more prevalently than other schools, while schools with more academically able students self-protect less than schools with less productive student inputs.","[Allen, W.

The aim of this paper is to analyse the impact that the intensity of a firm's adoption of information and communications technologies (ICT) and industry attractiveness has on corporate performance. A sample of 871 SMEs took part in the study and data were analysed using ordered logistic regression and principal axis factoring analysis. The results emphasise the existence of a significant positive relationship between ICT intensity of use and corporate performance and highlight the importance of ICT in very competitive environments. Our survey suggests that full integration of ICTs in the company is advisable. The drawback, however, is that the rapidly changing nature of ICTs makes the adoption of emerging ICTs difficult.","[Barba-Sanchez, Virginia; Atienza-Sahuquillo, Carlos] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Business Adm, ESII, Paseo Estudiantes S-N, Albacete 02071, Spain; [Jose Calderon-Milan, Maria] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Appl Econ, Ave Espana S-N, Albacete 02071, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Barba-Sánchez, V (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Business Adm, ESII, Paseo Estudiantes S-N, Albacete 02071, Spain.",virginia.barba@uclm.es,"Barba-Sánchez, Virginia/C-1870-2012; Calderón Milán, María José/E-7933-2018; Atienza-Sahuquillo, Carlos/L-7566-2014","Barba-Sánchez, Virginia/0000-0003-0149-0569; Calderón Milán, María José/0000-0001-8829-8750; Atienza-Sahuquillo, Carlos/0000-0002-1064-8893",European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) [GI20163487]; University of Castilla-La Mancha [GI20163487],European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)(European Union (EU)); University of Castilla-La Mancha,This work was supported by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the University of Castilla-La Mancha (GI20163487).,,71,21,24,2,30,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Indeed, in countries in which the official hotel classification system is voluntary, a substantial fraction of hotels choose not to enter the system, and are outsiders. Considering that being classified (being insider) as a predictor of the rate structure may raise an endogeneity issue, we apply the recursive semi-ordered probit model to control for endogeneity and appropriately assess the effect of being classified on price rates. Using a sample of 357 hotels of Corsica, we show that, in contrast to previous research, classification does not provide any rate premium.

The study of economic factors that are easier to quantify from methodological point of view, and which prevent complex evaluation of causality of interest rate risk and the discovery of various social barriers dominate. This consistent fact forms a platform in designing the research to introduce a model of dependency of effective credit risk management in the SME segment on significant social and economic factors. Empirical research was carried out in the Czech business environment in 2017 on a sample of 352 enterprises. The structural analysis modeling (SEM) was the main analytical method. The research results confirmed the fact that an effective approach to managing the SME's credit risk is determined by a number of factors of a non-economic nature. The most important are education and family environment. These are followed by economic factors, such as a relationship with banks, financial knowledge in the area of capital and payment discipline. The multi-spectral dimension of the findings and causality also opened up a wide discussion and prepared a high-quality data research base for further deeper exploration of this issue.","[Belas, Jaroslav; Dvorsky, Jan] Thomas Bata Univ, Fac Management & Econ, Dept Enterprise Econ, Zlin, Czech Republic; [Smrcka, Lubos] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Business Adm, Dept Strategy, Prague, Czech Republic; [Gavurova, Beata] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Banking & Investment, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia",Tomas Bata University Zlin; Prague University of Economics & Business; Technical University Kosice,"Gavurova, B (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Banking & Investment, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",benta.gavurova@tuke.sk,"Smrcka, Lubos/AFV-1635-2022; Belas, Jaroslav/AGS-6813-2022; Gavurová, Beáta/N-9159-2018; Dvorsky, Jan/C-9213-2018","Smrcka, Lubos/0000-0003-4966-2171; Belas, Jaroslav/0000-0002-5900-997X; Gavurová, Beáta/0000-0002-0606-879X; Dvorsky, Jan/0000-0002-6078-2636",,,,,46,61,63,5,50,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

A randomized experiment based around the introduction of the entreprenant legal status in Benin is used to test these assumptions, along with supplementary efforts to enhance the presumed benefits of formalizing to firms. Few firms register when just given information about the new regime, but our full package of supplementary efforts boosts formalization by 16.3 percentage points. However, this formalization does not bring firms higher sales or profits, and the cost of formalizing these firms exceeds the added taxation they will pay over the next decade. We show how better targeting of these policies towards firms that look more like formal firms to begin with can increase the formalization rate and improve cost-effectiveness.","[Benhassine, Najy; McKenzie, David; Santini, Massimiliano] World Bank Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Pouliquen, Victor] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France",The World Bank; Paris School of Economics,"McKenzie, D (通讯作者)，World Bank Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",dmckenzie@worldbank.org,,"McKenzie, David/0000-0002-1885-2426","Government of Benin; International Finance Corporation; Facility for Investment Climate Advisory Services (FIAS); U.K. Department for International Development (DFID); Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada (DFATD); U.S. Agency for International Development through the Impact Program; Research Support Budget (RSB); Strategic Research Program (SRP); Impact Evaluation to Development Impact (i2i) through the WBG's Development Economics Department; Private Enterprise Development for Low-Income Countries (PEDL) initiative; DFID","Government of Benin; International Finance Corporation; Facility for Investment Climate Advisory Services (FIAS); U.K. Department for International Development (DFID); Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada (DFATD); U.S. Agency for International Development through the Impact Program(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Research Support Budget (RSB); Strategic Research Program (SRP); Impact Evaluation to Development Impact (i2i) through the WBG's Development Economics Department; Private Enterprise Development for Low-Income Countries (PEDL) initiative; DFID","The authors owe particular appreciation to all the experts and colleagues who contributed to the design and implementation of the entreprenant program and its impact evaluation: Louis Akakpo, Theodore Anthonioz, Zoubir Benhamouche, Julien Bornon, Laurent Corthay, Tonagnon Dadjo, Matins Deen, Magueye Dia, Benedicta Houetchenou, Ferdinand Ngobounan, Adrien Pawlik, Dolele Sylla, Kjartan Sorensen, Hamidou Sorgo, Adama Tiendrebeogo, and Alain Traore.

An expert's preference is parameterized by his ideal action, or agenda. Common intuition suggests that more information is revealed if the panel includes experts with opposed agendas, because such experts will undo each other's attempts to conceal unfavorable information. In contrast, we show that recruiting experts with diverse agendas is optimal only if the correlation between the experts' types-i.e., whether they are informed or not is above a threshold. Moreover, if the experts' types are independent, under mild assumptions it is optimal to recruit experts who have extreme but identical agendas. These findings suggest that the diversity of preferences must be considered in conjunction with the diversity of information sources, and it is generally sub-optimal to seek diversity in both dimensions.

A higher market potential in the trade area is associated with higher average productivity and lower productivity dispersion through selection of the best stores. The analysis, based on a unique data set encompassing 14,212 Italian retailers, finds support for this relationship in Southern Italy, but not in Northern and Central Italy (where opposite results are obtained in some cases), suggesting the selection dynamics are affected by context factors (other than provincial/regional accessibility) related to an upper geographical scale. The results are robust to controlling for local context factors such as financial risk and floor size restrictions.

Many papers have analyzed the relationship between growth and a country's level of financial development using private credit, which leads to several unexpected problems. However, very few have used bank efficiency to gauge the development of the financial sector. The aim of this paper is to analyze the effect of bank efficiency on value-added growth of industries that were most dependent on external financing during the financial crisis. Specifically, it uses the data envelopment analysis (DEA) method to measure the efficiency of the banking sector across countries, according to the empirical strategy offered by Rajan and Zingales (1998). Our main result shows that bank efficiency relaxed credit constraints and increased the growth rate for financially dependent industries during the crisis. This finding shows the great but overlooked importance of bank efficiency in mitigating the negative effects of financial crises on growth for industries that are most dependent on external financing.","[Diallo, Boubacar] Qatar Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, Coll Business & Econ, POB 2713, Doha, Qatar",Qatar University,"Diallo, B (通讯作者)，Qatar Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, Coll Business & Econ, POB 2713, Doha, Qatar.",diallobs@kfupm.edu.sa,,,,,,,26,32,33,1,27,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Buchanan; rationality; methodology; subjectivism,CHOICE-THEORETIC FOUNDATIONS; OPPORTUNITY; PREFERENCES; AGENCY; ORDER,"In light of behavioral findings regarding inconsistent individual decision-making, economists have begun to re-conceptualize the notion of welfare. One prominent account is the preference purification approach (PP), which attempts to reconstruct preferences from choice data based on a normative understanding of neoclassical rationality. Using Buchanan's notion of creative choice, this paper criticizes PP's epistemic, ontological, and psychological assumptions. It identifies PP as a static position that assumes the satisfaction of given 'true preferences' as the normative standard for welfare. However, following Buchanan, choice should be understood dynamically as a process whereby preferences constantly regenerate. Accordingly, the meaning of welfare emerges from an ongoing quest for individual self-constitution. If this holds true, then rationality axioms cannot serve as a priori normative standards. Instead, creative imagination and learning processes must remain central to any understanding of welfare in economics.","[Dold, Malte F.] NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10003 USA",New York University,"Dold, MF (通讯作者)，NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10003 USA.",malte.dold@nyu.edu,,,,,,,60,19,19,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

We characterize nonlinear cointegration in terms of a nonlinear moving-average filter (high pass filter) of a matrix based on permutation matrices on the discrepancy of empirical distributions. A Cramer-Von Misses (CVM) test statistic is proposed for testing the null hypothesis of two independent random walks against a broad range of cointegrating alternatives with monotonic nonlinearities and level shifts in the cointegration relationship. We derive the asymptotic distribution of this induced-order Cramer-Von Misses (CVM) cointegration test. This new non-parametric test statistic has two important properties: the invariance to monotonic transformations of the series and the robustness for the presence of several parameter shifts or structural changes. We analyse the small sample properties of this test by Monte Carlo simulations and evaluate the power of the test. Finally, this CVM test is applied to the analysis of long run environmental Kuznets curve which relates economic growth and pollution. In particular, we consider a nonlinear cointegration between gross domestic product (GDP) and CO2 emissions. Our new CVM test is able to find evidence of cointegration while classical single equation cointegration tests are not.","[Escribano, Alvaro] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Teresa Santos-Martin, M.] Univ Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain; [Sipols, Ana E.] Univ Rey Juan Carlos Madrid, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; University of Salamanca; Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Escribano, A (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Madrid, Spain.",alvaroe@eco.uc3m.es,"Martín, Mª Teresa Santos/F-6236-2013; Escribano, Alvaro/H-7997-2015; Garcia Sipols, Ana Elizabeth/D-8493-2016","Martín, Mª Teresa Santos/0000-0001-9292-825X; Escribano, Alvaro/0000-0003-4401-0887; Garcia Sipols, Ana Elizabeth/0000-0002-2230-0587","Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad [ECO2016-00105-001, MDM 2014-0431, ECO2015-66593-P, MTM2013-47879-C2-2-P, MTM2016-80539-C2-2-R]; Comunidad de Madrid [MadEco-CMS2015/HUM-3444]; Junta de Castilla y Leon [SA130U14, SA080P17]","Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad; Comunidad de Madrid(Comunidad de Madrid); Junta de Castilla y Leon(Junta de Castilla y Leon)","This work was supported by Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad [Grant Numbers ECO2016-00105-001, MDM 2014-0431, ECO2015-66593-P, MTM2013-47879-C2-2-P and MTM2016-80539-C2-2-R], Comunidad de Madrid [Grant Number MadEco-CMS2015/HUM-3444], and Junta de Castilla y Leon [Grant Numbers SA130U14 and SA080P17]",,62,2,2,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The evidence presented shows that regions specialised in KETs are concentrated in central Europe; however, over the period taken into account (1996-2011), less innovative and peripheral EU regions have been increasing their specialisation in these technological areas at the expense of the most advanced regions. There is also evidence that (spatial) diffusion of KETs often occurs across regions contiguous to each other. The results of the econometric estimations show that being specialised in KETs affects regional economic growth (per capita gross domestic product) and that this effect is stronger in the case of less innovative EU regions. Overall, these results hint at the pervasive nature and enabling role of KETs and demonstrate the importance for EU regions to target these technologies as part of their smart specialisation strategies.","[Evangelista, Rinaldo] Univ Camerino, Sch Law, Camerino, MC, Italy; [Meliciani, Valentina] Univ LUISS Guido Carli Rome, Dept Business & Management, Rome, Italy; [Vezzani, Antonio] European Commiss, JRC IPTS, Seville, Spain",University of Camerino; Luiss Guido Carli University; European Commission Joint Research Centre,"Meliciani, V (通讯作者)，Univ LUISS Guido Carli Rome, Viale Romania 32, I-00198 Rome, Italy.",vmeliciani@luiss.it,"Vezzani, Antonio/AAL-9465-2021","Vezzani, Antonio/0000-0001-8077-2489",,,,,77,29,29,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

Innovation takes place in a rich North while firms in a poor South imitate products manufactured in North. Allowing a role for per capita incomes in determining demand delivers a complete international product cycle as described by Vernon (1966), where the different stages of the product cycle are not only determined by supply-side factors but also by the distribution of income between North and South. We analyze how changes in the gap between North and South due to changes in Southern labor productivity, population size in South and inequality across regions affect the international product cycle. In line with presented stylized facts, we predict a negative correlation between adoption time and per capita incomes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Rodrik (2018) seems sceptical, and provides evidence based on modern growth theory to support the scepticism: the recent relatively impressive growth does not seem sustainable. Related to the issue of sustainability is economic structure. Diao et al. (2018) find that accompanying the recent growth record has been improving agricultural labour productivity, a reduction of the agricultural labour share and increasing manufacturing employment, evidence that is consistent with that observed for industrialised economies. Thorbecke and Ouyang (2018) also find that while the efficacy of translating growth into poverty reduction remains lower for Africa than elsewhere, there is evidence of poverty convergence recently in Africa, contrary to that for developing countries generally. Fosu (2018) observes the dominant importance, on average, of growth for poverty reduction in Africa, but also underscores the critical role of inequality, especially for certain countries. Exploring why inequality is particularly high in Africa, Shimeles and Nabassaga (2018) uncover ethnic fractionalisation, limited tertiary education, and poor governance as major culprits, and inequality of opportunity as the dominant component. Bigsten (2018) identifies the dual-economy nature of colonial arrangements as the genesis for Africa's high inequality, and proposes an enhanced pro-poor Lewis-type modern-sector enlargement as a potential solution.","[Fosu, Augustin Kwasi] Univ Ghana, ISSER, Legon, Ghana; [Fosu, Augustin Kwasi] Univ Pretoria, Fac Econ & Management Sci, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Ghana; University of Pretoria,"Fosu, AK (通讯作者)，Univ Ghana, ISSER, Legon, Ghana.;Fosu, AK (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Fac Econ & Management Sci, Pretoria, South Africa.",afosu@isser.edu.gh,,,,,,,25,19,19,1,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

But field experiments find that matching doesn't always increase donations. Individuals may believe that peers will exhaust the matching funds, so their donation isn't pivotal. We develop a theory of how beliefs about peers' donations affect one's likelihood of donation. We test our theory using novel threshold match treatments in field and laboratory experiments. One threshold match treatment more than doubles the donation rate relative to no match. To understand the mechanism behind this increase, we use a lab study to show that beliefs about peers' donations matter. Our theoretical, lab, and field results combined suggest people are more likely to donate when they believe they are more pivotal to securing matching money. Beliefs about others matter, and they should be taken into account when trying to increase donations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper the idea of mixed data sampling (MIDAS) is extended from linear correlation in Colacito et al. (2011) to the more general dependence measure: copula, and a copula-MIDAS model is proposed to describe the asymmetric return-liquidity dependence of CSI 300 index futures with short-run and long-run components. Based on the skewed t copula-MIDAS model, it is found that extreme decreases in returns tend to be accompanied by extreme increases in bid-ask spreads, but extreme increases in returns may not coincide with extreme reductions in bid-ask spreads. Furthermore, the return-spread dependence consists of both short-run and long-run components, and the long-run component will influence the return-spread dependence in the next two weeks. Last, the out-of-sample forecast of liquidity risk stresses the importance of considering asymmetry and long-run trend in return-spread dependence as it enables investors to well predict liquidity risk in times of market crashes. The results imply that high frequency trading investors of CSI 300 index futures should pay more attentions to prevent the potential liquidity risk when the bid-ask spreads are widened. And investors are suggested to use the past two-week high frequency data to forecast the current return-spread dependence in liquidity risk management.","[Gong, Yuting] Shanghai Univ, SHU UTS SILC Business Sch, Dept Econ, Room 511,Wenhui Bldg,20 Chengzhong Rd, Shanghai 201800, Peoples R China; [Chen, Qiang] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Liang, Jufang] Hunan Univ, Sch Finance & Stat, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China",Shanghai University; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Hunan University,"Gong, YT (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ, SHU UTS SILC Business Sch, Dept Econ, Room 511,Wenhui Bldg,20 Chengzhong Rd, Shanghai 201800, Peoples R China.",yutinggongl1@.shu.edu.cn,,"Liang, Jufang/0000-0003-0917-8799",Chinese National Science Foundation [71601108],Chinese National Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We would like to thank the editors and three anonymous referees for many helpful comments that helped in improving the quality of the paper.

This paper provides a different view on this link by investigating how the size of Taylor rule reaction coefficients impacts the adjustment dynamics of the real exchange rate. Within a stylized sticky-price open-economy macro model, it is demonstrated that a stronger interest rate reaction to inflation in the Taylor rule raises the convergence speed of the real exchange rate. Conversely, raising the coefficient on the output gap or attending to the exchange rate in an open-economy version of the Taylor rule slows down real exchange rate adjustment. In all cases, more rapid convergence comes at the cost of stronger initial real exchange rate misalignments in the wake of monetary policy shocks.","[Kempa, Bernd] Univ Munster, Munster, Germany",University of Munster,"Kempa, B (通讯作者)，Univ Munster, Inst Int Econ, Univ Str 14-16, D-48143 Munster, Germany.",bernd.kempa@uni-muenster.de,"Kempa, Bernd/ABG-7880-2020",,,,,,21,0,0,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

Our findings show that the NKPC heavily relying on firms' forward-looking behaviour is hardly supported by the Euro Area and the US data. The failure of the NKPC in matching the data is consistently observed across the sub-samples divided before and after the early 1980s. For comparison, we also investigate the performance of the hybrid NKPC and the traditional backward-looking Phillips curve associated with ad hoc price indexation assumptions.","[Kim, Insu] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Insu] Chonbuk Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Jeonju Si, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Jeonbuk National University,"Kim, I (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.;Kim, I (通讯作者)，Chonbuk Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Jeonju Si, South Korea.",insu.kim@jbnu.ac.kr,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Incentives for wider use of RES are declared both in the European Union and in Lithuanian laws. However, it may be stated that there is lack of research, which would give answers to questions on economic assumptions that would link energy policy to economic results and would justify benefits of the use of RES technologies on a national scale. Thus, this paper aims at presenting methodological principles of wind power technologies assessment based on economic indicators. The impact of wind power technologies implementation on the economy was estimated based on microeconomic analysis method. Levelised cost of energy approach was used to compute wind power prime cost. Economic indicators were computed. The research results disclosed that investment subsidy and feed-in tariffs are attractive support measures for the investor. They could be used to promote wind power sector development in Lithuania in the future. Energy policy decision making should be based on the economic assessment principles. Wind power support schemes and support levels should be reconsidered taking into account the net benefits of wind power technologies. Wind power technologies are beneficial to economy due to their impact on profit, income-based taxes, electricity import substitution and CO2 savings.","[Klevas, Valentinas; Bobinaite, Viktorija; Marciukaitis, Mantas; Tarvydas, Dalius] Lithuanian Energy Inst, Breslaujos St 3, LT-44403 Kaunas, Lithuania",Lithuanian Energy Institute,"Klevas, V (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Energy Inst, Breslaujos St 3, LT-44403 Kaunas, Lithuania.",valentinas.klevas@lei.lt; viktorija.bobinaite@lei.lt; mantas.marciukaitis@lei.lt; dalius.tarvydas@lei.lt,,"Marciukaitis, Mantas/0000-0003-2783-1667; Bobinaite, Viktorija/0000-0002-7093-2458",,,,,28,3,3,1,8,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

This extensive training programme leads to a formal vocational degree, which is often required to access certain professions. Applying statistical matching methods, we find that on average, after a period with large lock-in effects, retraining strongly increases the employment probability of participants, especially women. We add to the literature by estimating the employment effects for different occupations for which participants are trained. Our results show that there are substantial differences depending on the occupation. As the composition of trained occupations differs for men and women, segregation could be a driver of higher employment effects for women. However, comparisons of men and women trained for the same occupations reveal that even after controlling for segregation, women profit more from retraining. While caseworkers are instructed to choose professions with high labour demand, other aspects, such as working conditions, preferences and aptitudes of participants, should be crucial in the choice of a suitable occupation. An individual assessment of the suitability of an occupation could therefore improve the overall effectiveness of the programme.","[Kruppe, Thomas; Lang, Julia] Inst Employment Res, Dept Act Lab Market Policies & Integrat, Regensburger Str 104, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany",,"Lang, J (通讯作者)，Inst Employment Res, Dept Act Lab Market Policies & Integrat, Regensburger Str 104, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany.",Julia.Lang@iab.de,,"Lang, Julia/0000-0002-6832-8665; Kruppe, Thomas/0009-0008-5533-3220",,,,,36,14,14,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

However, in relative terms - remittances as a per cent of GDP - the two countries stand at 6.1% and 2.8%, respectively, well below the levels of the top 10 recipients. In this article, we explore the effect of remittances on the total factor productivity (TFP) growth considering Bangladesh and India, as reference countries over the periods 1980-2012 and 1977-2012, respectively. We examine the presence of a long-run association between remittances and TFP using a number of tests. The results indicate that remittances have threshold effects on TFP growth in both countries. Despite the two countries receiving substantial amount of remittances, we note that Bangladesh has a U-shaped relationship whereas India has an inverted U-shaped relationship with TFP growth. For Bangladesh, a minimum threshold of remittances (% GDP) is 5.3% and for India, a tipping point of remittances (% GDP) is at 1.8%. The causality tests confirm a bidirectional effect, which implies that remittances and TFP growth are mutually reinforcing. Interestingly, while the two economies have similar remittances impact in regards to causality, the study highlights two different tipping points of remittances.","[Kumar, Ronald Ravinesh] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Informetr Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Kumar, Ronald Ravinesh] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Social Sci & Humanities, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Stauvermann, Peter Josef] Changwon Natl Univ, Chang Won, South Korea; [Kumar, Nikeel N.] Univ South Pacific, Suva, Fiji; [Kumar, Nikeel N.] Univ Fiji, Lautoka, Fiji; [Shahzad, Syed Jawad Hussain] Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier, France",Ton Duc Thang University; Ton Duc Thang University; Changwon National University; University of the South Pacific; Montpellier Business School,"Shahzad, SJH (通讯作者)，Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier, France.",j.syed@montpellier-bs.com,"Stauvermann, Peter Josef/I-3470-2019; Kumar, Nikeel/AAS-9818-2021; Kumar, Nikeel/AAR-6344-2021; Kumar, Ronald Ravinesh/H-4968-2015; Shahzad, Syed Jawad Hussain/D-1986-2019; Kumar, Ronald/AAK-7991-2020","Stauvermann, Peter Josef/0000-0001-7011-2209; Kumar, Nikeel/0000-0001-5950-1027; Kumar, Nikeel/0000-0001-5950-1027; Kumar, Ronald Ravinesh/0000-0001-9658-4896; Shahzad, Syed Jawad Hussain/0000-0003-3511-6057;",Changwon National University,Changwon National University,Peter J.

To this end, it introduces the rate of financial innovation (RoFIN) as an endogenous variable in an Agent-Based Model (ABM) set up and studies its interaction with the non-fixed fraction of securitized mortgage loans. RoFIN is able to capture financial agents' business decisions on using financial innovation tools, processes and services, such as the home mortgage securitization process. In the aftermath of the 2007-2009 financial and economic crisis it has been argued that financial innovation and securitization have increased macro/finance systemic instability via, for example, non-linear two-way spillovers between the financial system and the macroeconomy. The ABM model proposed enables the capture of these dynamics. High values of RoFIN (i.e. exceeding the threshold of 50%) make financial innovation become harmful for the economic system, leading to a switch from a virtuous to an unvirtuous business cycle. When RoFIN reaches 90%, the numerical simulations come close to the macro/finance dynamics observed before and during the financial crisis. Given its potential role in triggering financial and economic instability, RoFIN is of interest for financial regulation and supervision. How this endogenous variable may be influenced by means of operational variables under the control of policymakers remains a subject for future research.","[Lauretta, Eliana] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Dept Finance, Univ House,Edgbaston Pk Rd, Birmingham B15 2TY, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Lauretta, E (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Dept Finance, Univ House,Edgbaston Pk Rd, Birmingham B15 2TY, W Midlands, England.",e.lauretta@bham.ac.uk,,"Lauretta, Eliana/0000-0002-6624-2286",,,,,64,5,5,0,19,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

This paper provides an explanation for low quality of service through examining the rational responses of firms (utility providers) to subsidy policy. Cross-subsidies are widely applied to spur poor households' consumption of utility services. This raises the issue of whether charging lower prices to poor households, while boosting their consumption, induces firms to lower the quality of service received by these households. We specify an analytical model in which the government may not fully cover the firm's deficit from subsidizing poor households. Our main findings are: 1) when government transfers fail to cover this deficit, the firm reduces quality for subsidized consumers; 2) the difference in quality across consumer income groups might be reduced by an increase in the amount of government transfers. This paper also identifies several directions for future research, including the impacts of cross-subsidies on social welfare and a better design of subsidy funding mechanism.","[Li, Fan] Shenzhen Univ, China Ctr Special Econ Zone Res, Nanhai Ave 3688, Shenzhen 518060, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Li, Shengli] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, Dept Informat Management & Elect Commerce, West Xianning Rd 28, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Shenzhen University; Xi'an Jiaotong University,"Li, SL (通讯作者)，Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, Dept Informat Management & Elect Commerce, West Xianning Rd 28, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",lifan@szu.edu.cn; lishengli@mail.xjtu.edu.cn,,,"Department of Education of Guangdong Province, China [2015WQNCX127]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China; Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, State Education Ministry; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71402134, 71572138, 71571140, 71473191, 91546119]","Department of Education of Guangdong Province, China(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, State Education Ministry(Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","We are thankful to Sanford Berg, Steve Slutsky, and anonymous reviewers for their advice and suggestions.

Our empirical results are consistent with the following notions. First, default correlations increase with the time horizon. Second, firms with low credit quality, small size, illiquidity, and a high beta exhibit higher default correlations.

Preservation of the Soviet mode of production, in turn, inevitably led to a fundamentally flawed policy approach and guided the former Soviet bloc toward an unproductive and damaging path-dependence.

To fulfil the research gap, this study integrates separate research streams and empirically tests the relationships between these constructs in Polish SMEs. Based on the sample of 120 firms and using PLS-PM technique, it was found that knowledge sharing and firm innovativeness are significant and positively related to customer satisfaction. Knowledge sharing and a firm's innovativeness predict 29.9% of the variability of customer satisfaction indicators. Moreover, firm innovativeness partially mediates the relationships between knowledge sharing and customer satisfaction. This finding supports suggestion that effective knowledge sharing improves a firm's ability to introduce new or improved products and services, which in turn increase customer satisfaction. Results of this study provide empirical evidence for the importance of knowledge sharing for firm innovativeness and customer satisfaction. The focus on SMEs in a single country, subjective nature of the data and cross-sectional design of the research are the main limitations of this study.","[Michna, Anna] Silesian Tech Univ, 26 Roosevelta St, PL-41800 Zabrze, Poland",Silesian University of Technology,"Michna, A (通讯作者)，Silesian Tech Univ, 26 Roosevelta St, PL-41800 Zabrze, Poland.",anna.michna@polsl.pl,"Michna, Anna/S-3253-2018","Michna, Anna/0000-0002-4099-2943",,,,,69,20,22,2,20,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We use municipal panel data from Japan for the years 2000, 2005 and 2010, a data set including numerous consolidation cases. Reverse causality between consolidation decisions and size of municipal expenditure is a concern in the voluntary consolidation of local governments. An instrumental variable (IV) methodology is employed to deal with possible endogeneity associated with consolidation decisions. The main finding is that municipal current expenditure per capita increases immediately after consolidation, but then gradually declines. Because consolidation seems to increase per capita expenditure in the absence of the effect of this long-term declining trend, incorporating this trend into estimation is crucial in cost-efficiency analysis of consolidation. It is also shown that conventional panel data regressions yield biased consolidation effects, suggesting the superiority of the IV approach.","[Miyazaki, Takeshi] Kyushu Univ, Dept Econ, Fukuoka, Japan",Kyushu University,"Miyazaki, T (通讯作者)，Kyushu Univ, Dept Econ, Higashi Ku, 6-19-1 Hakozaki, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan.",tmiyazak@econ.kyushu-u.ac.jp,,,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science under JPSP [22730256]; Kyushu University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22730256] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science under JPSP; Kyushu University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science under JPSP Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) 22730256 and by Kyushu University under a special research fund.,,39,18,20,1,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We investigate the factors influencing derivatives usage by 308 non-financial firms listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the period of 2008-2011. We also test the hypothesis saying that there are differences in the factors influencing the use of derivatives by companies in developed economies and by companies operating in transition economies. To examine the direction of the influence of certain factors on derivatives usage and the significance of that influence, we use a logit model. To explore the impact of a specific group of factors, we construct 47 different logit models using a combination of variables reflecting firm's size, default risk, debt service costs, liquidity constraints, and growth options. Owing to specific time-series cross-sectional data, we used a method of building a model based on panel data. The results of our analysis indicate that such factors as company size, risk of default and debt usage have a significant positive effect on derivatives usage. According to our results there is no permanent, statistically significant relationship between derivative usage by Polish companies and liquidity ratios. In all models, considering an option to develop, this factor has a significant negative impact on derivative usage. In general, we have obtained results showing the similarity of the factors that affect the use of derivatives by companies operating in Polish and foreign markets.","[Mizerka, Jacek; Strozynska-Szajek, Agnieszka] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Corp Finance Dept, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Mizerka, J (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Corp Finance Dept, Poznan, Poland.",,"Mizerka, Jacek/HLX-1004-2023","Mizerka, Jacek/0000-0001-5862-7162; Strozynska-Szajek, Agnieszka/0000-0001-8611-5607",,,,,26,0,0,1,13,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

We consider three different sources of growth: neutral technical change associated with Total Factor Productivity, investment-specific technical change (ISTC) embodied in capital assets, and improvements in the quality of labor services generated by human capital accumulation. The contribution to growth of each of these sources is computed using two different approaches: the standard (statistical) growth accounting and the structural growth decomposition obtained from a general equilibrium growth model. We found that the effect of ISTC dominates that of neutral technology and human capital in all of the countries considered. On average, more than 50% of productivity growth is explained by ISTC. Contributions to growth from ICT and non-ICT technical change are in general of similar magnitude.","[Molinari, Benedetto; Torres, Jose L.] Univ Malaga, Dept Econ, Campus El Ejido S-N, Malaga 29013, Spain; [Molinari, Benedetto] RCEA, 75 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada",Universidad de Malaga,"Torres, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Malaga, Dept Econ, Campus El Ejido S-N, Malaga 29013, Spain.",jtorres@uma.es,"Molinari, Benedetto/ABF-6822-2021; Torres, José/ABF-6814-2021","Molinari, Benedetto/0000-0002-6212-2412;","Proyecto Excelencia Junta de Andalucia [P07-SEJ-02479, SEJ-122, SEJ-1512]",Proyecto Excelencia Junta de Andalucia(Junta de Andalucia),"We gratefully acknowledge A.

First of them (marked as FTL transport) provides the full truck capacity to a single transporter (trading factory, manufacturer). Cost is derivative of route length. The second option is the utilization of cross-dock. Transporter transports goods to the warehouse (cross-dock), then the logistic company sorts goods according to the destination and places it in a truck, which is going to appropriate destination. In this case, the cost is derivative of the quantities of goods and destination. This article is a case study, where the transport of predetermined goods at a certain time interval is optimized.

According to the literature, Matthew effect refers to the impact of past accessing to public funds on reputation, which increases the probability of accessing in the present. The dataset is made of 966 firms that accessed the Technological Argentinean Fund (FONTAR), main instrument to foster innovation in Argentina, during 2007-2013 - 3300 observations. Results confirm the existence of Matthew effects: past accessing to FONTAR increases the probability of accessing in the present, but only when different instruments are taken altogether. Then, Matthew effect is positively associated with the diversification of access to promotional instruments rather than the repeated access to one type of funding tool. Additionally, results show that firm's innovation investments, R&D activities, and human resources, explain the increase in probability of accessing, which provides evidence regarding the presence of capability effects. All of this suggests that once the firm enters the system of public funding, it remains with an active innovative behaviour, not just because of reputation effects, but because it has accumulated capabilities in the pursuit of a technological advantage.","[Pereira, Mariano; Suarez, Diana] UNGS, Inst Ind IdeI, JM Gutierrez 1150,CP1613GSX, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Pereira, Mariano; Suarez, Diana] CIECTI, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",,"Suárez, D (通讯作者)，UNGS, Inst Ind IdeI, JM Gutierrez 1150,CP1613GSX, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",dsuarez@ungs.edu.ar,,"Pereira, Mariano/0000-0003-4313-7421",,,,,51,16,17,1,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

The study covers the 1997-2015 period and all EU28 countries. Product market competition is measured by two types of variables: product market regulation indicators and the number of enterprises. New elements in the analysis include, among others, nonlinear impact and overlapping observations. The regression equations are estimated on the basis of Blundell and Bond's GMM system estimator. The results generally indicate that stronger product market regulations (and theoretically lower product market competition) are linked with faster growth of output. However, the impact of product market competition on economic growth depends on the type of capitalism. For post-socialist countries, unlike the Western European model of capitalism, more regulation tends to reduce the rate of economic growth.","[Prochniak, Mariusz] SGH Warsaw Sch Econ, Dept Econ 2, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Próchniak, M (通讯作者)，SGH Warsaw Sch Econ, Dept Econ 2, Warsaw, Poland.",mproch@sgh.waw.pl,,,"National Science Centre, Poland [2014/13/B/HS4/00549]","National Science Centre, Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","The research project has been financed by the National Science Centre, Poland (grant number 2014/13/B/HS4/00549).",,33,4,4,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2018,30.0,2,,,,,131,155,,10.1080/14631377.2017.1362098,0.0,,,25,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FU1LY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423612600001,0

Within a framework that incorporates legitimacy and neo-institutional theories, this study investigates how CSR disclosure in small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) influences CSR requirements and capacity building with suppliers. Based on an empirical data set of 146 000 SMEs, we test our hypotheses using multiple mediation analysis. Our results indicate that SME CSR disclosure has a positive direct effect on capacity building. When the mediating role of CSR requirements is taken into account, the study reveals that the more SMEs disclose their CSR activities, the more they require CSR from their suppliers, which in turn leads to an increase in capacity building with them. The study also suggests that the SMEs that limit their CSR requirements to the application step are more likely to build capacity with their suppliers than the SMEs that impose CSR verification. Overall, this article provides unique insights for practitioners seeking to determine the circumstances in which the SME practices of sustainable supplier management unfold in practice.","[Stekelorum, Rebecca] Univ Montpellier, MRM, Montpellier, France; [Laguir, Issam] MRM, Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier, France; [Elbaz, Jamal] Ibn Zohr Univ, Ecole Super Technol EST Agadir, Agadir, Morocco",Universite de Montpellier; Montpellier Business School; Universite de Montpellier; Ibn Zohr University of Agadir,"Stekelorum, R (通讯作者)，Univ Montpellier, 163 Rue Auguste Broussonnet, F-34000 Montpellier, France.;Stekelorum, R (通讯作者)，Montpellier Res Management, 163 Rue Auguste Broussonnet, F-34000 Montpellier, France.",r.stekelorum@montpellier-bs.com,"El Baz, Jamal/F-6611-2017","El Baz, Jamal/0000-0003-1224-3504; Stekelorum, Rebecca/0000-0001-9293-0675",,,,,76,7,8,1,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Based on the content analysis of the websites of companies in the Association of Chemical Industry of the Czech Republic, employing 60 percent of workers and generating more than 70 percent of the production of this industry, it analyses and evaluates the level of CSR communication of these companies in economic, social, environmental, ethical and philanthropic areas. The study shows that the level of communication of CSR activities of chemical companies in the Czech Republic is low and corresponds to the low level of CSR communication in this country. Chemical industry companies mostly communicate activities falling within the sphere of economic and environmental responsibility, completely neglecting activities of ethical responsibility. In all areas of CSR, large corporations communicate a larger range of activities than small and medium enterprises, with no significant difference in communication between national and foreign companies. Thus, it is necessary to adopt the set of measures proposed in the paper, both at the governmental level and at the level of individual enterprises.","[Tetrevova, Libena] Univ Pardubice, Studentska 95, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Tetrevova, L (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Studentska 95, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic.",libena.tetrevova@upce.cz,"Tetrevova, Libena/F-6818-2019","Tetrevova, Libena/0000-0001-5241-545X",,,,,69,21,21,3,18,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We analyze how these contests are affected when groups are led by an organizer with the capacity to impose transfers to share the costs of individual efforts within the group. The technology of conflict that we use is the Tullock Contest Success Function with a perfect substitute impact function. We first describe centralized levels of group effort-those that organizers wish to attain-and compare with efforts when individuals act non-cooperatively. In the model a group underperforms when effort exerted by individuals in the non-cooperative setting is smaller than the centralized group effort. Otherwise, the group outperforms. We show that the larger group always underperforms, while the smaller one only does so if its size is sufficiently close to the larger group. Second, we characterize cost sharing schemes that implement group centralized levels of effort. These schemes consist of sharing costs in an egalitarian way. And third, we examine the game in which organizers compete strategically in setting the cost-sharing scheme of their group. We show that while the cost-sharing scheme is the same for the larger group as in the implementation case, it is different for the smaller group.","[Vazquez-Sedano, Alexis] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Econ & Econ Hist Dept, Bellaterra, Spain; [Vazquez-Sedano, Alexis] Barcelona GSE, Bellaterra, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Barcelona School of Economics,"Vázquez-Sedano, A (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Econ & Econ Hist Dept, Bellaterra, Spain.;Vázquez-Sedano, A (通讯作者)，Barcelona GSE, Bellaterra, Spain.",Alexis.Vazquez@uab.cat,,,"Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2008-04756]; Generalitat de Catalunya [SGR2014-515]; Ministerio de educacion, cultura y deporte [2012-3574]","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya); Ministerio de educacion, cultura y deporte(Spanish Government)","I am specially grateful to Carmen Bevia and Clara Ponsati.

This views informal payments by patients to healthcare professionals as arising when formal institutional failures lead to an asymmetry between the laws and regulations of formal institutions and the unwritten rules of informal institutions. Reporting a 2013 Eurobarometer survey of the prevalence of informal payments by patients in Central and Eastern European countries, a strong association is revealed between the level of asymmetry between the formal and informal institutions, and the propensity to make informal payments. The association between informal payments and various formal institutional imperfections is then explored to evaluate which structural conditions might reduce this institutional asymmetry, and thus the propensity to make informal payments. The paper concludes by exploring the implications for tackling such informal practices.","[Williams, Colin C.] Univ Sheffield, SUMS, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Horodnic, Adrian V.] Grigore T Popa Univ Med & Pharm, Fac Med, Iasi, Romania",University of Sheffield; Grigore T Popa University of Medicine & Pharmacy,"Williams, CC (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, SUMS, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",C.C.Williams@sheffield.ac.uk,"Horodnic, Adrian V./AAN-8021-2020; Williams, Colin C/B-1198-2016","Horodnic, Adrian V./0000-0001-6274-5049; Williams, Colin C/0000-0002-3610-1933",,,,,76,16,16,2,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2018,30.0,4,,,,,440,458,,10.1080/14631377.2018.1442051,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GH9MR,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000433994000002,0

Thereafter, we further analyse the freedom effects on the convergence of bank profit so as to explain the prevailing persistent fall in the profit growth of Chinese banks. Two types of convergence are considered in this study: beta-convergence and sigma-convergence, which are estimated by using dynamic panel data estimator. Our results suggest that beta-convergence does not take place for all ownership structures until discrepancies on their traits and structural parameters are conditioned out, suggesting that it is the conditional beta-convergence rather than the absolute beta-convergence that transpires in China's banking sector. While freedom is found to reduce profit growth significantly, its negative impact on the speed of beta-convergence is arguably negligible. This alludes that China has done reasonably well in balancing its liberalization initiatives with stabilization measures so that the fall in profits instigated by freedom does not significantly overshoot its long-run equilibrium path. Credit market freedom is also found to be a significant catalyst for sigma-convergence for all ownership structures but state-owned commercial banks and foreign banks.","[Yap, Woon Kan; Law, Siong Hook; Naseem, N.

We use a modified specification of GARCH-MIDAS and find that EPU increases the long-run volatility of the industrials and materials industries and decreases it in 4 of the 10 industries considered here: consumer staples, healthcare, information technology and materials. In addition, we add a dummy variable for the political cycle (PLC) to study whether the relationship between EPU and the volatility of industry returns is significantly different under different political regimes. The results imply that a Republican presidency dampens the effects of EPU on the long-run volatility of the consumer staples, healthcare and information technology industries. We also decompose the aggregated EPU into 11 category-specific EPUs to explore the detailed relationship between category-specific EPU and long-run volatility driven by aggregate EPU. The results for the category-specific EPU are consistent with the findings for the aggregate EPU. In particular, the weakened effect of PLC on the relationship between EPU and the long-run volatility of industry-level returns is also confirmed by MIDAS regression with beta weight scheme.","[Yu, Honghai; Fang, Libing; Zhang, Sunqi] Nanjing Univ, Sch Management & Engn, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Du, Donglei] Univ New Brunswick, Sch Business Adm, Fredericton, NB, Canada",Nanjing University; University of New Brunswick,"Fang, LB (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ, Sch Management & Engn, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",lbfang@nju.edu.cn,,"Du, Donglei/0000-0003-0111-8572","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71301019, 71401071, 71472085, 71501131, 71672081, 71771117]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China: [Grant Numbers 71301019, 71401071, 71472085, 71501131, 71672081 and 71771117].",,10,8,9,1,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Moreover, it performs a step-by-step comparative analysis to evaluate similarities and differences in the convergence patterns of global real estate markets vis-a-vis global equity markets. Long-run results indicate that global real estate markets were less integrated than global equity markets prior to the crisis. Since the crisis, however, both global real estate and global equity markets have become highly integrated with the U.S. real estate and equity markets, respectively, and have fully converged. Short-run analyses indicate that during the pre-crisis period, global real estate markets were highly exogenous and independent. In contrast, global equity markets were comparatively more interdependent with one another and more endogenous. After the crisis, however, both global real estate and equity markets reacted strongly to shocks emanating from the U.S. markets, although the impact of the U.S. real estate market on the global real estate market is more pronounced than the effect of the U.S. equity market on the global equity markets. Finally, the study shows that U.S. real estate and equity markets are the channels of transmission or the sources of trends that drive global markets over the long-run and the short-run.","[Yunus, Nafeesa] Univ Baltimore, Merrick Sch Business, Dept Finance & Econ, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Baltimore,"Yunus, N (通讯作者)，Univ Baltimore, Merrick Sch Business, Dept Finance & Econ, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.",Nafeesa.yunus@gmail.com,,,,,,,74,6,7,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The empirical analysis is divided into two parts. Firstly, we examine the impact of macroeconomic uncertainty on short and long correlation between gold and the dollar. Secondly, we analyse the explanatory power of economic uncertainty for the abnormal market relation between gold and the dollar with a threshold model. In particular, we investigate impacts of economic uncertainty sourced from different economies. The empirical results indicate that economic uncertainty generates direct impacts on the correlation between gold and the dollar. Moreover, our results emphasize that uncertainty sourced from different economies have different impacts on the dynamics between gold and the dollar. This article also presents the relative contribution of gold and the dollar shocks to the likelihood of being in the high-uncertainty regime. These results have implications for risk management, international asset allocation and hedging strategies.","[Zhou, Yimin] Perking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Han, Liyan] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yin, Libo] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, 39 South Coll RD, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Beihang University; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Yin, LB (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, 39 South Coll RD, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",yinlibowsxbb@126.com,"Yin, Libo/AAJ-1976-2021; Yin, Libo/Q-7525-2017","Yin, Libo/0000-0003-0193-6735;","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71671193, 71371022]; Program for Innovation Research in the Central University of Finance and Economics; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2016M600001]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for Innovation Research in the Central University of Finance and Economics; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),"This research is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under project numbers 71671193 and 71371022, the Program for Innovation Research in the Central University of Finance and Economics, and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation under project number 2016M600001.",,52,11,11,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We test our hypothesis by analogously applying the economic specifications employed in studies of pork barrel politics, including control variables regarding per capita income, regional financing systems, political variables such as support for regional governments from the same political party or the existence of pivot parties. The results support the theoretical conclusions reached by Treisman (1999), namely that non-sovereignist regionalism generates revenue while sovereignist nationalism or regionalism leads governments to react by applying unfavourable treatment. Similarly, the fact that a regionalist party plays a key role in the investiture of the national president brings with it even greater revenue to the region in question, concurring with the results predicted by Brancati (2008).","[Angel Hierro, Luis; Atienza, Pedro; Gomez-Alvarez, Rosario] Univ Seville, Seville, Spain",University of Sevilla,"Hierro, LA (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Seville, Spain.",,"Hierro, Luis A./R-9475-2018","Hierro, Luis A./0000-0002-5868-5589",,,,,97,1,1,0,4,"UNIV ZARAGOZA DEV COOPERATION CHAIR, SPANISH NETWORK DEV STUDIES",ZARAGOZA,"GRAN VIA 2, ZARAGOZA, 50005, SPAIN",1133-455X,,,REV ECON APL-SPAIN,Rev.

One approach posits that the Federal Reserve held misperceptions of the economy. An alternative explanation contends that policy makers shifted preferences from an output gap stabilization goal toward inflation stabilization after 1979. This paper develops a medium-scale macroeconomic model that incorporates real-time learning by policy makers as well as a (potential) shift in policy makers' preferences. The empirical results show that combining both views-distorted policy makers' beliefs about the persistence of inflation and the inflation-output gap trade-off, accompanied by a stronger preference for inflation stabilization after 1979-illuminates the role played by monetary policy in propagating and ending the Great Inflation.","[Best, Gabriela] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA",California State University System; California State University Fullerton,"Best, G (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Econ, Steven G Mihaylo Coll Business & Econ, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA.",GBest@fullerton.edu,,,"Department of Economics; School of Social Sciences at the University of California, Irvine","Department of Economics; School of Social Sciences at the University of California, Irvine","I especially thank Fabio Milani for his advice and help in many aspects of this project.

More precise information can help the sellers to make more targeted offers, and can yield multiple relevant offers and lower prices. However, information disclosure can entail costs via identity theft, fraud, extortion, etc. In this paper, we explore this trade-off in a model in which a monopoly platform can gather personal customer information, and offer it to other sellers. The consumers differ relatively to their aversion to information disclosure, and the platform can offer them menus with different disclosure levels. In equilibrium, options featuring greater disclosure levels command a premium, and information about the consumers choosing them is sold to the sellers at a lower price. If we compare scenarios with alternative menus, a greater number of options corresponds to a greater average disclosure level and a greater surplus. If the potential surplus from the induced exchanges is relatively large, equilibrium with a binary menu features levels of the platform's profit and the surplus close to those achieved with a continuum of offers.

We report the results of a real-effort experiment in which production requires the completion of two complementary tasks, at which workers have heterogeneous skills. We vary whether participants: compete individually; compete in teams where each member must complete each task; or compete in teams where the agents can divide tasks between them and potentially specialize in the task they do best. We report three main results. First, individuals who must work alone divide their work time in a way that is qualitatively consistent with the theoretical predictions, but allocate too little time to their weaker task. Second, there is no difference in productivity or free-riding behavior between individual contests and team contests where teammates cannot specialize. Finally, and most notably, when teammates can divide work tasks, they allocate more time to the tasks they are best at and experience a strong productivity gain. This is true even among teams that cannot communicate-despite the potential for coordination failure or coordination on Pareto dominated equilibria-but the effect is strongest when communication is available.

Understanding equilibrium selection in this setting is extremely important for safeguarding financial stability. In this paper one new potential factor that determines whether a bank runs gets triggered or not is experimentally studied, namely the psychological state of the depositor. Prior to participating in an experimental bank run game, subjects are either induced with fear, sadness or happiness using an autobiographical emotion induction task. The findings suggest that the presence of background fear significantly increases the likelihood of withdrawal and a subsequent bank run. In addition women are shown to be significantly more likely to withdraw then men, but only in the fear induction treatment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We develop a theoretical model with two main testable predictions: in a setting where agglomeration forces lessen the responsiveness of capital to tax, high-regime agglomeration jurisdictions should adopt a rent-taxing behavior, and they should react less to their neighbors' tax policies. The panel dataset spans the period from 1995 to 2007 and focuses on the local business taxes set at the French mid-subnational jurisdiction level of d,partements. First, instrumental variables estimates indicate that attractive jurisdictions capture a significant part of firms' agglomeration rent by levying higher tax rates. An increase by 1% of the localization economies indicator (a specialization index) leads to increasing the business tax rate by 0.43%. Second, local tax setting behaviors are characterized by a mimetic behavior, with best response functions that slope upwards. We propose a two-agglomeration-regime spatial lag model to estimate through ML the relationship between tax competition and attractiveness. Our main result shows that both are linked and tax mimicry is less pronounced if a jurisdiction is agglomerated. Specifically, in response to a decrease in the tax rate of neighboring local governments by 1%, local governments with strong agglomeration economies reduce their tax rate by 0.4% against 0.6% for local government characterized by a low-agglomeration regime. We show that the classical one-size-fits-all-case of a single regime of agglomeration suffers from a 40% downward bias for low-agglomeration jurisdictions. We draw the link to policy praxis by discussing the optimal design of equalization schemes.","[Freret, Sandy; Maguain, Denis] French Treasury, Paris, France",,"Fréret, S (通讯作者)，French Treasury, Paris, France.",sandy.freret@gmail.com,,,,,,,87,9,10,0,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Spatial econometric tools are employed in order to control for the potential spatial dependence existing across neighbour countries. Results suggest a negative effect of democracy and regime instability on growth, while it emerges a positive effect of legislature effectiveness. Spatial externalities seem to matter: being surrounded by countries with a high level of democracy stimulates growth, while regime instability in neighbour countries plays a negative effect. The level of legislature effectiveness in neighbour countries seems to have a negligible effect on the short-run growth in the home country.","[Ganau, Roberto] Univ Padua, Dept Econ & Management Marco Fanno, Via Santo 33, I-35123 Padua, Italy",University of Padua,"Ganau, R (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dept Econ & Management Marco Fanno, Via Santo 33, I-35123 Padua, Italy.",roberto.ganau@unipd.it,,,,,,,79,11,13,0,19,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

The evaluated screening methods include traditional structural measures (e.g., Herfindahl-Hirschman Index), measures derived from hospital competition models (e.g., diversion ratios, willingness-to-pay, and upward pricing pressure), and hospital merger simulation. Willingness-to-pay and upward pricing pressure are found to be more accurate at flagging potentially anticompetitive mergers for further investigation than traditional methods.","[Garmon, Christopher] Univ Missouri Kansas City, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Kansas City,"Garmon, C (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri Kansas City, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA.",garmonc@umkc.edu,"Gebhardt, Judith/JQV-4417-2023",,,,,,41,25,33,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0741-6261,1756-2171,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

We survey the relevant literature on this energy-efficiency gap by presenting two complementary frameworks. First, we divide potential explanations for the energy-efficiency gap into three categories: market failures, behavioral explanations, and model and measurement errors. Second, we organize previous research in terms of the fundamental elements of cost-minimizing energy-efficiency decisions. This provides a decomposition that organizes thinking around four questions. First, are product offerings and pricing economically efficient? Second, are energy operating costs inefficiently priced and/or understood? Third, are product choices cost minimizing in present value terms? Fourth, do other costs inhibit more energy-efficient decisions? We synthesize academic research on these questions, with an emphasis on recent empirical findings, and offer suggestions for future research.","[Gerarden, Todd D.] Harvard Univ, Publ Policy, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Newell, Richard G.] Duke Univ, Resources Future, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Newell, Richard G.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Stavins, Robert N.] NBER, Harvard Kennedy Sch, Energy & Econ Dev, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; Duke University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Gerarden, TD (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Publ Policy, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"Newell, Richard/I-3838-2015","Newell, Richard/0000-0002-3205-5562",Duke University Energy Initiative; Harvard Environmental Economics Program; Alfred P.

The nonrejection of the rationality hypothesis requires expectations' unbiasedness and efficiency. We show that in a model with t - 1 dating, where expectations strongly and positively affect the economy, the rationality test suffers from low power. It provides a high probability of nonrejection of the rationality hypothesis against numerous alternatives for expectations formation. This result is attained because the realization of the economy is driven by the public's expectations, irrespective of how well they are formed, via the structural relationship between them. The parameters in this test are predetermined by the parameters of the structural model, supporting expectations' unbiasedness under reasonable assumptions. Thus, successfully passing the rationality test could be misleading in terms of interpretation of the quality of the expectations and could lead to questionable accuracy of many applications.","[Ilek, Alex] Bank Israel, Jerusalem, Israel",Bank of Israel,"Ilek, A (通讯作者)，Bank Israel, Res Div, Kiryat Hamada St, IL-91950 Jerusalem, Israel.",alexei.ilek@boi.org.il,,,,,,,22,1,1,0,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

By utilizing measures of inflation expectations formed by consumers and professionals, a series of empirical applications are pet:formed to identify main driving forces of variations in inflation expectations. Tests of forecast efficiency consistently indicate that survey expectations are not rational, and thus the expectations of real-world economic actors, not rational agents in a model, are found to be what matter for price setting. As a logical consequence of these findings, we explore potential factors agents rely on when forecasting inflation by looking more closely on price changes in consumption expenditure categories as well as some key macroeconomic aggregates. Empirical results suggest that agents think differently how aggregate inflation evolves mainly due to the fact that each type of agents employs a distinct set of information, which can be interpreted as a dominant source of disagreement among agents.","[Jang, Byeongdeuk; Kim, Young Se] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, 25-2 Sungkyunkwan Ro, Seoul 03063, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Kim, YS (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, 25-2 Sungkyunkwan Ro, Seoul 03063, South Korea.",jbd1311@gmail.com; youngsekim@skku.edu,,,Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2016S1A5A2A01025841],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2016S1A5A2A01025841).,,39,1,1,2,7,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

We find that affirmative action does have a significant effect on the racial distribution of who is made an offer by the university. We also find that affirmative action is well targeted, with those who we estimate to be beneficiaries being of much lower socioeconomic status than those who we estimate are displaced by affirmative action.

In a theoretical and an experimental analysis of a sender-receiver game we investigate whether sanctions for lying induce more truth-telling. The novel aspect in our model is that senders may not only choose between truth-telling and (explicit) lying, but may also engage in evasive lying by credibly pretending not to know. While we find that sanctions promote truth-telling when senders cannot engage in evasive lying, this is no longer true when evasive lying is possible. Then, explicit lying is largely substituted by evasive lying, which completely eliminates the otherwise positive effect of sanctions on the rate of truth-telling. As outlined in our model, the necessary prerequisite for such an 'erosion' effect is that evasive lying is perceived as sufficiently less psychologically costly than direct lying. Evidence from our experimental data and a survey conducted with additional participants indicate that the shift towards evasion can indeed be attributed to lower psychological costs. Overall, our results clearly demonstrate the limitations of sanctioning lying to counteract the exploitation of informational asymmetries and may explain the empirical evidence from the finance industry that sanctions for financial misconduct eventually appear to be not very effective.","[Khahnetski, Kiryl; Rockenbach, Bettina] Univ Cologne, Albertus Maginis Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany; [Werner, Peter] Maastricht Univ, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands",University of Cologne; Maastricht University,"Werner, P (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",kiryl.khalmetski@uni-koeln.de; bettina.rocicenbach@uni-koeln.de; p.werner@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Rockenbach, Bettina/AAI-8072-2021; Rockenbach, Bettina/B-5447-2016; Rockenbach, Bettina/HRC-3842-2023","Rockenbach, Bettina/0000-0003-2624-1964; Rockenbach, Bettina/0000-0003-2624-1964; Khalmetski, Kiryl/0000-0002-9914-7947",German Research Foundation (DFG) through the Research Unit Design Behavior [FOR 1371],German Research Foundation (DFG) through the Research Unit Design Behavior,We thank the Co-Editor and two anonymous referees for very helpful comments and suggestions.

First, we outline the institutional background of the expansion in order to identify various re-distributive dimensions of the policy. Using Household Labor Force Surveys between 2004 and 2013, we explore whether college proximity affects local families' access to college. Our results show that this policy had an equity enhancing effect for daughters of low-educated households in some regions with large-scale expansion. Second, we investigate whether the compositional change has affected local returns to college degrees and contributed to the relative convergence across regions. The estimation results show that despite the increase in college graduates, returns in terms of wages at the local level has increased increasing and that some regional convergence was attained.

The migration of a household member might lead to an income effect which could reduce the labour supply of the left behind and/or to a substitution effect which would work in the opposite direction. Thus the total effect of migration on the left behind is an empirical question. This paper uses panel data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), and uses the wage gap sorted by education level as instrumental variable to control for the endogeneity of migration. The findings show that the time use of the left behind spouse and children is not statistically different from those same members of non-migrant households, suggesting that the income effect is offset by the substitution effect. The result proves to be resilient to various robustness checks. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In order to illustrate the impact of public policies, the model is calibrated using the data for a low-income country, India and a sensitivity analysis is reported under different parameter values. Based on the numerical analysis, this paper focuses on possible trade-offs in the allocation of government spending between two productive components, that is, social capital-related activities and education. The results of this paper show that an increase in the share of public spending on social capital-related activities through a cut in spending on education or vice versa entails trade-offs. However, the trade-off fades away and the net impact on long-run growth turns out to be positive for different parameter values in the case where a higher share of spending on education is financed by a cut in spending on social capital-related activities but a policy in improving social capital accumulation at the expense of education is always detrimental to long-run growth.","[Alpaslan, Baris] Yildirim Beyazit Univ, Fac Polit Sci, Dept Publ Finance, TR-06690 Cankaya, Turkey",Ankara Yildirim Beyazit University,"Alpaslan, B (通讯作者)，Yildirim Beyazit Univ, Fac Polit Sci, Dept Publ Finance, TR-06690 Cankaya, Turkey.",balpaslan@ybu.edu.tr,"Alpaslan, Baris/A-3541-2017","Alpaslan, Baris/0000-0002-7908-1557",,,,,31,4,4,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,NOV,2017,68.0,4,,,,,859,881,,10.1111/meca.12147,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FL1GT,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413963400010,0

This paper thus presents a mechanism that explains the effects of export processing zones observed in most of the transitional economies of the world. Results have practical implications for traditional structural changes expected for these economies.

This paper analyzes the reaction of capital tax policy in a given U.S. state to changes in capital tax policy by other states. Our study is undertaken with a novel panel data set covering the 48 contiguous U.S. states for the period 1965 to 2006 and is guided by the theory of strategic tax competition. The latter suggests that capital tax policy is a function of foreign (out-of-state) tax policy, preferences for government services, and home state and foreign state economic and demographic conditions. The slope of the reaction function - the equilibrium response of home state to foreign state tax policy is negative, contrary to casual evidence and many prior empirical studies of fiscal reaction functions. This result, which stands in contrast to most published findings, is due to two critical elements that allow for delayed responses to foreign tax changes and responses to aggregate shocks. Omitting either of these elements leads to a misspecified model and a positively sloped reaction function. Our results suggest that the secular decline in capital tax rates, at least among U.S. states, reflects synchronous responses among states to common shocks rather than competitive responses to foreign state tax policy. While striking given prior empirical findings, these results are fully consistent with the implications of the theoretical model developed in this paper and presented elsewhere in the literature. Rather than racing to the bottom, our findings suggest that states are riding on a seesaw. Consequently, tax competition may lead to an increase in the provision of local public goods, and policies aimed at restricting tax competition to stem the tide of declining capital taxation are likely to be ineffective.","[Chirinko, Robert S.] Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL USA; [Chirinko, Robert S.] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Chirinko, Robert S.; Wilson, Daniel J.] Univ Illinois, Dept Finance, 2333 Univ Hall,601 South Morgan MC 168, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Chirinko, Robert S.; Wilson, Daniel J.] Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, 101 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; Ifo Institut; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - San Francisco,"Wilson, DJ (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, 101 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA.",Chirinko@uic.edu; Daniel.Wilson@sf.frb.org,"Wilson, Daniel John/JNF-1962-2023","Wilson, Daniel John/0000-0002-4493-5380",DAAD; Einaudi Institute of Economics and Finance; Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco; IEB,DAAD(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); Einaudi Institute of Economics and Finance; Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco; IEB,"We would like to acknowledge the excellent research assistance provided by Charles Notzon and Joseph Pedtke and the comments and suggestions from participants at the American Economic Association meetings, the CESifo Area Conference On Public Sector Economics, the Econometric Society World Congress, the Federal Reserve System Conference on Regional Analysis, the International Institute of Public Finance meetings, the Journees d'Economie Publique Louis Andre Gerard-Varet, the National Tax Association meetings, the Western Regional Science Association meetings, and from seminar participants at the Barcelona Institute of Economics (IEB), Bank of Italy, Baylor, Bergamo, Davis, Deakin, Goethe, Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance, Kentucky, Max Planck Institute for Tax Law and Public Finance, Michigan, Monash, Nevada-Reno, Oxford, and Pompeu Fabra.

There are two distinct trade blocs, each of them consisting of a pair of regions. Direct and indirect trade between all regions is allowed, whereas factor mobility can occur only between regions of the same bloc. Given this more general geographical structure, as compared to previous studies, we are able to disentangle two manifestations of the market access effect: firms can take advantage of locating both in a more central region (centrality effect) and/or in a bigger region (local market size effect). The model is able to generate a plethora of long-term outcomes, including four equilibria with full agglomeration in each trade bloc that can be ranked by factor owners. Equilibria where industry is dispersed or agglomerated in a bloc and dispersed in the other one, are also possible as well as more complex attractors. Finally, by allowing direct and indirect trade between regions, we are able to look at the effect of trade integration on transit traffic by evaluating in a preliminary analysis the consequences of policies aiming at limiting transport volumes in a model with shifting industry.","[Commendatore, Pasquale] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Law, Via Mezzocannone 16, I-80134 Naples, Italy; [Kubin, Ingrid] Vienna Univ Econ & Business Adm, Dept Econ, Welthandelspl 1,Bldg D4, A-1020 Vienna, Austria; [Mossay, Pascal] Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, 5 Barrack Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England; [Mossay, Pascal] CORE, Louvain, Belgium; [Sushko, Iryna] Natl Acad Sci Ukraine, Inst Math, 3 Tereshchenkivska St, UA-01601 Kiev, Ukraine; [Sushko, Iryna] Kyiv Sch Econ, Dmytrivska St 92-94, UA-01135 Kiev, Ukraine",University of Naples Federico II; Vienna University of Economics & Business; Newcastle University - UK; National Academy of Sciences Ukraine; Institute of Mathematics of NASU; Kyiv School of Economics,"Sushko, I (通讯作者)，Natl Acad Sci Ukraine, Inst Math, 3 Tereshchenkivska St, UA-01601 Kiev, Ukraine.;Sushko, I (通讯作者)，Kyiv Sch Econ, Dmytrivska St 92-94, UA-01135 Kiev, Ukraine.",commenda@unina.it; ingrid.kubin@wu.ac.at; pascal.mossay@ncl.ac.uk; sushko@imath.kiev.ua,"Sushko, Iryna/AAE-8256-2020; Commendatore, Pasquale/AAQ-9669-2021","Sushko, Iryna/0000-0001-5879-0699; Kubin, Ingrid/0000-0002-0974-0174; Commendatore, Pasquale/0000-0003-2938-168X",EU project COST Action [IS1104],EU project COST Action,"This work has been prepared within the activities of the EU project COST Action IS1104 The EU in the new complex geography of economic systems: models, tools and policy evaluation.

The main finding is that an increase in income leads to a significant rise in HIV infections in autocratic countries while there is no significant effect in democracies. Further analysis suggests that increasing urbanisation and decreasing public health expenditure share in GDP in autocracies are the dominant channels behind such distinct comparison. After controlling for urbanisation and public health expenditure share, the effect of income on HIV infection rates shrinks drastically and is statistically insignificant.","[Ji, Ting; Lin, Faqin] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Lin, FQ (通讯作者)，39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",linfaqin@cufe.edu.cn,,,,,,,56,3,3,1,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

The PRC and its neighbours have collectively formed a regional production network, and the PRC is becoming an increasingly important source of final demand. Two empirical techniques are used to examine the likely economic impact of growth deceleration in the PRC on other Asian economies: (1) a single-equation approach that captures the trade channel; and (2) a global vector autoregressive model that captures the effects beyond the trade channel. The results of both analyses confirm that deceleration in the PRC will have a non-negligible negative effect on other economies, especially on East and Southeast Asian economies. An out-of-sample analysis to tease out the effects of slower growth in the PRC from the recent growth performance of selected Southeast Asian economies suggests that the PRC effect is contributing to the growth dynamics of this region but is not always dominant.","[Lee, Minsoo; Park, Donghyun; Ramayandi, Arief] Asian Dev Bank, Econ Res & Reg Cooperat Dept, Manila, Philippines",Asian Development Bank,"Lee, M (通讯作者)，Asian Dev Bank, Econ Res & Reg Cooperat Dept, Manila, Philippines.",mlee@adb.org; dpark@adb.org; aramayandi@adb.org,"LEE, MINSOO/HGE-5845-2022; Lee, Minsoo/AAS-7437-2020","Lee, Minsoo/0000-0001-6121-094X",,,,,13,1,1,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

The tax choice literature sees the choice among these as depending on the political costs involved. One source of such costs is (horizontal) inequity in the distribution of the tax burden. In this article, we provide the first empirical test of the question whether and to what extent such inequity affects tax choices. Using data on housing sales and tax policy in Flemish municipalities, we create an indicator for the inequity of the local property tax. The latter is levied on the property's assessed rental value, and its inequity is a by-product of the slow reassessment procedure, leading to a situation in which properties of identical value are taxed very differently. We find clear evidence that municipalities in which property taxation is more inequitable tend to rely less on this tax as a source of municipal revenue.","[Mahieu, Bram; Geys, Benny; Heyndels, Bruno] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Appl Econ, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Geys, Benny] Norwegian Business Sch BI, Dept Econ, Nydalsveien 37, N-0442 Oslo, Norway",Vrije Universiteit Brussel; BI Norwegian Business School,"Heyndels, B (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Appl Econ, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",bram.mahieu@vub.ac.be; benny.geys@bi.no; bruno.heyndels@vub.ac.be,,"Heyndels, Bruno/0000-0003-0721-1364; Geys, Benny/0000-0003-4524-1820",,,,,23,4,4,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,NOV,2017,70.0,4,,,,,622,640,,10.1111/kykl.12151,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FI6RL,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412123800006,0

In light of these constraints, we propose the use of a local autoregressive (LAR) model with a data driven estimation window, i.e., a local homogenous interval, that is adaptively identified to strike a balance between information efficiency and stability. When applied to three key macroeconomic variables of China, the LAR model substantially outperforms the alternative models for various forecast horizons of 3 to 12 months, with forecast error reductions of between 4% and 64% for the IP growth, and between 1% and 68% for the inflation rate. The one-quarter ahead performance of the JAR model matches that of a well-known survey forecast. The patterns of the identified local intervals also coincide with the characteristic evolution of the gradual reforms and monetary policy shifts in China. In short, the LAR. model is suitable for not only forecasting, but also the real-time monitoring of the effects of regime and policy changes in emerging economies.","[Niu, Linlin] Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ WISE, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Niu, Linlin] Inst Econ Transit BOFIT, Bank Finland, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Niu, Linlin] Xiamen Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Econometr, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Xu, Xiu] Soochow Univ, Dongwu Business Sch, Suzhou, Peoples R China; [Xu, Xiu] Soochow Univ, Dongwu Business Sch, Suzhou, Peoples R China; [Xu, Xiu] Humboldt Universitat Berlin, Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz Chair Stat, Berlin, Germany; [Chen, Ying] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Stat & Appl Probabil, Singapore, Singapore",Xiamen University; Xiamen University; Soochow University - China; Soochow University - China; Humboldt University of Berlin; National University of Singapore,"Xu, X (通讯作者)，Soochow Univ, Dongwu Business Sch, Suzhou, Peoples R China.",xiu.xu@hu-berlin.de,,,"Natural Science Foundation of China [70903053, 71273007]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through the International Research Training Group [IRTG 1792, SFB 649]",Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through the International Research Training Group(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"Linlin Niu acknowledges the support of the Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 70903053 and Grant No. 71273007), and wishes to thank the Babil Visiting Researcher Program for its hospitality during her research stay at BOFIT.; Xiu Xu acknowledges the support of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through the International Research Training Group IRTG 1792 - High Dimensional Non Stationary Time Series and the SFB 649 Economic Risk.",,56,0,0,1,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Our study finds that for its implementation to be successful, RRI needs to meet certain conditions, and that its implementation is not always beneficial to economic growth. To achieve a better result from RRI as part of an innovation policy, each country should balance the push and pull power of RRI to make sure that it becomes a building block rather than a stumbling block for innovation, economic growth and social welfare. To assure that RRI can be successfully implemented, China needs to strengthen and improve the participation mechanisms for stakeholders in major scientific and technological innovative activities.","[Yang, Panpan; Han, Bing] CASS, IWEP, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Yang, PP (通讯作者)，CASS, IWEP, Beijing, Peoples R China.",pamelapanda@126.com; helenacass@163.com,,,European Community's Seventh Framework Programme [321400]; National Natural Science Foundation [71503263],European Community's Seventh Framework Programme(European Union (EU)); National Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This article was written with support from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (Grant No. 321400) and the National Natural Science Foundation (Grant No. 71503263).,,20,4,4,1,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,NOV-DEC,2017,25.0,6,,,,,120,138,,10.1111/cwe.12224,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FM8VN,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000415369600007,0

More than two centuries of banking crises are considered, and a discrete-time duration model is estimated to identify the hazard function characterizing banking crises. The model makes it possible to identify a time-dependence effect in the occurrence of banking crises. The time dependence that emerges from the hazard function is potentially generated by a wide variety of structural and cyclical factors. In this paper, the hazard function serves a descriptive purpose and provides two insights into the frequency of banking crises. First, it shows the extent to which policymakers failed in muting the exposure to a new banking crisis during the two decades following a banking crisis. Second, it provides quantitative evidence that graduation from banking crises is elusive.","[Bouvatier, Vincent] Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Def, EconomiX CNRS, 200 Ave Republ, F-92001 Nanterre, France",Universite Paris Nanterre,"Bouvatier, V (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Def, EconomiX CNRS, 200 Ave Republ, F-92001 Nanterre, France.",vbouvatier@u-paris10.fr,"Bouvatier, Vincent/I-5961-2019","Bouvatier, Vincent/0000-0003-4802-1313","Forum sur les Institutions, le Droit, l'Economie et la Societe (FIDES)","Forum sur les Institutions, le Droit, l'Economie et la Societe (FIDES)","This work was supported by Forum sur les Institutions, le Droit, l'Economie et la Societe (FIDES, http://fides.u-paris10.fr/).",,34,2,2,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

The variety of results in this domain have produced some scepticism regarding happiness analysis, and in particular with respect to the measurement of reference-group income. We here use data from an original Internet survey in Japan to compare the relative-income results from happiness regressions to those from hypothetical-choice experiments. This kind of validation of experienced utility via direct comparison with decision utility remains rare in this literature. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Using large-scale data on family networks from over 20 million individuals in 15,000 villages in the Philippines, we show that candidates for public office are disproportionately drawn from more central families and family network centrality contributes to higher vote shares during the elections. Consistent with our theory of political intermediation, we present evidence that family network centrality facilitates relationships of political exchange. Moreover, we show that family networks exercise an effect independent of wealth, historical elite status, or previous electoral success.","[Cruz, Cesi] Univ British Columbia, Dept Polit Sci, 1866 Main Mall C425, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada; [Labonne, Julien] Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, 120 Walton St, Oxford OX2 6GG, England; [Querubin, Pablo] NYU, Wilf Family Dept Polit, 19 W 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA",University of British Columbia; University of Oxford; New York University,"Cruz, C (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Dept Polit Sci, 1866 Main Mall C425, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada.",cesi.cruz@ubc.ca; julien.labonne@bsg.ox.ac.uk; pablo.querubin@nyu.edu,"Cruz, Cesi/M-9344-2019","Cruz, Cesi/0000-0002-6108-5605; Labonne, Julien/0000-0002-3776-6726",,,,,75,94,105,1,33,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

Evidence from Movie Reviews,REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES,,,English,Review,,,,,,Media Economics; Bias; Conflict of Interest; Conglomerates,MEDIA BIAS; FILM-CRITICS; MARKET,"Media outlets are increasingly owned by conglomerates, inducing a conflict of interest: a media outlet can bias its coverage to benefit companies in the same group. We test for bias by examining movie reviews in media outlets owned by News Corp, such as the Wall Street Journal, and Time Warner, such as Time. We find higher ratings for 20th Century Fox movies in News Corp. outlets compared to movies by other studios. To disentangle bias from correlation of taste, we introduce and validate a novel matching procedure using individual movie ratings from online platforms. Using this procedure, we find no evidence of bias in News Corp. nor Time Warner outlets. We reject even small effects, such as bias of one extra star (out of four) every thirteen movies. We test for differential bias when the return to bias is plausibly higher, examine bias by media outlet and by journalist, as well as editorial bias. We also consider bias by omission-whether media outlets are more likely to review highly-rated movies by affiliated studios-and conflict of interest within a movie aggregator. In none of these dimensions do we find evidence of bias. We relate to previous work and discuss three explanations for the lack of bias in our setting: high values of media reputation, organizational features in a conglomerate, and low returns to bias.","[Dellavigna, Stefano; Hermle, Johannes] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Dellavigna, Stefano] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Dellavigna, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Dellavigna, S (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,39,16,20,2,42,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Native officials' promotions lead to a broad range of hometown infrastructure improvement. Hometown favoritism is pervasive across all ranks, even among officials without budget authority, except among elected legislators. Favors are narrowly targeted toward small communes that have no political power, and are strengthened with bad local governance and strong local family values. The evidence suggests a likely motive of social preferences for hometown.","[Do, Quoc-Anh] Dept Econ, 28 Rue St Peres, F-75007 Paris, France; [Do, Quoc-Anh] LIEPP, 28 Rue St Peres, F-75007 Paris, France; [Do, Quoc-Anh] Sci Po, Paris, France; [Do, Quoc-Anh] CEPR, Paris, France; [Nguyen, Kieu-Trang] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Nguyen, Kieu-Trang] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, CEP, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Tran, Anh N.] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, 1315 E 10th St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po); University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Do, QA (通讯作者)，Dept Econ, 28 Rue St Peres, F-75007 Paris, France.;Do, QA (通讯作者)，LIEPP, 28 Rue St Peres, F-75007 Paris, France.;Do, QA (通讯作者)，Sci Po, Paris, France.;Do, QA (通讯作者)，CEPR, Paris, France.",quocanh.do@sciencespo.fr; nguyenk@lse.ac.uk; trananh@indiana.edu,"DO, Quoc-Anh/D-1424-2009",,"French National Research Agency's (ANR) Investissements d'Avenir [ANR-11-LABX-0091 (LIEPP), ANR-11-IDEX-0005-02]",French National Research Agency's (ANR) Investissements d'Avenir(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),Do acknowledges support from the French National Research Agency's (ANR) Investissements d'Avenir grants ANR-11-LABX-0091 (LIEPP) and ANR-11-IDEX-0005-02.

Different from limited existing provincial studies on China, we use a multivariate framework that considers per capita human capital on top of physical capital in the neoclassical production function and advanced panel econometric methodologies such as Cup FM estimators and bootstrapped panel Granger causality tests that allow for cross-sectional dependence and provincial heterogeneity. Our results suggest that human capital exerts 2-3 times the effect of physical capital on the economy and energy also plays a significant role. Furthermore, the rich bootstrap panel Granger causality test results for both the panel and individual provinces provide substantial insights and suggest that it is important to examine the causal effects of both the total energy use and various disaggregate energy consumption before local governments make specific energy and economic policies.
