This paper assesses the potential for local and regional governments to implement innovative solutions to the demands of managing urban spaces through a case study of the much talked about case of Lagos state in Nigeria. Drawing on over 100 elite interviews and a representative panel survey of Lagosians, we explain how political leaders at the sub-national level were able to embark on a process of impressive statebuilding and institutional transformation. More specifically, the article develops a comparative analysis of the tax and transport sectors to identify the conditions required for sub-national innovation, demonstrating how federal democracy, strong economic potential, political competition, the ability to mobilize public support, and elite commitment to build a functional mega-city combined to enable state-level politicians to overcome a number of potential barriers to reform. While this suggests that empowering regional and local actors can facilitate more responsive and effective government, we argue that the necessary conditions for sub-national statebuilding are rare and can only be found in a small number of African states. As a result, the lessons from Lagos cannot easily be applied elsewhere.","[Cheeseman, Nic] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [de Gramont, Diane] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",University of Birmingham; Yale University,"Cheeseman, N (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",n.cheeseman@bham.ac.uk; didigramont@gmail.com,"Cheeseman, Nicholas/AAT-4730-2021","Cheeseman, Nicholas/0000-0002-0922-7514",,,,,56,33,35,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

As in perfect competition, a trade surplus involves an income transfer to the deficit country and possibly a terms-of-trade deterioration. Unlike the conventional wisdom, however, trade imbalances do not impose any double burden on surplus countries. This is because of a production-delocation effect, which leads to a reduction in the local price index. In the presence of intermediate goods, new results arise: A trade surplus may lead to an appreciation of the exchange rate, to a terms-of-trade improvement and even to a welfare increase. Numerical simulations show that, under realistic assumptions about preferences and technology, the beneficial price-index effect can significantly reduce the direct cost of the transfer.

U.S. Department of Energy hourly residential profiles for five locations, 20 years of hourly weather data, prevailing electricity pricing rate schedules, and purchase prices and solar panel and wind turbine power output response functions, were used to address the objectives. Two commercially available household solar panels (4 kW, 12 kW), two wind turbines (6 kW, 12 kW), and two price rate structures (traditional meter, smart meter) were considered. Averaged across the five households, the carbon tax is expected to reduce annual consumption by 4.4% (552 kWh/year) for traditional meter households and by 4.9% (611 kWh/year) for households charged smart meter rates. The carbon tax increases electricity cost by 19% ($202/year). For a household cost of $202/year the carbon tax is expected to reduce social costs by $11. Annual carbon tax collections of $234/household are expected. Adding the carbon tax was found to be insufficient to incentivize households to install either a solar panel or wind turbine system. Installation of a 4 kW solar system would increase the annual cost by $1546 (247%) and decrease CO2 emissions by 38% (2526 kg) valued at $94/household. The consequence of a carbon tax would depend largely on how the proceeds of the tax are used. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we investigate the effects of lagged bad and good uncertainties, daily positive and negative signed jump variations, and leverages on predicting good and bad uncertainties by in-sample and out-of-sample analysis. The in-sample results show that bad and good uncertainties have long memory property, and the predictability of long-term good and bad uncertainties is stronger than that of short- and mid-term good and bad uncertainties. The out-of-sample results indicate that lagged bad (or good) uncertainties, daily positive signed jump variation, and daily negative signed jump variation contain incremental out-of-sample information for forecasting good (or bad) uncertainties, and in most cases lagged leverages also play indispensable roles in forecasting the good and bad uncertainties in the crude oil market. Moreover, the results of out-of-sample analysis remain robust across using the other estimation window, other HAR-type models, and the other sample. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We show that, within India, the gradient is steeper for high-son-preference regions and religions. The gradient also varies with sibling gender as predicted.

J,"Lau, LJ; Zheng, HH",,,,"Lau, Lawrence J.; Zheng, Huanhuan",,,How much slack was there in the Chinese economy prior to its economic reform of 1978?,CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Economic slack; Transition economies; Reform; Surplus potential output; Centrally-planned economies,,"The existence of economic slack or inefficiency is a common phenomenon of economies that operate under mandatory central planning. It implies that the economy operates in the interior of its set of production possibilities and not on its frontier. It also implies that output can be increased without any increase in the inputs if the constraints which prevent the economy from operating on the frontier in the first place are removed. Thus, there is surplus potential output that is not directly observable and cannot be identified by conventional analysis of the relationship between inputs and output alone. The objective of this study is to attempt to identify and estimate the surplus potential output in the Chinese economy prior to its economic reform in 1978. This will help answer the question of how much of the Chinese economic growth since 1978 can be attributed to the reduction and elimination of the pre-existing economic slack. This question is important because the increase in output due to the reduction or elimination of the economic slack can only take effect once and cannot be continuing. It will also affect the attribution of the sources of Chinese economic growth. Our investigation suggests that a reasonable estimate of the magnitude of the surplus potential output of the Chinese economy on the eve of its reform is approximately 50% of the actual realized output in 1978.","[Lau, Lawrence J.; Zheng, Huanhuan] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Lau Chor Tak Inst Global Econ & Finance, Cheng Yu Tung Bldg 13-F, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lau, Lawrence J.] Stanford Univ, Econ Dev, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Zheng, Huanhuan] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong; Stanford University; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Lau, LJ (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Lau Chor Tak Inst Global Econ & Finance, Cheng Yu Tung Bldg 13-F, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",lawrence@lawrencejlau.hk; zheng@cuhk.edu.hk,"Zheng, Huanhuan/ISV-0894-2023",,,,,,11,9,10,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

The dynamic relationship between structure, industry and project is investigated from an integrative perspective, which is utilized to assess the role of national policy in reshaping the regional industrial structure. A new indicator is constructed to measure the differentiation of industrial structure of a province by employing data from 29 secondary industries of western provinces of China from 2000 to 2010. The basic result shows that the differentiation of industrial structure decreased instead of increasing during the past decade. Empirical evidence demonstrates that the dysfunction of the SIP interaction leads to decreasing differentiation of the industrial structure in a province. Specifically, the change of key industry is positively associated with the differentiation of industrial structure, whereas the role of project works in a contingent way. Moreover, the project in resource-industries plays a significant role in facilitating the differentiation of industrial structure while the projects in technology-intensive and high-tech industries do nothing. The findings in this study can provide suggestion for the government to improve the effect of development policies on the optimization of industrial structure in less-developed economies.","[Shi, Junwei] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, CIER, Wuhan 430073, Peoples R China; [Fu, Haiyan] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Finance, Wuhan 430073, Peoples R China",Zhongnan University of Economics & Law; Zhongnan University of Economics & Law,"Fu, HY (通讯作者)，Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Finance, Wuhan 430073, Peoples R China.",jwshi@znufe.edu.cn; hyjw.fu@163.com,,,"National Social Science Foundation of China [13CJY061, 11cjy004]",National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),"We thank participants of North America annual conference of Chinese Economist Society (2015), The conference on industrial economic reform and development under new economic environment (2013), Bi-week seminar at Zhongnan University of Economics and Law (2014) for their helpful comments on the preliminary version of this paper, Yuyan Wang, Jinjun Zhang, Ya Feng and Ernest Affum for research assistance and National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 13CJY061 and 11cjy004) for financial support.

It examines possible opportunities and challenges for co-development of the Eurasian Economic Union and the Belt project. Both projects and their co-development may reduce the uncertainty in Eurasia, caused by significant structural changes in international relations and the world economy, the emergence of new trade regimes and the erosion of leadership in international affairs. Russian interests in this regard are determined by the need for modernization and long-term development, which could also help to address acute security issues. These particular factors encouraged Russia to come up with an ambitious plan of the Extensive Eurasian Partnership, although the prospects of its implementation currently are uncertain. The present article argues that the success of Russia-China collaboration in Eurasia will depend crucially on the future dynamics of the Eurasian integration, as well as on the agreement to co-develop the Eurasian Economic Union and the Belt Initiative with concrete and mutually beneficial projects.","[Timofeev, Ivan] Minist Foreign Affairs Russia, Moscow State Inst Int Relat, Moscow, Russia; [Lissovolik, Yaroslav] Eurasian Dev Bank, Moscow, Russia; [Filippova, Liudmila] RIAC, Arctic & Asia Pacific, Moscow, Russia",MGIMO University,"Timofeev, I (通讯作者)，Minist Foreign Affairs Russia, Moscow State Inst Int Relat, Moscow, Russia.",itimofeev@russiancouncil.ru; lisovolik_yd@eabr.org; filippova.lyudmila@gmail.com,"Filippova, Liudmila/JNS-6307-2023; Timofeev, Ivan/AEK-3857-2022","Filippova, Liudmila/0000-0002-7302-3356; Timofeev, Ivan/0000-0003-1676-2221",,,,,29,22,24,1,97,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,SEP-OCT,2017,25.0,5,,,SI,,62,77,,10.1111/cwe.12214,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FH3YU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000411087300005,0

We invented a new cutting technology that reduces waste of the primary raw material and gave the technology to a random subset of producers. Despite the clear net benefits for nearly all firms, after 15 months take-up remained puzzlingly low. We hypothesize that an important reason for the lack of adoption is a misalignment of incentives within firms: the key employees (cutters and printers) are typically paid piece rates, with no incentive to reduce waste, and the new technology slows them down, at least initially. Fearing reductions in their effective wage, employees resist adoption in various ways, including by misinforming owners about the value of the technology. To investigate this hypothesis, we implemented a second experiment among the firms that originally received the technology: we offered one cutter and one printer per firm a lump-sum payment, approximately a month's earnings, conditional on demonstrating competence in using the technology in the presence of the owner. This incentive payment, small from the point of view of the firm, had a significant positive effect on adoption. The results suggest that misalignment of incentives within firms is an important barrier to technology adoption in our setting.","[Atkin, David] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Lahore Sch Econ, Lahore, Pakistan; Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Lahore School of Economics; Columbia University,"Atkin, D (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,"Chaudhry, Azam/0000-0003-0401-7099",,,,,73,79,97,1,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Instead, we construct experimental, real-effort labor markets and offer an evaluation of the theory in a controlled setting. We study both the wage differentials that evolve between firms with varying degrees of disamenity and how these differentials are affected by worker mobility and therefore selection. Consistent with the theory, we find that riskier firms must pay significantly higher wages to attract workers. Further, when workers are mobile, they sort into firms according to their attitudes towards risk and, as a result, the compensating differential shrinks.

Deaccessioning may be an option, although controversial, to guarantee the survival of cultural institutions. This paper addresses the consequences that deaccessioning may have on donations of artworks to museums, by developing a sequential game with incomplete information. We investigate the interactions between donors and museums, when the former is uncertain about the commitment of a museum not to deaccess part of its endowment in the future. Our analysis shows that deaccessioning may reduce art donations to museums. Interestingly, public grants to museums cause a negative externality to a committed museum, which experiences a reduction in donations. Results provide intuitions for the widespread resistance to deaccessioning of museum associations, for their efforts to enforce common regulation restricting the use of proceeds to the acquisition of art, and also for the proliferation of private art museums.","[Di Gaetano, Luigi] Autorita Garante Concorrenza & Mercato Italian Co, Piazza Verdi 6A, Rome, Italy; [Mazza, Isidoro] Univ Catania, Dept Econ & Business, Corso Italia 55, Catania, Italy",University of Catania,"Di Gaetano, L (通讯作者)，Autorita Garante Concorrenza & Mercato Italian Co, Piazza Verdi 6A, Rome, Italy.",luigi.digaetano.10@ucl.ac.uk; imazza@unict.it,,"Di Gaetano, Luigi/0000-0002-8532-1510; Mazza, Isidoro/0000-0001-7182-3619",,,,,15,5,5,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

The present study extends this strand of the literature, by comparing Islamic banks, conventional banks, and banks with an Islamic window with the use of a bank overall financial strength index. This index is developed with a multicriteria methodology that allows us to aggregate various criteria capturing bank capital strength, asset quality, earnings, liquidity, and management quality in controlling expenses. We find that banks differ significantly in terms of individual financial ratios; however, the difference of the overall financial strength between Islamic and conventional banks is not statistically significant. This finding is confirmed with both univariate comparisons and in multivariate regression estimations. When we look at the bank financial strength within regions, we find that conventional banks outperform both the Islamic banks and the banks with Islamic window in the case of Asia and the Gulf Cooperation Council; however, Islamic banks perform better in the MENA and Senegal region. Second stage regressions also reveal that the bank overall financial strength index is influenced by various country-specific attributes. These include control of corruption, government effectiveness, and operation in one of the seven countries that are expected to drive the next big wave in Islamic finance.","[Doumpos, Michael; Pasiouras, Fotios] Tech Univ Crete, Khania, Greece; [Hasan, Iftekhar] Fordham Univ, Bank Finland, 45 Columbus Ave,5th Floor, New York, NY 10023 USA; [Hasan, Iftekhar] Univ Sydney, 45 Columbus Ave,5th Floor, New York, NY 10023 USA",Technical University of Crete; Fordham University,"Hasan, I (通讯作者)，Fordham Univ, Bank Finland, 45 Columbus Ave,5th Floor, New York, NY 10023 USA.;Hasan, I (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, 45 Columbus Ave,5th Floor, New York, NY 10023 USA.",mdoumpos@dpem.tuc.gr; ihasan@fordham.edu; pasiouras@dpem.tuc.gr,"Pasiouras, Fotios/AAK-6582-2020",,,,,,49,59,61,1,31,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

We show that traders' private value of information about a firm's investment project increases with the ex ante likelihood the project will be undertaken. This generates an informational amplification effect of shocks to firm value. Information production by traders may exhibit strategic complementarities for projects that would not be undertaken in the absence of positive news from the stock market. A small decline in fundamentals can lead to a market breakdown where information production ceases, and investment and firm value collapse.

We estimate a price index for the Spanish art market that is used for a general historical analysis of art during this period, showing a large increase in the real price of paintings during the XVII century. Then we examine the price differential between domestic and foreign paintings: At the beginning of the century domestic production was priced substantially below imported paintings, but the price gap was gradually reduced during the century. We argue that such a price convergence was not the fruit of variations in real exchange rate, relative supply or home bias, but was associated with increasing prices for the new domestic painters of the XVII century. Increasing remuneration for painting may have induced artistic innovations by domestic producers and created the conditions for the development of the Siglo de Oro of Spanish art.","[Etro, Federico] Ca Foscari Univ, Fondta S Giobbe 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy; [Stepanova, Elena] St Anna Sch Adv Studies, Lab Econ & Management, Piazza Martiri Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"Etro, F (通讯作者)，Ca Foscari Univ, Fondta S Giobbe 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy.",federico.etro@unive.it; e.stepanova@sssup.it,"Stepanova, Elena/AAF-7111-2020","Stepanova, Elena/0000-0002-2924-4565",,,,,31,8,9,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

The paper offers a conceptualisation of the possible associations between Hofstede's cultural dimensions and social entrepreneurial activity as defined by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, along with its empirical testing across more than 40 countries around the world. Based on correlation analysis that was controlled for the countries' level of economic development, there appears to be a negative association between the national power distance level and social entrepreneurial activity. In addition, the rate of young social entrepreneurial ventures is associated with lower levels of masculinity. The cultural dimensions of individualism and uncertainty avoidance have no direct linear association with social entrepreneurial activities of any kind. In factor-driven economies, lower levels of masculinity appear to support the development of social entrepreneurship. On the other hand, in innovation-driven economies, social entrepreneurial ventures emerge more often in those cultures characterised by short-term orientation and indulgence.","[Kedmenec, Irena] Univ Zagreb, Dept Econ, Fac Org & Informat, Varazhdin, Croatia; [Strasek, Sebastjan] Univ Maribor, Dept Econ Policy, Fac Econ & Business, Maribor, Slovenia",University of Zagreb; University of Maribor,"Kedmenec, I (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Dept Econ, Fac Org & Informat, Varazhdin, Croatia.",irena.kedmenec@foi.hr,"Konecki, Irena/AGO-8355-2022; PENG, Xiao-bao/J-4466-2012",,Slovenian Research Agency [P5-0027]; University of Zagreb,Slovenian Research Agency(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia); University of Zagreb,This work was supported by the Slovenian Research Agency [research core funding No P5-0027]; the University of Zagreb.,,53,67,69,6,64,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

I examine a unique program employed by the Iowa Department of Transportation, where prior to 2013 prime contractors were allowed an exemption from a project's affirmative action requirement if their history of DBE utilization was sufficiently high. I find that prime contractors use the exemption to smooth demands on capacity constrained DBEs, building a history of utilization during low demand periods and exploiting the resulting exemption during high demand. The exemption policy was unexpectedly eliminated in 2013, which I exploit to evaluate its effect on DBE utilization and procurement costs. I find that average DBE utilization was unchanged and bids rose on affirmative action contracts.","[Marion, Justin] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Econ, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Marion, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Econ, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",marion@ucsc.edu,,,,,,,28,5,6,0,9,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7731,1945-774X,,AM ECON J-ECON POLIC,Am.

The intraday reactions to overnight developments are studied using cross-quantilograms, a new, flexible methodology that facilitates detailed insights into the quantile dependence between two time series. The results provide evidence for the existence of intraday reversals after overnight periods that carry very bad news, whereas the picture of the short-term reactions to very positive overnight returns is mixed. The observed rebounds concern extreme quantiles and occur with a short delay during the first part of the trading day. The study also shows that continuation and reversal effects are not mutually exclusive.

However, the extant methods either neglect the adverse impact on the financial system posed by a bank or ignore the various interactions among banks. To resolve this issue, the objective of this study is to put forward an expected default based score (EDBS) that overcomes the drawbacks of the existing methods from the perspective of contagion risk. This indicator measures the systemic importance of a bank by calculating the expected bank defaults triggered by its initial failure. In the empirical study, the expected default based score is applied to identify the systemically important banks in the Chinese banking system. Both the quantitative comparison with other major methods and the qualitative evaluation of the Delphi method validate the reliability of the EDBS method. The empirical results also demonstrate that interconnectedness among banks is an important and complementary driver of systemic importance in addition to asset size.","[Yao, Yanzhen; Li, Jianping; Zhu, Xiaoqian; Wei, Lu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Policy & Management, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Yao, Yanzhen; Li, Jianping; Wei, Lu] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; CAS Institutes of Science & Development; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Zhu, XQ (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Policy & Management, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",yaoyanzhen14@mails.ucas.ac.cn; ljp@casipm.ac.cn; zhuxq@casipm.ac.cn; weilu2014ucas@163.com,"li, jianping/A-9544-2012","Zhu, Xiaoqian/0000-0002-7854-2753","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71425002, 71601178, 71403251]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences [2012137, 2017200]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences,"This research has been supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71425002, 71601178, and 71403251) and Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences (2012137 and 2017200).

Our model includes exogenous growth, endogenous capital accumulation and debt, demand-driven production with a non-linear IS curve, a dynamic Phillips curve, and fiscal and monetary policy instruments. It has multiple steady states with different stability properties, and it is analytically tractable to a significant extent. We complete the analytical results with simulations. We find alternative growth patterns, endogenous fluctuations, and demand-driven level effects even in the long-run. For certain steady states the model shows saddle-path type instabilities, which lead us to reflect on fiscal and monetary policy standards.","[Almudi, Isabel; Fatas-Villafranca, Francisco; Jarne, Gloria; Sanchez-Choliz, Julio] Univ Zaragoza, Gran Via 2, Zaragoza 50005, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Almudi, I (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Gran Via 2, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.",ialmudi@unizar.es; ffatas@unizar.es; gjarne@unizar.es; jsanchez@unizar.es,,"Fatas Villafranca, Francisco/0000-0002-1246-6751; Almudi Higueras, Isabel/0000-0003-3766-9157",S10 Research Group (DGA-Spain/FSE),S10 Research Group (DGA-Spain/FSE),"We would like to thank Giancarlo Gandolfo, Giovanni Dosi, Mario Pianta, the Editors and three anonymous referees of Metroeconomica for their helpful comments on previous versions of this work.

Our analysis covers direct, induced, or indirect job creation, based on exports output and inputs demanded by exports. We carried out estimations of symmetrical Input-Output Tables (iot) from 2010 to 2020, as an instrument to analyze the impacts of exports on Spanish economy and employment. The main conclusions deal with Spanish exports within sectorial production chains, the spillover effect of those exports on the domestic economy, and, by extension, their effect on job creation and the balance of payments. Thus, one of the main contributions of this paper, not much explored in current economic literature, is the continuity of the entrepreneurial structure of Spain's export sector. This entails a dual structure: A very few high-volume exporting companies that create few jobs, and a large amount of small exporting companies that create more jobs. We surmise that this structure will continue to exist over the following years. A conclusion of our investigation is that as Spain's export sector increases its participation in global production chains, there will be few net jobs created by exported output.","[Dones Tacero, Milagros] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Econ & Business Sci, Dept Appl Econ, Madrid, Spain; [Heredero de Pablos, Maria Isabel; Ruesga Benito, Santos M.] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Econ Struct & Dev Econ, Fac Econ & Business Sci, Madrid, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Tacero, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Econ & Business Sci, Dept Appl Econ, Madrid, Spain.",milagros.dones@uam.es,"Heredero, María Isabel/A-4160-2011; BENITO, SANTOS MIGUEL RUESGA/AAG-2003-2020","RUESGA BENITO, SANTOS MIGUEL/0000-0002-9837-2261",,,,,48,6,8,0,9,"UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO, FAC ECONOMIA",MEXICO,"CIRCUITO INTERIOR S-N EDIFICIO B, PRIMER PISO, CIUDAD UNIV, MEXICO, DISTRITO FEDERAL 04510, MEXICO",0185-1667,,,INVEST ECON-MEX,Investig.

Individuals in my model must choose when and whether to complete a task, but may forget or procrastinate. A calibration exercise shows that assuming perfect memory leads to biased estimates of present bias because the rate of task completion at the deadline is much lower with imperfect memory. Naive procrastination explains why individuals do not set up reminders despite large gains to doing so. The model offers guidance for empirical studies of reminders, making a distinction between anticipated and unanticipated reminders: anticipated reminders can induce additional procrastination, lowering both welfare and the probability the task is completed.

A policymaker may try to prevent such a run by pledging to protect the interests of these stakeholders should a firm cease to do business. However, this promise also enables the firm to demand better terms of trade from its stakeholders, which blunts the policy's effectiveness. We show how to avoid such an adverse response by the use of partial, countercyclical insurance. Under certain conditions, such a scheme costlessly implements the first-best outcome in the limit as the stakeholders' information becomes precise. We also identify least-cost efficient schemes in the cases of large noise, learning, and duopoly. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In the early twentieth century, securities underwriters commonly held directorships with American corporations. Section 10 of the Clayton Antitrust Act prohibited bankers from serving on the boards of railroads for which they underwrote securities. We find that following the implementation of Section 10, railroads with strong preexisting relationships with underwriters saw declines in their investment rates, valuations, and leverage, and increases in their costs of external funds. Reassuringly, we do not observe similar effects among industrials and utilities, which were not subject to Section 10.

Using a monthly dataset on global stock indices, the BVAR model controls for co-movement commonly observed in global stock markets. Moreover, the time-varying specification of the covariance structure accounts for sudden shifts in the level of volatility. In an out-of-sample forecasting application we show that the BVAR model with stochastic volatility significantly outperforms the random walk both in terms of point as well as density predictions. The BVAR model without stochastic volatility, on the other hand, shows some merits relative to the random walk for forecast horizons greater than six months ahead. In a portfolio allocation exercise we moreover provide evidence that it is possible to use the forecasts obtained from our model with common stochastic volatility to set up simple investment strategies. Our results indicate that these simple investment schemes outperform a naive buy-and-hold strategy.","[Huber, Florian] Vienna Univ Econ & Business WU, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria; [Krisztin, Tamas] IIASA, Laxenburg, Austria; [Piribauer, Philipp] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA),"Huber, F (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business WU, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria.",fhuber@wu.ac.at,"Krisztin, Tamás/ABE-1438-2020","Krisztin, Tamás/0000-0002-9241-8628; Huber, Florian/0000-0002-2896-7921; Piribauer, Philipp/0000-0002-3414-3101",,,,,37,5,5,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

The paper finds that standard theories of wage setting and unemployment have difficulty in explaining these patterns and evaluates a number of alternative theories that do better in accounting for the new fact.","[Mueller, Andreas I.] Columbia Univ, Columbia Business Sch, Uris Hall,3022 Broadway, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Mueller, Andreas I.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Mueller, Andreas I.] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Columbia University; National Bureau of Economic Research; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Mueller, AI (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Columbia Business Sch, Uris Hall,3022 Broadway, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Mueller, AI (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Mueller, AI (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.",amueller@columbia.edu,"Mueller, Andreas I/N-3400-2014; Mueller, Andreas I/ITT-1344-2023","Mueller, Andreas I/0000-0002-1542-4960;",Handelsbanken's Research Foundations; Mannerfelt Foundation,Handelsbanken's Research Foundations; Mannerfelt Foundation,"I am grateful to four anonymous referees as well as to Per Krusell, John Hassler, Torsten Persson, Alan Krueger, Mark Aguiar, Dale Mortensen, Jonathan Parker, Mark Bils, Yongsung Chang, Erik Hurst, Thijs van Rens, Fabrizio Zilibotti, Pascal Michaillat, Aysegul Sahin, Mike Elsby, Almut Balleer, Phillippe Aghion, Valerie A.

Within these models, speculators apply technical and fundamental analysis to predict asset prices. Since destabilizing technical trading dominates the market near the fundamental value, asset prices tend to be either overvalued or undervalued. Interestingly, the bimodality of the distribution of the S&P 500's distortion confirms an implicit prediction of a number of seminal agent-based financial market models. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The huge gap between urban and rural education is embedded in the disparity in educational investment, children's educational attainment, school quality and the returns to education. Migrant children move with their parents to urban cities to pursue a better education. However, the Chinese household registration system (hukou system) limits migrant children's rights and access to basic education in the cities. Will migrant children benefit from a better-quality education in the cities, or will they continue to be constrained by their hukou registration? Will the large-scale internal rural-urban migration provide the opportunity to reduce rural-urban education inequality in China, or will it merely create a new education-poverty trap? Based on publicly available large-scale survey data (RUMiC), this paper applies logistic regression and survival analysis to illustrate the new education-poverty trap imposed on migrant children by the institutional constraints and hierarchies in children's education, created by the Chinese household registration system in Chinese cities.

Our findings show that higher share of non-interest income yields higher profits and risk-adjusted profits; in particular when banks are involved in more trading activities. The results indicate that private foreign banks earn more risk adjusted profits compared to public sector and private domestic banks. Furthermore, we also find that income diversification benefits more to the banks that have lower asset quality compared to the banks that have higher asset quality. The findings are insensitive to dynamic panel data estimations and alternative sample specification. The results of this paper provide valuable insights for policymakers, and conclude that ensuring diversification activities enhances bank profitability, in particular for the banks that have lower asset quality.","[Ahamed, M.

Our unique dataset on earnings inclusive and exclusive of these SSC enables us to apply the methodology by Alvaredo et al.

First, our finding of a smooth distribution of gross earnings indicates that both employer and employee do not shift their contributions. This contradicts the standard incidence prediction of full shifting of SSC to employees but corroborates recent findings. Moreover, it is hard to reconcile with the standard static model of labour supply and demand where gross earnings are irrelevant. Second, our finding of a discontinuity in labour costs supports our conclusion of non-shifting and renders out measurement error as an alternative explanation. Overall, these findings suggest that the statutory split matters and that the burden of SSC close to thresholds is borne by employers.","[Bosch, Nicole; Micevska-Scharf, Maja] CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, Bezuidenhoutseweg 30, NL-2594 AV The Hague, Netherlands",CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy,"Bosch, N (通讯作者)，CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, Bezuidenhoutseweg 30, NL-2594 AV The Hague, Netherlands.",n.m.bosch@cpb.nl,,"Micevska, Maja/0000-0001-7943-8504",Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research [464-11-091],Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"We thank Stuart Adam, Antoine Bozio, Thomas Breda, Koen Caminada, Julien Grenet, Peter Haan, Luke Haywood, Johannes Hers, Bas van der Klaauw, Pierre Koning, Arjan Lejour, Michael Neumann, David Phillips, Barra Roantree, Daniel van Vuuren, and Bas ter Weel for helpful comments.

Unlike in other cooperative firms, most REC members in Germany neither work for their cooperative nor do they receive goods or services from it. We document frequent controversial topics of discussion in annual meetings and how the organizational frame conditions influence modes of conflict handling by the involved parties. Using data gathered by participant observation of the annual meetings of 15 different RECs in southern Germany, we show by a qualitative approach that conflict handling by members of the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board and the rank-and-file during the process of decision-making ranges from highly cooperative to fully Competitive, but these styles tend to converge to collaborative outcomes, reflecting the members' shared commitment to the cooperative principles of the enterprise.","[Brummer, Vasco; Herbes, Carsten] Nuertingen Geislingen Univ, Nurtingen, Germany; [Gericke, Naomi] Alanus Univ Arts & Social Sci, Alfter, Germany",Nuertingen-Geislingen University (NGU),"Brummer, V (通讯作者)，Nuertingen Geislingen Univ, Nurtingen, Germany.",vasco.brummer@hfwu.de,"Herbes, Carsten/J-4566-2019","Herbes, Carsten/0000-0003-0670-8045; Brummer, Vasco/0000-0003-3541-6375","Ministry of the Environment, Climate Protection and the Energy Sector Baden-Wurttemberg in the BWPLUS program [BWE 13014]","Ministry of the Environment, Climate Protection and the Energy Sector Baden-Wurttemberg in the BWPLUS program","The authors would like to thank Judith Rognli for her invaluable help gathering data and fruitful discussions, and two anonymous reviewers for their comments.

Three personality traits have a significant negative correlation with financial risk taking, as measured by the holding and the amount of stock assets: Agreeableness, Cynical Hostility and Anxiety. For Cynical Hostility a belief-based mechanism seems to be at work, whereas the impact of all the other traits seems to pass through the preferences - rather than the beliefs - channel.

The supply of safe assets, private and public, has historically been concentrated in a small number of advanced economies, most prominently the United States. Over the last few decades, with minor cyclical interruptions, the supply of safe assets has not kept up with global demand. The reason is straightforward: the collective growth rate of the advanced economies that produce safe assets has been lower than the world's growth rate, which has been driven disproportionately by the high growth rate of high-saving emerging economies such as China. The signature of this growing shortage is a steady increase in the price of safe assets; equivalently, global safe interest rates must decline, as has been the case since the 1980s. The early literature, brought to light by Ben Bernanke's famous savings glut speech of 2005, focused on a general shortage of assets without isolating its safe asset component. The distinction, however, has become increasingly important over time, particularly in the aftermath of the subprime mortgage crisis and its sequels. We begin by describing the main facts and macroeconomic implications of safe asset shortages. Faced with such a structural conundrum, what are the likely short- to medium-term escape valves? We analyze four of them, each with its own macroeconomic and financial trade-offs.","[Caballero, Ricardo J.] MIT, Econ, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Farhi, Emmanuel] Harvard Univ, Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Gourinchas, Pierre-Olivier] Univ Calif Berkeley, Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Caballero, Ricardo J.; Farhi, Emmanuel; Gourinchas, Pierre-Olivier] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Harvard University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Caballero, RJ (通讯作者)，MIT, Econ, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Caballero, RJ (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",caball@mit.edu; efarhi@fas.harvard.edu; pog@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,38,106,126,0,15,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

We exploit a unique dataset that contains a rich set of administrative information on individuals newly entering unemployment in Germany, as well as several usually unobserved characteristics like personality traits, attitudes, expectations, social networks and intergenerational information. This allows us to empirically assess the effect of including these usually unobserved variables on the propensity score distribution, the matching quality, and the treatment effects obtained using unconfoundedness-based estimators. Our findings indicate that these variables play a significant role for selection into active labor market programs (ALMP), but do not make a significant difference in estimating treatment effects on wages and employment prospects. This suggests that the usually unobserved variables we analyze are not a threat to the validity of the estimated treatment effects, if comprehensive control variables of the type usually used in modern ALMP evaluations (which include labor market histories) are available. Our results also suggest that rich administrative data may be good enough to draw policy conclusions on the effectiveness of ALMPs.","[Caliendo, Marco; Mahlstedt, Robert] Univ Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany; [Caliendo, Marco; Mahlstedt, Robert; Mitnik, Oscar A.] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Caliendo, Marco] DIW, Berlin, Germany; [Caliendo, Marco] IAB, Nurnberg, Germany; [Mitnik, Oscar A.] Inter Amer Dev Bank, Washington, DC USA",University of Potsdam; IZA Institute Labor Economics; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Inter-American Development Bank,"Caliendo, M (通讯作者)，Univ Potsdam, Chair Empir Econ, August Bebel Str 89, D-14482 Potsdam, Germany.",caliendo@empwifo.uni-potsdam.de; mahlstedt@iza.org; oscar@mitnik.net,,"Mahlstedt, Robert/0000-0001-5086-6388",,,,,71,67,69,0,20,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5371,1879-1034,,LABOUR ECON,Labour Econ.,JUN,2017,46.0,,,,,,14,25,,10.1016/j.labeco.2017.02.001,0.0,,,12,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EZ4QN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000404697700002,0

This program offers a unique setting for studying the ageing population, given the rapidity of China's population ageing, traditions of filial piety and co-residence, decreasing number of children, and dearth of formal social security, at a relatively low income level . This paper examines whether receipt of the old-age pension payment equips elderly parents and their adult children to live apart and whether parents substitute children's time involved in instrumental support to them with service consumption. Employing a regression discontinuity design to a primary longitudinal survey conducted in Guizhou province of China, this paper overcomes challenges in the literature that households eligible for pension payment might be systematically different from ineligible households and that it is difficult to separate the effect of pension from that of age or cohort heterogeneity. Around the pension eligibility age cut-off, results reveal large and significant reduction in intergenerational co-residence of the extended family and increase in service consumption among elderly parents.","[Chen, Xi] Yale Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Chen, Xi] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Chen, Xi] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Yale University; Yale University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Chen, X (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.;Chen, X (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.;Chen, X (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.",xi.chen@yale.edu,,,"NIH/NIA [1 R03 AG048920-01]; National Science Fund of China (NSFC) [70525003, 70828002]",NIH/NIA(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); National Science Fund of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Financial support from the NIH/NIA (Grant No. 1 R03 AG048920-01) and the National Science Fund of China (NSFC) (Approval Nos. 70525003 and 70828002) and data collection support provided by IFPRI, China Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and Guizhou University are acknowledged.

It argues that a style of corporate behaviour-one characterized by a risk tolerant, even reckless, pursuit of short-term profits and a disregard for the interests of non-shareholder constituencies-is attributable in significant part to recent changes in corporate governance, including the rise of hedge fund activism, greater use of incentive compensation, and the appearance of blockholder directors. This trend will only be accelerated by the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States, because the consensus view is that 'tone at the top' is a critical factor in shaping law compliance and business ethics within corporations. This essay then surveys feasible responses intended to strengthen the role of the board as the corporation's conscience and superego.

The results of the Johansen cointegration test confirm the presence of a long-run relationship among the variables. The analysis of the short-run dynamics reveals that the impact of a shock to GDP on FDI is more significant than the impact of FDI on GDP. Furthermore, FDI exerts a stronger impact on exports than imports and Vietnam's inflation rate appears to play a crucial role in affecting the dynamics of some of the key economic variables.

A growing body of research has utilised within-country variation in conflict to address the concerns raised about the cross-country level studies on income and conflict. This study adds to this literature by examining the relationship between coffee prices and conflict across fifty-six districts within Uganda over the 2002-2014 time period. Using a difference-in-difference framework, we find that increases in global coffee prices lead to a higher likelihood of conflict in coffee growing districts. Higher coffee prices may relax credit constraints faced by rebel groups allowing them to finance armed conflicts. In addition, we find that higher coffee prices also lead to greater intensity in conflict as measured by both the number of conflicts and fatalities.","[Gong, Erick] Middlebury Coll, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA; [Sullivan, Katherine A.] Nomura Secur Int Inc, New York, NY USA",,"Gong, E (通讯作者)，Middlebury Coll, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA.",egong@middlebury.edu,,,,,,,32,5,5,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Half of this decline is associated with the declining incidence of jobs that start and end in the same calendar quarter, employment events that we call single quarter jobs. We investigate this unique subset of jobs and its decline using matched employer-employee data for the years 1996-2012. We characterize the worker demographics and employer characteristics of single quarter jobs, and demonstrate that changes over time in workforce and employer composition explain little of the decline in these jobs. We find that the decline in these jobs accounts for about a third of the decline in the fraction of the population that holds a job in the private sector that occurred from the mid-2000s to the early 2010s. We also find little evidence that single quarter jobs are stepping stones into longer-term employment. Finally, we show that the inclusion or exclusion of these single quarter jobs creates divergent trends in average earnings and the dispersion of earnings for the years 1996-2012. To the extent that administrative records measure the volatile tail of the employment distribution better than conventional household surveys, these findings show that measurement of short duration jobs matters for economic analysis.","[Hyatt, Henry R.; Spletzer, James R.] US Bur Census, Ctr Econ Studies, Suitland, MD 20746 USA",,"Spletzer, JR (通讯作者)，US Bur Census, Ctr Econ Studies, Suitland, MD 20746 USA.",Henry.R.Hyatt@census.gov; James.R.Spletzer@census.gov,,,,,,,20,17,21,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5371,1879-1034,,LABOUR ECON,Labour Econ.,JUN,2017,46.0,,,,,,166,176,,10.1016/j.labeco.2016.10.001,0.0,,,11,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EZ4QN,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000404697700012,0

Using a wind power investment model for Germany, I show that SFTs indeed deliver benefits for the energy system that over-compensate for their cost premium. Floating market premium schemes incentivize their deployment only where investors bear significant price risks and possess sufficient foresight. Alternatively, a new production value-based benchmark triggers investors to install SFTs that meet the requirements of power systems with increasing shares of variable renewable energies.

Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the distribution of endowments around the mean. We argue that skewness reflects the social distance between 'elite' players with high initial endowments and other players with lower endowments, better than variance and concentration measures like the Gini-coefficient. We hypothesize that elite players become more selfish with increasing skewness and therefore contribute less to a public good in the framework of a one-shot non-linear public good game. The results of an experimental test, in which we systematically vary the distribution of endowments between treatments, confirm that the model is able to correctly explain the observed pattern of contribution behavior. We find that cooperation and efficiency are lowest with right-skewed distribution of endowments. Our paper therefore improves the understanding of the behavioral link between inequality and efficiency. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This paper presents a growth model in which technological change increases the income share of reproducible factors at the expense of non reproducible ones. Agents are heterogeneous in wealth. Preferences imply that the saving rate increases with wealth. Consequently, assets (reproducible factor) are less equally distributed than raw labor (non-reproducible factor). This implies that technological change raises the share of the less equally distributed factor, increasing inequality along permanent growth path. When reproducible factors and the state of know-how are low, to adopt new technologies is not profitable, learning-by-doing and technological change ceases, arising stagnation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In a context in which the primary focus of management literature, especially of North American origin, concerns the concept and practices of social entrepreneurship, this paper explores the experiences of European social enterprises and in particular of Italian social cooperatives. Social cooperatives are experimenting with initiatives capable of responding to the emergence of new needs and changes in society in a sustainable way. Based on an analysis of the experience of various social cooperatives operating in the field of renewable energy sources, tourism, and the use of assets confiscated from the Mafia, this paper aims to highlight how social enterprise manages to create contexts of sustainable development, thereby building interorganizational and intersectoral collaborative networks aimed at the activation of new paths for local development. This represents evidence of the specific nature of the social enterprise, which is able to establish a number of coordination mechanisms. It creates new businesses with public and private, and profit and non-profit partners, with the aim of achieving a stated goal, or enters into contractual arrangements, in order to establish business partnerships and build entire local manufacturing supply chains. In this way social enterprise promotes interaction between resources of a public, market and community nature.","[Picciotti, Antonio] Univ Perugia, Perugia, Italy",University of Perugia,"Picciotti, A (通讯作者)，Univ Perugia, Perugia, Italy.",antonio.picciotti@unipg.it,,,,,,,72,39,39,4,120,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

Double moral hazard is significant because innovation by the principal implies that the optimal incentive contract satisfies monotonicity conditions. The analysis shows that the optimal incentive contract for delegated R&D is an option. Delegated R&D with simultaneous sampling results in shirking but delegated R&D with sequential sampling attains the efficient outcome. The analysis considers a combined problem with simultaneous and sequential search and gives sufficient conditions under which del6egated R&D attains the first best. The discussion also considers delegated R&D with stochastic innovation and with stochastic quality of inventions.

Although homelessness is strongly correlated with many social problems, the multivariate studies that adjust for conditions that co-occur with homelessness have found far fewer associations.

I also test the validity of the instruments by comparing estimates in countries which have or do not have an independent monetary policy reaction function. Another relevant finding is that the slope of the IS curve appears to have steepened over time since the 1990s, probably reflecting financial liberalisation.","[Stracca, Livio] European Cent Bank, Kaiserstr 29, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Stracca, L (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Kaiserstr 29, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany.",livio.stracca@ecb.europa.eu,,,,,,,22,1,1,0,3,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

The complementarity between exporting and investing in productivity enhancements is investigated by using descriptive regressions using rich, firm-level data for the period 2003-2011 for Turkey. The authors use three productivity measures for robustness purposes. The results show that firms that export both goods and services throughout the sample have higher productivity compared to all other firms in the sample. Another important result of the paper is related to the firms that switch from being goods exporters to goods and services exporters, which exhibit higher productivity than firms that export only goods or firms that switch from services exporting to exporting both goods and services. Finally, within-firm gains from trade as measured by the productivity growth of firms is insensitive to the services exporting status. More importantly, the authors observe no effect of any of export status of firms considered in this paper on their productivity growth.","[Dincer, N.

This article tests for VAM bias using a procedure that asks whether VAM estimates accurately predict the achievement consequences of random assignment to specific schools. Test results from admissions lotteries in Boston suggest conventional VAM estimates are biased, a finding that motivates the development of a hierarchical model describing the joint distribution of school value-added, bias, and lottery compliance. We use this model to assess the substantive importance of bias in conventional VAM estimates and to construct hybrid value-added estimates that optimally combine ordinary least squares and lottery-based estimates of VAM parameters. The hybrid estimation strategy provides a general recipe for combining nonexperimental and quasi-experimental estimates. While still biased, hybrid school value-added estimates have lower mean squared error than conventional VAM estimates. Simulations calibrated to the Boston data show that, bias notwithstanding, policy decisions based on conventional VAMs that control for lagged achievement are likely to generate substantial achievement gains. Hybrid estimates that incorporate lotteries yield further gains.","[Angrist, Joshua D.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Angrist, JD (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,"Angrist, Josh/ADL-8782-2022",,"National Science Foundation; Laura and John Arnold Foundation; Spencer Foundation; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1056325] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Laura and John Arnold Foundation; Spencer Foundation; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We gratefully acknowledge funding from the National Science Foundation, the Laura and John Arnold Foundation, and the Spencer Foundation.

We show that there may be a trade-off between these two channels. Higher levels of effective accountability may hinder the voters' ability to learn about the politicians. In turn, this may hinder electoral selection and be detrimental to voter welfare. This is because increasing effective accountability directly impacts how informative governance outcomes are about an incumbent's type. We show that, if politicians' effort and type are local substitutes (resp. complements) in the production of governance outcomes, an increase in effective accountability corresponds to a decrease (resp. increase) in Blackwell (1951) informativeness. We also show that effective accountability can vary even absent institutional variation. In particular, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for there to be multiple equilibria that differ in terms of both effective accountability and electoral selection.

We design a three-stage repayment game to examine how the existence of these ancillary activities affect repayment behavior and group attrition. In the first stage, the group borrows under joint liability, each member undertakes a risky project and decides whether or not to contribute to loan repayment. In the second stage, contributing members can vote to expel others from the group. Those remaining engage in a public goods game in the last stage. The public good game represents the non-credit collective activity that members can be involved in. We identify repayment equilibria with and without exclusion and show that exclusionary equilibria are most likely when loans are large and there is significant within-group heterogeneity in the gains from the public good. Results from a laboratory experiment that embodies the main features of the repayment game are consistent with the theoretical predictions. Individual decisions to contribute to loan repayment depend on gains from the public good and groups with the largest debt burdens have the highest rates of default and attrition.

The strongest result to emerge from the study consistently shows that inflation above two per cent negatively affects growth. Two additional parametric methods confirm this finding. Another important result is that high or very low levels of inflation are undesirable and are associated with lower growth - hinting that a growth maximizing value of inflation exists.","[Balcilar, Mehmet] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Econ, Via Mersin 10, Famagusta, Northern Cyprus, Turkey; [Balcilar, Mehmet; Gupta, Rangan; Jooste, Charl] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Balcilar, Mehmet] Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier, France; [Gupta, Rangan] IPAG Business Sch, Paris, France",Eastern Mediterranean University; University of Pretoria; Montpellier Business School; IPAG Business School,"Gupta, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.;Gupta, R (通讯作者)，IPAG Business Sch, Paris, France.",mehmet@mbalcilar.net; rangan.gupta@up.ac.za; Jooste.Charl@yahoo.co.za,"BALCILAR, MEHMET/K-7346-2019","BALCILAR, MEHMET/0000-0001-9694-5196",,,,,21,4,5,1,5,UNIV CEMA,BUENOS AIRES,"AV CORDOBA 374, BUENOS AIRES, C1054AAP, ARGENTINA",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

Using the difference-in-differences technique and employing The Harmonized System six-digit data, it is found that the tax rebate policy boosted the growth of textile exports to the USA. Approximately 6 to 25 per cent of the growth can be attributed to this policy. The difference-in-differences technique appears useful in evaluating such policies and opens the door to studies measuring the impact of polices. The effectiveness of the export tax rebate policy should be a lesson for policymakers facing slumps in their exports in economic downturns and perhaps become part of the standard trade policy arsenal.","[Bao, Qun; Li, Kunwang] Nankai Univ, Sch Econ, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Hou, Jack] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Econ, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA; [Hou, Jack] Henan Univ, Sch Econ, Kaifeng, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaosong] Renmin Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Nankai University; California State University System; California State University Long Beach; Henan University; Renmin University of China,"Wang, XS (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",wangxiaosong@ruc.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473254, 71673280]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors are grateful for the financial support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71473254, 71673280).",,14,6,6,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

Such a significant change might have affected the long-run relationship between oil and natural gas prices postulated by several authors. By using monthly data of oil and gas prices, as well as gas quantities from 1997 to 2013, we test for the presence of a long-run relationship, allowing also for possible breaks. We first show the stationarity of gas quantity data before the production of shale gas and the existence of a break in the trend (and in the intercept) on the integrated gas price time series, by the time shale gas enters the market. Then, applying a Vector Error Correction Model, we show that shale gas production has affected the relationship across variables. Gas quantities become relevant in the formation of gas prices after the beginning of shale gas production, while impact of oil prices on the gas ones doubles. However, on the basis of the available data, it is not unequivocally possible to assess whether or not a new long-run relationship between oil and gas has been established. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast to centralization, it is thought to offer a better match between the provision of public services and individual preferences. We test this fundamental hypothesis propounded by the fiscal federalism literature by analyzing the process of decentralization undergone by Spain since the beginning of the 1980s. We exploit survey data in which respondents (coded according to their region of residence) are asked about their level of satisfaction with the provision of public goods. A higher degree of satisfaction is expressed when responsibility for education and health expenditure is assigned to the intermediate tier of government rather than to central government. This level of satisfaction, however, is not recorded in the case of Spain's largest regions. Likewise, the simultaneous presence of tax revenue decentralization does not guarantee further welfare gains. In the case of the administration of justicewhere the nature of the responsibility assigned to some regional governments is of a merely administrative naturedecentralization does not appear to have any impact on the level of satisfaction expressed.","[Espasa, Marta; Esteller-More, Alejandro] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ, Barcelona, Spain; [Espasa, Marta; Esteller-More, Alejandro; Mora, Toni] IEB, Barcelona, Spain; [Mora, Toni] Univ Int Catalunya Barcelona, Sch Econ & Social Sci, Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona; Universitat Internacional de Catalunya (UIC),"Esteller-Moré, A (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ, Barcelona, Spain.;Esteller-Moré, A (通讯作者)，IEB, Barcelona, Spain.",mespasa@ub.edu; aesteller@ub.edu; tmora@uic.es,"Esteller, Manel/L-5956-2014; Mora, Toni/I-4358-2012","Esteller, Manel/0000-0003-4490-6093; Mora, Toni/0000-0002-2686-5307","Institut d'Estudis Autonomics (Generalitat de Catalunya); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness/FEDER [ECO2012-37131, ECO2012-37873, ECO2013-48217-C2-1-R]; [2014SGR420]; [2014SGR1360]",Institut d'Estudis Autonomics (Generalitat de Catalunya)(Generalitat de Catalunya); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness/FEDER; ;,"Marta Espasa and Alejandro Esteller-More (corresponding author), Departament d'Economia, Universitat de Barcelona, and Institut d'Economia de Barcelona (IEB), Barcelona, Spain, E-mail: mespasa@ub.edu, aesteller@ub.edu; Toni Mora, School of Economic and Social Sciences, Universitat Internacional de Catalunya Barcelona, Spain, and IEB E-mail: tmora@uic.es.

Firms can choose to innovate or to imitate by hiring a worker from a firm that has already innovated. We show that if innovating firms can commit to long-term wage contracts with their workers, productivity spillovers are fully internalized. If firms cannot commit to long-term wage contracts, there is too little innovation and too much imitation in equilibrium. Our model is tractable and allows us to analyze welfare effects of various policies in the limited commitment case. We find that subsidizing innovation and taxing imitation improves welfare. Moreover, allowing innovating firms to charge different forms of fees or rent out workers to imitating firms may also improve welfare.

Recent analyses show that the Netherlands would play an important role in replacing Russian supplies in Germany and France in case of a Russian export disruption. Lately, however, the Netherlands have suffered from a series of earthquakes that are related to the natural gas production in the major Groningen field. By consequence, natural gas production rates - that are politically mandated in the Netherlands - have been substantially reduced, by almost 45% in 2015 compared to 2013-levels. We implement this reduced production path for the next decades in the Global Gas Model and analyse the geopolitical impacts. We find that the diversification of European natural gas imports allows spreading the replacement of Dutch natural gas over many alternative sources, with diverse pipeline and LNG supplies. There will be hardly any price or demand reduction effect. Even if Russia fails to supply Europe, the additional impact of the lower Dutch production is moderate. Hence, the European consumers need not to worry about the declining Dutch natural gas production and their security of supplies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Analyzing whether subjects choose contracts consistent with their risk preferences, we find that about 14% of all participants show inconsistent behavior and low decision quality.

We find greater intraprovincial fiscal decentralization is associated with more fiscal expenditure (growth) on local bureaucracy but less on local public goods, such as education and health care. In addition, the marginal effects of intraprovincial fiscal decentralization vary by county per capita GDP, suggesting that the role of fiscal decentralization depends on a local institutional environment that is tightly linked to the county development level.","[Qian, Tao] Zhejiang Univ, China Acad West Reg Dev, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qi] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, China Ctr Econ Studies, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Fudan University,"Zhang, Q (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, China Ctr Econ Studies, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",qiantaochew@zju.edu.cn; zhangqifd@fudan.edu.cn,,,Shanghai Pujiang Scholarship [PJ0001644]; Grant for Key Programs - Ministry of Education [13JJD790006],Shanghai Pujiang Scholarship(Shanghai Pujiang Program); Grant for Key Programs - Ministry of Education,Funding for this research was provided by the Shanghai Pujiang Scholarship (No. PJ0001644) and the Grant for Key Programs Sponsored by the Ministry of Education (No. 13JJD790006).,,36,5,5,1,26,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.

The novel data are obtained from Lafayette, Louisiana court records, and provide specific details about the ticketed driver as well as a wide range of violation characteristics. In contrast to the automated cameras, the probability of a ticketed driver being female is consistently and significantly higher when the ticket was given by a police officer. For African-American drivers this effect is less robust, though in general still positive and significant. This implies that police use gender and race as a determining factor in issuing a speeding ticket. Potential behavioral reasons for this outcome are discussed. The validity of using automated cameras as a population measure for police-issued tickets is thoroughly investigated and supportive evidence is provided.","[Quintanar, Sarah Marx] Univ Arkansas, Little Rock, AR 72204 USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; University of Arkansas Little Rock,"Quintanar, SM (通讯作者)，2801 S Univ Dr, Little Rock, AR 72204 USA.",smquintanar@ualr.edu,,,,,,,18,6,11,0,13,UNIV CEMA,BUENOS AIRES,"AV CORDOBA 374, BUENOS AIRES, C1054AAP, ARGENTINA",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

KEYNES; EMPLOYMENT; RISK,"Keynesian monetary theory focuses on money as a store of value, seen as a defence against uncertainty. Circuitist economists emphasize the role of money as means of payment and downplay its function of store of value. The paper, by drawing on Hicks's and Kaldor's contributions, suggests an approach in which the fundamental functions of money are those of unit of account and means of payment. The function of money as store of value is regarded as marginal, because in economies with well-developed financial markets it can be played by other assets as liquid and risk-less as money. The demand for liquidity as a defence against uncertainty is kept distinct from the demand for money. This approach to money makes it easier to develop a framework in which the Keynesian and circuitist approaches can be reconciled and co-exist.","[Sardoni, Claudio] Sapienza Univ Roma, Dipartimento Sci Sociali & Econ, Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Sardoni, C (通讯作者)，Sapienza Univ Roma, Dipartimento Sci Sociali & Econ, Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, Rome, Italy.",claudio.sardoni@uniroma1.it,,,,,,,54,4,5,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,MAY,2017,68.0,2,,,SI,,205,227,,10.1111/meca.12115,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,ER1IV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000398544500002,0

School latrine construction substantially increases enrollment of pubescent-age girls, though predominately when providing sex-specific latrines. Privacy and safety appear to matter sufficiently for pubescent-age girls that only sex-specific latrines reduce gender disparities.

The conventional view of NIMBY is based on two premises: first, that locally unwanted facilities are essential to achieve an important societal benefit and realize the public good; second, that selfish opposition of local community prevents the realization of that societal good. The NIMBY effect is studied as a conflict between the City of Prague and its city districts. The official documents of the Prague City Council and of the Prague City Assembly were searched to find examples of decisions on the location of unwanted facilities. The documents search was concentrated on five selected facilities: municipal waste dumps, services for the homeless, services for drug users, regulation of gambling facilities, and the system of parking zones. In the documents, the authors identified five types of approaches to NIMBY that are called financial compensation, fair distribution, local autonomy, gradual problem shifting, and consultation/cooperation. It was observed that city districts, lower level of public administration, behave as guardians of local interests if they communicate with a higher level of public administration, a guardian of global interests. As local politicians depend on their local voters, it is not surprising that they prefer local interests to global ones. This naturally creates an internal policy conflict in the city that is divided into smaller units.","[Dlouhy, Martin] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Prague, Czech Republic; [Hudecek, Tomas] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Appl Geoinformat & Cartog, Fac Sci, Prague, Czech Republic; [Hudecek, Tomas] Czech Tech Univ, Masaryk Inst Adv Studies, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Charles University Prague; Czech Technical University Prague,"Dlouhy, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Prague, Czech Republic.",dlouhy@vse.cz; hudecek@dr.com,"Hudecek, Tomas/W-3558-2018; Dlouhy, Martin/I-3913-2018","Hudecek, Tomas/0000-0002-2786-4699; Dlouhy, Martin/0000-0003-1028-1822",Czech Science Foundation [16-01821S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"This work was supported by the Czech Science Foundation under Project No. 16-01821S, and by the institutional support for the long-term development of science and research at the Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics in Prague.",,26,1,1,1,22,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

A multi country dynamic panel framework and the mean-variance efficient frontier are applied to 320 sample firms from eight European countries, divided into portfolios of low and high debt using the shari'ah screening threshold of 33%. We find that the firm's return and volatility change with changes in the capital structure.

First, we compare the effects of four different forms of decentralization, namely, fiscal decentralization, administrative decentralization, federalism, and aggregate decentralization. Second, we study the effect on three dimensions of government performance, namely, tax administration, business licensing and permits, and corruption. Third, the effects are judged in terms of the perceptions of nearly 100,000 business leaders located in 113 countries. Seven statements summarize our findings. First, fiscal and administrative decentralization improve perceptions of government performance. Second, federalism is associated with worse perceptions. Third, the effect of aggregate decentralization is ambiguous. Fourth, service industries tend to perceive decentralization more favorably than others. Fifth, large firms perceive decentralization less favorably than other firms. Sixth, the effect of the same form of decentralization varies in magnitude across the three government activities. Seventh, therefore, decentralization may not be oversold as a policy prescription to improve government performance; the form of decentralization and its contextualization in terms of the targeted area of government activity need careful consideration.","[Goel, Rajeev K.; Ram, Rati] Illinois State Univ, Normal, IL 61761 USA; [Mazhar, Ummad] Forman Christian Coll, Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan; [Nelson, Michael A.] Univ Akron, Akron, OH 44325 USA",Illinois State University; University System of Ohio; University of Akron,"Nelson, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Akron, Dept Econ, Akron, OH 44325 USA.",nelson2@ualuon.edu,"Nelson, Michael Shawn/GXF-4934-2022; Goel, Rajeev K/HPD-3780-2023; Mazhar, Ummad/D-4390-2015","Goel, Rajeev/0000-0001-9580-3196; Mazhar, Ummad/0000-0003-0784-6757",,,,,54,60,65,5,57,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

In a simple closed private one-good economy model, each theory is presented drawing on the relationship between the rate of profit and the rate of growth, as well as on the consideration of one major adjusting variable allowing for the convergence of the endogenous variables of the model to their equilibrium values. This allows for a systematic comparison of exogenous and endogenous variables, of the 'logic' or the chain of causalities in each of the approaches, and of the generation of the long-run equilibrium positions of the system. It is finally shown that the post-Kaleckian model is able to cover many but not all of the results generated by the old neoclassical growth model, new neoclassical growth theories, classical-Marxian distribution and growth approaches, and post-Keynesian Kaldor-Robinson and Kalecki-Steindl distribution and growth theories.","[Hein, Eckhard] Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Berlin, Germany; [Hein, Eckhard] Inst Int Polit Econ IPE, Berlin, Germany",Berlin School of Economics & Law,"Hein, E (通讯作者)，Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Berlin, Germany.;Hein, E (通讯作者)，Inst Int Polit Econ IPE, Berlin, Germany.",,"Hein, Eckhard/HQY-4102-2023","Hein, Eckhard/0000-0002-6542-6630",,,,,64,10,10,0,2,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

The self-exciting and mutually exciting properties of the jump-clustering model allow for illustrating internal and cross-sectional transmission processes. The results obtained suggest stronger effects from US to mutual markets than in the reverse case. Cross-sectional excitation dynamics in the spot markets are larger than in the forward markets. As a central result, we can observe that the results for the Hawkes-model parameters are more significant in the forward markets. Transmission dynamics beyond volatility determine the likelihood of contagion occurrence. The significance of the decay parameters towards the long term jump intensities supports the importance of abrupt fluctuations in the contagion discourse.","[Kilic, Erdem] MEF Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey",MEF Universitesi,"Kilic, E (通讯作者)，MEF Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey.",kilice@mef.edu.tr,"Kilic, Erdem/JBS-4046-2023; Library, MEF/O-1457-2019",,,,,,40,8,8,0,18,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Using a dynamic computable general equilibrium model on Indonesia, mineral export taxes were found to adversely affect urban and rural poverty but income inequality hardly changed as the decline in income in the higher income group is not significantly different to the decline in low income groups. However, if smelters for mineral ore are developed, then there is not only a fall in poverty, more so for the rural than urban, but there is some decline in income inequality. On the other hand, although the current imposed import tariffs do not affect poverty or income inequality, any further increases from the current low average MFN applied rates, will see a rise in rural and urban poverty and income inequality. By and large, any small improvements in the trade balance brought upon by the mineral tax and import tariffs are more than outweighed by the substantial decline in real household consumption expenditure due to falls in employment and wages, thereby leading to a fall in GDP growth.","[Mahadevan, Renuka] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Nugroho, Anda; Arnir, Hidayat] Fiscal Policy Agcy, Minist Finance, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Nugroho, Anda; Arnir, Hidayat] RM Notohamiprodjo Bldg 6th Floor,Jalan Dr Wahidin, Jakarta 10710, Indonesia",University of Queensland; Ministry of Finance of Republic of Indonesia,"Arnir, H (通讯作者)，Fiscal Policy Agcy, Minist Finance, Jakarta, Indonesia.;Arnir, H (通讯作者)，RM Notohamiprodjo Bldg 6th Floor,Jalan Dr Wahidin, Jakarta 10710, Indonesia.",r.mahadevan@uq.edu.au; anugroho@fiskal.depkeu.go.id; hamir@fiskal.depkeu.go.id,"Mahadevan, Renuka/AAA-1046-2019; Nugroho, Anda/JZD-4240-2024; Amir, Hidayat/R-8029-2018; Nugroho, Anda/AAV-7779-2021","Mahadevan, Renuka/0000-0003-4105-2993; Amir, Hidayat/0000-0002-9200-7466; Nugroho, Anda/0000-0002-7549-7619",,,,,59,24,24,1,46,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

In order to analyse the scope of cooperation, a three-stage technology agreement formation game is solved. First, countries decide whether or not to sign up to the agreement. In the second stage, the signatories (playing together) and the non-signatories (playing individually) select their investment in R&D. In this stage, it is assumed that the signatories not only coordinate their levels of R&D investment but also pool their R&D efforts to fully internalize the spillovers of their investment. Finally, in the third stage, each country decides non-cooperatively upon its level of energy production. For linear environmental damages and quadratic investment costs, the grand coalition is stable if marginal damages are large enough to justify the development of a breakthrough technology that eliminates emissions completely, and if technology spillovers are not very important.","[Rubio, Santiago J.] Univ Valencia, Dept Econ Anal, Valencia, Spain; [Rubio, Santiago J.] Univ Valencia, ERI CES, Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia; University of Valencia,"Rubio, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Dept Econ Anal, Valencia, Spain.;Rubio, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, ERI CES, Valencia, Spain.",Santiago.Rubio@uv.es,"Rubio, Santiago J./F-6329-2016","Rubio, Santiago J./0000-0002-2727-9756",Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness [ECO2013-45045-R]; Valencian Autonomous Government [PROMETEOII/2014/054],Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Valencian Autonomous Government,This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness [ECO2013-45045-R]; and the Valencian Autonomous Government [PROMETEOII/2014/054].,,30,14,14,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Our revised estimates show that the rate of return rose sharply from 1998 to 2014, which helps explain the strong investment drive. Second, we explore what caused the rate of return to rise.

A fixed-effects analysis of data from the Child and Young Adult file of the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth shows that, conditional upon receipt of some amount of child support, higher payment levels are associated with significantly greater odds of having private health insurance coverage and significantly lower odds of poor or declining health status.

Using a triple-difference approach and a synthetic control approach, we find that the tariff waivers substantially increased Pakistan's exports to the EU. The export hike occurred within a few months after the waivers became effective, and did not significantly depress exports by competing countries. While the export boost brought greater employment opportunities in the tariff-waived industries, we find little evidence that the greater labor demands from trade were particularly beneficial to the areas most affected by the floods. Our findings suggest that trade policy may complement traditional means of foreign aid but trade concessions alone may be inadequate, as the areas most affected by natural disasters may be poorly targeted.","[Cheong, Juyoung] Kyung Hee Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Kwak, Do Won; Yuan, Haishan] Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",Kyung Hee University; University of Queensland,"Cheong, J (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",jcheong@khu.ac.kr; d.kwak@uq.edu.au; h.yuan@uq.edu.au,"Cheong, Juyoung/AAJ-9607-2020","Kwak, Do Won/0000-0001-5443-1576",,,,,42,6,7,0,20,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

This paper uses the recently developed Debt, Investment, Growth and Natural Resources (DIGNAR) model to characterise optimal allocations of resource wealth, with a focus on the particular economic structures of fragile countries. This study adds to the existing literature by not only carefully applying the DIGNAR model to quantify key policy trade-offs facing resource-rich fragile Western African countries such as Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, but also by extending the model to account for the possibility of direct social transfers and of an endogeneous determination of the investment path based on fiscal rules. Key results, with far-reaching policy implications for accelerating inclusive growth stand out from the simulations. First, compared with a conservative approach based on the permanent income analysis, a sustainable non-resource deficit target is robust to the high uncertainty of resource revenues, while delivering growth benefits through higher productive public capital. Second, distributing part of resource revenues as transfers raises private consumption immediately, suggesting that a fraction of the resource revenue could be used to expand safety nets in fragile states.","[Delechat, Corinne; Kabedi-Mbuyi, Malangu; Koulet-Vickot, Mesmin; Macario, Carla; Orav, Toomas; Rosales, Manuel; Zhdankin, Dmitry] Int Monetary Fund, African Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Yang, Shu-Chun S.; Gupta, Pranav] Int Monetary Fund, Strategy Policy & Review Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Yang, Shu-Chun S.] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Econ, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Clark, Will] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Tapsoba, Rene] Int Monetary Fund, Fiscal Affairs Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund; International Monetary Fund; National Sun Yat Sen University; International Monetary Fund; International Monetary Fund,"Deléchat, C (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, African Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",cdelechat@imf.org,,"Delechat, Corinne/0000-0002-5303-8454",,,,,71,1,1,1,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Selection of neighbourhoods into the programme was determined by a measure of neighbourhood quality. At first sight this is a textbook example for the application of a regression discontinuity design to estimate the causal effect of the programme on neighbourhood outcomes. Neighbourhoods close to the threshold should be similar before the programme starts. However, at the discontinuity threshold we observe a surprisingly large gap in the share of non-Western immigrants between neighbourhoods that were selected into the programme and neighbourhoods that were not. In addition, there is non-compliance with the assignment rule based on the quality index. The pattern of non-compliance is consistent with investing in neighbourhoods with a high share of non-Western immigrants. Finally, the way in which neighbourhoods were defined could be a likely explanation for the imbalance in the share of non-Western immigrants at the discontinuity threshold.","[Gerritsen, Sander] CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, The Hague, Netherlands; [Webbink, Dinand] Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [ter Weel, Bas] SEO Amsterdam Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [ter Weel, Bas] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands",CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; University of Amsterdam,"ter Weel, B (通讯作者)，SEO Amsterdam Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;ter Weel, B (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",s.b.gerritsen@cpb.nl; webbink@ese.eur.nl; b.terweel@seo.nl,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,MAR,2017,165.0,1,,,,,101,128,,10.1007/s10645-016-9287-y,0.0,,,28,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EM0JF,,"Green Published, hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395003900005,0

The case of Sweden,REVIEW OF ECONOMICS OF THE HOUSEHOLD,,,English,Article,,,,,,Self-employment; Fertility; Work; Family,DIVISION-OF-LABOR; FAMILY; GENDER; SIZE; TIME,"Previous studies, mostly from Anglo-Saxon countries, find a positive correlation between the presence of young children in the household and self-employment probabilities among women. This has been seen as an indication of women with young children choosing self-employment as a way of balancing work and family commitments. This paper studies the relationship between children and female self-employment in a country with family friendly policies and a generous welfare system: Sweden. The initial hypothesis is that we will not find evidence of a positive effect of children on self-employment among Swedish women since there are other institutions in place aiming at facilitating the combination of work and family. Using Swedish register data for the period 2004-2008 we do, however, find that the presence of young children increases the probability of choosing self-employment also among Swedish women. The effect is strongest for women with very young children, 0-3 years of age. These results also hold in a panel data model that takes individual unobserved heterogeneity into account. We also analyze time-use data and find, contrary to what has been found in many other countries, that self-employed women spend more, or as much, time on market work than wage-earning women. This raises doubts about whether women in Sweden chose self-employment as a way of balancing work and family commitments.","[Joona, Pernilla Andersson] Stockholm Univ, Swedish Inst Social Res, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Joona, PA (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Swedish Inst Social Res, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",Pernilla.andersson.joona@sofi.su.se,,,Swedish Research Council (VR),Swedish Research Council (VR)(Swedish Research Council),The author gratefully acknowledges financial support from the Swedish Research Council (VR).,,28,26,27,1,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Researchers using the same paradigm seek answers to similar questions, and employ similar methods and concepts. In an article published in 2000, the author of this essay introduced the term system paradigm, which focuses on the systems functioning in a society. This study develops the theoretical considerations outlined in that earlier article on the basis of experience on post-socialist transition. The first part compares the socialist and capitalist systems, describing their main characteristics, and concludes that the capitalist system has become established in former socialist countries, except for North Korea and Cuba. The second part analyzes varieties of capitalism within a typology which classifies prevailing forms of politics and government. Three markedly different types are identified: democracy, autocracy, and dictatorship. Huntington wrote about the third wave of democratization. This study concludes the third wave has dried up: for the 47 post-socialist countries, only a tenth of the population live in democracy, while autocracy or dictatorship prevails in all other countries in this group. The third part of this essay applies the conceptual and analytical apparatus to Hungary, where capitalism exists, and autocracy is the prevailingpolitico-governmental form here we can find important characteristics common to other capitalist countries or other autocracies. This finding is compatible with the observation that there are some, less fundamental, characteristics unique to Hungary, or Hungarica, which differ from the characteristics of all other countries.","[Kornai, Janos] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kornai, Janos] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Budapest, Hungary",Harvard University; Corvinus University Budapest,"Kornai, J (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Kornai, J (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Budapest, Hungary.",janos.kornai@uni-corvinus.hu,,,,,,,88,4,4,1,8,NECPLUS,PARIS,"16, RUE CLAUDE TILLIER, PARIS, 75012, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

We show that the appropriate adaptation of Maskin monotonicity to this context depends on the range of the mechanisms: the wider is this range, the weaker is the monotonicity condition to be used. As a result, mechanisms employing outcome functions which allow for out-of-range alternatives at off-equilibrium messages can Nash implement social choice rules which fail to be Nash implementable by mechanisms whose ranges are restricted to the range of the social choice rule to be implemented. The Walrasian social choice correspondence is a particular instance of this. Moreover, social choice rules which are not Maskin monotonic can be monotonized by the addition of artificial out-of-range alternatives-a point we illustrate through Solomon's Dilemma.","[Sanver, M.

Exploiting the timing of each offender's release from prison, I find that being released to a county with higher low-skilled wages significantly decreases the risk of recidivism. The impact of higher wages on recidivism is larger for both black offenders and first-time offenders, and in sectors that report being more willing to hire ex offenders. These results are robust to individual- and county-level controls, such as policing and corrections activity, and do not appear to be driven by changes in the composition of released offenders during good or bad economic times.

We provide stylized facts on the input sourcing strategies of these domestic firms, contrasting them with multinationals operating in the same industry. We then investigate how changes in firm input purchases from low-income countries as well as domestic market import penetration from these sources are correlated with changes in employment and wages at surviving domestic firms. Greater offshoring by domestic firms from low-income countries correlates with larger declines in manufacturing employment and in the average production workers' wage. Given the negative association, however, the estimated magnitudes are small, even for a narrow measure of offshoring that includes only intermediate goods. Import penetration of U.S. markets from these sources is associated with relatively larger changes in employment for arm's length importing firms, but has no significant correlation with employment changes at firms that do not trade. Given differences in the degree of both offshoring and import penetration, we find substantial variation across industries in the magnitude of changes associated with low-income country imports.

While North-North PTAs do tend to yield higher global welfare than South-South PTAs, a single South-South FTA may make free trade more sustainable than any other single agreement.

Little is known about why the US is characterized by high inequality and low mobility, while the opposite tends to hold for Scandinavian countries. In an overlapping generations model, calibrated to the US, education policies are endogenized via probabilistic voting. By exploiting cross-country variation in the bias in voter turnout towards the educated and elderly, the model replicates the negative relation between inequality and public education expenditures and accounts for more than a quarter of the variation in inequality and mobility. For the US, I find that compulsory voting could foster mobility, whereas inequality would be hardly affected. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A repeated game of incomplete information between a borrower and a sequence of lenders is considered. Lenders' beliefs regarding the borrower's type depend on the borrower's historical loan performance and other informative signals. It is established that for low beliefs, strategic defaults occur in equilibrium as the borrower defaults on his loans despite having the ability to repay them. Further, as the ancillary signals become increasingly informative of the borrower's type, the range of beliefs over which strategic defaults occur expands. This increase in strategic defaults highlights an unintended negative effect of allowing informative signals to influence beliefs. On the upside, the informative signals allow lenders to learn the borrower's type more quickly. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

By modeling the choice of electoral rule as a decision by the ruling rich-elite party before universal suffrage is enacted, this paper predicts that a loose constitutional constraint on targeted transfers is conducive to the adoption of proportional representation. To complete the theory, this work argues that the British empiricism and the Continental rationalism have their own views concerning the role and the power of a state, leading to differential levels of constraints on redistribution. Thus the theory explains why Anglo-Saxon countries tend to maintain majoritarian electoral rule. Employing the event history analysis with the two-stage-residual-inclusion approach, this work shows that countries with poorer executive constraints are more likely to adopt proportional representation. Meanwhile, we find evidence supporting that countries with British origin have been associated with tighter constraint upon the executive. Journal of Comparative Economics 45 (2017) 67-88.

The study uses micro data from the e-Business Survey of the European Commission. The dependent variables studied are binary ( presence or absence of process or/and product innovation). The explanatory variables considered are: suppliers, clients, market orientation, turnover growth and size. In addition, some national context variables - GDP per capita and R&D weight in GDP - are also tested. The results show that the sector of construction innovates, and the factors that contribute more to this innovation are suppliers and growth of business. It is also concluded that firm size is more relevant for process innovation than for product innovation, and companies that are guided by international markets innovate more than those that focus on local and regional markets.","[Barata, Jose M.] Univ Lisbon, SOCIUS Res Ctr, Lisbon Sch Econ & Management, ISEG,Econ Dept, Rua Quelhas 6, P-1200781 Lisbon, Portugal; [Fontainha, Elsa] Univ Lisbon, Econ Dept, Lisbon Sch Econ & Management, ISEG, Rua Quelhas 6, P-1200781 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa,"Barata, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Lisbon, SOCIUS Res Ctr, Lisbon Sch Econ & Management, ISEG,Econ Dept, Rua Quelhas 6, P-1200781 Lisbon, Portugal.",jmbarata@iseg.ulisboa.pt,"Fontainha, Elsa/B-3047-2008; Barata, Jose/N-8336-2013","Fontainha, Elsa/0000-0001-7870-3556; Barata, Jose/0000-0002-2953-6875",,,,,73,17,19,2,41,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

A narrative interpretation of CDM describes the chain from innovative activity at firms to increases in welfare and makes links to the policy environment. Filling in missing pieces of the innovation to productivity puzzle has a heavy data burden. The paper makes use of the micro moments database (MMD) that allows observing micro-level behavior and macro-level impacts of innovation and production in a large selection of European countries. Two examples are given of research using the MMD. First, we estimate a simplified system of innovation and production equations that can be applied to average firm choices and outcomes, as well as to industry or aggregate outcomes. We find that innovative activity contributes to aggregate productivity even while the average effect at the firm level is insignificant. Next, a cross-country exploration is made that shows heightened productivity effects of combined use by firms of various enterprise-level information and communications technologies.","[Bartelsman, Eric] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Bartelsman, Eric] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Bartelsman, Eric] IZA Bonn, Bonn, Germany; [van Leeuwen, George; Polder, Michael] Stat Netherlands, Heerlen, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Bartelsman, E (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Bartelsman, E (通讯作者)，Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Bartelsman, E (通讯作者)，IZA Bonn, Bonn, Germany.",e.j.bartelsman@vu.nl,"Bartelsman, Eric/ABE-2895-2021","Bartelsman, Eric/0000-0001-7099-8513",European Commission; EUROSTAT,European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); EUROSTAT,"This paper uses results from the ESSLimit and ESSLait projects, commissioned and financed by the European Commission and EUROSTAT.

Within these countries, there is a concentration of wealth in the hands of a few people. This fact confirms the analysis of Thorstein Veblen (1898) who shows the gap that exists between the vested interest of the rich and the unmet needs of the poor. The world happiness report (Helliwell, Layard and Sachs 2016) also shows for the emerging economies a gap between the world rank in economic growth and in wellbeing. I propose a new paradigm of development for two emerging economies, Brazil and South Africa, by putting human development in the center of economic development and by using different approaches in economics and psychology. My analysis links the theories of Carl Shapiro and Joseph E. Stiglitz regarding efficiency wages (1984) with the complexity approach (Le Moigne 1995). This approach combines the results of positive psychology (Kahneman 2011) with the role of local institutions for improving the economic development of emerging economies (Deaton 2016). In the first section of the article, I examine definitions of economic and human wealth. In the second section, I analyze the gaps that exist between the standard-of-living ranking and the wellbeing ranking for both Brazil and South Africa in order to present meso-happiness indexes linking the micro- and macro-levels of human wealth. In the last section, I analyze the way local institutions in Brazil and South Africa could create dynamic links for these countries' efficient functioning in the world economy.","[Baulant, Camille] Univ Angers, Econ, Angers, France; [Baulant, Camille] Univ Angers, Masters Program Competit Intelligence & Competit, GRANEM Lab, Angers, France",Universite d'Angers; Universite d'Angers,"Baulant, C (通讯作者)，Univ Angers, Econ, Angers, France.;Baulant, C (通讯作者)，Univ Angers, Masters Program Competit Intelligence & Competit, GRANEM Lab, Angers, France.",,,,,,,,58,1,1,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Using a Crepon, Duguet and Mairesse (CDM) model, we estimate an R&D-augmented Cobb-Douglas production function to assess the impact of R&D spillovers on firm performance. The results emphasize that international spillovers (from foreign affiliates to local firms) have a greater effect on firm performance than reverse spillovers (from local firms to foreign affiliates) and are more likely to be backward than forward. Moreover, the effect of backward spillovers depends on a firm's absorptive capacity and is amplified in the case of outsourcing relationships.","[Ben Hassine, H.; Boudier, F.; Mathieu, C.] Univ Paris Est, ERUDITE EA 437, UPEC, UPEMLV, Creteil, France; [Ben Hassine, H.] France Strategie, 18 Rue Martignac, F-75007 Paris, France",Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC),"Ben Hassine, H (通讯作者)，France Strategie, 18 Rue Martignac, F-75007 Paris, France.",haithem.ben-hassine@strategie.gouv.fr,,,Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) as part of the 'Investissements d'avenir' programme [ANR-10-EQPX-17],Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) as part of the 'Investissements d'avenir' programme(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),This work is supported by a public grant overseen by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) as part of the 'Investissements d'avenir' programme (reference: ANR-10-EQPX-17 - Centre d'acces securise aux donnees - CASD).,,41,23,23,1,53,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Welfare participation rates subsequently declined. Previous investigations of these declines focused on cuts in benefits and stricter eligibility requirements. This article focuses instead on work requirements, diversion, earning exemptions and time limits - referred to jointly as new welfare reform strategies - while controlling for benefit levels, eligibility requirements, province-specific labour market conditions and GDP growth, as well as individual-level socio-economic information. Province-year-specific variation in new reform strategies produce estimates implying that their presence is associated with a large decline in welfare participation of 1.3 percentage points (14% relative to the unconditional mean participation rate of 9.2%). Our coding scheme generates new measures of policy variation that distinguish reductions in benefit levels and tighter eligibility restrictions from new welfare reform strategies, helping identify how different subpopulations responded to different kinds of welfare reforms. Estimates from 46 subpopulations demonstrate that immigrants, native Canadians, single parents and disabled people were substantially more likely to be affected by aggressive new attempts to limit welfare participation than other Canadians receiving social assistance.","[Berg, Nathan] Univ Otago, Dept Econ, POB 56, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Gabel, Todd] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Econ, Arlington, TX 76019 USA",University of Otago; University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington,"Berg, N (通讯作者)，Univ Otago, Dept Econ, POB 56, Dunedin, New Zealand.;Berg, N (通讯作者)，Univ Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia.",nathan.berg@otago.ac.nz,,,,,,,64,5,5,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Classical inference methods have been generalized to the case in which moment inequalities and equalities define a set instead of a point. We review several instances of partial identification by focusing on examples in which the underlying economic restrictions are expressed as linear moments. This setting illustrates the fact that convex analysis helps not only for characterizing the identified set but also for inference. From this perspective, we review inference methods using convex analysis or inversion of tests and detail how geometric characterizations can be useful.","[Bontemps, Christian; Magnac, Thierry] Univ Toulouse, Toulouse Sch Econ, F-31000 Toulouse, France; [Bontemps, Christian] Ecole Natl Aviat Civile, F-31055 Toulouse, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; Ecole Nationale de l'Aviation Civile (ENAC),"Bontemps, C (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse, Toulouse Sch Econ, F-31000 Toulouse, France.;Bontemps, C (通讯作者)，Ecole Natl Aviat Civile, F-31055 Toulouse, France.",christian.bontemps@tse-fr.eu; thierry.magnac@tse-fr.eu,,,,,,,101,8,9,0,5,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4609-6,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

Using techniques introduced by Vincent and Mason (1967), the bunching region is identified by solving an unconstrained optimization problem.

We begin by using high-frequency identification and direct measures of FOMC private information to show that puzzling responses of private-sector forecasts to movements in federal funds futures rates on FOMC announcement days can be attributed entirely to Delphic forward guidance. However, a large fraction of futures rates' variability on announcement days remains unexplained, leaving open the possibility that the FOMC has successfully communicated Odyssean guidance. We then examine whether the FOMC used Odyssean guidance to improve macroeconomic outcomes since the financial crisis. To this end we usean estimated medium-scale New Keynesian model to perform a counterfactual experiment for the period 2009:Q1-2014:Q4, in which we assume the FOMC did not employ any Odyssean guidance and instead followed its reaction function from before the crisis as closely as possible while respecting the effective lower bound. We find that a purely rule-based policy would have delivered a shallower recession and kept inflation closer to target in the years immediately following the crisis than FOMC forward guidance did in practice. However, starting toward the end of 2011, after the Fed's introduction of calendar-based communications, the FOMC's Odyssean guidance appears to have boosted real activity and moved inflation closer to target. We show that our results do not reflect Del Negro, Giannoni, and Patterson's (2015) forward-guidance puzzle.","[Campbell, Jeffrey R.; Fisher, Jonas D.

Using an original data set of 180 contracts used by a local public buyer of social housing between 2006 and 2009, we show that limiting competition may enable economies to be made on transaction costs while the most efficient bidders still come forward, and that abuses such as corruption or favouritism do not result.

By looking at a cross-country panel dataset of 29 power markets around Europe over the period 1990-2012, we find empirical evidence that an increase of public ownership, as measured by the OECD ETCR index, is associated with a reduction of both greenhouse gas emissions and carbon intensity. We also find that the implementation of the European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) had a limited impact on emissions' reduction due to lax allocation of allowances. The positive effect of public ownership on environmental performance has been significant even after the introduction of the ETS, giving additional incentives to mitigate emissions when the ETS cap was not stringent enough. This evidence suggests that government control over power companies in Europe can has created idiosyncratic incentives to improve environmental quality, complementing environmental regulation in the achievement of environmental goals when the latter was absent or sub-optimal.

This article shows intermediary fundraisers can make donors insensitive to differences in charity quality: Unattractive charities can receive the same financial support as an attractive charity. In a series of across-subject experiments, when donations are framed as going directly to the charity, unattractive charities receive fewer and smaller contributions relative to attractive charities; however, when donations for the same charities are collected by (meaningless) intermediary fundraising campaigns, donations become indistinguishable across charities. The fundraising campaign does not affect donor recall of charity identity or evaluation of charity quality; it simply precludes donors from using these data in the donation decision.

When using public-private partnerships (PPPs), the amounts invested in the construction of such infrastructures may not be counted as public debt if certain conditions are met. But in PPPs, host governments often make payments and provide financial support, through various channels, generating direct and/or contingent financial liabilities. By using an option pricing-based model, this paper offers a method to quantify those liabilities for various forms of road PPPs. In particular, we focus on valuing debt guarantees, equity guarantees, and minimum revenue guarantees. Our method takes into account that in road infrastructures, the governmental payments are typically a function of the evolution of both inflation and traffic. We use an illustrative case for showing the magnitude of the contingent debt implied in such guarantees.","[Contreras, Carlos] Univ Complutense Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Angulo, Julio] ICIS, Madrid, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Contreras, C (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Madrid, Spain.",jcontreg@yahoo.es; ja@grupoicis.com,,"contreras, carlos/0000-0002-3917-2593",,,,,65,0,0,1,11,INST ESTUDIOS FISCALES,MADRID,"AVDA CARDENAL HERRERA ORIA, 378, MADRID, 28035, SPAIN",0210-1173,,,HACIENDA PUBLICA ESP,Hacienda Publica Esp.,,2017,,223,,,,,,,,,,,,33,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FT6OM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000423273500002,0

In particular, we study maximin efficient notions for an ambiguous asymmetric information economy (i.e., economies where agents' preferences are maximin a to Wald, 1950). The interest on the maximin preferences lies in the fact that maximin efficient allocations are always incentive compatible (de Castro and Yannelis, 2009), a result which is false with Bayesian preferences. A noncooperative notion called maximin equilibrium is introduced which provides a noncooperative foundation for individually rational and maximin efficient notions. Specifically, we show that given any arbitrary individually rational and ex -ante maximin efficient allocation, there is a direct revelation mechanism that yields the efficient allocation as its unique maximin equilibrium outcome. Thus, an incentive compatible, individually rational and efficient outcome can be reached by means of noncooperative behavior under ambiguity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

While economic models typically regard preferences as stable, a growing literature suggests that information, including how it interacts with intentions and attitudes, plays an important role in unhealthy behaviours. Relatedly, a large health literature demonstrates that theory-based behavioural interventions can successfully change risky behaviour. This study uses the contingent valuation (CV) survey method to investigate the impact of behavioural interventions on a novel outcome measure: the willingness to pay (WTP) to avoid the consequences associated with risky behaviour. Using novel pre-and post-intervention data from Project MARS (Motivating Adolescents to Reduce Sexual Risk), this study estimates the impact of the intervention on elicited WTP to avoid sexually transmitted infections (STIs). It is found that after the intervention, participants' elicited WTP to avoid STIs were significantly higher, and more sensitive to differences in infection severity. These results suggest that the intervention may affect risky sexual behaviour by changing the perceived value of avoiding the consequences of risky sexual behaviour. Additionally, these findings contribute to an ongoing debate regarding the construct validity of CV studies in health economics.","[Dealy, B. C.] US FDA, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Horn, B.

The reason for this finding is that with inflation, the money-illusioned agents always believe that the return on their savings is higher than it actually is. Because these agents trade financial assets in markets with the rational agents, the rational agents end up being borrowers and the money-illusioned agents lenders. Because the rational agents' debt accumulates over time, they become so indebted that the money-illusioned agents eventually consume the economy's entire endowment.

We take the Mexican economy as the case of study. Manufacturing exports constitute the most of exports and processing exports (maquiladora) represent an important part of them. We consider the indirect domestic value added contained in Mexican manufacturing exports, dividing them into exports from the internal economy and the maquiladora industry. We show that the internal backward linkages of exports are weak, that only a few sectors produce inputs for exports, and that the forward linkages are weak too because the Mexican maquiladora industry assembles imported parts and components into final goods for export. The actual picture is quite different from that presented by Hirschman [(1958) The Strategy of Economic Development. New Haven, Yale University Press], who argued that the manufacturing sector plays a key role to promote economic growth because of its dense forward and backward internal linkages.","[Fujii-Gambero, Gerardo] Natl Autonomous Univ Mexico UNAM, Coll Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Cervantes-Martinez, Rosario] Univ Guadalajara, Univ Ctr Econ & Adm Sci, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad de Guadalajara,"Fujii-Gambero, G (通讯作者)，Natl Autonomous Univ Mexico UNAM, Coll Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",fujii@unam.mx,,"Cervantes, Rosario/0000-0002-1524-0379","National Council of Sciences and Technology of Mexico (CONACyT) [10017, 152740]",National Council of Sciences and Technology of Mexico (CONACyT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)),"This study was sponsored by the National Council of Sciences and Technology of Mexico (CONACyT) [grant 10017, project 152740].",,13,6,7,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

For each model, three notions of precautionary savings are defined as indicators of the extra saving induced by income and background risk on the consumer's optimal choice.

Looking into this widely known event, this article presents formal empirical evidence establishing that (i) conditional volatility during taper talk exceeded that during actual tapering and (ii) volatility spillovers took place contemporaneously' from the US markets to the key EMEs during this period. The results suggest importance of careful communications by advanced economy central banks and the possibility of establishing rules of the monetary game'.

Financial crisis represents a setting that is tightly related to the concepts of audit risk and liability, where higher audit fees can be expected to account for increased audit engagement. The article identifies the characteristics of audit fees in Slovenia, a country with a relatively short auditing tradition. Since the establishment of the first audit firms in Slovenia in 1992, the number has consistently increased and reached 50 in 2007. This trend resulted in decreasing concentration and increasing price competition in the audit market for the large segment of non-listed companies. The aim of the article is to investigate the effect of the financial crisis on audit fees in Slovenia. Using the fixed effects panel model, our study provides evidence that financial crisis negatively affected audit fees in Slovenia. It seems that the negative effects on audit fees (reduced demand, increased competition and cost reduction measures) outweigh the opposing positive effect on audit fees resulting from increased audit engagement.","[Groff, Maja Zaman; Iglicar, Aleksander] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Acad Unit Accounting & Auditing, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Trobec, Domen] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Acad Unit Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana; University of Ljubljana,"Groff, MZ (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Acad Unit Accounting & Auditing, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",maja.zaman@ef.uni-lj.si,,"Zaman Groff, Maja/0000-0002-3917-5436",,,,,49,10,10,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Firms selling homogenous products set anticipated prices that consumers understand and additional prices that naive consumers ignore unless revealed to them by a firm, where we assume that there is a binding floor on the anticipated prices. Our main results establish that bad products (those with lower social surplus than an alternative) tend to be more reliably profitable than good products. Specifically, (1) in a market with a single socially valuable product and sufficiently many firms, a deceptive equilibrium-in which firms hide additional prices-does not exist and firms make zero profits. But perversely, (2) if the product is socially wasteful, then a profitable deceptive equilibrium always exists. Furthermore, (3) in a market with multiple products, since a superior product both diverts sophisticated consumers and renders an inferior product socially wasteful in comparison, it guarantees that firms can profitably sell the inferior product by deceiving consumers.

This model simultaneously resolves the estimation problems of endogeneity, heterogeneity, and nonlinearity. Empirical results support that the causality is bidirectional, nonlinear, time- and country-varying. Economic growth has a negative impact on military spending and vice versa. The larger the HDI, the smaller the negative causality. Evidently, the increase in the level of country development can reduce the negative impact of military outlays on economic growth. Reducing the ratio of military spending to GDP is beneficial for countries with low HDI scores; however, moderately increasing the share of military expenditure is favorable for countries with extremely high HDI scores.

In line with the risk-taking channel of monetary policy, we find that in the short run, the Fed and European Central Bank (ECB) interest rate policy compensate for changes in global risk assessment thereby supporting net private credit flows to the European periphery. However, in later periods, a worsened risk sentiment weighs on credit flows to these countries. In contrast, EMU core countries are generally less affected by global financial shocks. This asymmetric influence of global conditions on EMU member states are smoothed by the uniform access of commercial banks to the Eurosystem's open market operations in conjunction with the redistribution of liquidity via the TARGET mechanism.","[Jochem, Axel] Deutsch Bundesbank, Frankfurt, Germany; [Reitz, Stefan] Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Reitz, Stefan] Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany",Deutsche Bank; University of Kiel; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Reitz, S (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany.;Reitz, S (通讯作者)，Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany.",stefan.reitz@ifw-kiel.de,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

In particular, suppose that the threshold of legality is uncertain. I show that this legal uncertainty raises welfare. Legal uncertainty changes deterrence in opposite directions. The probability of conviction increases for firms below the threshold, while the probability of conviction decreases for firms above the threshold. Hence, legal uncertainty acts as a welfare enhancing screen and increases welfare.

Design/methodology/approach - This study adopted a contingency perspective to examine the relationship between organizational coordination and organizational implementation capabilities. A conceptual framework was tested based on data obtained from Korean firms. Findings - The results suggested a discrepancy between the direct and indirect influences of internationalization. On the one hand, there is an inverted U-shaped pattern in the direct relationship between internationalization and organizational implementation capabilities; that is, high levels of internationalization may reduce organizational implementation capabilities. On the other hand, the evidence for a U-shaped moderation suggests that high levels of internationalization can help a firm become capable of amplifying the value of cross-functional coordination in organizational implementation capabilities. In addition, technological changes weaken the positive impact of organizational coordination on organizational implementation capabilities. Research limitations/implications - Empirical research on the role of internationalization and dynamic environments in the context of new product development (NPD) affirms the importance of testing the curvilinear moderation beyond a linear two-way interaction. Practical implications - The present study offers insights into the importance of high levels of internationalization in enabling Korean firms to create effective cross-functional coordination to serve an international market with new products. Originality/value - This is the first review focusing on the role of internationalization in NPD.","[Lee, Keon Bong; Choi, Suk Bong] Korea Univ, Coll Global Business, Sejong City, South Korea",Korea University,"Lee, KB (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Coll Global Business, Sejong City, South Korea.",keonbonglee@korea.ac.kr,,,,,,,115,1,1,1,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Our results reveal that UK fund managers engage in significant herding behaviour and that this behaviour does not differ significantly from bullish to bearish stock markets. Moreover, we confirm that there are weak positive correlations between fund managers' herding and stock returns within the subsequent year, which indicates that their herding is mainly informational. To improve portfolio performance, other investors could follow UK fund managers and purchase stocks overbought by them with at least 15 traders quarterly in the following one-year period, particularly for growth-type, sector-specific and international-type funds. Moreover, because they are more likely to herd in large-capitalisation securities, the informational reasons driving managers' herding behaviour are mainly related to investigative herding. We also find that growth-type and international-type funds are more likely to herd with similar type funds. This finding may result from reputational and characteristic herding, which illustrates that non-informational reasons for managers' herding still exist.","[Lu, Yang-Cheng] Ming Chuan Univ, Finance Dept, Taipei, Taiwan; [Fang, Hao] Hwa Hsia Inst Technol, Dept Assets & Property Management, Taipei, Taiwan; [Lee, Yen-Hsien] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Finance, Taoyuan, Taiwan",Ming Chuan University; Chung Yuan Christian University,"Fang, H (通讯作者)，Hwa Hsia Inst Technol, Dept Assets & Property Management, Taipei, Taiwan.",ralphyclu1@gmail.com; hihaoa@gmail.com,"Fang, Hao/AAW-3714-2021","Fang, Hao/0000-0003-3874-5537",,,,,33,0,0,2,9,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2017,64.0,5,,,,,571,592,,10.2298/PAN150212016L,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FS7TI,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000422611300003,0

We present scenarios detailing how a rebalancing of China's growth pattern from investment-driven growth towards more consumption-driven growth may occur in practice. Using input-output tables for 2012, we illustrate the knife-edged nature of Chinese rebalancing, the linkages between expenditure-side and production-side rebalancing, and how an internal rebalancing could exacerbate external imbalances. A policy implication for China is that for rebalancing to be fast, consumption must be exceptionally resilient and the efficiency of investment must increase sharply. If rebalancing is too slow, the capital-to-output ratio will rise to potentially unsustainable levels and consumption will fail to attain levels of contemporary upper middle-income economies by 2030. Global input-output tables (1995-2011) suggest that the patterns of Chinese rebalancing considered in our scenarios may generate substantial headwinds for exports to China by its trading partners.","[Ma, Guonan] City Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Roberts, Ivan] Reserve Bank Australia, Asian Econ Res Unit, Econ Grp, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Kelly, Gerard] Reserve Bank Australia, Financial Markets Grp, Sydney, NSW, Australia",City University of Hong Kong; Reserve Bank of Australia; Reserve Bank of Australia,"Ma, GN (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",guonan.ma@outlook.com; robertsi@rba.gov.au; kellyg@rba.gov.au,,,,,,,27,20,20,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JAN-FEB,2017,25.0,1,,,,,1,31,,10.1111/cwe.12184,0.0,,,31,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EK3QC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393839900002,0

The reduced-form modelling approach was based on the premise that auction design features can, and do, affect both final (revenue) and intermediate (viz., auction competitiveness and license assignment) auction outcomes. Importantly, the analysis recognizes, and explicitly allows for, the endogeneity of bidder entry and sample selection arising from an absence of bidding. Generally, these key features have only received attention in isolation. In particular, the study addressed the principal question of: which regulator chosen auction design variables determine prices paid in spectrum auctions? The analysis showed that flexible-package formats increased prices paid, and that higher reserve prices had a dampening effect. The article also showed that longer license terms and more competitive auctions (as measured by the bidders-to-licenses ratio) enhance prices paid.","[Madden, Gary] Curtin Univ, Dept Econ, Perth, WA, Australia; [Suenaga, Hiroaki] Curtin Univ, Dept Finance & Banking, Perth, WA, Australia",Curtin University; Curtin University,"Madden, G (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Dept Econ, Perth, WA, Australia.",g.madden@curtin.edu.au,,"Suenaga, Hiroaki/0000-0002-0208-2586",DotEcon Spectrum Awards,DotEcon Spectrum Awards,"The authors thank Felix Chan, Christian Dippon, Alan Duncan, Bill Greene, Mark Harris, Jerry Hausman, Richard Marsden, Leslie Marx, and participants at the Curtin Econometrics Study Group Workshop in Honour of Jerry Hausman, for helpful comments.

In total, these households spend an estimated 17% of their gross annual income across the border, contributing about 10% to the total household final consumption expenditure (HFCE) in Luxembourg. Cross-border expenditure is linked to individual- and household-related characteristics and to distance between home and work.

The authors describe transportation issues confronting the population of urban areas. An overview is done of scholarly work on the problem of preference assessment by means of sociological surveys and laboratory experiments. The authors analyze the methodological framework of laboratory experiments and improve the method of public good experiments. The proposed research method is a laboratory experiment based around a survey asking students whether they prefer public or private transport. The experiment envisages that the cost of the trips by public transport and by car varies. Following the experiment, the students' readiness to use public transport is assessed for different cost ratios. The second variable parameter of the experiment was travel time. The authors assess the readiness of students to use public transport under various ratios of travel time by private and public transport. A conclusion is made that transportation preferences vary significantly depending on the factors of price and time. The aim of the research is to develop a method of assessing transport preferences of people living in urban areas with regard to private vs. public transport.","[Mayburov, Igor] Ural Fed Univ, Econ Sci, Mira Str 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia; [Mayburov, Igor] Ural Fed Univ, Dept Finance & Tax Management, Mira Str 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia",Ural Federal University; Ural Federal University,"Mayburov, I (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, Econ Sci, Mira Str 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia.;Mayburov, I (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, Dept Finance & Tax Management, Mira Str 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia.",mayburov.home@gmail.com; uv.leonteva@mail.ru,"MAYBUROV, IGOR/Q-2807-2016; Leontyeva, Yulia/AAS-8060-2020; Mayburov, Igor/AAQ-4302-2020","Leontyeva, Yulia/0000-0003-4676-9926; Mayburov, Igor/0000-0001-8791-665X",Russian Foundation for Basic Research [17-22-21001],Russian Foundation for Basic Research(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)Spanish Government),"The work was supported by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research, contract No. 17-22-21001.",,10,0,0,1,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,981,990,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000455325300098,0

In contrast to the two explanations of the controversy put forward in existing literature, I argue that Growth in a Time of Debt and its criticism published by Herndon, Ash and Pollin (Does high public debt constantly stifle economic growth? A critique of Reinhart and Rogoff) exemplify the 'emerging contrary result' phenomenon (emerging recalcitrant result, ERR). Three arguments support this hypothesis. First, the infamous spreadsheet error did not cause the findings to differ. On the contrary, the results differed mostly due to employing alternative averaging schemes. Second, the cliometric techniques employed by both research teams are justified to a similar degree. Third, the pattern in the cliometric literature focused on the 90%-threshold hypothesis suggests that the Reinhart-Rogoff controversy exemplifies an ERR phenomenon caused by submission/publication bias.","[Maziarz, Mariusz] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Econ Sci, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Maziarz, M (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Econ Sci, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",mariusz.maziarz@ue.wroc.pl,"Maziarz, Mariusz Ł/W-9565-2018",,"National Science Centre, Poland [2015/19/N/HS1/01066]","National Science Centre, Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","This work was supported by the National Science Centre, Poland [grant number 2015/19/N/HS1/01066].",,41,8,10,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

Currently, the Usti nad Labem region is generally perceived as an area with a number of major socio-economic problems. As compared to other regions of the Czech Republic, the region's economic performance is below average. Industry 4.0 represents a great opportunity for the future development and increase in the competitiveness of this industrially-oriented region. The question is to what extent the region is ready for the changes connected with automation, digitalisation, or robotisation, and what changes it should go through in the future in order for the possible ideas and some of the Industry 4.0 processes already under way to be successfully implemented. Due to the fact that Industry 4.0 is a very complex and comprehensive concept, this paper focuses on four key selected factors on which Industry 4.0 puts the most emphasis. These comprise research, development and innovation, human resources, education, and infrastructure. Therefore, the specific aim is to analyse these four factors in the territory of the Usti nad Labem region, and point out the necessary changes related to the commencement of Industry 4.0. It is apparent from the performed analysis that the Usti nad Labem region suffers from a lack of capacity (in the field of science and research, human resources, or in the qualification structure and communication infrastructure) and an insufficient involvement of the stakeholders themselves (company owners and management, workers, but also the young generation).","[Nedomlelova, Iva; Werner, Jiri] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Nedomlelová, I (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic.",iva.nedomlelova@tul.cz; jiri.werner@tul.cz,"Nedomlelova, Iva/HLP-5065-2023; Nedomlelová, Iva/AAD-1593-2022","Nedomlelová, Iva/0000-0001-9038-6610",,,,,14,3,3,0,9,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-349-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,87,97,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6CS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000426486500010,0

This means that the IIM is not suited to prioritize industries for policy interventions that aim at reducing the negative impacts of such disasters. Besides, this note shows that the application of the IIM is problematic and tends to overestimate the subset of impacts that the model is able to quantify.

The research was conducted on three research samples. The first sample was composed of enterprises in Clutex, a cluster of technical textiles, which arose as a result of a cluster initiative in 2006. It was also one of the projects from the Operational Programme Industry and Enterprise. Enterprises that create the core of the cluster do business in industries with the following statistical classifications: NACE 13200, 13900 and 14100. The second research sample was composed of enterprises in a natural textile cluster that exists within the territories of the Liberec, Hradec Kralove and Pardubice Regions (they together form the North-East Cohesion Region). The third research sample was composed of enterprises doing business in the same industries, but outside the North-East Cohesion Region. ROE indicators and indicators based on economic value added were used as criteria for assessing financial performance. The research was based on 2014 data. The research was targeted at verifying the hypothesis that enterprises in the Clutex cluster reach higher performance than enterprises in the natural cluster. And further, by analogy, that enterprises in the natural cluster are more successful than enterprises in the same industry, but doing business in other regions. However, the results of the research did not confirm the expected positive effect of the existence of clusters (institutionalized or natural) on enterprise performance. The concluding section of the report deals with the possible causes of this finding.","[Pelloneova, Natalie; Zizka, Miroslav] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Business Adm & Management, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Pelloneová, N (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Business Adm & Management, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic.",natalie.pelloneova@tul.cz; miroslav.zizka@tul.cz,"Zizka, Miroslav/I-5624-2016","Zizka, Miroslav/0000-0002-7804-3954",Student Grant Competition (SGS) project Research into the evaluation of cluster performance in the Czech Republic [21189],Student Grant Competition (SGS) project Research into the evaluation of cluster performance in the Czech Republic,The article was prepared with financial support from the Student Grant Competition (SGS) project Nr. 21189 Research into the evaluation of cluster performance in the Czech Republic.,,17,0,0,0,2,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-349-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,240,248,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6CS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000426486500027,0

We find that more trading activity in the futures market leads to greater next-period returns and that the trading volume has a bi-directionally positive relationship with the volatility. We also find that greater market volatility increases asset returns but that greater returns decrease volatility, which is consistent with the asymmetric returns-volatility relationship and is explained by the risk-return trade-off and the leverage effect.","[Ryu, Doojin] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Coll Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Shim, Hyein] Korea Publ Finance Informat Serv, Fiscal Informat Res Ctr, Seoul, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Shim, H (通讯作者)，Korea Publ Finance Informat Serv, Fiscal Informat Res Ctr, Seoul, South Korea.",sharpjin@skku.edu; hyein@kpfis.kr,"Ryu, Doojin/AAZ-3318-2020","Ryu, Doojin/0000-0002-0059-4887",National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A5B8060964],National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government,"The authors are grateful for helpful comments and suggestions from Corina Saman, Heejin Yang, and the members of Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) Economic Research Institute (ERI).

In this study, we explored the impacts on learning outcomes for students in an introductory statistics course by allowing students to arbitrarily choose their own sequence of learning from three key learning activities, namely tutorials, Peer-Assisted Study Sessions and Computer-Managed Learning quizzes. Unlike the old regime where the learning activities followed a strict, rigid sequence, a new regime allowed students to freely choose when, where and how they engaged with the course learning activities. This allowed increased opportunities for students to receive relevant and timely feedback. Using a total of 1187 students enrolled in semester 2 of 2011, 2012 and 2013, data were collected on students' scores from 7 assessment tasks. Our experimental design ensured as many course features as possible remained constant between the control cohorts (of 2011 and 2012) and the experimental cohort (2013), thereby avoiding potential sample selection problems. The findings showed student learning outcomes in the new regime improved significantly. Interestingly, the effects were found to be greatest in the lower percentile of the score distribution.","[Sherwood, Carl] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Kwak, Do Won] Korea Univ, Asiat Res Inst, Seoul 02841, South Korea",University of Queensland; Korea University,"Kwak, DW (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Asiat Res Inst, Seoul 02841, South Korea.",dwkwak@korea.ac.kr,,"Kwak, Do Won/0000-0001-5443-1576",National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government [NRF-2008-362-A00001],National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of Korea),This research was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2008-362-A00001).,,25,0,1,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The theoretical argument is based on the menu-cost approach in which small absolute changes in exchange rates may not prompt price changes because the costs of doing so exceed the extra profits generated for firms involved in international trade. This relationship is investigated empirically using quarterly data for the period 1979q1-2015q1 for a sample of 17 countries. In the case of import prices, evidence is found of nonlinear adjustment consistent with the theoretical model in 4 out of 17 cases. In the case of export prices, such a relationship is only evident for two economies in the sample. However, for both the import and export price cases, a significant positive nonlinear relationship is found for the two largest economies in the sample, i.e. the United States and Japan.","[Turner, Paul; Wood, Justine] Univ Loughborough, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough LE11 4TU, Leics, England",Loughborough University,"Turner, P (通讯作者)，Univ Loughborough, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough LE11 4TU, Leics, England.",p.m.turner@lboro.ac.uk,,"Wood, Justine/0000-0002-2410-6905",,,,,7,2,2,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This article, for the first time in Central and Eastern Europe, explains the undeclared economy using a demand-side approach which evaluates citizens' motives for purchasing undeclared goods and services. Here, three potential explanations for purchasing undeclared goods and services, grounded in rational economic actor, social actor and institutional imperfections theoretical perspectives, are evaluated. Reporting data from 11,131 face-to-face interviews conducted in 11 Central and Eastern European countries in 2013, the main finding is that all three explanations are used by consumers, demonstrating the need for a synthesis of these approaches. A multinomial regression analysis identifies the specific groups variously using the undeclared economy to obtain a lower price, for social or redistributive rationales, or due to formal institutional imperfections.

In this global market, clubs must maintain or improve fans' attendance at the stadium; simultaneously, they need, more than ever, to take care of social media. The aim of this article is to test and discuss a comprehensive approach to analysing the performance of football clubs regarding their multiplicity of objectives. We analyse the efficiency of English Premier League (EPL) clubs during three seasons (2012/13-2014/15). The methodologies employed are data envelopment analysis (DEA) and a bootstrapped DEA model. The input is the market value of the squad, and the outputs are sports results, total revenue, the ratio of stadium utilization during the season and an index of social media impact. The results are robust to alternative estimation methods and indicate that EPL clubs still have a margin for improving their overall efficiency, mainly the medium clubs. The analysis of football clubs' performance with the proposed comprehensive approach provides a useful tool to help managers with evaluation and feedback considering the actual context of the market. The approach brings closer the opportunity to design appropriate strategies to improve clubs' efficiency as well as competition policies.","[Zambom-Ferraresi, Fabiola; Lera-Lopez, Fernando; Iraizoz, Belen] Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Econ, Pamplona, Spain",Universidad Publica de Navarra,"Zambom-Ferraresi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Econ, Pamplona, Spain.",fabiola.zambom@unavarra.es,"Iraizoz, belen/A-8705-2011; Ferraresi, Fabíola Zambom/P-3109-2019; Iraizoz, Belen/GLT-9023-2022; Zambom-Ferraresi, Fabíola/AAI-5419-2020; Zambom-Ferraresi, Fabíola/H-1700-2014; Lera-Lopez, Fernando/J-4450-2016","Iraizoz, belen/0000-0002-9131-7323; Iraizoz, Belen/0000-0002-9131-7323; Zambom-Ferraresi, Fabíola/0000-0001-7068-5269; Lera-Lopez, Fernando/0000-0002-9230-9405",Public University of Navarre,Public University of Navarre,Fabiola Zambom-Ferraresi was supported by a predoctoral fellowship from the Public University of Navarre.,,13,8,9,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We submitted two of the main Basel III recommendations for market risk to a back test: the capital requirements and the Value at Risk (VaR) methodology that includes the BIS's Stressed VaR. We tested the main Brazilian currency exchange (U.S. Dollar to Brazilian Reais) and currency exchange swaps contracts through volatility-based VaR methodologies in the period that comprises the so-called Brazilian confidence crisis, which occurred in the second half of 2002. While the Stressed VaR revealed inapplicable, due to historical data shortage, the capital requirements level appeared innocuous, due to the high levels of daily volatility - daily oscillation limits may have a significant role on crisis mitigation. To circumvent the lack of either historical information or optimal window for stress patterns, we suggest to calibrate the Stressed VaR or the recently announced Expected Shortfall with a historical VIX (Volatility Index, Chicago Board Options Exchange), working as a volatility scale. We suggest modelling with other densities, apart from the BIS recommended standard normal.","[Zeuli, Marcelo] Fed Univ Rio Janeiro, COPPEAD UFRJ, Grad Sch Business, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Carvalhal, Andre] Fed Univ Rio Janeiro, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"Zeuli, M (通讯作者)，Banco Cent Brasil, Cent Bank, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",m_zeuli@yahoo.com,,"Carvalhal da Silva, Andre Luiz/0000-0003-0210-2775",,,,,50,0,0,1,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Among the most controversial and rapidly growing shared-mobility services are ridehailing services, such as those offered by Uber and Lyft in the U.S. market. In this paper, we investigate the factors affecting the adoption of ridehailing through the estimation of a latent-class adoption model that captures the heterogeneity in individuals' tastes and preferences, focusing on members of the millennial generation and the preceding Generation X. We present a 3-class adoption model that provides better goodness of fit and interpretability of the classes compared to other model specifications that were tested. The three distinct classes have expected sample shares of 28%, 34% and 38%, respectively, and can be characterized as follows: (1) a class that is largely composed of more highly-educated, independent (i.e. who have already established their household) millennials, who has the highest adoption rate. Among other factors, the adoption of ridehailing services for the members of this class is influenced by the frequency of long-distance leisure and business-related trips made by non-car modes. The adoption of ridehailing among the members of this group is higher if they live in high-quality transit neighborhoods. (2) The second highest adoption rate is observed among the members of the class that is mainly composed of affluent individuals living with their families who are either dependent millennials or older members of Generation X. The frequency of use of transportation-related smartphone apps and the share of long-distance leisure trips made by plane affect the adoption of ridehailing for the members of this class. The members of this class also tend to adopt ridehailing if they live in neighborhoods with higher land-use mix and if they have used taxi services within the past 12 months. (3) Finally, the lowest adoption rate is observed among the members of the last class, comprising the least affluent individuals with the lowest level of education. The members of this class are more likely to live in rural neighborhoods and they rarely use ridehailing. The adoption of ridehailing among the members of this class is affected by household income, the frequency of long-distance non-car business trips, and transit accessibility as well as the use of taxi and of caisharing.","[Alemi, Farzad] Univ Calif Davis, Inst Transportat Studies, 1715 Tilia St, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Circella, Giovanni] Univ Calif Davis, Inst Transportat Studies, 1715 Tilia St, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Circella, Giovanni] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 1715 Tilia St, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Mokhtarian, Patricia] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 790 Atlantic Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Handy, Susan] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Inst Transportat Studies, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Alemi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Inst Transportat Studies, 1715 Tilia St, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",falemi@ucdavis.edu; gcircella@ucdavis.edu; patmokh@gatech.edu; slhandy@ucdavis.edu,"Mokhtarian, Patricia/B-3374-2011; Circella, Giovanni/ABB-1666-2020","Mokhtarian, Patricia/0000-0001-7104-499X; Circella, Giovanni/0000-0003-1832-396X; alemi, farzad/0000-0003-4333-3393","National Center for Sustainable Transportation (NCST); USDOT; Caltrans through the University Transportation Centers program; NCST dissertation fellowship; NCST; Sustainable Technology Energy Pathways (STEPS) Program of the University of California, Davis; Caltrans","National Center for Sustainable Transportation (NCST); USDOT; Caltrans through the University Transportation Centers program; NCST dissertation fellowship; NCST; Sustainable Technology Energy Pathways (STEPS) Program of the University of California, Davis; Caltrans","This study was funded by the National Center for Sustainable Transportation (NCST), which receives funding from the USDOT and Caltrans through the University Transportation Centers program.

Despite the huge amount of researches investigating the relationship between education and GDP as a proxy of well-being, to the best of our knowledge, none of these studies examined a group of post-socialist countries comparing with not-post-socialist countries. This paper aims to fill this gap. We examine the correlation between growth and education with panel data evidence for 18 post-socialist (PS) countries and 16 developed market economies (DME) over the 1990-2014 period. The goal of this paper is to test two hypotheses: (i) The relationship between GDP per capita and tertiary education's enrolment rate is stronger in the post-socialist countries than in other countries. (ii) In the post-socialist countries, the relationship between GDP per capita and tertiary education's enrolment rate is stronger than the relationship between GDP per capita and any other level of education. Correlation analyses confirmed both hypotheses. Our findings suggest that the patterns of relationship between GDP and measures of tertiary education are different for PS and DME countries and would be interesting to observe when and how the gap between the patterns disappears.","[Banasz, Zsuzsanna; Csanyi, Vivien Valeria] MTA PE Budapest Ranking Res Grp, Veszprem, Hungary",Hungarian Research Network; Office for Supported Research Groups (ELKH),"Csányi, VV (通讯作者)，MTA PE Budapest Ranking Res Grp, Veszprem, Hungary.",banasz@gtk.uni-pannon.hu; csanyivivien@gtk.uni-pannon.hu,"Csanyi, Vivien Valeria/T-5234-2017",,European Union and Hungary - European Social Fund [EFOP-3.6.2-16-2017-00017]; MTA-PE Budapest Ranking Research Group [16208],European Union and Hungary - European Social Fund; MTA-PE Budapest Ranking Research Group,"This publication/research has been supported by the European Union and Hungary and co-financed by the European Social Fund through the project EFOP-3.6.2-16-2017-00017, titled Sustainable, intelligent and inclusive regional and city models and MTA-PE Budapest Ranking Research Group (Grant No. 16208).",,51,0,0,4,8,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

It starts by documenting and comparing their statistical properties. The results point at biased and inefficient budget forecasts, which seem to have been more cautious in French departments than in Portuguese municipalities. Second, we examine the political, institutional and economic determinants of forecast biases. Overall, we find that they are essentially driven by electoral motivations and by institutional differences across the two countries. In particular, opportunistic forecasting is more prevalent where governments enjoy greater margin of maneuver, and there is evidence of conservatism in French departments where fiscal autonomy is greater.","[Boukari, Mamadou] Univ Lille, LEM CNRS UMR 9221, Cite Sci, Bat SH2,Bur 101, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Veiga, Francisco Jose] Univ Minho, Escola Econ & Gestao, NIPE, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal",Universite de Lille; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universidade do Minho,"Veiga, FJ (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, Escola Econ & Gestao, NIPE, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.",mamadou.boukari@ed.univ-lille1.fr; fjveiga@eeg.uminho.pt,"BOUKARI, Mamadou/IZD-4806-2023; Veiga, Francisco José/B-1784-2008","BOUKARI, Mamadou/0000-0003-0439-6471; Veiga, Francisco José/0000-0002-6116-1479","COMPETE [POCI-01-0145-FEDER-006683 (UID/ECO/03182/2013)]; FCT/MEC's (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, I.P.); ERDF through the Operational Programme on Competitiveness and Internationalization - COMPETE 2020 under the PT2020 Partnership Agreement; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [UID/ECO/03182/2013] Funding Source: FCT","COMPETE; FCT/MEC's (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, I.P.); ERDF through the Operational Programme on Competitiveness and Internationalization - COMPETE 2020 under the PT2020 Partnership Agreement; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","Previous versions of this paper were presented at the 2016 French Political Economy Association and at the 2017 European Public Choice Society meetings, and at seminars at the University of Le Havre and the University of Lille.

By contrast, we provide novel evidence showing that parents who helped their adult children in the past are rewarded by higher chances of receiving informal care later in life. To this end we use Italian data containing precise retrospective information about the help with housing that couples received from their parents when they got married, such as a real estate donation or down payment. Our estimates show that this type of past help is positively associated with the current provision of informal care to the parents. This result is robust to controlling for a large set of individual and family characteristics and is only partially due to increased geographical proximity. We suggest that this finding can be explained by mixed self-interest motives, related to theories based on either bilateral exchange or the presence of a third generation (grandchildren), such as the demonstration effect model or the family constitution model.","[Ciani, Emanuele] Bank Italy, Directorate Generale Econ Stat & Res, Struct Econ Anal Directorate, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy; [Ciani, Emanuele] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Ctr Anal Publ Policies, Via Jacopo Berengario 51, I-41121 Modena, Italy; [Deiana, Claudio] European Commiss, CC ME, Joint Res Ctr, Directorate Competences 1, Via E Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy; [Deiana, Claudio] Univ Essex, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy; Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; University of Essex,"Ciani, E (通讯作者)，Bank Italy, Directorate Generale Econ Stat & Res, Struct Econ Anal Directorate, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy.;Ciani, E (通讯作者)，Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Ctr Anal Publ Policies, Via Jacopo Berengario 51, I-41121 Modena, Italy.",emanuele.ciani@bancaditalia.it,"Ciani, Emanuele/B-1836-2016","DEIANA, CLAUDIO/0000-0002-2576-9997",,,,,47,5,6,1,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

We exploit variation in interview modes in the Austrian EU-SILC panel, where between 2007 and 2008 the interview mode was switched from personal interviews to telephone interviews for some but not all participants. We combine methods from the program evaluation literature with methods from the distributional decomposition literature to obtain causal estimates of the effect of interview mode on estimated inequality. We find that the interview mode has a large effect on estimated inequality, where telephone interviews lead to a larger downward bias. The effect of the mode is much smaller for robust inequality measures such as interquantile ranges, as these are not sensitive to the tails of the distribution. The magnitude of effects we find are of a similar order as the differences in many international and intertemporal comparisons of inequality.","[Fessler, Pirmin; Lindner, Peter] Oesterreich Nationalbank, Econ Anal Div, Postbox 61, A-1011 Vienna, Austria; [Kasy, Maximilian] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, 1805 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB); Harvard University,"Fessler, P (通讯作者)，Oesterreich Nationalbank, Econ Anal Div, Postbox 61, A-1011 Vienna, Austria.",pirmin.fessler@oenb.at; maximiliankasy@fas.harvard.edu; peter.lindner@oenb.at,,,,,,,23,4,4,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

As compared to the traditional cooperative, the NGC facilitates a strong market orientation by defining membership and requiring high supply and equity capital commitments. Approximately 100 such value-added ventures formed during a period called 'cooperative fever', but public and producer interest dissipated in the 2000s. With secondary data collected from print media publications, we conclude that many of the original NGCs exited by means of bankruptcy or liquidation because of challenges common to most business organizations. However, other failures and conversions of large, successful NGCs also indicate an inherent equity and liquidity constraint, suggesting a limited ability of the organizational form to drive complex and capital-intensive value-added ventures. We conclude by raising possible conditions for the future viability of producer-owned business organizations in the value-added agri-food industry.","[Grashuis, Jasper; Cook, Michael] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Cook, M (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",GrashuisJ@missouri.edu; CookML@missouri.edu,,,,,,,99,13,17,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

It first examines the notion of a new combination - a core analytical concept in economic theories of innovation and explanations of emergent novelty through bottom-up processes. Following Schumpeter, different theorists have made different claims about the composition and structure of new combinations. Possible constituent elements include factors of production, capital goods, routines, information, ideas, technologies, and property rights. The article then looks synoptically at the institutional dimensions of innovation from alternative perspectives that focus upon different kinds of institutional rules and policy solutions to innovation problems. Neoclassical and evolutionary approaches tend to emphasize specific policy interventions in markets to channel behavior toward particular desired outcomes, whereas institutional and Austrian approaches tend to focus upon general institutional rules (e.g. property and contract) that frame markets and innovation processes. Finally, this article summarizes the papers in the special issue.","[Harper, David A.] NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10003 USA",New York University,"Harper, DA (通讯作者)，NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10003 USA.",david.harper@nyu.edu,"Harper, David A/U-3706-2018","Harper, David A/0000-0002-4716-3638",,,,,74,18,22,2,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Economic freedom is measured by the Fraser Institute's economic freedom summary index as well as its five major sub-indices, such as government size, property rights, access to sound money, freedom to trade, and regulations. Wealth inequality is measured by the top wealth shares. Trade union density is used as an instrument for wealth inequality. Empirical results suggest that the rising wealth inequality significantly hampers overall economic freedom, property rights protection, freedom to trade, soundness of money and regulatory environment. Furthermore, this negative effect of wealth inequality is reinforced at a lower level of democracy. These findings are robust to alternative measures of wealth inequality, economic freedom, treatment for endogeneity, and model specification.","[Islam, Md.

The effect of income comparisons on credit applications can be explained by either a keeping up with the Joneses effect, in which the poor seek financing for costly consumption to emulate the wealthy's consumption style and thus suffer persistent poverty, or else a tunnel effect, in which the poor are inspired by the wealthy's economic success and enlightened to use credit for investment. Although this study provides no empirical evidence of a keeping up effect, it reveals that credit applicants invest significantly more in human capital than non-applicants, and it demonstrates that the tunnel effect is the primary incentive for relatively poor households to participate in the credit market. Poor households are capable of using finance to escape from poverty.","[Li, Linying] Northwest Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Finance, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Li, Linying] 1 Xuefu Ave, Xian 710127, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Northwest University Xi'an,"Li, LY (通讯作者)，Northwest Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Finance, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;Li, LY (通讯作者)，1 Xuefu Ave, Xian 710127, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",ly.li@nwu.edu.cn,,"Li, Linyang/0000-0003-1854-9002",,,,,85,60,63,0,74,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

We exploit the 2002 Chinese Income Tax Reform which exogenously cut local government revenues from income taxes roughly by half. We find that, when facing fiscal distress, local officials resort to informal taxes, such as fees and levies, instead of formal taxes to supplement revenue. On average, the increase in informal taxes recovered 75 percent of the local government revenue loss due to the reform. The increases are more pronounced along the intensive margin and are primarily driven by more extractions from large firms. We also find that the reform led to reductions in investment and growth rates of small firms and consistently more small firms in the total size distribution.","[Liu, Yu] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Fudan University,"Liu, Y (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",yu_liu@fudan.edu.cn,,,Fudan University [SXH3246007/148],Fudan University,"I am indebted to Nancy Qian, Christopher Udry, David Atkin, and Eric Weese for their guidance and support.

The model is based on the non-paternalistic approach in which, the utility function incorporates the utility of other people as perceived by a decision maker. This can explain the different behavior of people under a very common environment with incomplete information. I extend the model by adding shame aversion as an additional driver for apparently altruistic behavior. The threat of shame is induced by different levels of exposure of either one's own actions or identity to third-party observers. I also experimentally test predictions of the model using a simple environment of a dictator's game. The experimental design aims to remove additional confounding behavioral effects present in the previous literature. The results suggest that even exposure to only one person, who is not affected by the agent's decision, results in significantly higher amounts sent to recipients. The analysis also shows that agents who believe they can conceal their own actions in front of a less-informed counterpart exploit this lack of transparency for their monetary benefit.","[Miklanek, Tomas] Univ Econ, Prague W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Miklánek, T (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Prague W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",tomas.miklanek@vse.cz,,"Miklanek, Tomas/0000-0002-8775-9460",CERGE-EI Foundation under a program of the Global Development Network [RRC 12-64],CERGE-EI Foundation under a program of the Global Development Network,This research was supported by the CERGE-EI Foundation under a program of the Global Development Network (RRC 12-64).

The results show that there is a bi-directional volatility spillover effect between the two markets in the short-run. Also these effects are asymmetric.

The higher BMI is not necessarily healthy because the boys are more likely to be in the overweight range and less likely to be in the normal range. I also find evidence that risk averse mothers spend more on their son's schooling related expenditures such as materials, uniforms, and spending money.

The agent is uncertain if these variables are stationary or non-stationary and puts positive probability on both representations. The agent uses Bayesian learning to update his probability weights on each model and these weights vary over time according to how well each model fits the data. The model exhibits an improved fit to the data relative to a no-learning benchmark. It requires half the standard deviation of exogenous shocks to match the volatility of output and still matches the relative volatilities of key business cycle variables. The model lowers the contemporaneous correlation of consumption and wages with output and generates positive autocorrelation in growth rates. Impulse responses exhibit persistent responses and forecast errors are positively serially correlated. Finally, in contrast to the existing literature, the model endogenously generates observed time varying volatility and long run predictability of business cycle variables, especially for investment, without generating counterfactually high serial correlation of forecast errors.","[Tortorice, Daniel L.] Coll Holy Cross, Dept Econ & Accounting, 1 Coll St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",College of the Holy Cross,"Tortorice, DL (通讯作者)，Coll Holy Cross, Dept Econ & Accounting, 1 Coll St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",,,,Theodore and Jane Norman Fund at Brandeis,Theodore and Jane Norman Fund at Brandeis,"I thank Steve Cecchetti, George Hall, Blake LeBaron, Davide Pettenuzzo, three anonymous referees, the editor and seminar participants at Brandeis University, Boston College, College of the Holy Cross, Providence College, Bentley University, the Midwest Macroeconomics Meetings, the Annual Meeting of the Eastern Economics Association, the Annual Symposium of the Society for Nonlinear Dynamics and Econometrics, the 2018 Conference of Macroeconomists from Liberal Arts Colleges, and the 21st Annual Conference on Macroeconomic Analysis and International Finance for helpful comments.

To this end, we first develop a theoretical model that extends the existing literature by, among other things, considering alternative firms with proprietary legacy network (e.g., cable operators) and the presence of asymmetric mandated access to networks. In the empirical part, we test the theoretical predictions using a novel panel data from 27 EU member states pertaining to the last decade. Our main finding is that, in line with the theoretical results, stricter access regulations (i.e., a decrease in access price to legacy network and the adoption of fiber regulation) decrease the incumbent operators' fiber investments. On the other hand, cable operators are not affected by access regulation. Our paper thus provides policy insights for the on-going revision of the EU regulation framework for the electronic communications industry. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Assignment to high performance pay via a market mechanism is roughly twice as effective as imposing the same contract exogenously. This positive effect is largely offset by a negative effect for workers that endogenously choose low performance pay. We decompose the positive effect of endogenous assignment to high performance pay into effects due to selection and strategic anticipation, and find that selection has a greater effect than strategic anticipation. We use a Reverse Sort treatment to show that the effect of selection is sufficiently strong to overcome the direct effect of lower performance pay, yielding coordination at high effort levels in spite of low incentives.

We take an alternative approach by examining how news of Brexit affected expectations as embodied in stock returns using a two-stage estimation process. While most firms had negative returns following news of the referendum's result (with nearly $3 trillion wiped off global markets), there was considerable heterogeneity in their changes relative to expectations. We show that this heterogeneity can be explained by the firm's global value chain, with firms heavily exposed to the EU and UK doing worse. In addition, we find that firms reliant on imported intermediates also perform worse. This, however, is partially offset via intra-firm trade in intermediates when Sterling fell relative to host currencies. These changes were primarily in the first two trading days and highly persistent. Understanding these movements gives a better understanding of Brexit's potential effects. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this paper is to obtain a true economic measure of capital stock according to the prescriptions of the neoclassical theory. In this way, we develop an alternative method based on the equations that solve the dynamic optimization problem of the firm, yielding an economic estimation based on indicators of profitability, such as the distributed profits and the Tobin's q ratio. Thus, this method enables us to endogenously calculate the variables' rate of depreciation and capital stock. We apply this procedure to the Spanish economy, getting the series of an economic measure of depreciation and the economic value of capital stock. Our results show an economic depreciation rate that fluctuates around the statistical rate. Moreover, we get two time profiles for the economic and statistical capital stocks that differ significantly from each other.","[Escriba-Perez, F. J.; Murgui-Garcia, M. J.; Ruiz-Tamarit, J.

The introduction of limited attention changes the positive and normative predictions obtained from otherwise standard models, such as Salop-style competition. Further, the model identifies when limited attention is beneficial or harmful to firms, and explains why the individually rational decision to become less attentive in presence of more choice options may be catalyzed to a collective inattention trap over the market mechanism.

However, such equilibria are strategically fragile. In order to investigate how robust they are in the absence of an external coordination mechanism, I simulate various protocols firms may use to update their prices. Despite firms being myopic, some protocols yield results close to the benchmark model. If firms rush to update before observing competitors' actions, profits are higher on average but volatile and cyclical. With cost dispersion, prices become more stable as they are more closely tied to costs.

The exporters' markup premium, however, may disappear in a special case, namely when the home country is small relative to its trade partners and trade barriers are low. This can be because competition is more intense in the large export destination than in the small home country, so that firms are able to set higher markups for locally sold products but not for exports. This paper provides empirical evidence on the validity of this special case by estimating markups for firms in Luxembourg who generally export to larger countries. The estimated negative markup premium for exporters has important implications for the productivity measurement. In a sufficiently small open economy, exporters' productivity may be biased downward, when the firm-level markup variation is not controlled for in the productivity estimation.

Previous studies focus on the use of country-specific factors to explain countries' exchange rate regime choices. However, though some papers found strong correlation between idiosyncratic factors and ERR choices, these factors cannot fully explain the contemporary movement of the choices. It is possible that large swings in regime choices are caused by network effects: a few countries change their ERR and other countries follow. If this snowball effect is true for countries' decisions, we should be able to observe spatial autocorrelations among countries' ERR choices. Using spatial analysis, we found that countries are likely to follow the ERRs of other countries, and countries' ERRs are jointly determined by network effects and country-specific factors. The findings indicate that countries may achieve higher welfare by jointly choosing their ERRs with their major partners through cooperation and negotiation.","[Song, Mengdi] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Quantitat & Tech Econ, 5 Jianguomennei St, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Song, Mengdi] Heriot Watt Univ, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; Heriot Watt University,"Song, MD (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Quantitat & Tech Econ, 5 Jianguomennei St, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Song, MD (通讯作者)，Heriot Watt Univ, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",songmengdi@cass.org.cn,"song, mengdi/L-7709-2019","song, mengdi/0000-0003-4556-7791",,,,,43,4,4,1,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Previous studies predominantly assume a single economy-wide labour market, and therefore abstract from differences across sector-specific labour markets in the economy. In Canada, such differences are substantial. From 1991 to 2010, employment in the tradable sector is almost three times as volatile as that in the non-tradable sector, and wages are about twice as volatile. To capture the labour market differences at the sectoral level, I introduce a segmented labour market structure to a medium-scale dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with financial and labour market frictions and estimate the model using Canadian data from 1991 to 2010. I find that, in the long run, unemployment fluctuations are mainly driven by the shocks to firms' net worth and production technology in the non-tradable sector and the shocks to the foreign interest rate. In the short run, however, it is the shocks to firms' net worth in the tradable sector that account for about 50% of unemployment fluctuations. I also find that inclusion of the recent financial crisis data in the estimation is crucial for assessing the effects of the financial wealth shocks.

The research is carried out using the development index for municipalities and counties of the Ministry of Regional Development and European Union Funds and investments data of the State Audit Office. The paper is the first, not only in Croatia, to deal with investment distribution in entrepreneurial zones. The authors found that within groups of poorer counties, more developed municipalities invested more in their entrepreneurial zones, but also, they received more money from the state and county. That is not the case within the group of most developed counties, where there is no link between the development index of their local government units and investments by the county, the state and other sources. Further, municipalities in more developed counties on average received fewer investments from municipality and the state than they would have to get based on their development index.","[Pamic, Roberta Kontosic; Belullo, Alen] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Pamic, RK (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula, Croatia.",roberta.kontosic@unipu.hr,"Kontošić Pamić, Roberta/IWU-4276-2023","Kontosic Pamic, Roberta/0009-0008-6833-8290",,,,,34,5,6,2,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The increased prevalence of dissatisfaction with the standard of living contributed the most to the decline in subjective well-being during this period, followed by worsening labor market conditions manifested in increased unemployment and decline in self-reported earnings.

However, international climate agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol or Paris Agreement focused mostly on the regulation of production emissions without considering transport emissions in policy regulations. In this paper I analyze the effects of global carbon pricing on international trade and modal choice in the transportation of goods between countries, and resulting changes in international transport emissions. For this purpose I modify the Energy-environmental version of the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP-E) model to allow for substitution among different modes of transport. I find that a global GHG tax increases the competitiveness of transport services exports from the most developed countries which exhibit relatively low economic emissions intensities, while having a negative effect of services exports from most developing regions, which have relatively higher emissions rates per dollar of transport services. The findings also indicate that when international transport emissions and modal substitution are considered in global emissions regulation policies there is significant impact on the expected reduction in global emissions and global warming.

Inspired by French et al. (1987) and Bollerslev et al. (1988), who maintain that future asset returns are also influenced by past volatility, we use daily volatilities and returns from financial and commodity markets to generate real out-of-sample forecasts for the monthly oil futures prices. Our results convincingly show that although the oil market fundamentals are useful for long-run forecasting horizons, the combination of the latter with high-frequency financial data significantly improve oil price forecasts, by reducing the RMSE of the no-change forecast by approximately 68%. Results are even more impressive during the oil price collapse period of 2014-15. These findings suggest that we cannot ignore the information extracted from the financial markets when forecasting oil prices. Our results are both statistically and economically significant, as suggested by several robustness tests. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In countries where taxes are a politically costly alternative to generate fiscal revenue, debt finances fiscal expansionary activity to initially raise wages and increase output. However, institutional mechanisms keep such drivers in check, and prompt a stop-and-go cycle as Kalecki suggested in his landmark 1943 paper. We find that the push of labor interests against business stakeholders leads to non-linear dynamics over debt, deficits and long-term growth paths.","[Fisher, Eloy] Catholic Univ Panama, Panama City, Panama",,"Fisher, E (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Panama, Panama City, Panama.",eloy.fisher@fulbrightmail.org,,,,,,,14,1,1,0,5,"UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO, FAC ECONOMIA",MEXICO,"CIRCUITO INTERIOR S-N EDIFICIO B, PRIMER PISO, CIUDAD UNIV, MEXICO, DISTRITO FEDERAL 04510, MEXICO",0185-1667,,,INVEST ECON-MEX,Investig.

In line with factual evidence, the fiscal federalism literature on policy experimentation hints that grants can be employed to stimulate policy innovation through trial and error learning. Yet it lacks a theory of policy experimentation through grants, meaning that, in effect, we lack a fiscal theory of laboratory federalism. In the proposed approach, an intergovernmental grant is likened to a fiscal institution for political compromise between levels of government that frames policy experimentation options and constraints. At the same time, since policy solutions are not always easy to find or to implement, policy experimentation requires some degree of flexibility. Thus, the article shows that the extent of experimentation induced by a grant is influenced (or, more fashionably, nudged) by the conditionality attached to the grant. It argues, moreover, that if a grantor would like to induce more (less) experimentation, then, all other things equal, a grant with fewer (more) conditions attached should fare better than a grant with more (fewer) conditions attached.","[Garzarelli, Giampaolo] Sapienza Univ Roma, DiSSE, Rome, Italy; [Garzarelli, Giampaolo] Univ Witwatersrand, IPEG, SEBS, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Keeton, Lyndal] Univ Witwatersrand, Inst & Polit Econ Grp, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Keeton, Lyndal] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa",Sapienza University Rome; University of Witwatersrand; University of Witwatersrand; University of Witwatersrand,"Garzarelli, G (通讯作者)，Sapienza Univ Roma, DiSSE, Rome, Italy.;Garzarelli, G (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, IPEG, SEBS, Johannesburg, South Africa.",giampaolo.garzarelli@gmail.com; lyndal.keeton@wits.ac.za,,"Garzarelli, Giampaolo/0000-0002-2155-901X; Keeton, Lyndal/0000-0002-7580-1879","2016 Progetti di Ricerca, Sapienza - Universita di Roma [RP11615501F36030]","2016 Progetti di Ricerca, Sapienza - Universita di Roma","Emma Galli, Pavel Kuchar, Dick Langlois, Rim Limam, Matheus Magalhaes, Aldo Sitoe, Nic Spearman, Dick Wagner, Ron Wintrobe, and graduate students offered very useful feedback when we were muddling through various (differently titled) preliminary drafts.

This negative relationship between the relative price and quantity of investment suggests that heightened uncertainty depresses investment as an adverse supply shock to the investment sector. We demonstrate that a two-sector sticky price model with realistic asymmetric sectoral price rigidity can successfully account for our empirical findings. In particular, the underlying mechanism behind the negative relationship between the price and quantity of investment is limited intersectoral factor mobility. By contrast, the standard two-sector model featuring perfect factor mobility causes a negative co-movement between consumption and investment, contradicting the business cycle phenomenon.

This provides a more nuanced picture of employment dynamics than the standard approach which rests on a single measure of net job creation at firm level. Data cover the period 1995-2014 at annual frequency for about 30,000 firms each year. Empirical results indicate that wages and job productivity significantly affect job creation and destruction. Specifically, higher wages decrease job creation and increase job destruction, whereas higher productivity increases job creation and reduces job destruction. Moreover, although employment under Japan's lifetime employment system (seishain workers) helps to mitigate job destruction, it also hinders job creation, with the latter effect dominating to diminish employment growth overall.

We find that both increased contract enforcement and high trusting preferences lead to enhanced rates of contract formation and larger investments.

This paper investigates the effects of commodity price shocks on headline inflation with a cross-country panel. We find that the effects of commodity price shocks on inflation virtually disappear within about one year after the shock. This transitory effect suggests a low risk of a persistent second-round effect on inflation. While the effect on the price level varies across country groups, the transitory effect is fairly robust. We also allow for the possibility that the effect of commodity price shocks may vary, depending on inflation regimes.

This paper explores an additional challenge, for monetary policy. Although remittances expand bank balance sheets, providing a stable flow of interest-insensitive funding, they tend to increase banks' holdings of liquid assets. This both reduces the need for an interbank market and severs the link between policy rate and banks' marginal cost of funds, thus shutting down a major transmission channel. We develop a stylized model based on asymmetric information and a lack of transparent borrowers and undertake econometric analysis providing evidence that increased remittance inflows are associated with weaker transmission. As independent monetary policy becomes impaired, this result is consistent with earlier findings that recipient countries tend to favor fixed exchange rate regimes.","[Barajas, Adolfo; Chami, Ralph; Ebeke, Christian; Oeking, Anne] Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Oeking, A (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",abarajas@imf.org; rchami@imf.org; cebeke@imf.org; aoeking@imf.org,,,,,,,37,11,13,1,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

In spite of the many empirical studies confirming this Rockets-and-Feathers phenomenon for different industries, the mechanism driving it is not well understood. We use simple experimental markets with and without search frictions and either privately or publicly observed cost shocks to study how sensitive the Rockets-and-Feathers phenomenon is to changes in search costs and information conditions. In contrast to standard theoretical predictions we observe price dispersion and spontaneous asymmetric price adjustments in all treatments. Neither search costs nor private information on cost shocks are indispensable for prices to adjust asymmetrically in the short term. The initial asymmetry quickly disappears if the direction of the cost shocks are publicly known, while it persists in both treatments with private information. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The results from methodology of Bai and Perron (1998, 2003) suggest that the change of the policy rule (January 2006 and May 2009) induces a break in the inflation process (January 2008) and in the market equation (October 2008); the latter due to the existence of nominal frictions and incomplete information in the Peruvian economy. Moreover, results from the estimation of the method of Qu and Perron (2007) reaffirm that there are breaks in the entire reduced system (May 2008 and May 2010). In both cases, the channel of expectations is strengthened since 2008 and it is related to changes in the monetary policy during those years.

Information embodied in pre-game money lines facilitates the calculation of the market's expectation that the game will end with a strong favorite winning but not covering the point spread, a result deemed suspicious in previous studies. Additional market-based information embodied in second-half lines reveal how the market's expectation about second-half play differs from pre-game expectations. Applying our methodology to college basketball reduces previous estimates of the percentage of games thought to be consistent with potential point shaving to insignificant levels. Our approach can apply to other sports in which strong favorites are common. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The Hubei, Guangdong and Shenzhen ETS pilots have obviously greater market shares and higher liquidity than the Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing and Fujian ETS pilots. Market fragmentations have significant impacts on emissions allowance returns in the Beijing, Guangdong and Hubei ETS pilots; illiquidity ratios and trading values have significant influences on emissions allowance returns in the Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hubei and Fujian ETS pilots; and the variances in market fragmentation and liquidity in the Beijing, Shenzhen and Hubei ETS pilots have more persistent impacts on the variances in emissions allowance returns than the Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangdong and Chongqing ETS pilots. Greater market fragmentation, insufficient allowance transactions, longer trade intervals and poorer information transparency result in lower liquidity and pricing efficiency.

As a new trade technology, e-commerce can increase inter-city trade and alleviate spatial consumption inequality because it (1) eliminates the fixed cost of market entry, and (2) reduces the effects of distance on trade costs. Using unique data from China's leading e-commerce platform, we provide evidence consistent with these two features: online trade is less hindered by distance relative to offline trade, and residents from smaller and more remote cities spend a larger fraction of their income online. We then build a multi-region general equilibrium model to quantify the impacts of e-commerce on domestic trade and welfare. We find that although it partially crowds out inter-city trade originally taking place offline, the emergence of e-commerce increases the aggregate domestic trade. The welfare gains from e-commerce are 1.6% on average, and are about 30% larger for cities in the smallest population and market potential quintiles. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, after more than a quarter century of research, no consensus has been reached on how to identify such vulnerable individuals within a given population. Some misunderstandings have also arisen from the overlapping of other closely related concepts, such as the expectation of being poor, expected poverty, multi-period poverty and risk exposure. This paper offers a detailed conceptual discussion on vulnerability to poverty and its related elements, reviewing a wide range of identifying criteria provided in the literature. It is found that according to the state of the art in this field of research, two key elements stand out in identifying vulnerable individuals: an expected well-being below the poverty line and a relevant risk of falling into poverty due to downside deviation from a reference level of well-being. The traditional classification of vulnerability approaches has been updated into four groups: (i) those that stress the element of exposure to risk; (ii) those that emphasize the element of expected poverty; (iii) those that define vulnerability through a utility gap and (iv) those that are supported by a mean-risk dominance criterion.","[Gallardo, Mauricio] Univ Catolica Norte, Escuela Ciencias Empresariales, Antofagasta, Chile",Universidad Catolica del Norte,"Gallardo, M (通讯作者)，Univ Catolica Norte, Escuela Ciencias Empresariales, Antofagasta, Chile.",megallardo@ucn.cl,"Gallardo, Mauricio/Q-5450-2017","Gallardo, Mauricio/0000-0002-7230-2281",,,,,108,41,45,7,51,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

It also analyzes the possibility of moving to a voting system that allocates parliamentary seats according to life expectancy. The presented results imply the following three main findings. First, the voting system is important when population demographics change. Declining birthrates and an aging population may shorten the temporal perspective for policymaking over time. Any theoretical transition from the current voting system to a voting system that allocates parliamentary seats according to life expectancy would thus lengthen the temporal perspective for policymaking, potentially increasing the public investment rate and improving the utilities of the working and future generations. Second, when age-based voting turnout disparity is high, a shift from the current voting system to one based on either life expectancy and region or life expectancy and age is possible. Third, assuming both transitions are possible, the latter holds greater promise for increasing the utilities of the working and future generations than the former.","[Ishida, Ryo] Minist Finance, Policy Res Inst, Chiyoda Ku, 3-1-1 Kasumigaseki, Tokyo 1008940, Japan; [Oguro, Kazumasa] Hosei Univ, Fac Econ, 4342 Aihara, Machida, Tokyo 1940298, Japan",Hosei University,"Ishida, R (通讯作者)，Minist Finance, Policy Res Inst, Chiyoda Ku, 3-1-1 Kasumigaseki, Tokyo 1008940, Japan.",ryou.ishida@mof.go.jp; ZVU07057@nifty.com,,,JSPS KAKENHI [23730270]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23730270] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We would like to express our gratitude to the many people who advised us during the writing of the first draft of this paper, particularly Prof. Akira Yakita, Nagoya City Univ.; Prof. Shinji Yamashige, Hitotsubashi Univ.; Prof. Tom Nakazato, Sophia Univ.; and Prof. Jun Iritani, Fukuyama Univ as well as anonymous referees.

The unidirectional threshold causality from growth to defence shows that the military impact on a positive change in China's growth is little in the long term. Conversely, the growth impact of a positive change in defence has accelerated after it reaches the threshold year in 1987.

J,"Layton, R",,,,"Layton, Roslyn",,,Net Neutrality and Mobile App Innovation in Denmark and Netherlands 2010-2016,REVIEW OF NETWORK ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,innovation; net neutrality; policy; regulation; telecommunications,,"Net neutrality or Open Internet rulemaking has been ongoing for more than a decade. Some 50 nations have adopted formal rules including the US (then repealed), the European Union, India, and many countries in Latin America. Among other arguments, it is asserted that net neutrality rules are necessary for application innovation. While the focus for policymakers has largely been to make rules, there is less attention on how to measure the impact of such rules and how well they achieve their innovation goals. The article summaries a specific research investigation to what degree the introduction of rules in a given country stimulates innovation in that country's mobile app ecosystem. The focus in on mobile networks because it allowed the most consistent data across countries. The study covered 53 countries, their net neutrality policies (or lack thereof), and the results to the respective mobile application ecosystems of the countries adopting rules between the period of 2010-2016. This investigation tests the proposition that countries which adopt net neutrality rules should experience an increase in mobile app development innovation within their national economy. To test this, a statistical methodology was developed based upon measuring the number of locally developed mobile apps in the country for relevant periods before and after rules are imposed and the corresponding app downloads, usage, and revenue. Measurement was conducted with two independent toolsets and adjusted for the sophistication and penetration of advanced mobile networks in the country. To make more meaningful comparisons and avoid inevitable heterogeneity across the countries, the investigation focuses on two similar countries with different rules, Denmark with soft rules (self-regulation) and Netherlands with hard rules (legislation). The study reviewed the leading theories of innovation as well as the foundational papers in net neutrality to explain the observed discrepancies. The research finds significant statistical support for soft net neutrality measures adopted on a voluntary basis. Hard rules adopted through legislation and regulation were not associated with greater mobile app development for the given country. Denmark increased in local mobile app development while Netherlands decreased. Additionally, the explosion of mobile apps from countries with no net neutrality rules and the general dearth of mobile apps from countries which have had hard rules for years runs counter to expected results. This suggests that policymakers revisit their assumptions and expectations for net neutrality policy.","[Layton, Roslyn] Aalborg Univ, Ctr Commun Media & Informat Technol, Copenhagen, Denmark",Aalborg University,"Layton, R (通讯作者)，Aalborg Univ, Ctr Commun Media & Informat Technol, Copenhagen, Denmark.",roslyn@layton.dk,,,,,,,25,1,1,0,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

Following a theoretically consistent approach, I construct regional measures of high- and low-skill export demand shocks using the variation in initial industry composition across regions and differential skill intensities across industries. Using a sub-national data over the period 1990 to 2005, the empirical analysis shows that high-skill export shocks raise both high school and college enrollments, while low-skill export shocks depress both. These relationships appear to be attributable to the association between skill premium and skill demand embodied in export shocks. The amplified differences in skill abundance across regions reinforce the initial industry specialization patterns. These findings suggest a mutually reinforcing relationship between regional industry specialization and skill formation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The discovery of non-conventional coal-seam gas reserves led to investment in three 'lumpy' LNG export facilities in Gladstone, Queensland. Drilling activity has subsequently slowed, a direct result of a soft global price for LNG. This slowdown, in an environment of a tripling of east-coast gas demand, has resulted in concerns about domestic gas shortages. To be clear, there is no lack of gas resources. Instead, the problem relates to the relative lumpiness of capital allocation and temporal instability driven by changing global circumstances. Utilising a simple partial equilibrium model, various options for overcoming these problems are analysed. Of these options, developing import infrastructure appears to be a 'no regrets' option that would ensure that the price floor, the LNG netback price, also becomes the market price cap.

Using a quasi experimental design applied to noncash charitable contribution deductions, I show that even basic self reporting requirements are effective at reducing evasion but impose large compliance costs on taxpayers. I find that simplified reporting requirements reduce reporting costs by $55 per person and substantially increase claimed donations. However, half of the new donations are due to evasion. Thus, information reporting should only be imposed on total reported donations above a pre-specified threshold. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Individuals assigned to the treatment group of our experiment received a brochure that informed them about job search strategies and the consequences of unemployment, and motivated them to actively look for new employment. We study the causal impact of the brochure by comparing labor market outcomes of treated and untreated job seekers in administrative data containing comprehensive information on individuals' employment status and earnings. The effects of our treatment tend to be positive, but concentrated among job seekers who are at risk of being unemployed for an extended period of time. Specifically, treatment effects in our overall sample are moderately positive on average, but mostly insignificant. At the same time, we do observe pronounced and statistically significant effects for individuals who exhibit an increased risk of long-term unemployment. For this group, the brochure increases employment and earnings in the year after the intervention by roughly 4%. Given the low cost of the intervention, our findings indicate that targeted information provision can be a highly effective policy tool in the labor market.

To achieve this goal, the study develops a theoretical model based on the neoclassical theory of the firm that links energy efficiency to bank sector development, and a unique bank-based data by Andrianova et al. (2015) for 43 Sub-Saharan African countries from 1998 to 2012. The principal component analysis is used to derive a composite bank-based development index from different bank balance sheet performance indicators- return on asset, asset quality, bank capitalization, managerial inefficiency and financial stability. The two-stage system generalized method of moment (Sys-GMM) technique was used. The results reveal that, both in the short- and long-run, improved banking performance fosters energy efficiency improvements in sub-Saharan Africa, but this is compromised by democracy (institutional quality). Thus, to achieve energy efficiency improvements, specific initiatives should be implemented to boost the development of the banking sector while also ensuring that democratic governance in the sub-region weans itself off things that impede the progress of the real sector. More ambitiously, creating a Green Bank may be necessary to stimulate energy efficiency investments in the sub-region. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

I compare the fit and forecasting performance of the model to that of a range of linear and nonlinear GARCH models widely adopted in the literature. Complexity-penalized likelihood criteria show that the Markov switching long memory model improves the description of the data. The out-of-sample results at several time horizons show that the model produces superior forecasts over those obtained from the selected GARCH competitors. Results are obtained using Patton's robust loss functions and the Hansen's superior predictive ability test.

We derive theoretical results and present simulation and empirical evidence showing that these CIs do not guard against model misspecification, and that they have poor coverage properties.

At the same time, China is experiencing a rising tide of religion, the impact of which on social integration remains unexplored. Based on a large-scale survey for rural-urban migrants, we find that being a religious believer is associated with a higher level of trust towards strangers. In addition, participating in religious-related activities has a positive impact on trust for both believers and non-believers. We test the robustness of our results using instrumental variable analysis. We conjecture that prosocial values in religious teaching and social interaction opportunities contribute to rural-urban migrants' generalized trust.

Wages play a dual role by allocating labor supply and motivating employee effort. This gives rise to an equilibrium wage distribution that contrasts with existing literature.

In the 1920s and 1930s, Friedrich August von Hayek questioned this monetary policy regime, and stressed injection effects of the newly created money aimed at price level stabilization in the economy with expanding natural output. This paper compares the Hayekian theory with mainstream economics. A simple graphical apparatus is used to clarify major differences between the two theories. Standard textbook models are applied to show why the Hayekian approach favours secular deflation over price level stabilization which may lead to the boom -bust cycle.The next section presents New Keynesian arguments in favour of stable prices or even low inflation, and it shows why the Hayek recommendations may result in quasi -recession. The Wicksellian equation, which relates inflation gap to the real interest rate gap, is derived to reconcile the Hayek approach with the mainstream perspective.

People who were observed purchasing scratch cards at selling kiosks were offered, upon completing scratching their cards and discovering whether (and how much) they have won or lost, to participate in a simple task with monetary payoffs and an opportunity to increase their pay by acting dishonestly. The results reveal that lottery losers behave significantly more dishonestly than lottery winners and that honesty monotonically increases with the net profit derived from the lottery (amount won minus lottery price). It thus follows that winning a lottery has not the same effect on moral disengagement as winning a competition which has been shown in the literature to engender dishonest behavior.","[Siniver, Erez] COMAS, Rishon Leziyyon, Israel; [Yaniv, Gideon] Ariel Univ, Ariel, Israel",Ariel University,"Yaniv, G (通讯作者)，Ariel Univ, Ariel, Israel.",yanivgi@ariel.ac.il,,,,,,,22,8,9,1,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

We explore a unique firm-level Chinese Environmental Statistics dataset and utilize a regression discontinuity design to assess the impact of central supervision through the NSMF program on an industrial firm's chemical oxygen demand (COD) emissions. The results suggest that central supervision significantly reduces industrial COD emissions by at least 26.8%. These results highlight the substantial room for improvement in Chinese environmental regulations via central supervision. A more flexible environmental decentralization regime and comprehensive central supervision are thus recommended for future reforms. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Texas provides an ideal setting for this research strategy. First, Texas has the largest number of giant oil fields. Second, Texas's giant oil fields possess the greatest remaining oil potential. Third, giant oil fields are dispersed throughout the state. We find that a 1% increase in the value of oil reserves increases murder by 0.16%, robbery by 0.55% and larceny by 0.18%. Using the estimated elasticities, an average increase in the value of oil reserves (26% increase in the value of reserves) results in a 4.15% increase in murder rates, 8% increase in robbery and 4.7% increase in larceny. These effects are not trivial. We explore potential mechanisms that could be driving this increase in crime and find that an increase in the value of local oil reserves improves the local economic conditions, increases the share of young males, and increases the share of individuals residing in group quarters (e.g. temporary worker housing) of its county with no effect on the local economic conditions, demographic changes or crime rates of adjacent counties.

To avoid this problem, this paper provides a detailed case study of the Swedish Tobacco Monopoly's pricing with data from 1916 to 1959. Prices are found to be below those that maximize the expected net present value of profits. However, the difference between actual and optimal price diminishes over time, and towards the end of the period the two are almost indistinguishable. The net present value of actual profits is approximately 60% of what could have been obtained. Overall, the pricing patterns appear more consistent with the firm learning about demand conditions than being the result of maximization of something other than profits.","[Asplund, Marcus] CEPR, Copenhagen Business Sch, Frederiksberg, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Asplund, M (通讯作者)，CEPR, Copenhagen Business Sch, Frederiksberg, Denmark.",,,,,,,,42,1,1,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,JUL,2018,85.0,339,,,,,532,557,,10.1111/ecca.12215,0.0,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GI5LQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000434412400006,0

To analyze the liquidity and prices of such assets, I adapt the Shi (1995), Trejos and Wright (1995) model with Lucas trees under adverse selection. While most studies focus on either a pooling or separating equilibrium, I apply the undefeated equilibrium refinement by Mailath et al. (1993) to make the selection based on fundamentals. Under pooling, the high-quality asset holder accepts a pooled price, and under separating signals quality through asset retention. Applying the refinement results in a regime switch from no-information (pooling) to information revelation (separating) following a negative shock to the quality or quantity of lemons.

The quantification of movement is addressed using a general concept of distance between positions and a parsimonious set of axioms that characterize the distance concept and yield a class of aggregative indices. This class of indices induces a superclass of mobility measures over the different status concepts consistent with the same underlying data. We investigate the statistical inference of mobility indices using two well-known status concepts, related to income mobility and rank mobility.

Over the two subperiods of the Great Inflation and Great Moderation, both of them are estimated by the method of simulated moments. An innovative feature is here that the moments do not only include the autocovariances up to eight lags of quarterly output, inflation and the interest rate, but optionally also a measure of the raggedness of the three variables. In short, the performance of the Old-Keynesian model is very satisfactory and similar to the New-Keynesian model, or even better.

Evidence from a rule-based policy,JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Rule-based intervention; Portfolio balance; Foreign exchange policy; Regression discontinuity; Non-linear impulse response,CAPITAL MOBILITY; RATES; LIQUIDITY; DESIGN,"This paper investigates the effectiveness of sterilized foreign exchange interventions by exploiting a discontinuous policy rule used by the Central Bank of Colombia. We use a unique data set that comprises tick by tick intervention and order book data, daily capital in- and outflows, and balance sheet information of financial institutions. We apply regression discontinuity methods to identify the surprise component of rule-based interventions and use this variation to measure how they affect exchange rates and capital flows. Our findings indicate that interventions had significant effects on the exchange rate, albeit short-lived (2-3 weeks). Moreover, capital controls amplify the effect of intervention, though some effect remains even in the presence of free capital flows. A methodological contribution of the paper is to extend regression discontinuity designs to a time-series environment and to show how these techniques can be used to identify and estimate local non-linear impulse response functions. A clearly defined policy rule and high frequency data are crucial in exploiting local variation around the policy cutoff. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The SIN is constructed in two steps. First, we develop a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) of regime-switching between a normal market phase represented by a geometric Brownian motion and a bubble regime represented by the stochastic super-exponential Sornette and Andersen (Int J Mod Phys C 13(2):171-188, 2002) bubble model. The calibration of the HMM provides the probability at each time for a given security to be in the bubble regime. Conditional on two assets being qualified in the bubble regime, we then use the transfer entropy to quantify the influence of the returns of one asset i onto another asset j, from which we introduce the adjacency matrix of the SIN among securities. We apply our technology to the Chinese stock market during the period 2005-2008, during which a normal phase was followed by a spectacular bubble ending in a massive correction. We introduce the Net Speculative Influence Intensity variable as the difference between the transfer entropies from i to j and from j to i, which is used in a series of rank ordered regressions to predict the maximum loss (%MaxLoss) endured during the crash. The sectors that influenced other sectors the most are found to have the largest losses. There is some predictability obtained by using the transfer entropy involving industrial sectors to explain the %MaxLoss of financial institutions but not vice versa. We also show that the bubble state variable calibrated on the Chinese market data corresponds well to the regimes when the market exhibits a strong price acceleration followed by clear change of price regimes. Our results suggest that SIN may contribute significant skill to the development of general linkage-based systemic risks measures and early warning metrics.","[Lin, Li] East China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China; [Sornette, Didier] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Scheuchzerstr 7, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Sornette, Didier] Univ Geneva, Swiss Finance Inst, 40 Blvd Du Pont dArve, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; [Lin, Li] East China Univ Technol & Sci, Res Inst Financial Engn, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China",East China University of Science & Technology; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Geneva,"Lin, L (通讯作者)，East China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China.;Lin, L (通讯作者)，East China Univ Technol & Sci, Res Inst Financial Engn, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China.",llin@ecust.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Founds of China [71301051]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China [WN1522007],National Natural Science Founds of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),We acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Science Founds of China (Grant No. 71301051) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China (Grant No. WN1522007).,,74,2,3,1,23,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

As in Davila et al. (2012), whether capital is over-accumulated depends on how the pecuniary externalities affect insurance and redistribution. In a human capital economy, however, not only capital but also human capital generates externalities and an additional channel arises that has implications for the overaccumulation (under-accumulation) of capital (human capital). The income sources of the poor and the correlation between wealth and human capital are crucial for the implication of pecuniary externalities.

I propose a general equilibrium model in which entrepreneurs finance their firm through a long-term contract with a financial intermediary. The contract is inefficient because firm cash flow is costly to monitor, and borrowers that repudiate cannot be excluded from capital markets. By investing in enforcement capacity, an intermediary can delay debt repayment and maintain incentive compatibility. Reforms that seek to decrease either the cost of monitoring or enforcing contracts, or both, affect firm dynamics and can generate complementaries. Estimating the model with data on Colombian manufacturing firms in the 1980s and 1990s, I find that financial frictions are responsible for a significant aggregate output loss. Most of this distortion can be attributed to private information. Reforms that only reduce private information create significant economic growth and welfare gains, while those that only improve enforcement do not. There are significant complementarities between different types of reforms, as moral hazard is less significant when contracts are more enforceable.

From the perspective of the company it is necessary to know customer satisfaction, as it is reflected in the company's performance. The research shows that there are significant differences in the evaluation of customer satisfaction from the perspective of companies and from the perspective of their customers, and that these differences are also reflected in the differences in the performance of the companies. The self-evaluation of companies tends to be overestimated in relation to the evaluation of companies by their customers, regardless of whether the companies are high-performing or low-performing. Customers are better able to distinguish the high-performing companies from the low-performing ones, since the high-performing companies received better evaluation from customers. In contrast, in the self-evaluation of companies, there were no statistically significant differences between the high-performing and low-performing companies. Companies evaluate customer satisfaction incorrectly regardless of their level of performance. Even if the evaluation of customer satisfaction from the company's perspective is generally overestimated in comparison with the view of customers, some factors of satisfaction are, at least concerning the trends, in agreement with both perspectives, that is, those of the customers and the companies.","[Suchanek, Petr] Masaryk Univ, Dept Corp Econ, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno, Czech Republic; [Kralova, Maria] Masaryk Univ, Dept Appl Math & Comp Sci, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno; Masaryk University Brno,"Suchánek, P (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Dept Corp Econ, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno, Czech Republic.",suchy@econ.muni.cz,"Králová, Maria/D-1801-2014; Suchanek, Petr/R-9626-2019","Králová, Maria/0000-0001-8515-8402; Suchanek, Petr/0000-0002-2606-4040",Quality Management and Enterprise Competitiveness [MUNI/A/0799/2013],Quality Management and Enterprise Competitiveness,This work was supported by the Quality Management and Enterprise Competitiveness [grant number MUNI/A/0799/2013].,,57,12,14,2,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Developed around the corresponding tax wedge, the variable of interest is a firm-specific effective tax rate that aggregates all public finance liabilities, based on a unique set of hand-collected data from publicly available corporate reports. Using a fixed-effect model, the results show that one percentage point increase in overall firm-specific tax rate triggers 0.15 percentage points decrease in return on assets.

The overall effect, however, is modest-around one sixth of the slowdown in consumption between 2000-06 and 2007-12and mostly driven by states with particularly large imbalances in their household sector.

The question is why it seems, in many contexts, to be preferred over standard life insurance even though the latter is a more flexible product. This paper presents a simple model in which funeral insurance differs from life insurance in that there is a constraint on how the payout is spent. Funeral insurance can therefore serve as an intergenerational commitment device. The model's key prediction is consistent with South African household data.","[Berg, Erlend] Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, Priory Rd Complex, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England",University of Bristol,"Berg, E (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, Priory Rd Complex, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England.",erlend.berg@bristol.ac.uk,,,Research Council of Norway; British Academy,Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); British Academy,I thank the Research Council of Norway and the British Academy for financial support and the South African Advertising Research Foundation for giving me access to their data.,,52,3,3,1,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

We find that students in the French-speaking region have a lower level of financial literacy than students in the German-speaking region. The difference in financial literacy across the language groups is stronger for native students and monolingual students than for immigrant students and bilingual students. This supports the hypothesis that embedded cultural differences rather than unobserved heterogeneity in schooling are driving the effect. A mediation analysis suggests that the cultural divide in financial literacy is related to systematic differences in financial socialisation across the language groups. Students in the German speaking region are more likely to receive pocket money at an early age, and are more likely to have independent access to a bank account than students in the French speaking region.

Changes in inequality are decomposed using an Oaxaca-Blinder-like decomposition analysis based on the Recentered Influence Function (RIF) methodology, which allows splitting the overall change in inequality into endowment effects associated with changes in the distribution of inequality covariates and coefficient effects, which are related to changing returns to these covariates. Our results show that the Gini for disposable incomes has increased in a statistically significant way over 2008-2012 for Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary and Slovenia. For most of the countries with significant increases in inequality, a falling full-time employment rate played the biggest role in explaining changes in inequality, accounting for about 50-60% of the Gini change for disposable incomes and about 60-80% of the Gini change for market incomes. The fall in the full-time employment rate had a smaller inequality-increasing effect for disposable incomes in Hungary (about 15% of the Gini increase). Increased part-time employment during the recession had either no impact on inequality or was rather inequality-decreasing. We did not find evidence that changes in the incidence of temporary jobs had any impact on income inequality.","[Brzezinski, Michal] Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Brzezinski, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland.",mbrzezinski@wne.uw.edu.pl,"Li, Wang/M-1612-2019; Brzezinski, Michal/N-3365-2013","Brzezinski, Michal/0000-0002-7704-3805",Polish National Science Centre [DEC-2013/09/B/HS4/01924],Polish National Science Centre,"I would like to thank the participants of the 2014 Crises and distribution conference (Free University Berlin, 2015), the International Conference Economic Challenges in Enlarged Europe (Tallinn) and the CEPS/INSTEAD seminar (Luxembourg, 2014).

The aim is to compare how the different sources of information (external and internal) and cooperation for innovation are used in manufacturing and services in Europe using Community Innovation Survey (CIS) data for 15 European countries. The empirical study uses a sample of firms included in the CIS (2008), which covers 15 European countries and applies multivarious data analysis techniques to extract results. The results of this research suggest that firms use simultaneously different sources of information for cooperation, revealing different patterns of cooperation according to the activity sector in Europe. This paper brings some important insights about cooperation for innovation and suggests some patterns in Europe useful to design public policies, due de similar behavior of some countries grouped according with geography, development status or other economic features. Thus, this article seeks to frame the subject based on a literature review that raises a set of study hypotheses and presents an empirical study applied to cooperation for innovation in Europe using the CIS for 15 European countries.","[Carvalho, Luisa] Univ Aberta, Dept Social Sci & Management, Rua Braamcamp 90,Piso 5, P-1250052 Lisbon, Portugal; [Carvalho, Luisa] Univ Evora, CEFAGE, Rua Braamcamp 90,Piso 5, P-1250052 Lisbon, Portugal; [Madeira, Maria Jose] Univ Beira Interior, Management & Econ Dept, Polo 4, P-6200209 Covilha, Portugal; [Carvalho, Joao] Univ Beira Interior, Rua 1 Maio,Vivenda 3, P-6230339 Fundao, Portugal; [Moura, Dulcineia Catarina] Univ Beira Interior, Rua Formosa 66,Bloco B,3 B, P-6300837 Guarda, Portugal; [Duarte, Filipe P.] Univ Beira Interior, Ave Caminhos Santiago 76, P-3500063 Viseu, Portugal",Universidade Aberta; University of Evora; Universidade da Beira Interior; Universidade da Beira Interior; Universidade da Beira Interior; Universidade da Beira Interior,"Carvalho, L (通讯作者)，Univ Aberta, Dept Social Sci & Management, Rua Braamcamp 90,Piso 5, P-1250052 Lisbon, Portugal.;Carvalho, L (通讯作者)，Univ Evora, CEFAGE, Rua Braamcamp 90,Piso 5, P-1250052 Lisbon, Portugal.",luisam.carvalho@uab.pt; maria.jose.madeira@ubi.pt; joao.carvalho@ubi.pt; dulcineia.coito@ubi.pt; filipeduarte@ubi.pt,"Madeira, Maria Jose Aguilar/AAC-7928-2020; Duarte, Filipe AP/ABA-7472-2020; Cesario, Marisa/E-9734-2019; Carvalho, Luisa Cagica/K-3459-2014","Madeira, Maria Jose Aguilar/0000-0003-1722-6148; Duarte, Filipe AP/0000-0001-9381-8562; Cesario, Marisa/0000-0001-7832-6949; Carvalho, Luisa Cagica/0000-0002-9804-7813; Moura, Dulcineia Catarina/0000-0002-3539-4754",Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [UID/ECO/04007/2013]; FEDER/COMPETE [POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007659]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [UID/GES/04630/2013] Funding Source: FCT,Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FEDER/COMPETE(European Union (EU)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),The first author is pleased to acknowledge financial support from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (grant UID/ECO/04007/2013) and FEDER/COMPETE (POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007659).,,65,3,4,1,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1868-7865,1868-7873,,J KNOWL ECON,J.

On one hand, migrants' disentitlement to local urban hukou creates financial insecurity through barriers to employment, social welfare, medical insurance, etc., thereby encouraging precautionary saving. On the other hand, it promotes temporary migration, allows divergence in tastes and values from local urban residents to persist, and incentivizes migrant households to save their transitory income. Factors reflecting these two channels, such as medical and pension insurances, the duration of migration, and local home-ownership, are specifically modeled, and they are found to contribute to the discrepancies in consumption between migrant and local urban households, among other factors. In addition, the marginal propensity to consume exhibits heterogeneity across migrant households; it is higher with a longer duration of migration, local homeownership, and self-employment. The lack of these attributes further reinforces the reluctance of migrant households to consume.","[Chen, Xiaofen] Truman State Univ, Dept Econ, 100 East Normal Ave, Kirksville, MO 63501 USA",,"Chen, XF (通讯作者)，Truman State Univ, Dept Econ, 100 East Normal Ave, Kirksville, MO 63501 USA.",xiaofen@truman.edu,,"Chen, Xiaofen/0000-0001-7220-1993",,,,,30,23,24,9,44,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

This paper addresses two problems encountered when modeling substitution: spurious correlations arising from data with trends and violations of the law of demand. This paper shows how the dynamic linear logit model addresses these two problems. First, the model allows adjustment in quantities and, thereby, avoids spurious correlations arising from data with significant trends. Secondly, the linear nature of the substitution elasticities facilitates parameter restrictions to ensure that substitution estimates are consistent with the law of demand and the mathematical conditions consistent with cost minimizing behavior by producers. These features are illustrated by estimating the dynamic linear logit model for energy demand in the U.S. industrial sector. The empirical results demonstrate that the dynamic linear logit model is well suited for data with common trends and for ensuring robust and intuitively appealing estimates of demand elasticities and associated substitution possibilities.","[Considine, Timothy J.] Univ Wyoming, Dept 3985, Coll Business 323E, 1000 E Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",University of Wyoming,"Considine, TJ (通讯作者)，Univ Wyoming, Dept 3985, Coll Business 323E, 1000 E Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",tconsidi@uwyo.edu,,"Considine, Timothy/0000-0001-6844-9494",,,,,36,2,2,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

By means of a difference-in-differences analysis, we evaluate changes in market quality of stocks that initiated trading in Multilateral Trading Facilities (MTF) in relation to matched samples. Our analysis provides evidence that the overall liquidity (measured by transaction costs and price impact) and trading activity increased in the short term with trade initiation in MTF. Notably, we show that fragmentation did not cause lower price precision or informativeness, but some tests suggest that fragmentation correlates positively with volatility. The results of this study are stronger for stocks with greater propensity for MTF trade initiation, i.e. stocks with greater size and liquidity prior to that event. Interestingly, the impact on liquidity and trading activity varied across stock exchanges and timing of MTF trade initiation. As for long run effects, our results suggest an improvement of overall liquidity and a neutral effect on the trading activity of traditional exchanges.","[da Silva, Paulo Pereira] Univ Evora Palacio Vimioso, CEFAGE, Largo Marques de Marialva 8, P-7000809 Evora, Portugal; [da Silva, Paulo Pereira] Portuguese Secur Commiss, CMVM, Rua Laura Alves 4, P-1064003 Lisbon, Portugal",,"da Silva, PP (通讯作者)，Univ Evora Palacio Vimioso, CEFAGE, Largo Marques de Marialva 8, P-7000809 Evora, Portugal.;da Silva, PP (通讯作者)，Portuguese Secur Commiss, CMVM, Rua Laura Alves 4, P-1064003 Lisbon, Portugal.",e-paulosilva@cmvm.pt,"da Silva, Paulo Pereira/P-4634-2019; da Silva, Paulo Miguel Pereira/L-2349-2018","da Silva, Paulo Pereira/0000-0003-4774-128X;",Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [UID/ECO/04007/2013]; FEDER/COMPETE [POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007659],Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FEDER/COMPETE(European Union (EU)),The author thanks the editor and an anonymous referee for valuable comments and suggestions.

I assess the validity of the measure, and show that it is hard to reconcile with familiar theories of intertemporal choice. I find a worldwide optimism about the future; in spite of repeated evidence to the contrary, people consistently but irrationally predict they will be better off five years from now. The gap between future and current wellbeing diminishes with age, and in rich countries, is negative among the elderly. I also use the measure to think about income transfers by age and sex.

To revive his insights, the present paper adapts his stationary economy to a growth context. Introducing a reasonable nonlinearity into the investment function, it then takes care that the model exhibits persistent cyclical behaviour that is characterized by a unique, globally attracting limit cycle. This feature is a robust property. A calibration of the numerical parameters achieves desired values for the cycle period as well as the amplitudes of the output-capital ratio and the capital growth rate. It is moreover demonstrated that a one-time shock to the dynamics can easily have long-lasting effects on the amplitudes. Despite common misgivings about delay differential equations (which here result from Kalecki's implementation lag), the analysis can be conducted with a limited mathematical effort.

Due to a lack of reliable data on migrants' preferences, empirical evidence, however, is scarce. Therefore, this paper has sought to advance research on preferences and migration decisions by using original household survey data from two developing countries that are both characterized by a longstanding tradition in regional migration. In coastal communities in Ghana and Indonesia, individual risk and time preferences have not only been elicited through survey questions but also through experimental tasks with real and relatively large monetary payoffs. There is evidence that out-migrants from both study regions are significantly less risk averse and have a lower time preference than non-migrants. Overall, the results indicate that the considered individual preferences are as important as employment status, education or networks, which have mainly been the focus of migration theories.

The town of Basalt, in the southwestern part of the state, is split in half by two counties that chose different modes of voting. Our research design compares these two counties to understand whether turnout levels were altered by all-mail elections. Our analysis considers the possibility that social interactions may lead to spillover effects-a situation in which one unit's outcome may be affected by the treatment received by other units. In our application, treated and control voters lived in very close proximity and spillovers are possible. Using the potential outcomes framework, we consider different estimands under the assumption that interference occurs only when treated individuals are in close geographic proximity to a sufficiently high number of control individuals. Under our assumptions, our empirical analysis suggests that all-mail voting decreased turnout in Colorado, and shows no evidence of spatial interference between voters.","[Keele, Luke] Georgetown Univ, McCourt Sch Publ Policy, 304 Old North,37th & O St, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Keele, Luke] Georgetown Univ, Dept Govt, 304 Old North,37th & O St, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Titiunik, Rocio] Univ Michigan, Dept Polit Sci, 5700 Haven Hall,505 South State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Georgetown University; Georgetown University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Keele, L (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, McCourt Sch Publ Policy, 304 Old North,37th & O St, Washington, DC 20057 USA.;Keele, L (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Dept Govt, 304 Old North,37th & O St, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",lk681@georgetown.edu; titiunik@umich.edu,,,National Science Foundation [SES 1357561],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This manuscript was prepared for the CESifo Economic Studies special issue on geocoding to follow our keynote lecture presentation at the 2016 CESifo Economic Studies Conference on the Use of Geo-coded Data in Economic Research, held in Munich in 18 and 19 November 2016.

Literature review lists a number of factors of the business environment affecting businesses. These factors may be oriented towards inputs, outputs, sales, or can be an instrument of regional policy. With regard to future development of businesses, it is crucial to identify which factor and to what extent can influence the operation of the business. Purpose of the article: The main objective of the primary research was to provide a comprehensive assessment of how different factors influence enterprises of different economic sectors as well as help to verify the research question defined and formulate recommendations for future development of enterprises. The questionnaire survey to verify the research question was conducted on a sample of 496 small and medium-sized enterprises. Methods: We chose quantitative method of ANOVA for processing the results of the survey, and we also set the limit of significant impact of different influence factors on the basis of analysed data of primary research, and the limit of significant impact. Based on literature study, we have grouped individual factors such as factors focused on inputs, on outputs, on sales, and instruments of regional policy. Based on those findings we can identify the impact of factors for the future development of SMEs in different economic sectors. Findings & Value added: SMEs of Nitra Region involved in the research represent different economic sectors and various factors influence them with different intensity, for future development of these SMEs it is necessary to reduce the transport cost of raw material and goods, improve the attitude of employees to work, and the technical level of equipment to improve the economic situation of the region. The mentioned findings are important for formulating the future regional development plan.","[Korcsmaros, Eniko; Simova, Monika] J Selye Univ, Komarno, Slovakia",J.

Although DCEs assume that respondents know their true preferences and can make choices precisely, in reality, respondents may be uncertain. Respondent uncertainty has long been recognized as an issue in the DCE context, but unfortunately, its explicit modelling has received only limited attention. This paper proposes using hierarchical Bayes multinomial probit models to construct respondent uncertainty measures based on the utility difference and a concept called utility suppression, which is quantified by the derivative of the inverse Mills ratio. Two empirical studies with different DCE design formats are conducted to assess and compare the performance. The first includes a no-choice option, and the second is forced-choice formatted with a simpler design. The hold-out validation shows that the utility difference and our proposed measure, which are consistent with the random utility maximization assumption, have better overall performance, particularly in identifying the high-uncertainty respondents. We further show how the information about respondent uncertainty can be utilized in practice.","[Ku, Yu-Cheng] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Wu, John] Fed Reserve Bank Richmond, Charlotte, NC 28230 USA",North Carolina State University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Richmond,"Ku, YC (通讯作者)，North Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",yku2@ncsu.edu,"Ku, Yu-Cheng/P-2438-2019","Ku, Yu-Cheng/0000-0002-0702-1045",,,,,53,3,3,1,17,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

Through the application of an online questionnaire, 325 Brazilian owners of technological startups answered their reasons to enterprise. The data was processed using Ward's hierarchical clustering algorithm, generating four distinct clusters. The first, financial success entrepreneurs, are concerned about financial outcomes of their startups. The new challenges group seeks self-realization, innovation, and independence by means of their enterprises. Leaders are driven by the will to lead and motivate others, relegating other factors. Finally, there are pessimistic entrepreneurs, who rank all reasons lower than other entrepreneurs. These results highlight that even within the class of technological entrepreneurs, from the same country, there are sizeable groups with different factors regarding reasons to enterprise, shedding some light on conflicting results in the entrepreneurial motivation literature.","[Lasso, Sarah V.] Tech Univ Denmark, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Mainardes, Emerson W.; Motoki, Fabio Y.

First, a female whose own immediate family is at least as rich as her husband's counterpart enjoys a greater say over children- and asset-related decision-making. Second, the size, relative wealth and proximity of the extended family also matter. Third, kinship characteristics prove to be more important than (standard) individual and household characteristics. Finally, we also show that the female's say over asset-related decision-making is positively associated with males' education, more than with female's education per se. All these correlation patterns can inform policies aiming at empowering women or targeting children through women's empowerment.","[Ngenzebuke, Rama Lionel] Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES European Ctr Adv Res Econ & Stat, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Ngenzebuke, Rama Lionel] Univ Libre Bruxelles, CERMI Ctr European Res Microfinance, Ave FD Roosevelt 50,CP 139, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [De Rock, Bram; Verwimp, Philip] Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, Ave FD Roosevelt 50,CP 114, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [De Rock, Bram] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Econ, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; KU Leuven,"Ngenzebuke, RL (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES European Ctr Adv Res Econ & Stat, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.;Ngenzebuke, RL (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, CERMI Ctr European Res Microfinance, Ave FD Roosevelt 50,CP 139, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",rama.ngenzebuke@ulb.ac.be; bderock@ulb.ac.be; philip.verwimp@ulb.ac.be,,"De Rock, Bram/0000-0002-5114-1386",Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique,Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS),This study was funded by the Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique.,,42,6,7,1,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Economic accounts of climate adaptation have stressed its collective action nature and the limitations of standard economic approaches to the matter. Governance accounts, on their part, have shown that adaptation does not always happen when it is expected. Against this background, institutional economics has the potential to shed light on those societal processes and collective mechanisms leading to and shaping adaptation (or the absence of it). The selection of articles contributing to this special issue shows that climate adaptation can indeed be explored successfully through institutional economics, and that doing so fits well within the institutional economics agenda.

Available decision time is often cut short through natural or artificial constraints, or is impinged upon by the opportunity cost of time. Experimental economists have only recently begun to conduct experiments with time constraints and to analyze response time (RT) data, in contrast to experimental psychologists. RT analysis has proven valuable for the identification of individual and strategic decision processes including identification of social preferences in the latter case, model comparison/selection, and the investigation of heuristics that combine speed and performance by exploiting environmental regularities. Here we focus on the benefits, challenges, and desiderata of RT analysis in strategic decision making. We argue that unlocking the potential of RT analysis requires the adoption of process-based models instead of outcome-based models, and discuss how RT in the wild can be captured by time-constrained experiments in the lab. We conclude that RT analysis holds considerable potential for experimental economics, deserves greater attention as a methodological tool, and promises important insights on strategic decision making in naturally occurring environments.","[Spiliopoulos, Leonidas] Max Planck Inst Human Dev, Berlin, Germany; [Ortmann, Andreas] Univ New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Max Planck Society; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Spiliopoulos, L (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Human Dev, Berlin, Germany.",spiliopoulos@mpib-berlin.mpg.de; a.ortmann@unsw.edu.au,"Ortmann, Andreas/H-2907-2014","Spiliopoulos, Leonidas/0000-0001-9154-2160",Max Planck Society; Humboldt Research Fellowship for Experienced Researchers; University of New South Wales Vice Chancellor Postdoctoral Fellowship,Max Planck Society(Max Planck Society); Humboldt Research Fellowship for Experienced Researchers; University of New South Wales Vice Chancellor Postdoctoral Fellowship,"Open access funding provided by Max Planck Society.

One of the ways to assess the competitiveness of the Polish food sector is an analysis of comparative (relative) advantages in the export of this sector's products. Purpose of the article: The objective of this paper is to assess comparative advantages in Polish export of food products to the European Union against a background of selected groups of non-food products. Methods: The study used the B. Balassa's revealed comparative advantage (RCA) index. The study is preceded by a brief review of foreign trade results. The source of data was the WITS-Comtrade commercial database. The analysis was carried out at the level of the HS sections (in commodity terms). The research period covered the years 2003-2015. Findings & Value added: In the years 2003-2015, export of food increased nearly six times and its import - more than 4.5 times. The major partners of Poland as regards trade in food were the EU countries. The food sector was one of few sectors of the economy with the positive trade balance. Polish export to the EU was characterised by a diversified level of comparative advantages. From among 20 HS sections, in 2015 Poland had comparative advantages in export to the EU countries for products from 10 sections (2 food and 8 non-food). Those products accounted for 11% and 70% of Polish export to the EU, respectively. The development of Polish foreign trade in food products during the Polish membership in the EU as well as fairly high comparative advantages in the export of these products to the EU indicate the competitiveness and significant importance of the Polish food sector for the national economy.","[Szczepaniak, Iwona] Natl Res Inst Warsaw, Inst Agr & Food Econ, Ul Swietokrzyska 20, PL-00002 Warsaw, Poland",Jan Kochanowski University; Institute of Agricultural & Food Economy,"Szczepaniak, I (通讯作者)，Natl Res Inst Warsaw, Inst Agr & Food Econ, Ul Swietokrzyska 20, PL-00002 Warsaw, Poland.",szczepaniak@ierigz.waw.pl,"Szczepaniak, Iwona/HRD-1157-2023","SZCZEPANIAK, IWONA/0000-0002-1511-4428",,,,,20,18,18,0,8,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

By means of an agent-based model, we replicate an artificial credit network economy in order to assess the impact of growing income inequality in the presence of peer effects and home equity borrowing. We show that the resulting debt-financed consumption boom jeopardises the stability of the economic system, thus paving the way for a financial crisis. Our model includes a behavioural rule for consumption based on expenditure cascades, a hierarchical structure of household finance, an articulated credit market with collateralised consumption loans and mortgages and a simple housing market. Results show that the model is able to capture the economic and social pressure of inequality on low and middle income households that pushes them to increase their consumption via home equity extraction. Rising non-performing loans lead to higher bad debt on the banks' balance sheets and, consequently, to the emergence of a crisis as an endogenous dynamic. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We find that under a private duopoly the optimal size of the residential area depends on the ratio between transportation costs and a negative externality due to congestion. The optimal size is the whole municipality when the ratio is low enough and a small area of the municipality when the ratio is high enough. The transition from a flat residential area to a more compact one is not continuous, so some large-enough residential areas are never optimal. Under a mixed duopoly the transition from a flat residential area to a more compact one is continuous as the ratio increases. By comparing the two cases we find that for intermediate values of this ratio a flat city is optimal for a private duopoly while compact cities emerge under a mixed duopoly.","[Carlos Barcena-Ruiz, Juan; Javier Casado-Izaga, F.] Univ Basque Country, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ 1, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, UPV EHU, Ave Lehendakari Agirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain",University of Basque Country,"Bárcena-Ruiz, J (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ 1, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, UPV EHU, Ave Lehendakari Agirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain.",juancarlos.barcena@ehu.es; franciscojavier.casado@ehu.es,"Casado-Izaga, Francisco Javier/F-8664-2016; Barcena-Ruiz, Juan Carlos/G-6104-2011","Casado-Izaga, Francisco Javier/0000-0002-1752-878X; Barcena-Ruiz, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-8808-2543",Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia [ECO2015-66803-P],Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia(Spanish Government),Financial support from Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia (ECO2015-66803-P) is gratefully acknowledged.,,34,4,5,1,11,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

In particular, Sraffa regards the Physiocrats as having the correct idea of cost as being the commodities that allow workers to subsist. The classical economists measured this bundle of commodities in terms of labour, which they also ambiguously viewed as 'toil and trouble'. Then, the idea of labour as 'toil and trouble' was indicated by Marshall as an anticipation of the conception of cost as a sacrifice. Conferring also upon abstinence from consumption the nature of sacrifice, the neoclassical-marginalist theory understood wages and interest as compensation for the disutility of working and saving. Then, cost was ultimately seen as what induces workers and capitalists to produce. This completed the degeneration of cost from the objective-physical conception of the Physiocrats to the subjective-psychological view of the marginalist school.","[Fratini, Saverio M.] Univ Roma Tre, Rome, Italy",Roma Tre University,"Fratini, SM (通讯作者)，Roma Tre Univ, Dept Econ, Via Silvio DAmico 77, I-00145 Rome, Italy.",saveriomaria.fratini@uniroma3.it,"FRATINI, Saverio Maria/B-6417-2013","FRATINI, Saverio Maria/0000-0003-0766-0741",,,,,35,3,4,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Controlling for observables, we find a gap that peaks at 10% points at ages 55-59 years. The marriage health gap is similar for men and women. If we allow for unobserved heterogeneity in innate health (permanent and age-dependent), potentially correlated with timing and likelihood of marriage, we find that the effect of marriage on health disappears below age 40 years, while about 5% points difference between married and unmarried individuals remains at older ages (55-59 years). This indicates that the observed gap is mainly driven by selection into marriage at younger ages, but there might be a protective effect of marriage at older ages. Exploring the mechanisms behind this result, we find that better innate health is associated with a higher probability of marriage and a lower probability of divorce, and there is strong assortative mating among couples by innate health. We also find that married individuals are more likely to have a healthier behavior compared to unmarried ones. Finally, we find that health insurance is critical for the beneficial effect of marriage. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence from Chinese Panel Data,ANNALS OF ECONOMICS AND FINANCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Fiscal decentralization; Investment rate; Panel data,ECONOMIC-GROWTH; FEDERALISM; POLICY; EXPENDITURE; INCENTIVES; GOVERNMENTS; COMPETITION; MODELS; IMPACT; STYLE,"China has one of the highest investment rates in the world, and in 1994, China introduced a new fiscal system. The current study utilizes provincial panel data from the period of 1995-2010 to provide a consistent underlying fiscal regime. The estimation results show that expenditure decentralization has a significant, positive effect on the physical capital investment rate in both least squares dummy variables (LSDV) and system GMM (Generalized method of moments) estimations. In contrast, revenue decentralization has a negative effect on the investment rate. One possible explanation is that China's political centralization has been maintained during its economic decentralization. Since the provincial officials are not elected by local constituents but are rather appointed by the central government, it is rational for provincial officials to raise investment rates to meet the cadre promotion criteria of the central government, be it growth performance, as argued by Blanchard and Shleifer (2001) or revenue collection, identified by Shih et al.

The first effect can be understood as the re-assignment of offshore tasks to immigrant workers. The second can be seen as a cost cutting effect due to immigration, and the third as a trade-cost reducing effect. To test the empirical significance and size of these effects, we exploit differences in immigrant inflows across U.K. labor markets and a new firm-level dataset on U.K. service firms. We find that immigrants increase overall productivity in service-producing firms, revealing a cost cutting impact on these firms. They also reduce the extent of country-specific off shoring, consistent with a reallocation of tasks, and they increase country-specific exports, consistent with a reduction in bilateral communication and trade costs.

This approach has two main advantages. First, it allows us to run multiple long repeated games per session. Second, it allows us to incorporate the strategy method with minimal restrictions on the set of pure strategies that can be implemented. This gives us insight into what happens in long repeated games and into the types of strategies that subjects construct. We report results obtained from the indefinitely repeated prisoner's dilemma with a continuation probability of delta = .95. We find that during such long repeated prisoner's dilemma games, cooperation drops from the first period of a supergame to the last period of a supergame. When analyzing strategies, we find that subjects rely on strategies similar to those found in the literature on shorter repeated games-specifically Tit-For-Tat, Grim Trigger, and Always Defect. However, we also identify features of strategies that depend on more than just the previous period that are responsible for the drop in cooperation within supergames, but that may be overlooked when using the common strategy frequency estimation approach.

This result is in contrast to previous findings reported in the literature showing that the optimal decision for a monopolist facing a fixed set of two buyers is to not release any information.

This paper uses a new dataset for 18 Latin American countries covering the 2000-2013 period to examine the effectiveness of international remittances in reducing poverty and inequality. Dynamic panel data results using a number of measures for remittances indicate that increases in remittances have a negative and statistically significant impact on overall poverty and inequality in the region, even if it exacerbates moderate poverty. Such effect is robust to alternative remittances measures used to control for endogeneity concerns. In particular, remittances seem to have a stronger effect in countries receiving smaller amounts and in countries with a larger share of its population working abroad. Regional differences also affect the impact that remittances have on the wellbeing of the population, but financial development is found to have a limited impact on the effectiveness of remittances on poverty and inequality.

The agents can acquire information about their private production costs after the contracts are announced and before production begins. We prove that, generically the separation property (Riordan and Sappington in Am Econ Rev 77(3):375-387, 1987), which states that production distortions are independent of the number of agents, does not hold. Compared to the case with one agent, the effect of competition on agents' incentive for information gathering can be positive or negative. On one hand, there is the competition effect, which alleviates the incentive to shirk on information gathering. On the other hand, the competition effect reduces the expected rent for each agent, thus discouraging the agents from gathering information. When the cost of information gathering is small, the first (positive) effect dominates, and competition leads to a greater distortion in the output schedule. In contrast, when the cost of information gathering is large, the second (negative) effect dominates, and competition leads to a smaller distortion in the output schedule.","[Ye, Bing] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Ye, Bing] Zhejiang Univ, Ctr Res Private Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Li, Sanxi] Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University; Renmin University of China,"Li, SX (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",colinyebing@zju.edu.cn; lisanxi@gmail.com,"wang, chen/JED-7289-2023","Ye, Bing/0000-0002-5206-2401","Hengyi Foundation at Zhejiang University; Center for Research of Private Economy, Zhejiang University (CRPE)","Hengyi Foundation at Zhejiang University; Center for Research of Private Economy, Zhejiang University (CRPE)","We wish to express our appreciation to the editor, Giacomo Corneo, and to four anonymous referees for offering extremely valuable and detailed comments.

Data for the study were collected from a survey of 73 basketball clubs' managers from four South-east European countries. Explorative factor analysis and structural equation modelling were employed. The results show that stronger influence of public institutions, reflected in a higher proportion of clubs' funding from public resources, affects clubs' strategies so that clubs with a greater percentage of public funds: (1) emphasise risk reduction more than fast results; (2) emphasise local community aims more than top sport results; and (3) emphasise organisational growth more than cost reduction. The study empirically verified the thesis that clubs with a larger proportion of public funds are less successful in terms of sport and financial results, which is partially a consequence of their different strategic focus. The study offers a better understanding of the relationships among the structure of clubs' funding and its direct (clubs' strategic conduct) and indirect (clubs' performance) consequences.","[Ivaskovic, Igor; Cater, Tomaz] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Ivaskovic, I (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",igor.ivaskovic@ef.uni-lj.si,,,,,,,47,5,7,1,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

This database allows us to estimate the effects of military change of station moves controlling for some key observable characteristics of the service-member and household and controlling for individual spouse fixed effects. We find that military moves cause a substantial decline in spousal earnings in the year of the move, on the order of $2,100, or 14% of average spousal earnings. Moves also increase the likelihood that the spouse has no earnings for the year. We find larger earnings reductions for moves that cross state lines, and for older spouses, male spouses, and those with young children. The career costs persist over time and spouses continue to experience significantly lower earnings 2years after the move. This persistence, combined with the typical military member experiencing a change of station move every 2 or 3 years, may substantially limit the ability of military spouses to accumulate human capital over time.

We find that the announcement of the policy caused the price disparity to immediately reduce by 4.0 to 4.5 percentage points. To estimate the longer-run impact, we use a panel data model and a two-step estimator that accounts for unobserved common factors and potential nonstationarity in outcomes.

Using a panel of 32 OECD countries from 1985 to 2013, we show that more stringent product and labour market regulations are associated with less investment (lower capital stock). The paper also sheds light on the existence of non-linear effects of employment protection legislation (EPL) on the capital stock. Several alternative testing methods show that the negative influence of EPL is considerably stronger at higher levels. Finally, and importantly, the paper uncovers important policy interactions between product and labour market policies. Higher levels of product market regulations (covering state control, barriers to entrepreneurship and barriers to trade and investment) tend to amplify the negative relationships between EPL and the capital stock and ETCR and the capital stock. Equally important is the finding that the rule of law and the quality of (legal) institutions alters the overall impact of regulations on capital deepening: better institutions reduce the negative effect of more stringent product and labour market regulations on the capital stock, possibly through the reduction of uncertainty as regards the protection of property rights. This result also implies that the benefit from product and labour market reforms may be smaller in countries with weaker institutions.","[Egert, Balazs] OECD, Dept Econ, Paris, France; [Egert, Balazs] Univ Paris X Nanterre, Economix, Nanterre, France; [Egert, Balazs] CESifo, Munich, Germany",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); Ifo Institut,"Égert, B (通讯作者)，OECD, Dept Econ, Paris, France.;Égert, B (通讯作者)，Univ Paris X Nanterre, Economix, Nanterre, France.;Égert, B (通讯作者)，CESifo, Munich, Germany.",balazs.egert@oecd.org,,,,,,,30,5,5,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Our results are reported for three categories of special aggregates: indexes for industrial production excluding two major industries (technology and motor vehicles), energy-related special aggregates, and non-energy-related special aggregates. Our results indicate that among energy-related market groups, the effects of oil price volatility are concentrated in activities related to primary energy generation and oil and gas drilling.

By analyzing credible plans in a sticky-price economy with occasionally binding zero lower bound constraints, I find that the answer is yes if contractionary shocks hit the economy with sufficient frequency. In the best credible plan, if the central bank reneges on the promise of low policy rates, it will lose reputation and the private sector will not believe such promises in future recessions. Even with a very small probability of future contractionary shocks, the incentive to maintain reputation outweighs the short-run incentive to close consumption and inflation gaps and keeps the central bank on the originally announced path of low nominal interest rates.

These approaches shed a new light on the question of path-dependence and historical dynamics.

Contracts inducing short-sighted managerial behavior arise as shareholders' response to conflicting intergenerational managerial incentives. High-return projects may last longer than the tenure of managers who implement them. Consequently, inducing managers to act in the long-term interests of firms requires the alignment of incentives across multiple managers. Such action comes at greater costs than providing incentives for a single manager and leads to contracts that favor short-term behavior. Long-term firm value maximization is further impeded when only the quality of accepted projects-but not those of declined projects-is public. In that case, shareholders find it costly to induce long-term project selection among managers who can earn all information rents from short-term projects but must sacrifice information rents from long-term projects to future managers.

It is underlined that the classical Jarque-Bera test (JB hereafter) for normality is inadequate in our framework. On the other hand it is found that the approach which consists in correcting the heteroscedasticity by kernel smoothing for testing normality is justified asymptotically. Nevertheless it appears from Monte Carlo experiments that such a methodology can noticeably suffer from size distortion for samples that are typical for macroeconomic variables. As a consequence a parametric bootstrap methodology for correcting the problem is proposed.

Two main results are obtained. First, productivity asymmetries represent a serious handicap for partial tax harmonization that can be remedied by coordinating nontax instruments when they allow to reduce these asymmetries. Second, infrastructure coordination through the choice of a common investment level is particularly indicated when asymmetries between potential members of a tax coalition are large. The current usage of European Union (EU) structural funds orientated to reduce regional infrastructure deficits is therefore suitable to facilitate tax harmonization within the EU.

To attract these workers, firms post a recruiting intensity and a hiring standard, in addition to terms of trade. Ahigher recruiting intensity is costly, but allows the firm to select more applicants for an interview, which reveals their productivity. The hiring standard solves the tradeoff between immediate hiring and waiting for a potentially better match in the future. I characterize equilibrium and find that various outcomes, including uniqueness of equilibrium and the cyclicality of recruiting intensity, crucially depend on firms' recruiting cost and workers' search cost. Calibration of the model to the U.S. labour market indicates a continuum of equilibria. Given selection of a particular equilibrium, hiring standards are countercyclical while recruiting intensity is procyclical. The calibrated model creates more amplification than a standard model without intensive margins and gives rise to procyclical match efficiency when viewed through the lens of a Cobb-Douglas matching function.","[Wolthoff, Ronald] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto,"Wolthoff, R (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.",,,,,,,,64,18,24,2,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

J,"Ambrosi, GM",,,,"Ambrosi, Gerhard Michael",,,Aristotle's geometrical accounting,CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Aristotle; Accounting; Exchange; Reciprocation; Euclid; Complements,EUCLID ELEMENTS; PROPORTIONS,"Aristotle's analysis of economic exchange in the Nicomachean Ethics involves two paradigms which he addresses separately but then he stresses that there is no difference between them: barter and monetary exchange. Each one of them is rendered here separately but in a mutually consistent way by using geometrical methods which were well established and widely used in Aristotle's intellectual surroundings. In this framework Aristotle's 'monetary equivalence' in exchange appears as an application of Euclid's proposition Elements I, 43 about the equality of geometrical complements in a rectangle. Aristotle repeatedly refers to 'own production' when mentioning exchange between two artisans, say, 'builder' and 'farmer'. The accounting worth of the quantity of 'own production' in terms of money is then Aristotle's 'worth' of an artisan. This interpretation helps to make sense of Aristotle's statements of the type: 'as builder to farmer, so food to houses'. We show that this statement is logical and plausible provided that the goods in question are measured as proportions of sales out of own production. This result solves one of the major riddles of Aristotle's text on exchange. Accounting of exchange should be seen in connection with Aristotle's critique of the Pythagoreans' concept of justice. He claims that they wrongly equate justice with 'reciprocation'. The paper does not speculate about Aristotle's alternatives. It just shows that his text on 'reciprocation' can be interpreted with reference to a consistent and interesting system of geometrical accounting. This system might be Pythagorean in origin, but Aristotle's writings are its sole literary source. It justifies to list Aristotle's passages on exchange as being among the most interesting texts of ancient economic analysis.","[Ambrosi, Gerhard Michael] Normannenstr 10, D-14129 Berlin, Germany",,"Ambrosi, GM (通讯作者)，Univ Trier, Trier, Germany.",ambrosi@uni-trier.de,,"Ambrosi, Michael/0000-0001-6011-6871",,,,,66,2,2,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The asymptotic mean squared error of the estimator using the proposed bandwidth selection method is shown to be smaller than other bandwidth selection methods proposed in the literature. The approach that the bandwidth selection method is based on is also applied to an estimator that exploits the sharp regression kink design. Reliable confidence intervals compatible with both of the proposed bandwidth selection methods are also proposed as in the work of Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014a). An extensive simulation study shows that the proposed method's performances for the samples sizes 500 and 2000 closely match the theoretical predictions.

However, neither Harrod nor Domar fit in the 'capital fundamentalism' idea. Development planners in the 1950s adapted the growth formula to their own agenda. Most development economists at the time were aware that Harrod's and Domar's growth models addressed economic instability issues, not long-run growth. Harrod eventually applied his concept of the natural growth rate to economic development. He claimed that the growth of developing economies was determined by their ability to implement technical progress. Domar observed that the incremental capital-output ratio was more likely a passive result of the interaction between the propensity to save and technological progress, not a causal factor.","[Boianovsky, Mauro] Univ Brasilia, Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Universidade de Brasilia,"Boianovsky, M (通讯作者)，Univ Brasilia, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",mboianovsky@gmail.com,,,Capes (Brazil),Capes (Brazil)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),"The author would like to thank Geoff Harcourt, Deirdre McCloskey, Tony Thirlwall, Kevin Hoover, Roy Weintraub, Bruce Caldwell, Clara Mattei and three anonymous referees for helpful comments on earlier drafts.

Our findings suggest that M&A activity carries significant predictive power over oil return and volatility, while predictability displays remarkably distinct patterns across various quantiles representing normal, bull and bear market states. We also observe that M&A activity by oil firms, i.e. both the acquiring and target firms considered active in the oil and gas (O&G) industry, generally carries greater predictive power over both oil returns and volatility compared to M&A activity by non-oil acquirers, i.e. acquirers that have entered the O&G industry by buying an oil company. Our findings imply that M&A activity in the O&G industry carries valuable fundamental information regarding future expectations on oil price dynamics and should be taken into account in forecasting exercises.

The wide literature on this issue, however, lacks studies on the specific implications of structural labour-market reforms on growth and functional distribution of income. The purpose of this study is to fill this gap by proposing two new empirical analyses aimed at verifying the existence of statistical relationships between changes in the Employment protection legislation index (EPL) on one side and variations of real GDP growth and wage share on the other side. Results indicate that EPL reductions have no significant links with real GDP growth whereas they are significantly correlated with wage share reductions.

In fact, the rich literature in this area has positively assessed and documented China's successful experiences. However, theories that were established in Western countries have been applied as doctrine to judge China's experiences. By adopting an analytical framework unifying historical logic and theoretical logic, the purpose of this paper is to reveal the unique Chinese experience and its relevance to the general laws of economic development. Based on the experiences of and in reference to research findings about China, this paper chronicles the process of reform, opening up and economic growth, and analyzes the nexus between them. The study demystifies how the incentive mechanism, the factor accumulation and allocation system, market development, and macro policy environment reforms have spurred China's economic growth, structural changes and the increase in productivity. The changes in development stage are examined and policy implications for further reform are discussed.","[Cai, Fang] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Cai, F (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Social Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",caifang@cass.org.cn,,,,,,,44,13,14,6,90,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAR-APR,2018,26.0,2,,,SI,,1,22,,10.1111/cwe.12234,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FZ3EJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000427468900001,0

An analysis of characteristics of cartel members shows harsher enforcement after the revision, which indicates that the decrease in cartel discoveries is in line with higher cartel deterrence.

Such games are induced by a hierarchy (partial order) on players. We propose a larger class of vertices for games on distributive lattices, called min-max vertices, obtained by minimizing or maximizing in a given order the coordinates of a core element. We give a simple formula which does not need to solve an optimization problem to compute these vertices, valid for connected hierarchies and for the general case under some restrictions. We find under which conditions two different orders induce the same vertex for every game, and show that there exist balanced games whose core has vertices which are not min-max vertices if and only if n > 4.

We provide the first joint experimental analysis of the role of these two obstacles. First, we observe that overbidding decreases significantly between a simple common-value auction and a transformed version of this auction that does not require conditional reasoning. Second, assistance in belief formation leads to comparable behavioral changes in both games. The two effects are of similar magnitude and amplify each other when jointly present. We conclude that the combination and the interaction of the two cognitive processes in auctions lead to relatively low strategic sophistication compared to other domains. The study's focus on games' objective cognitive challenges is potentially useful for improving predictions across games and complements the common focus on behavioral models and their explanatory power.

The results show that the global economic costs of outdoor air pollution gradually increase to 1% of global GDP by 2060, with highest GDP losses in China, the Caspian region and Eastern Europe. These economic consequences stem from a combination of exposure to high concentrations, aging population and relatively high pollution-related health expenditures that crowd out other consumption and savings. While the direct costs of these market impacts grow more or less at the same pace as total economic activity, the indirect economic costs induced by these impacts become increasingly significant over time. Numerical results are more sensitive to the specification of the feedbacks to the economic model than to the parameter values used in calibrating the impacts; the most optimistic specifications lead to significantly lower costs of air pollution, but qualitative conclusions on the sign of effects and ordering of regional consequences are robust. Non-market damages, especially the welfare losses from premature deaths, are potentially an order of magnitude larger than the market damages that this paper focuses on, but those do not directly affect the economy. These findings on the costs of inaction of outdoor air pollution underline the need for policy action that would reduce the health and environmental impacts as well as lead to economic benefits.

Impacted sites provide less content over time, providing corroboration for the mechanism. Effects on revenue are compounded; ad blocking reduces visits, and remaining visitors blocking ads do not generate revenue. We conclude that ad blocking poses a threat to the ad-supported web.","[Shiller, Benjamin] Brandeis Univ, Waltham, MA 02254 USA; [Waldfogel, Joel] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Waldfogel, Joel] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ryan, Johnny] PageFair, Dublin, Ireland",Brandeis University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Shiller, B (通讯作者)，Brandeis Univ, Waltham, MA 02254 USA.",shiller@brandeis.edu; jwaldfog@umn.edu; johnny@pagefair.com,"Waldfogel, Joel/A-4916-2015","Waldfogel, Joel/0000-0002-8040-7227; Shiller, Benjamin/0000-0001-9021-1669",,,,,18,31,40,2,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0741-6261,1756-2171,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

The so-called open innovation paradigm has been developed by taking single-business firms and external networks as cornerstones of the standard model. However, in the case of multi-business firms, the role of internal networks has been neglected. Business units within multi-business corporations have the potential advantage of relying on both external partners and internal peers in order to support their product innovation process. The corporate network thus enables business units to provide knowledge (source knowledge from) to peers in their quest to bring new products onto the market. This study analyses the impact of four types of open innovation activities on business units' product innovation performance, which are classified according to the directionality (outside-in and inside-out) and locus (cross-business and across-boundaries) of the innovation flows. The results from a sample of 227 business units show that business units should look outside firm boundaries for inbound innovation and throughout business units for outbound innovation if they are to improve their innovation performance.","[Villasalero, Manuel] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Law & Social Sci, Ronda Toledo S-N, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Villasalero, M (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Law & Social Sci, Ronda Toledo S-N, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain.",Manuel.Villasalero@uclm.es,"Villasalero, Manuel/L-3960-2014","Villasalero, Manuel/0000-0001-8436-4714",American Consortium on European Union Studies (ACES) [GWPTA 27290/16/ECNS20983N]; Regional Government of Castilla-La Mancha [POll-2014-007-A]; European Union under the European Regional Development Fund [2007ES161PO007],American Consortium on European Union Studies (ACES); Regional Government of Castilla-La Mancha; European Union under the European Regional Development Fund,"The author would like to thank the editor and anonymous reviewers for their constructive and helpful comments on the paper.

In this paper we seek to find simple additions to the existing benchmark model that might let us answer three questions. What caused the boom and crisis? Why has the recovery been slow? And, how should policy respond to that slow recovery? We argue that it is necessary to add financial frictions to the benchmark model. This allows us to study the effects of leveraged financial institutions, and of a yield curve based on preferred habitats. Such features will cause endogenous changes in the natural real interest rate and the spread between that interest rate and the rate which influences expenditure decisions. They are likely to radically change the way in which the model responds to shocks. We point to some promising models that incorporate these features.","[Vines, David] Univ Oxford St Antonys Coll, Balliol Coll, Polit Econ Financial Markets Programme, Oxford, England; [Vines, David] Univ Oxford, Oxford Martin Sch, Inst New Econ Thinking INET, Oxford, England; [Vines, David] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England; [Wills, Samuel] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Wills, Samuel] Univ Oxford, Oxford Ctr Anal Resource Rich Econ, Oxford, England; [Wills, Samuel] Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Appl Macroecon Anal, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of Sydney; University of Oxford; Australian National University,"Vines, D (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford St Antonys Coll, Balliol Coll, Polit Econ Financial Markets Programme, Oxford, England.;Vines, D (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford Martin Sch, Inst New Econ Thinking INET, Oxford, England.;Vines, D (通讯作者)，Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England.",david.vines@economics.ox.ac.uk; samuel.wills@sydney.edu.au,,,ESRC [ES/K009303/1]; ESRC [ES/K009303/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We thank Christopher Bliss for very useful comments, and Dylan Smith for helpful conversations about the material in section IV.

These increasingly popular pastimes can crowd out time spent on other activities. I exploit week-to-week variation in video game popularity to identify variation in video game playing time likely due to changes in game quality rather than to individuals selecting into gaming. I find that when video game sales increase, students spend more time playing games, and less time attending class and doing homework. Differential effects for college students and those with lower incomes indicate large effects for these groups. Newly developing ICT based pastimes, such as use of online social media, could have similar effects. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The first application is to provide conditions under which the existence of the asymptotic value implies the convergence of the values of the weighted game, as players get more and more patient. The second application concerns stochastic games with finite state space and action sets. This paper builds a simple class of asymptotically optimal strategies in the weighted game, that at each stage play optimally in a discounted game with a discount factor corresponding to the relative weight of the current stage.

Empirical results indicate that the CUSFTA had a stabilizing effect on the Canadian and U.S. equity markets while increasing the volatility of the CAD/USD exchange rate. NAFTA further reduced the two stock markets' volatility, however unlike CUSFTA, NAFTA also reduced the volatility of the CAD/USD exchange rate. Additional results indicate that during NAFTA, the Mexican stock market is more volatile than the other stock and bilateral exchange markets. Moreover, the exchange rate of the Mexican peso against both the U.S. and Canadian dollars has been more volatile than the Canadian dollar/US dollar exchange rate. Evidence also suggests that all three stock markets are positively correlated with each other with the U.S. market being much less correlated with the Canadian and Mexican stock markets than the latter two markets are correlated with each other. Evidence found in this paper suggests a negative relationship between the stock and bilateral currency markets that is statistically significant except for the U.S. equity market when paired with an exchange rate that involves the Mexican peso.","[Daelemans, Bram] Marquette Univ, Ctr Global & Econ Studies, Madison, WI 53711 USA; [Daelemans, Bram] Wisconsin Angel Network, Madison, WI 53711 USA; [Daniels, Joseph P.; Nourzad, Farrokh] Marquette Univ, Coll Business Adm, POB 1881, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",Marquette University; Marquette University,"Nourzad, F (通讯作者)，Marquette Univ, Coll Business Adm, POB 1881, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",joseph.daniels@mu.edu; farrokh.nourzad@mu.edu,,,,,,,54,6,8,1,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

We explore a unique policy change in the context of the German pension system to study this question. As of 2005 (with a phase-in period between 2002 and 2004), the German pension administration started to send out annual letters providing detailed and comprehensible information about the pension system and individual expected public pension payments. This reform did not change the level of pensions, but only provided information to individuals about their expected pension payments. Using German tax return data, we exploit an age discontinuity to identify the effect of these letters on the behavior of individuals. We find an increase in tax-deductible private retirement savings and provide evidence that this is not due to a crowding-out of other forms of savings. We also show that labor earnings, i.e. the most direct way to increase public pensions, increase after receiving the letter.","[Dolls, Mathias; Peichl, Andreas] Ifo Inst, Munich, Germany; [Dolls, Mathias; Doerrenberg, Philipp; Peichl, Andreas; Stichnoth, Holger] ZEW Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany; [Dolls, Mathias; Doerrenberg, Philipp; Peichl, Andreas] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Doerrenberg, Philipp; Peichl, Andreas] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Peichl, Andreas] LMU, Munich, Germany",Ifo Institut; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); IZA Institute Labor Economics; Ifo Institut; University of Munich,"Peichl, A (通讯作者)，Ifo Inst, Munich, Germany.;Peichl, A (通讯作者)，ZEW Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.;Peichl, A (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.;Peichl, A (通讯作者)，CESifo, Munich, Germany.;Peichl, A (通讯作者)，LMU, Munich, Germany.",dolls@ifo.de; doerrenberg@zew.de; peichl@ifo.de; stichnoth@zew.de,,,,,,,23,44,46,5,34,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0047-2727,,,J PUBLIC ECON,J.

Unlike quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE) without a negative interest rate, the NIRP not only had limited impacts on the Japanese economy but also raised serious concern about the profitability of local financial institutions. It is, thus, likely that its spillover effects were different from those of QQE without a negative interest rate. In the analysis, we examine the spillover effects on Asian stock markets. We find that Japan's long-term interest rate decline had significantly positive effects on Asian stock prices in the NIRP period. The results imply that the NIRP, which lowered the long-term rate below zero, might have benefitted Asian economies. We discuss that this might have happened because local financial institutions that lost their profit opportunities in domestic markets explored a new profit opportunity in emerging Asia after the NIRP was announced.","[Fukuda, Shin-ichi] Univ Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Fukuda, S (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Fac Econ, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",sfukuda@e.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,"JSPS Bilateral Open Partnership Joint Research Projects; JSPS KAKENHI [26285044]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17K18557, 26285044] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS Bilateral Open Partnership Joint Research Projects; JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","An earlier version of this paper was presented at the ADBI 19th Annual Conference The Implications of Ultra-Low and Negative Interest Rates for Asia on December 1-2, 2016 at ADBI in Tokyo.

While multilateral and international agreements bind countries concerning the imposition of tariffs on imports, TBTs have been used as trade policy instruments, which conceal the true motivations of governments. The main legitimate reasons behind the imposition of TBTs are to increase environmental qualities and human health, or to improve market efficiencies. However, in addition to these reasons, governments are also in pursuit of protecting their domestic industries. In fact, this contribution analyses how trade protectionist motives and legitimate public policy objectives induce these specific trade measures. Various effective factors of TBT STC notifications are considered in the econometric analysis using fixed effect Poisson estimation as the main technique, and Poisson GMM as robustness specification. Separate estimations on the European Union block in this study points at the determining factors of TBTs harmonized by heterogeneous member states. Results suggest that bilateral trade and tariffs are one of the forces of TBT STC notifications, acknowledging the protectionist behaviour of authorities. Moreover, countries with high quality of humans' health-related environmental issues, and low environmental vitalities, are more likely to impose new TBTs. Overall, this study confirms the complex nature of TBT STCs affected by economic, technological, institutional, and health and environmental issues.","[Ghodsi, M.

Variable markups arise from oligopolistic competition, and cost-reducing innovation is the engine of long-run growth. Trade liberalisation stiffens competition by reducing markups, generating tougher firm selection and increasing the aggregate productivity level. Selection increases firms' incentives to innovate, thereby leading to a higher aggregate productivity growth rate. Endogenous productivity growth boosts the selection gains from trade, leading to substantial welfare improvements.

Governments strategically control labor distribution across industries, and representative agents maximize Cobb-Douglas utilities. A Nash equilibrium with complete specialization is achieved if and only if relative productivity exceeds a key value of 3, which is considered a very large number based on previous empirical studies. This paper also introduces a two-stage game where each government chooses labor distribution first and then tariffs. In this two-stage game, complete specialization is never achieved for any relative productivity level. Finally, by generalizing the Cobb-Douglas model into constant elasticity of substitution (CES) preferences, I show that if immiserizing growth effects exist, complete specialization could not be achieved for any level of relative productivity.","[Kang, Minwook] Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University,"Kang, M (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Social Sci, Div Econ, 14 Nanyang Dr, Singapore 637332, Singapore.",mwkang@ntu.edu.sg,"Kang, Minwook/AAB-1231-2020","Kang, Minwook/0000-0003-2369-7894",Nanyang Technological University AcRF Tier-1 Grant [RG171/14],Nanyang Technological University AcRF Tier-1 Grant,Nanyang Technological University AcRF Tier-1 Grant No. RG171/14,,28,5,6,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

J,"Maidorn, S",,,,"Maidorn, Susanne",,,Is there a trade-off between procyclicality and revisions in EC trend TFP estimations?,EMPIRICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,Potential output; Procyclicality; TFP; Revisions,,"Potential output constitutes a central measure to determine compliance of the member states with the EU fiscal rules. The EU uses a production function approach to estimate potential output. In a Kalman filter model together with a Bayesian approach TFP is decomposed into a trend and a cycle. The aim of this paper is to examine the relationship between two widely discussed issues of the EC estimate of potential output, procyclicality and the extent of revisions. Procyclicality of the TFP trend depends on the prior assumptions for the residual variance of the TFP cycle equation. Exploiting this, simulations over increasing values of the priors of the residual variance of the TFP cycle equation are run for eight EU countries, leading to decreasing procyclicality of TFP trend estimates. Procyclicality of the estimated TFP trend reduces the standard error of revisions for half of the countries considered, while it implies an increase for the other countries or has no effect. Thus there is a trade-off between procyclicality of the TFP trend and the revision error, but it is not so clear cut. The standard errors of revisions of real-time estimates of the TFP trend as a criterion of model selection could improve forecasts additionally to the marginal likelihood value employed by the EC.","[Maidorn, Susanne] Oesterreichsiche Natl Bank, Off Austrian Fiscal Advisory Council, Vienna, Austria",,"Maidorn, S (通讯作者)，Oesterreichsiche Natl Bank, Off Austrian Fiscal Advisory Council, Vienna, Austria.",susanne.maidorn@oenb.at,,"Maidorn, Susanne/0000-0002-0517-0514",,,,,16,0,0,2,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,FEB,2018,45.0,1,,,,,59,82,,10.1007/s10663-016-9346-2,0.0,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FT2QF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000422990400005,0

In communication with these ghosts, what messages from the tax authority are effective for eliciting a return? This is the first study to address message content in communication with income tax nonfilers. I assess the efficacy of messages related to penalty salience, punishment probability, compliance cost, and civic pride by evaluating the response to experimental mailings distributed by Detroit to 7142 suspected resident nonfilers. The penalty salience message was the most effective. Relative to a basic mailing that requested a return, penalty salience mailings that stated the statutory penalty for failing to file a return tripled response rates from 3% to 10%. Compliance cost mailings that enclosed a blank tax return and punishment probability mailings that stated the recipient's federal income also raised response rates relative to the basic mailing, but civic pride mailings did not. I investigate the impact of treatment mailings on the behavior of untreated neighbors and find no evidence of geographic network effects.","[Meiselman, Ben S.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",Johns Hopkins University,"Meiselman, BS (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",meiselman@jhu.edu,,"Meiselman, Ben/0000-0001-9297-8871",Office of Tax Policy Research; Michigan Institute for Teaching and Research in Economics; Rackham Graduate School at the University of Michigan,Office of Tax Policy Research; Michigan Institute for Teaching and Research in Economics; Rackham Graduate School at the University of Michigan(University of Michigan System),"I am grateful for guidance from Joel Slemrod.

We examine the effects on town locations of the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, which temporarily ended urbanisation in Britain, but not in France. As urbanisation recovered, medieval towns were more often found in Roman-era town locations in France than in Britain. The resetting of Britain's urban network gave it better access to natural navigable waterways, which mattered for town growth from 1200 to 1800.

After setting a zero lower bound to the jump intensity of the ARJI model, we found that dynamic jumps exist in oil price movements. Moreover, under shocks of oil price jumps, not only the returns but also the risks of China's bulk commodity markets are affected significantly, and the reactions of risks are characterized by overreactions. Meanwhile, by decomposing oil price shocks into expected positive (negative), and unexpected positive (negative) components, we discovered that the impacts of unexpected shocks are positive and significantly asymmetric at both levels, while those of the expected shocks are negative and insignificantly asymmetric at the industry level. In addition, the volatility clustering of all price movements and the permanent volatility effects on China's bulk commodities are also authenticated by applying the GARCH family models.

Specifically, we examine the economic policy response to the debt crisis of the Eurozone, applying institutional economics from two perspectives: the theory of social power and the endogenous money supply. The research question is whether monetary policy can be characterized as a countervailing power exercised by European institutions with respect to the member countries. Fiscal and monetary policies have been interpreted through these sources and types of power, as proposed by Galbraith, by distinguishing between those types of power that have had a permanent versus a conjunctural character. We conclude that European Quantitative Easing can be characterized as having been a countervailing power.

We show that, when the seller is more patient than the buyer, there exist systematic differences between the optimal selling and renting mechanisms. While the former consists of simple price-posting, the latter induces the buyer to choose between a secure- and a random-delivery contract. Allowing for mechanisms more general than price-posting reduces the seller's cost of learning the buyer's valuation in the renting case. Renting leads to more learning than selling but (unless the horizon is sufficiently long) only when general mechanisms are available. Our results contrast with the common view that the restriction to price-posting is innocuous and that informational asymmetries are more persistent under renting than under selling.

The analysis is performed on Czech data over the 2001-2016 period. Results show that the reaction of a central bank to macroeconomic shocks can be regime-dependent. We find that a rising government debt could constrain monetary policy, which manifests through an altered monetary policy transmission to the real economy.

The new information and communication technologies fasten the pace of change and increase the need for learning that is subject to an increased information flow. This research aims to measure the impact and the efficiency of e-learning training programs on employees within an organization, which is the market leader within the pharmaceutical field. The carried-out research aims to put into practice the theoretical frame of ROI methodology of evaluating the business education programs on human resources in five stages, suggested by J.J. Phillips. The case study is based on using quantitative analysis according to the suggested research methodology. The variables used in the entire research were: feedback and satisfaction, learning and confidence in application, the impact on the organization's business results. The results of the research validate the theoretical data of the surveyed model and are based on the analysis of the data gathering process within the ROI methodology. This work shows only the evaluation stage of assimilating knowledge and competences and the evaluation stage of performance improvement in the participants workplace after attending the e-learning training program.

Each measure looks at the risk from the perspective of another characteristic; it has its informative value. Then it seems that a choice of the risk measurement approach should influence the composition of a portfolio. But is it generally really so? Are not there cases where this does not apply? Answers these questions are notable for real investment decision making because a choice of the right risk measure can be very difficult task. In case of no influence, the portfolio selection process becomes easier. To analyze this effect, a methodical approach based on the Markowitz model is proposed. The effect is studied from a few perspectives, namely investment horizon and kind of specified investment instruments (unit trusts).

It is indeed argued that the traditional post Keynesian and circuitist approaches are overly narrow because they rely on a limited definition of money. Consequently, these approaches are focused on commercial banks (that create money) and regard other financial institutions as mere intermediaries that intermediate funds from surplus units (savers) toward deficit units (borrowers). Because it treats NBFIs as mere intermediaries, the authors argue that the traditional post Keynesian framework is no longer relevant for the analysis of the contemporary financial system. We believe that this critique is not justified.

Therefore, this paper guides us to formulate better economic policies to lower RER variability. Our goal is to test whether the extent and composition of international trade and financial integration would smooth the impact of shocks to the RER for 82 countries from 1974 to 2013. Our findings support existing theoretical models (Obstfeld and Rogoff, 1995; Hau, 2000). They confirm empirically that the composition of trade and financial openness matters for RER stabilization. We show that trade in manufacturing helps reduce RER volatility while non-manufacturing trade may contribute to higher RER volatility. Financial openness mitigates (amplifies) RER volatility in a country with higher (lower) share of foreign equity vis-a-vis foreign debt liabilities. A greater share of equity in external liabilities can improve the country's resilience to external shocks (Rogoff, 1999). Consequently, policies to lower RER volatility should account for a) the composition of financial openness as measured by the type of capital flows (i.e. equity vs. loan-related) accumulated in the domestic economy and b) the role of the structure of trade (i.e. manufacturing vs. non-manufacturing) in the transmission process of shocks to the RER. Our evidence relates to findings of mitigating effects on sudden stops of trade openness (Cavallo and Frankel, 2008), and equity-rather than debt-related financial openness (Levchenko and Mauro, 2007; Calderon and Kubota, 2013).

We consider unconventional monetary policy decisions as temporary policies aimed at dampening the consequences of financial and real shocks on the provision of loans. In a DSGE model with financial frictions, we provide a simple approach to the decision to begin and end up unconventional policy measures, by specializing this kind of policies to periods with loan supply shortages. Accounting for an endogenous length of loan supply shortages we find that this policies have two main effects. As previously found in the literature, by raising the value of the lending accelerator in a situation of loan scarcity, they dampen the consequences of shocks. As a second effect (new in the literature), such policy measures increase the length of the loan saturation period making the combination of conventional and unconvential policies an enduring policy solution. These results extend to the Zero Lower Bound situation.","[Cargoet, Thibaud; Poutineau, Jean-Christophe] Univ Rennes 1, CREM CNRS, Rennes, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Rennes,"Poutineau, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Rennes 1, CREM CNRS, Rennes, France.",jean-christophe.poutineau@univ-rennes1.fr,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

The relationship between wages and productivity has become indeterminate, especially after the 2008 financial crisis. This article presents the phenomenon for why salary rarely follows up with productivity after an economy recovers. By using the GMM method, this study shows the interaction among wage, productivity and tightness, in which we illustrate the Taiwan labour market as an example to show how hiring system changes press wages away from an efficient allocation, causing instability and market failure. Surveying 35 labour markets for different industries, we reveal that the situation in the labour markets has drastically changed since 2008. We find that this resulted in a severe problem when the Taiwan firms got used to policies like 22K', fix-term contract' and unpaid leave' programmes. These plans negatively impacted the economy and raised market failure with instability.","[Chen, W.

These basic insights of the paper are obtained from the application of panel regression and Granger causality analysis for a sample of twelve CEE countries using annual data for the period of 1995-2014.

The model is estimated using data from Information Resources Inc.'s National Consumer Panel. These data are heavily censored at zero.

Using highly disaggregated firm-level data, we show that the quality upgrading made possible by China's tariff reductions was concentrated in the least productive Chinese exporters. These firms, which had been laggards in terms of quality prior to the tariff reduction, were the most aggressive in increasing the quality of their exports and their inputs and in redirecting their exports toward high income markets where demand for high quality goods is strong. Our empirical results are consistent with a simple model featuring scale effect and non-Hicks' neutral productivity that disproportionately affects the efficiency with which firms use intermediate inputs.

While stories of Obama inspiring individuals to overachieve are common, it remains to be seen if there was a systemic shift in Black student achievement after Obama's election. Given the persistent racial score gap between Blacks and Whites on standardized tests, it is important to know if an inspirational figure could have a significant impact. Using ACT data from Chicago Public Schools, I find there is no evidence that Obama's election had an impact on Black test scores. The racial ACT gap has been increasing since the beginning of the 21st century, and that trend continued after Obama was elected.","[Gourley, Patrick] Univ New Haven, Dept Econ, West Haven, CT 06516 USA",University New Haven,"Gourley, P (通讯作者)，Univ New Haven, Dept Econ, West Haven, CT 06516 USA.",PGourley@newhaven.edu,,,,,,,23,0,2,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

I argue that interaction of SBC with agency problems within the government bureaucracy helps explaining a major feature of state capitalism - failure to privatize underperforming state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Bureaucrats supervising the failing SOEs prefer to keep them afloat and gamble for resurrection; in contrast, privatization would involve recognizing the loss, which would result in acknowledging the bureaucrat's failure that is disincentivized by the state. This endogenously emerging preferential treatment of state-owned firms creates a competitive advantage against private firms; this explains why in state capitalism privatization may result in lower rather than higher productivity and therefore remain unpopular.","[Guriev, Sergei] Sci Po, Inst Etud Polit Paris, EBRD, Paris, France; [Guriev, Sergei] Sci Po, CEPR, Paris, France",Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po); Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po),"Guriev, S (通讯作者)，Sci Po, Inst Etud Polit Paris, EBRD, Paris, France.;Guriev, S (通讯作者)，Sci Po, CEPR, Paris, France.",gurievs@ebrd.com,"Guriev, Sergei/AAE-4596-2020","Guriev, Sergei/0000-0001-6048-2169",,,,,22,3,4,0,15,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

The effects of E-S-QUAL and CNFU on attitude are examined with data collected from Korean consumers who have cross-border online purchasing experience. Design/methodology/approach The authors evaluate the research model in this study and test the hypotheses using partial least squares, an OLS regression-based estimation method that focuses on predicting independent variables hypothesized to have a causal relationship that maximizes the explanatory variance of the dependent variable. Findings Analysis of the data emphasizes that beliefs about E-S-QUAL and CNFU positively affect attitudes toward buying online from international sites, which in turn positively affect purchasing intention. Also, beliefs about self-efficacy and normative structure regarding cross-border online purchasing positively affect behavioral intentions. Originality/value This paper develops a conceptual model explaining consumers' intentions to shop online across national borders. To the best of the authors' knowledge, none of the previous studies have particularly mentioned the associations between beliefs about e-service quality and actual behavioral intentions in the context of cross-border online shopping. Also, the important role of CNFU has been ignored as one of the factors that can affect consumers' decisions to shop online beyond national borders. In regard to this matter, the authors aim to investigate cross-border online shopping factors that can help international e-commerce gain a better understanding of the needs of their consumers.","[Han, Bangwool; Kim, Minho] Chonbuk Natl Univ, Coll Commerce, Jeonju, South Korea; [Lee, Jaehoon] Southern Illinois Univ, Dept Mkt, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA",Jeonbuk National University; Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University,"Kim, M (通讯作者)，Chonbuk Natl Univ, Coll Commerce, Jeonju, South Korea.",kimmh@jbnu.ac.kr,"Kim, Minho/Q-7939-2019; Kim, Minho/Q-8006-2019","Kim, Minho/0000-0002-6703-0808; Lee, Jaehoon/0000-0002-3514-8000",Chonbuk National University,Chonbuk National University,This paper was supported by the research funds of Chonbuk National University in 2014.,,85,20,22,8,96,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Consequently, the purpose is to develop a multidimensional index of innovation that is able to reflect innovation enablers and outputs. The index may then be used (i) to assess and quantify temporal changes of innovation, (ii) to describe regional differences and similarities of innovation, and (iii) serve as exogenous variables to analyze the importance of innovation for other economic phenomena. Our index is defined in a four-dimensional space of orthogonal axes. An empirical case study is used for demonstration of the index, where 44 variables are collected for all municipalities in Sweden. The index spanning the four-dimensional innovation comprises size, accessibility, firm performance, and agglomeration. The proposed index offers a new way of defining and analyzing innovation and should have a wide range of important applications in a world where innovation is receiving a great deal of recognition.","[Holgersson, Thomas] Linnaeus Univ, Ctr Data Intens Sci & Applicat, Vaxjo, Sweden; [Holgersson, Thomas; Kekezi, Orsa] Jonkoping Univ, Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Box 1026, S-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden; [Kekezi, Orsa] Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Ctr Entrepreneurship & Spatial Econ CEnSE, Jonkoping, Sweden",Linnaeus University; Jonkoping University; Jonkoping University,"Kekezi, O (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Univ, Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Box 1026, S-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden.",orsa.kekezi@ju.se,"Kekezi, Orsa/AAF-4165-2020",,,,,,90,5,5,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

Universities and other higher education institutions could be seen as boosting entrepreneurship in the region. University graduates could be more often involved in starting up a new business and the university itself could commercialize their innovations by creating academic spin-off companies. The paper aims to examine the potential effect of higher education on the probability of starting a business as well as its further success. Based on the data for 40 EU and non-EU countries, retrieved from a Eurobarometer survey, we conducted probit and IV probit regressions. These have tested the assumed relationship between higher education and entrepreneurial activities. Our results strongly suggest that higher education can often be very beneficial for starting up a new business and this seems to be one of the factors determining the success of new businesses. Furthermore, those respondents who attended courses related to entrepreneurship appear to be more active in starting-up a business and this seems to be also positively correlated with the company's future success. Interestingly, university graduates from Brazil, Portugal and India in particular, tend to appreciate the role that their universities have played in acquiring the skills to enable them to run a business.","[Hunady, Jan; Orviska, Marta; Pisar, Peter] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Hunady, J (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia.",jan.hunady@umb.sk; marta.orviska@umb.sk; peter.pisar@umb.sk,"Orviska, Marta/U-5000-2019; Pisar, Peter/ABE-4019-2020; Hunady, Jan/B-9678-2019","Orviska, Marta/0000-0002-8968-8483; Hunady, Jan/0000-0002-7075-2289; Pisar, Peter/0000-0003-4898-2739",Slovak Research and Development Agency (APVV) [APVV-14-0512],Slovak Research and Development Agency (APVV)(Slovak Research and Development Agency),"This research was supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency (APVV), APVV-14-0512 Universities and regional development.",,39,12,19,2,44,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We highlight new implications of globalization when general equilibrium effects on capital markets are present. In particular, we show that globalization increases the share of financially constrained firms and affects producers very differently depending on their exposure to credit frictions. While the positive effect of globalization dominates for unconstrained firms, higher borrowing costs and tougher competition especially hurt credit-rationed producers. We show that these new adjustments increase the heterogeneity among firms and reduce welfare gains from trade. Our theory is consistent with new empirical patterns from World Bank firm-level data. We show that credit frictions are positively related to the degree of product competition and to the variance of sales across firms. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The research is based on the sample of EU-28 over the period 1995-2015. The empirical analysis is conducted within the econometric framework of heterogeneous, cross-sectional dependent panels, using common correlated effects approach. According to the main findings of the paper, different effects of public policies between groups of developed and emerging European economies are evident but not crucial. These effects on fiscal deficit are heterogeneous across all countries, with different magnitude of pension, health and education expenditure impact. Due to the population ageing, pension expenditure has the most frequent and the most intensive influence on fiscal deficit deepening, following by education expenses. It means that policymakers are facing with trade-off related to old/young population, and that they are mostly oriented toward old population (voters).","[Josifidis, Kosta; Glavaski, Olgica; Supic, Novica] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ Subot, Novi Sad, Serbia; [Mitrovic, Radmila Dragutinovic] Univ Belgrade, Fac Econ, Belgrade, Serbia",University of Novi Sad; University of Belgrade,"Glavaski, O (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ Subot, Novi Sad, Serbia.",,"Supic, Novica/Q-8905-2019; Supic, Novica/ABF-9244-2022; Mitrovic, Radmila Dragutinovic/AAZ-5903-2020","Supic, Novica/0000-0002-9526-7255; Mitrovic, Radmila Dragutinovic/0000-0003-2566-4666; Glavaski, Olgica/0000-0001-6628-2301",,,,,68,1,1,0,4,INST ESTUDIOS FISCALES,MADRID,"AVDA CARDENAL HERRERA ORIA, 378, MADRID, 28035, SPAIN",0210-1173,2386-4176,,HACIENDA PUBLICA ESP,Hacienda Publica Esp.,,2018,,227,,,,,63,101,,10.7866/HPE-RPE.18.4.3,0.0,,,39,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,HP9OK,,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000462022500003,0

Central banks implemented several unconventional monetary policies to overcome the ZLB, including setting negative nominal interest rates. This paper explores possible unintended effects of setting negative policy rates. Using Danish data, I assess the impact of paying a negative interest rate on reserves. Results suggest that going into negative territory has a particular impact, distinct from that of simply lowering interest rates: it leads to higher banking outflows and depreciation of the currency. Due to the reluctance of commercial banks to pass on negative rates to their depositors (retail deposits can easily be switched into cash), paying a negative (vs. positive) interest rate on reserves creates a disconnection between the assets and liabilities of commercial banks' balance sheets. Commercial banks can avoid this disconnection by holding external assets or assets in foreign currencies.

To maximize its effectiveness, the monthly average daily solar radiation (MADSR) should be accurately estimated, and then an accurate MADSR map could be developed for final decisionmakers. However, there is a limitation in improving the accuracy of the MADSR map due to the lack of weather stations. This is because it is too expensive to measure the actual MADSR data using the remote sensors in all the sites where the PV system would be installed. Thus, this study aimed to develop the MADSR map with improved estimation accuracy using the advanced case-based reasoning (A-CBR), finite element method (FEM), and kriging method. This study was conducted in four steps: (i) data collection; (ii) estimation of the MADSR data in the 54 unmeasured locations using the A-CBR model; (iii) estimation of the MADSR data in the 89 unmeasured locations using the FEM model; and (iv) development of the MADSR map using the kriging method.

In addition to the revenue-recycling effect, the equilibrium pollution tax rate depends on two opposite forces: the tax-cutting effect and the profit effect. The two forces show that an instrument that exploits a greater revenue-recycling effect can cause a more severe environmental deterioration, thereby resulting in the infeasibility of the hypothesis. The introduction of the interdependence between the two dividends can also mean that non-revenue-raising instruments are more efficient than revenue-raising instruments.","[Lai, Yu-Bong] Natl Chengchi Univ, Taipei 11605, Peoples R China",,"Lai, YB (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, Taipei 11605, Peoples R China.",yblai@nccu.edu.tw,,"Lai, Yu-Bong/0000-0001-7032-8245",Ministry of Science and Technology [104-2410-H-004-006-MY2],Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government),The author is grateful to two anonymous referees for their valuable comments and suggestions.

While aid directed at trade-related infrastructure (e.g. ports and roads) is reported to drive the overall effect of AfT, the increasing importance of labor market flexibility and informal labor in export environment has been largely overlooked. The purpose of this paper is to test two hypotheses regarding the relationship between labor market flexibility, exports and AfT. First, flexible labor regulation promotes exports by reducing adjustment costs related to the export process. Second, for informal labor-intensive export sectors, AfT effectiveness may be compromised by the contraction of the informal sector due to labor deregulation as it deteriorates comparative advantage that supports recipients' export competitiveness. Design/methodology/approach Since first introduced by Tinbergen (1962), the gravity model has been widely used to analyze bilateral trade, and its usefulness has been verified in several prominent empirical studies (e.g. Anderson and van Wincoop, 2003; Helpman et al., 2008). However, despite the empirically successful framework of the gravity model, the standard gravity equation may not be appropriate for estimating the effect of AfT in the paper. The main interest lies in whether aggregate AfT flows enhance the export performance of individual recipients, that is, whether they improve the recipients' total exports rather than their bilateral exports. For this purpose, the authors took aggregated approach to the gravity model from Anderson and van Wincoop (2003). Findings The findings suggest that while both AfT and labor market flexibility are positively associated with higher export levels, the export-promoting effect of AfT is marginally reduced by the contraction of informal workforce. These findings, however, only hold for export sectors that heavily rely on informal labor force, that is, primary commodities and resource/labor-intensive goods. The authors also find that these effects are stronger in low-income countries, indicating that the AfT initiative has been effective where it is needed the most. Originality/value This paper is the first attempt to analyze the relationship between AfT and exports with consideration of labor market flexibility. Using the data for 85 recipient countries, the authors test the following hypotheses. First, labor market flexibility promotes exports by reducing adjustment costs related to the exporting process. Second, the contraction of the informal sector due to labor deregulation deteriorates developing countries' comparative advantage in certain export sectors. Hence, while both AfT and labor market flexibility are expected to enhance the export volume of developing countries, the loss from weaker comparative advantage in a form of smaller informal labor force can exceed the gains from AfT in certain sectors.","[Lee, Hongshik] Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Minseok] Samjong Accounting Corp, Transfer Pricing Team, Seoul, South Korea",Korea University,"Lee, H (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",honglee@korea.ac.kr,,,National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government [NRF-2008-362-A00001],National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government,This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2008-362-A00001).,,56,3,3,1,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

To illustrate such consequences of means-tested subsidies of health insurance premiums, we construct hypothetical households earning different levels of income who are eligible for current subsidies in the USA. and compare the estimated implicit marriage penalty faced by these households to the one faced by low-income households who are eligible for various means-tested programmes (e.g. TANF, WIC, SNAP) for each of the 48 contiguous states. We find that, like very low-income households, marriage can potentially penalize couples who receive health insurance premium subsidies by decreasing their overall disposable income by as much as 14%. We find that the ACA increases the number of households subject to marriage penalties embedded in means-tested programmes for low-income couples. This distortion will exist for any future health insurance premium subsidies that are means tested at the household income level.","[Leguizamon, J.

These changes to the market design aim to better reflect the intermittent power generation from renewable energy sources. However, little is known about trading in shorter intervals and its impact on the existing market. As a remedy, our evaluation first shows that the market has quickly adopted the new 15 min contracts. Second, we estimate a Bayesian structural time series, which measures a causal decrease of electricity prices. Depending on the model specification, our results indicate that the reduction can be as high as 28% for existing hourly contracts subsequent to the introduction of 15 min trading. Third, the use of 15 min contracts coincides with intermittent power generation, as it incentivizes renewable energy providers to offer additional electricity. Altogether, our findings suggest that 15 min trading is used to balance the intra-hour volatility of renewable energy sources. Consequently, this presents a blueprint for policy-makers, who can attain similar price reductions and larger feedins from renewable energy sources without direct costs in all countries with high shares of renewable energy sources.

The sources of business cycle fluctuations are crucial in determining whether a leaning-against-the-wind policy is optimal or not.

This intrinsically raises ontological issues regarding the nature of an economy within which policy is made and to which statistical analysis is applied. These are of general significance to post Keynesians irrespective of the position they take on the specifics of the ergodicity debate. However, they involve some issues that overlap with some aspects of that debate. The problem as posed in this article is specific and involves a practical contradiction regarding central bank policy and the problem of unit roots. The authors then consider some additional ways in which one can go beyond common practice based on the example of Forward Guidance in the United Kingdom and a more institutional approach to post Keynesian analysis.","[Nasir, Muhammad Ali] Leeds Beckett Univ, Fac Business & Law, Econ Analyt & Int Business Grp, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Morgan, Jamie] Leeds Beckett Univ, Fac Business & Law, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",Leeds Beckett University; Leeds Beckett University,"Nasir, MA (通讯作者)，Leeds Beckett Univ, Fac Business & Law, Econ Analyt & Int Business Grp, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",,"Nasir, Muhammad Ali/I-6252-2019","Nasir, Muhammad Ali/0000-0003-2779-5854",,,,,62,4,4,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

We find evidence of the Samuelson maturity effect even after controlling for the trading volume. The mixture of distribution hypothesis is strongly supported. Hence trading volume, a proxy for information arrival, is one of the important determinants of volatility, and it dominates time-to-maturity.

The inflation stemmed from military subsidy and Peninsula campaign payments, as well as food imports, far in excess of Britain's export earnings to cover these capital transfers (particularly when crimped by the Continental Blockade), and not merely from domestic credit over issue. Neither domestic money creation nor the fiscal theory of the price level best explains the imbalance in Britain's international accounts during the Napoleonic Wars. This deficit stemmed from domestic production shortfalls in essentials (above all food production) and contractual obligations such as military spending/subsidies relative to the pound's international purchasing power which emanated from the ability of Britain to sell exports and replace imports with domestic output (raise food production internally). These types of highly inelastic transactions tended to operate independently of domestic money creation, fiscal policy (taxes) or price developments (inflation). This article tracks England's bullion debate, which concerned whether gold prices rose (and hence sterling's exchange rate fell) because military capital transfers over-whelmed the balance of payments, or because the Bank of England over issued paper money after the gold cover was removed in 1797. The issues herein are not antiquated because the primary issues in monetary debates for two centuries have concerned the cause of inflation and deflation, and whether the domestic money supply or the balance of payments is responsible. Determining actual causation is critical for the proper solution: monetary deflation, or domestic and international restructuring of trade and investment.","[Phillips, Emir] Grenoble Ecole Management, DBA Program, Grenoble, France",Grenoble Ecole Management,"Phillips, E (通讯作者)，Grenoble Ecole Management, DBA Program, Grenoble, France.",,,"phillips, emir/0000-0002-6596-1449",,,,,77,0,0,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Using parametric and nonparametric methods, this study provides evidence that behavioral factors have the power to predict oil price movements. Based on monthly, weekly and daily data for 1986 to 2016, we find that investor sentiment, captured by nine different proxies, has a significant effect on oil prices. In addition, we demonstrate that volatility in these sentiment indices spills over and can explain part of the volatility in oil prices. Our findings are even more significant during and after the early 2000s, when oil-based financial products became a popular asset class for many funds and portfolio managers.

This article examines whether there is any empirical support for this belief by testing for the presence of across-contest momentum effects in college football. We characterize momentum in multiple fashions and after controlling for between-team heterogeneity find no evidence that systematic relationships exist between the degree of momentum a team enters a contest with and the outcome of that contest. From a wagering market perspective, this indicates that there is no statistically significant advantage to betting on teams perceived to possess positive momentum. Our results also suggest that the combination of the opening betting line set by odds makers and the subsequent market movement of that line does not systematically overreact to teams on streaks.","[Salaga, Steven] Univ Georgia, Dept Kinesiol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Brown, Katie M.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Hlth & Kinesiol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Salaga, S (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Ramsey Ctr 361, 330 River Rd, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",salaga@uga.edu,,"Salaga, Steven/0000-0002-7329-9256; Brown, Katie/0000-0002-3629-769X",,,,,12,5,5,2,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The results show that within-country asset inequality is positively correlated with the returns to higher education, a finding that is corroborated by results showing a negative correlation between consumption-based inequality and the proportion of households that completed tertiary education. Countries with higher remittance flows also experienced lower inequality, whereas assets and goods market distortions tended to increase inequality in Africa. The paper also decomposed within-country inequality into components deemed to represent opportunities beyond the control of individuals and those attributed to individual efforts, such as education. At least 30% of asset inequality within countries was, on average, due to inequality of opportunity, though there were considerable differences across countries. In addition, the incidence of child mortality and disease burden of malaria and tuberculosis tended to increase with asset-based inequality of opportunity, which increased with ethnic fractionalisation but decreased with improved governance.","[Shimeles, Abebe; Nabassaga, Tiguene] African Dev Bank, Res Dev Dept, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire",African Development Bank Group (AfDB),"Shimeles, A (通讯作者)，African Dev Bank, Res Dev Dept, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire.",a.shimeles@afdb.org,,,African Development Bank,African Development Bank(CGIAR),"We thank John Anyanu, Issa Faye, Anthony Simpasa, Daniel Zerfu, Rupa Duttagupta, participants at the African Economic Conference held in Kinshasa, DRC in 2012; seminar at African Development Bank in 2015 and the IMF in September 2016.

Our results point toward a drop in domestic currency loans and an increase of foreign currency credit in reaction to monetary policy tightening in Poland and Hungary, suggesting that the presence of foreign currency debt weakens the transmission of monetary policy. A currency depreciation shock leads to an initial decline in foreign currency lending, but also in loans denominated in domestic currency as central banks react to a weaker exchange rate by increasing the interest rates. However, after several quarters, credit in foreign currency accelerates, indicating that borrowers start using it to substitute for depressed domestic currency lending.","[Skibinska, Malgorzata] SGH Warsaw Sch Econ & Narodowy Bank Polski, Warsaw, Poland",,"Skibinska, M (通讯作者)，SGH Warsaw Sch Econ & Narodowy Bank Polski, Warsaw, Poland.",malgorzata.skibinska@nbp.pl,,"Walerych, Malgorzata/0000-0003-2447-9004",National Science Centre [2014/13/B/HS4/00212],"National Science Centre(National Science Centre, Poland)",The financial support of the National Science Centre [grant number 2014/13/B/HS4/00212] is gratefully acknowledged.

The former question, in particular, makes this book important not only for Marx specialists but also for other dissenting economists. Recall that in writings before the General Theory Keynes (1933a, 1933b), in particular, made allusion to the Marxian circuit via the concept of the monetary theory of production. However, these references did not survive in the published version in 1936. Nor was Keynes at all confident on this topic in debate the following year. It is therefore important to both Marx scholars and other heterodox economists to inquire exactly how the Marxian circuit was supposed to work. A starting point is to write out the scheme from Capital Vol. 2 (Marx, 1885/1976) in full, M - C ... P ... C' - M', and try to explain what the magnitudes (M' - M) and (C' - C), are supposed to represent.

Main-stream analyses, including New Keynesian ones, which retain the notion of factor substitution leading to a factor intensity inversely related to its rate of return, have encountered some difficulties in the interpretation of this change. Nonmainstream approaches present an advantage in the explanation of the phenomenon, consisting in the fact that they entail no a priori connections between the changes in distribution and the changes factor proportions. Hence if a change in institutions or in the bargaining strength of the parties affects distribution, income shares may vary significantly (i.e., changes in wages need not be accompanied by changes in labor to output ratio in the opposite direction as in mainstream analyses). Yet empirical observation may question also some of the analyses that have been advanced outside the mainstream. The article will explore the ways in which nonmainstream approaches have interpreted the described changes in distribution, and assess them from an analytical viewpoint and with reference to U.S. data. The purpose is that of pointing at some open questions and problems.","[Stirati, Antonella] Univ Roma Tre, Dipartimento Econ, Rome, Italy",Roma Tre University,"Stirati, A (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tre, Dipartimento Econ, Rome, Italy.",,"STIRATI, Antonella/R-8669-2016","STIRATI, Antonella/0000-0002-4195-9416",,,,,49,3,3,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

We employed two types of approaches in our analysis: i) time series and ii) panel data approach. According to the generalized ridge regressions estimated in Bayesian framework, the perceived corruption was a factor that influenced FDI in all the countries. In Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia corruption came through as a serious obstacle for FDIs since 2005, but this was not the case for Hungary. Even if Hungary is perceived as a country with high influence, foreign investors seem no to care about this fact and are more interested in the quality of human resources and the possibility to increase exports. Our panel approach based on a panel ARDL model identified a significant relationship between FDI, corruption index and labour force with advanced education however this causality was only detected in the long run. According to the Granger causality in panel, the attraction of FDI inflows succeeded in generating changes in total tax rate, but the issues related to corruption were not reduced at an acceptable level for foreign investors in Poland, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic.","[Su, Weihua; Zhang, Dongcai; Zhang, Chonghui] Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Coll Stat & Math, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Abrham, Josef] Metropolitan Univ Prague, Dept Legal Specializat & Publ Adm, Dubecska 900-10, Prague 10031, Czech Republic; [Simionescu, Mihaela] Casa Acad, Romanian Acad, Inst Econ Forecasting, Calea 13,Septembrie 13,Sect 5, Bucharest 050711, Romania; [Yaroshevich, Natalya] Ural State Univ Econ, Dept Corp Econ, 62 Vosmogo Marta Str, Ekaterinburg 620144, Russia; [Guseva, Valentina] Tyumen Ind Univ, Dept Business Informat & Math, Volodarskogo Str 38, Tyumen 625000, Russia",Zhejiang Gongshang University; Metropolitan University Prague; Romanian Academy of Sciences; Ural State University of Economics; Tyumen Industrial University,"Zhang, CH (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Coll Stat & Math, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",zhangch1988@zjgsu.edu.cn,"Wang, Yue/JRY-8962-2023; Simionescu, Mihaela/AAP-7639-2021; Abrhám, Josef/AAL-8271-2021; Simionescu, Mihaela/L-1249-2016; Guseva, Valentina/AAM-4555-2020; Yaroshevich, Natalia/AAE-4610-2019","Wang, Yue/0000-0001-8673-6358; Abrhám, Josef/0000-0003-2484-8439; Simionescu, Mihaela/0000-0002-6124-2172;",Philosophy and Social Science of Zhejiang Province [17NDJC211YB]; National Natural Science of China [71671165]; First Class Discipline of Zhejiang - A (Zhejiang Gongshang University - Statistics),Philosophy and Social Science of Zhejiang Province; National Natural Science of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); First Class Discipline of Zhejiang - A (Zhejiang Gongshang University - Statistics),"This work was supported by the Philosophy and Social Science of Zhejiang Province (No. 17NDJC211YB), National Natural Science of China (No. 71671165) and First Class Discipline of Zhejiang - A (Zhejiang Gongshang University - Statistics).",,62,20,20,4,40,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Their asymptotic properties are derived. Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the estimators and test statistic perform well. The analysis of Chinese house price data shows the existence of both spatial dependence and a non-linear relationship.","[Sun, Yan] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Key Lab Math Econ SUFE, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yueqin] Shanghai Normal Univ, Sch Math & Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Shanghai Normal University,"Sun, Y (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Key Lab Math Econ SUFE, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",sunyan@mail.shufe.edu.cn; wuyueq@shnu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [11271242]; Shuguang Program - Shanghai Education Development Foundation; Shanghai Municipal Education Commission [15SG31],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shuguang Program - Shanghai Education Development Foundation; Shanghai Municipal Education Commission(Shanghai Municipal Education Commission (SHMEC)),This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 11271242]; and sponsored by both the Shuguang Program supported by the Shanghai Education Development Foundation and the Shanghai Municipal Education Commission [grant number 15SG31].,,31,9,9,3,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

It explores three categories of households with zero, ten and fifteen years' education of household heads who also have differential access to financial markets. Results show that financially excluded, uneducated households prefer assets with negative returns over human capital investments in their offspring, and hence fall into an intergenerational poverty trap. Their educational investments begin only after an income threshold is reached and the same may be funded through transfers or withdrawal of educational subsidies from college educated households without lowering their human capital investments. Educational subsidies and higher access to educational inputs work best for middle educated households who have higher demand for education. For policy analysis, this study quantifies the contributions of income support, financial inclusion, lower uncertainty and subsidised education in reducing the supply of child labour.","[Thakurata, Indrajit] Indian Inst Management, Indore 453556, Madhya Pradesh, India; [D'Souza, Errol] Indian Inst Management, Ahmadabad 380015, Gujarat, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Indore; Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad,"Thakurata, I (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management, Indore 453556, Madhya Pradesh, India.",indrajitt@iimidr.ac.in; errol@iima.ac.in,,,,,,,61,3,3,3,23,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

As they do not have their own monetary policy, fiscal deficits require the issuing of public debt without the support of the central bank. The authors consequently incorporate the notion of a (partially) balanced-budget expansion to achieve the desired stimulus in gross domestic product (GDP) with the least possible effect on public debt. Their proposal is only a sort of imperfect balanced-budget expansion: It is based on the idea that simultaneous increases in public revenue and expenditure can boost GDP, but without any pretension of keeping public deficit unchanged. Specifically, the authors use the case of Spain to show that a more expansive fiscal policy is desirable on economic grounds, and that only institutional constraints prevent it. They do it presenting two alternative scenarios for the coming years and analyzing their different impact on unemployment and fiscal sustainability. The first represents a firm commitment to budget consolidation, whereas the second is based on this imperfect application of the balanced budget multiplier. The main conclusion is that a more expansive fiscal policy is perfectly compatible with finance sustainability.","[Uxo, Jorge] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Econ Anal & Finance, La Mancha, Spain; [Alvarez, Ignacio] Autonomous Univ Madrid, Dept Econ Struct, Madrid, Spain; [Alvarez, Ignacio] Complutense Inst Int Studies ICEI, Madrid, Spain; [Febrero, Eladio] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Econ Anal & Finance, La Mancha, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Autonomous University of Madrid; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Uxó, J (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Econ Anal & Finance, La Mancha, Spain.",,"Febrero, Eladio/AAB-5335-2019; ALVAREZ, IGNACIO/F-7039-2016; Uxó, Jorge/AAB-3357-2019; ALVAREZ, IGNACIO/AAR-3498-2020","Febrero, Eladio/0000-0002-0722-9487; ALVAREZ, IGNACIO/0000-0003-2801-3447; Uxó, Jorge/0000-0002-2218-1004; ALVAREZ, IGNACIO/0000-0003-2801-3447; Alvarez, Ignacio/0000-0003-0534-1253",,,,,41,5,5,3,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

However, the average effect of housing tenure choice on this probability is robust and significantly positive, ranging from 3.8 percentage points for the home-owners group as a whole, and 4.3 percentage points for those home-owners with a mortgage left to pay off.","[Barrios Garcia, Javier A.] Univ La Laguna, San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain",Universidad de la Laguna,"García, JAB (通讯作者)，Univ La Laguna, San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain.",,,,,,,,42,1,1,0,3,"UNIV ZARAGOZA DEV COOPERATION CHAIR, SPANISH NETWORK DEV STUDIES",ZARAGOZA,"GRAN VIA 2, ZARAGOZA, 50005, SPAIN",1133-455X,,,REV ECON APL-SPAIN,Rev.

In contrast to the strategic complementarity result for homogeneous individuals, we show that an asymmetric completion Markov perfect equilibrium exists, where the individual contributions and the strategic behaviors depend crucially on an impatience differential: the difference in rates of time preference across groups of individuals. When this differential is insignificant, contributions of both types of individuals are strategic complements. On the other hand, when this impatience differential exceeds a threshold, the contributions of impatient individuals become strategic substitutes, whereas the contributions of patient individuals remain strategic complements. We show that group size has an interesting role to play in the strategic behavior: increasing the number of patient individuals aggravates the incentives to free-ride by the impatient agents.

This paper tries to fill this gap. Using cross-country enterprise-level data, it investigates (1) the effect of a key political institution, namely electoral rules, on the probability that a firm engages in lobbying activities and (2) the impact of lobbying on influence, accounting for corruption and political institutions. The main conclusion is that lobbying is a significantly more effective way of generating political influence than corruption, and that electoral rules are a key mediating political institution. Our baseline estimate is that the probability of influencing government policy is 16% higher for firms that are members of lobbying groups than for those firms that are not.","[Campos, Nauro F.] Brunel Univ London, London, England; [Campos, Nauro F.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Campos, Nauro F.] IZA Bonn, Bonn, Germany; [Giovannoni, Francesco] Univ Bristol, Bristol, Avon, England",Brunel University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Bristol,"Campos, NF (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ London, London, England.;Campos, NF (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland.;Campos, NF (通讯作者)，IZA Bonn, Bonn, Germany.",nauro.campos@brunel.ac.uk; francesco.giovannoni@bristol.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/P000274/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/P000274/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,30,21,23,0,26,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

It is increasingly recognized that the somewhat constitutive autonomy, the progressive autonomization, and finally the imperialism of economics have severely reduced the possibility of interdisciplinary discussion. This paper is a first step towards developing a research program on the foundations of a non-imperialist economics. It investigates gift exchange as a missed opportunity for economics. It aims at showing that, by refusing to tackle the complexity of the gift, economics has not only lost an opportunity to develop a method suitable for the analysis of complex problems, but has voluntarily chosen not to follow a path which would have prevented it from colonizing other disciplines. Reintroducing the concept of gift into the economic discourse may thus represent a required precondition to produce an innovating discourse on economics.","[Cedrini, Mario A.; Marchionatti, Roberto] Univ Turin, Dept Econ & Stat Cognetti de Martiis, Campus Luigi Einaudi,Lungo Dora Siena 100A, Turin, Italy",University of Turin,"Cedrini, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Econ & Stat Cognetti de Martiis, Campus Luigi Einaudi,Lungo Dora Siena 100A, Turin, Italy.",mario.cedrini@unito.it,,"Cedrini, Mario Aldo/0000-0003-1059-4458",,,,,92,5,5,0,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

But not all elements in the framework are sufficiently well developed. This paper focuses on one such element: the rules-in-use' (a.k.a. rules' or working rules'). Specifically, it begins a long-overdue conversation about relations between formal legal rules and working rules' by offering a tentative and very simple typology of relations. Type 1: Some formal legal rules equal or approximate the working rules; Type 2: Some legal rules plus (or emended by) widely held social norms equal or approximate the working rules; and Type 3: Some legal rules bear no evident relation to the working rules. Several examples, including some previously used by Ostrom, are provided to illustrate each of the three types, which can be conceived of as nodes or ranges along a continuum. The paper concludes with a call for empirical research, especially case studies and meta-analyses, to determine the relevant scope of each of these types of relations, and to provide data for furthering our understanding of how different types of rules, from various sources, function (or not) as institutions.","[Cole, Daniel H.] Indiana Univ, Maurer Sch Law, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Cole, Daniel H.] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Cole, DH (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Maurer Sch Law, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.;Cole, DH (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",dancole@indiana.edu,"Cole, Daniel/AAZ-6091-2020","Cole, Daniel/0000-0002-6356-5178",Society for Environmental Law and Economics; WINIR; Humboldt University,Society for Environmental Law and Economics; WINIR; Humboldt University,"I am grateful for helpful comments during the drafting of this paper to colloquia participants at Indiana University's Ostrom Workshop and participants in conferences sponsored by the Society for Environmental Law and Economics, WINIR, and Humboldt University.

This paper surveys the empirical literature on financialization and investment to take stock of where we are and to identify questions for further research. Because financialization' is widely recognized to be ambiguously defined, I first introduce empirical indicators of financialization in this literature. This categorization elucidates three approaches to measuring financialization in the context of investment. The first two approaches emphasize rising income flows between nonfinancial corporations (NFCs) and finance: first, growth in NFCs' financial incomes and, second, growth in NFCs' payments to creditors and shareholders. Rising financial profits are, notably, widely used to suggest financial assets and incomes crowd out' physical investment. I contend that these flow-based indicators of financialization capture important relationships between changes in firm financial behaviour and investment, but also raise questions about determinants underlying NFCs' changing portfolio and financing decisions. The third approach to defining financialization emphasizes the best-developed behavioural explanation linking financialization to reduced investment: shareholder value orientation. In future research, scope remains for further attention to behavioural drivers of the empirical trends summarizing financialization.","[Davis, Leila E.] Middlebury Coll, Econ, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA",,"Davis, LE (通讯作者)，Middlebury Coll, Econ, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA.",ldavis@middlebury.edu,,,,,,,100,61,65,14,192,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

The wage decomposition model introduced by Brown et al. (1980) is used to examine the determinants of gender-related wage differentials. The results suggest that differences within occupations account for the largest portion of the wage gap between men and women. The results also indicate that wage discrimination within occupations plays an important role in the gender wage gap, while sample selection bias plays an important role in the examination of gender wage gaps.","[Ismail, Rahmah; Wye, Chung-Khain] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Sch Econ, Ukm Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia; [Farhadi, Maryam] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Accounting, Mobarakeh Branch, Esfahan, Iran",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; Islamic Azad University,"Farhadi, M (通讯作者)，Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Accounting, Mobarakeh Branch, Esfahan, Iran.",farhadim58@gmail.com,"farhadi, maryam/G-1925-2011","Wye, Chung-Khain/0000-0001-9450-942X; farhadi, maryam/0000-0002-8663-9213",,,,,36,13,13,6,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

It shows that under centralization the agent transmits his information truthfully to the principal only if his reputation concerns are low and therefore that the delegation of authority to the agent can be optimal if the agent's reputation concerns are high.","[Kim, Doyoung] Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 04107, South Korea",Sogang University,"Kim, D (通讯作者)，Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 04107, South Korea.",dkim@sogang.ac.kr,,,Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2015S1A5A2A01012239],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",We thank the referee for helpful comments.

The unemployment rate of young people in Poland in the age range 15-29, reached 14.2% in 2015. For comparison, at that time the average for the EU was higher by almost two percentage points, and the decline compared to the year 2013 was lower than in Poland. It turns out that higher education in Poland has lost its importance in the process of hiring staff. Employers are increasingly less likely to look at the educational background of candidates, as they focus more on their experience and specific skills. Purpose of the article: The purpose of this article is to present the results of re-search regarding the diagnosis of the situation of young people on the labour market in Poland from the perspective of employers. In particular, there were competency gaps and other reasons for not recruiting young people which have been identified. Methods: Two types of research were carried out with employers from Podlaskie province: quantitative, using CATI/CAWI and qualitative, using the technique of IDI. Quantitative research was carried out on a sample of 346 respondents. A qualitative study was carried out among 16 companies registered in Podlaskie province. Findings & Value added: Among the reasons for not employing young people which were most often mentioned by the entrepreneurs in quantitative research there were financial reasons. During the interviews, employers indicated the reasons for not employing young people such as lack of appropriate qualifications, specific skills or simply practical preparation for work. Employers were asked about the competence gaps of young people, and they pointed out that they lack experience, initiative and entrepreneurship, as well as learning skills.","[Kobylinska, Urszula; Rollnik-Sadowska, Ewa; Samul, Joanna] Bialystok Tech Univ, Wiejska 45A, PL-15001 Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Kobylinska, U (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Wiejska 45A, PL-15001 Bialystok, Poland.",u.kobylinska@pb.edu.pl,"Rollnik-Sadowska, Ewa/AAV-4280-2020; Samul, Joanna/Q-7931-2019","Rollnik-Sadowska, Ewa/0000-0002-4896-1199",Bialystok University of Technology [S/WZ/3/2015],Bialystok University of Technology,"The article was financed from the statutory work of the Chair of Organization and Management (Bialystok University of Technology, statutory work number: S/WZ/3/2015).",,23,8,8,0,14,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

Using data from 2007 to 2014 on medical research funding for infectious and parasitic diseases, we examine how governments and foundations in 41 countries respond to funding changes by the US government (which accounts for half of funding for these diseases). Because funding across governments might be positively correlated due to unobserved drivers they have in common, we use variation in the representation of research-intensive universities on US Congressional appropriations committees as an instrument for US funding.

Despite the increasing level of education, the unemployment of young generation of millennials has been worsening. It seems that they often lack relevant professional skills and social habits, and usually have unreal expectations about their initial job opportunities. We want to explore this problem in more detail. Purpose of the article: The purpose of the article is to present work expectations of today's Czech millennials and post-millennials and discuss their potential employability on the Czech labor market. Methods: The paper is based on the analysis of available scientific literature and the results of the authors' questionnaire survey focused on students of three selected Czech universities and their motivation to study at university and their expectations about the future career. The survey was conducted in spring and autumn 2016. The respondents were full-time and combined bachelor's and master's students of the College of Regional Development in Prague, the Masaryk Institute of Advanced Studies of the Czech Technical University in Prague and the Education Management Centre of the Faculty of Education of the Charles University in Prague. The relevant data were obtained from 484 students. Findings & Value added: The results support the research assumption that young generation of Czech millennials show relatively high expectations related to work and career, which would limit their employability. Many employers are afraid of employing young people, but from the perspective of potential shortage of qualified and motivated people on the Czech labor market they should learn to create appropriate and attractive employment opportunities for young people to ensure effective development of their potential. The article presents common work expectations of today's Czech millennials and provides employers with some advice to manage them.","[Safrankova, Jana Marie; Sikyr, Martin] Inst Reg Dev & Banking Inst AMBIS, Narozni 2600-9, Prague 15800 5, Czech Republic",AMBIS University,"Safránková, JM (通讯作者)，Inst Reg Dev & Banking Inst AMBIS, Narozni 2600-9, Prague 15800 5, Czech Republic.",jana.safrankova@ambis.cz,"Šikýř, Martin/K-4913-2017",,,,,,18,13,13,2,30,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

The subgame perfect equilibrium of this contest is analyzed with either positive or negative synergy. We show, in particular, that whether the contestants are symmetric or asymmetric their expected payoffs may be higher under negative synergy than under positive synergy.

Unlike unemployment insurance, unemployment accounts solve the moral hazard problem but provide no public insurance to workers. I study a hybrid system that borrows from concepts of both unemployment insurance and unemployment accounts, in which workers are mandated to save when employed and can withdraw from the account when unemployed. Once the account is exhausted, the unemployed worker receives unemployment benefits. This hybrid policy provides insurance to workers more efficiently than an unemployment insurance system because it provides government benefits selectively. As a consequence, young workers can reduce their precautionary savings and better smooth their consumption over the life cycle. Calibrating the model to the US economy, I find that, relative to an optimal unemployment insurance system, the optimal hybrid policy leads to a welfare gain of 2.4%, measured as consumption equivalent variation.

However, they do not focus on the psychological factors affecting the efficiency of energy consumption in households. Lithuania has a lack of a unified and justified opinion on psychological factors that affect the energy efficiency of households. Purpose of the article: The main objective of the article is to identify the psychological factors that influence energy efficiency in households and to identify the appropriate measures to change the individual's energy consumption behavior. Methods: The article was based on analysis of scientific literature and expert evaluation, when experts selected the most influencing psychological factors. Expert valuation allowed to set the right conditions in which individuals are more easily assimilated by means of energy saving. Findings: In most cases, economic and technological factors significantly influence household energy consumption. Increased energy-efficient equipment production and supply is causing an energy consumption growth in households, because they are more inclined to buy and use more efficient electrical equipment. An investigation has showed that the energy consumption is strongly influenced by some cultural and psychological factors: with greater public openness to innovation, the households tend to use energy more efficiently. Also, some psychological indicators have significant impact on energy consumption has - frequently the more pronounced neuroticism or extraversion rate. Since the research was performed only in Lithuania, in the future it will seek to carry out an investigation in several countries and to compare a various factors on the proposed measures and the efficiency of household energy consumption.","[Simanaviciene, Zaneta] Mykolas Romeris Univ, Ateities St 20, LT-08303 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Dirma, Virgilijus; Simanavicius, Arturas] Lithuanian Sports Univ, Kaunas, Lithuania",Mykolas Romeris University; Lithuanian Sports University,"Simanaviciene, Z (通讯作者)，Mykolas Romeris Univ, Ateities St 20, LT-08303 Vilnius, Lithuania.",zasiman@mruni.eu,"Simanaviciene, Zaneta/W-3675-2019; Simanaviciene, Zaneta/U-7817-2019","Simanaviciene, Zaneta/0000-0001-6008-2405;",,,,,49,7,7,1,14,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

We distinguish between classical-Marxian and post-Keynesian models, and analyze them under three different assumptions on the determinants of technical change: capital accumulation, income distribution, and labor market tightness. The balanced growth implications of alternative models are compared with neoclassical exogenous and endogenous growth theories. Despite the strong differences in the assumptions regarding the substitutability between capital and labor, the role of different classes in society, and whether or not productive factors are fully employed, the various alternative models can be classified in a way that highlights remarkable similarities with their neoclassical counterparts. Both neoclassical and alternative theories of endogenous growth: (i) have shown that long-run growth is sensitive to investment decisions, and (ii) rely on a linear spillover from the stock of knowledge to the production of innovations. The comparison highlights the different channels emphasized by competing theories: saving behavior and market structure in the neoclassical theories, as opposed to income distribution, the state of the labor market, and investors' behavior in alternative theories.","[Tavani, Daniele] Colorado State Univ, Dept Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Zamparelli, Luca] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Social & Econ Sci, Rome, Italy",Colorado State University; Sapienza University Rome,"Zamparelli, L (通讯作者)，Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Social & Econ Sci, Rome, Italy.",luca.zamparelli@uniroma1.it,"Tavani, Daniele/HSE-9182-2023","Tavani, Daniele/0000-0002-2757-0439; ZAMPARELLI, LUCA/0000-0001-6321-2105",,,,,104,47,53,6,58,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

We find that institutional rigidities - such as labour and product market institutions and regulations - limit the adjustment of euro area wages to unemployment, in both upturns and downturns, particularly in manufacturing and, to a lesser extent, in the construction and service sectors. In addition, there are further limitations in the response of wages to changes in unemployment during economic downturns which suggests that euro area wages are also characterised by significant downward wage rigidities, especially in the manufacturing sector. These results are robust to specifications that account for factors that may affect structural unemployment (such as duration-dependent unemployment effects), as well as changes in the skill composition of employment that may affect the evolution of aggregate wages. The results also hold for panels including or excluding the public sector (where wages may be determined differently to the private sector also due to the effects of fiscal consolidation on public sector wages during the crisis). From a policy perspective, reforms in product and labour markets which reduce wage rigidities can facilitate employment growth and enhance the rebalancing process in the euro area.","[Anderton, Robert; Savsek, Simon; Toth, Mate] European Cent Bank, Sonnemannstr 20, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany; [Anderton, Robert; Hantzsche, Arno] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Hantzsche, Arno] Natl Inst Econ & Social Res, 2 Dean Trench St,Smith Sq, London SW1P 3HE, England",European Central Bank; University of Nottingham,"Anderton, R (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Sonnemannstr 20, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany.;Anderton, R (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",robert.anderton@ecb.europa.eu,,,,,,,31,3,3,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Since transaction costs involved in conducting arbitrage are typically unobserved, empirical investigations in this area have largely been restricted to markets such as for air travel where arbitrage is difficult, if not impossible. Using an entirely novel dataset, this paper documents the effect of competition on price discrimination in the presence of arbitrage in the Canadian online sports betting market where prices for Canadian teams are higher than in the world market. I observe how the prices of Canadian teams change in real time in response to the presence of arbitrageurs that establish Canadian sportsbooks' observable marginal opportunity costs. I exploit the existence of government betting outlets not subject to arbitrage to obtain reduced form counterfactual estimates of the extent to which competition affects price discrimination in the presence of arbitrage. In this new empirical environment, I find results consistent with the airline literature: competition reduces overall price dispersion and markups, but dispersion and markups shrink more for those in the strong market than the weak market.","[Boik, Andre] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Boik, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",aboik@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,18,1,2,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

In a Salop framework with three symmetric firms, several striking results appear. First, the merging firms reduce quality but possibly also price, whereas the outside firm increases both price and quality. As a result, the average price in the market increases, but also the average quality. Second, the outside firm benefits more than the merging firms from the merger, and the merger can be unprofitable for the merger partners, i.e., the merger paradox may appear. Third, the merger always reduces total consumer utility (though some consumers may benefit), but total welfare can increase due to endogenous quality cost savings. In a generalized framework with n firms, we identify two key factors for the merger effects: (i) the magnitude of marginal variable quality costs, which determines the nature of strategic interaction and (ii) the cross-quality and cross-price demand effects, which determines the intensity of price relative to quality competition. These findings have implications for antitrust policy in industries where quality is a key strategic variable for the firms.","[Brekke, Kurt R.] Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Bergen, Norway; [Siciliani, Luigi] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Straume, Odd Rune] Univ Minho, Dept Econ, Braga, Portugal; [Straume, Odd Rune] Univ Minho, NIPE, Braga, Portugal",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); University of York - UK; Universidade do Minho; Universidade do Minho,"Siciliani, L (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York, N Yorkshire, England.",luigi.siciliani@your.ac.uk,"PATTANAYAK, MANORANJAN/N-7858-2017; siciliani, luigi/AAE-8686-2020; Straume, Odd Rune/B-6090-2009","Straume, Odd Rune/0000-0002-6889-2717","COMPETE [POCI-01-0145-FEDER-006683]; FCT/MEC's (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, I.P.); ERDF through Operational Programme on Competitiveness and Internationalization - COMPETE","COMPETE; FCT/MEC's (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, I.P.)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); ERDF through Operational Programme on Competitiveness and Internationalization - COMPETE","Odd Rune Straume acknowledges funding from COMPETE (ref. no.

An agent's utility is affected by the presence of an aspiration level which will only be satisfied if their final income is above the poverty line. I show that agents who are sufficiently above the poverty line will invest in the risky project and are able to aspire for success. An agent, however, who is just above the poverty line, may be so concerned about falling into poverty that they choose to invest in the safe project. These individuals aspire only to survive. Alternatively, if an agent is sufficiently below the poverty line, then they will invest in the risky project even if expected returns are lower than the safe project. These individuals have nothing left to lose and therefore aspire to escape. Two forms of poverty traps emerge from the resulting equilibria: one above the poverty line, and one below the poverty line. Finally, I offer empirical support for the model based on individual level survey data across a large number of countries. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We use a simple task-based model of the firm's choice of occupational inputs to examine how that choice varies with global engagement. We reveal a robust and causal relationship between global engagement and the skill mix of occupations within firms, using Swedish matched employer-employee data that link firms and the labor force for 1997-2005. Taking an instrumental variable approach, we find that increased export shares (driven by higher world import demand) skew the labor mix more toward high-skill occupations. Our results suggest that global engagement may require firms to employ more skilled labor to undertake complex tasks embodied in international businesses, which have further implications for the demand for specific occupational skills and overall wage dispersion.

Assuming a technological sequence of production stages, a recent property rights framework (Antras and Chor, 2013; Alfaro et al., 2015) predicts that vertical integration decisions are crucially based on both the position of a supplier along the chain and on the relative size of demand elasticities faced by the final-good producer and the supplier. In line with this, we find that if final demand is sufficiently elastic (inelastic), downstream parents, i.e. final-good producers, integrate production stages that are more proximate to (far from) final demand. However, this result is not valid in the case of midstream parents, i.e. producers of intermediate inputs that can integrate either backward or forward along the chain. We document that these companies are at least as common as are downstream parents, but the existing theory neglects them. In these cases, we find that demand elasticities do not play a significant role in integration choices. Interestingly, both midstream and downstream parents tend to integrate affiliates that are more proximate in segments of a supply chain, probably due to technological complementarities in adjacent industries.

We propose a framework to model imperfectly credible announcements and use it to study the distribution of the output cost for a given disinflation. Imperfect credibility is modeled as the extent to which agents rely on adaptive learning to form expectations. Lower credibility increases the mean, variance, and skewness of the distribution of the sacrifice ratio. When credibility is low, disinflations become very costly for adverse realizations of the shocks. But, an opportunistic disinflation, a disinflation implemented after a period of below trend inflation, can significantly lower the sacrifice ratio. With simulated data, we reinterpret the reduced form evidence in sacrifice ratio regressions. Coefficient estimates from these regressions can be misleading for policymakers considering the cost of disinflation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We develop firm, product, market and year-specific measures of productivity and demand. We use these measures to document a number of novel findings that distinguish the growth of Chinese exports. First, we document that changes in demand explain nearly 78-89% of aggregate export growth, while only 11-22% of export growth is determined by productivity growth. Second, our results highlight two mechanisms which contribute significantly to aggregate export growth: the rapid reallocation of market shares towards products with growing demand, and high rates of product exit among low demand products. Investigating the mechanisms underlying these results we find that new exporters suffer demand shocks which are 66% smaller than those observed for incumbent producers in the same product market. By comparison, we find that there is only an 8% difference on average between the productivity of new and incumbent exporters. Repeating our exercise with revenue productivity reveals much smaller differences. This is largely attributed to differential movements in prices and marginal costs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This study contributes to the existing literature by analysing the role of the labour and product markets in mitigating inflationary pressure stemming from the catching-up process. It is demonstrated that disregarding the developments of sectoral wages and mark-ups severely distorts the estimates of the convergence-driven inflation.

Hence, an optimal leniency policy must trade off the positive impact of helpful disclosure of insider information and the positive externality that these rents exert on the organisation's returns from crime. Due to this tension, the amnesty that minimises the probability of crime induces the Legislator to restrict the access to the programme, by excluding informants owning potentially useful knowledge.

We consider a population with two groups each with different character traits. A political institution provides the platform and a set of rules for the two groups to battle over the relative representativeness of their traits for the high positions in the social hierarchy. This political process affects the economic outcomes of the two groups and, subsequently their character traits evolve. We study how conducive different political institutions are to spreading character traits that induce better economic outcomes. Under exclusive political institutions, any trait can be prevalent. Therefore, a society can be trapped in a state in which traits associated with unfavorable economic outcomes persist. Under inclusive political institutions, evolution has stronger selection power. Only traits that result in the largest comparative advantage in terms of holding a high position can be prevalent. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

As an important counterexample, although China has one of the world's fastest-growing economies, its legal and financial systems are underdeveloped. With evidence from China, the author confirms that government intervention positively and causally determines firms' access to credit. The author further provides evidence that government intervention enables firms' profit through facilitating access to credit. This evidence confirms that the mechanism of government intervention allows firms' access to credit and then enables the firms to obtain relatively large profits. Ultimately, this paper reveals that, in the absence of effective economic institutions, government intervention determines firms' access to credit.","[Fu, Tong] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Ctr Regulat Competit, Inst Ind Econ, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics,"Fu, T (通讯作者)，Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Ctr Regulat Competit, Inst Ind Econ, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",canjianft@hotmail.com,"Fu, Tong/AAS-8814-2021","FU, TONG/0000-0002-6929-3230",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71763009],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),I acknowledge financial support by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 71763009).,,83,7,7,1,1,DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics-Kiel,OCT 30,2017,11.0,,,,,,,,201731,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2017-31,0.0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FL9VW,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000414609000001,0

Monetary policy accommodated fiscal policy through the '60s-'70s leading to high inflation. Monetary policy changed with Volcker, but inflation dropped only when fiscal policy and agents' beliefs about fiscal backing switched; successful disinflations require fiscal backing. If the monetary authority had always led or if agents had been confident about this switch, the Great Inflation would not have occurred. The policy change explains why, in the '80s, inflation dropped, debt-to-GDP reversed, output fell, and inflation persistence and volatility declined.

Our best estimate is that a 10% increase in the electricity price reduces the average energy consumption of commercialized refrigerator models by 2%. A large share of this reduction is explained by a reduction of freezing space. We also show that the exit of energy-inefficient products contributes more to energy reduction than the launch of new energy-efficient models. These findings suggest that innovation - the development of better technologies embodied in new products - does not respond strongly to energy price variations.

This novelty in a dynamic environment allows us to analyze how the inequality within groups changes according to individual choices and to investigate if players show inequity averse preferences. Results show that inequality has a negative impact on individual contribution. Players act in order to reduce the initial exogenous inequality. Indeed, in the Treatment with the highest level of inequality, agents vote for reducing the endowment heterogeneity.

Recessionary technology shocks induce exit of unprofitable products on impact, allocating resources towards more productive production lines. However, during the recovery phase, less productive production lines survive destruction, counteracting the original increase in productivity. The analysis shows that recoveries hinge on lower product destruction rather than higher product creation. We find that product heterogeneity and the persistence of technology shocks play a critical role for the cyclicality of product turnover. Endogenous product destruction is important to evaluate the effect of permanent policies of entry deregulation and subsidies aimed to stimulate the economy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, the convergence of per capita energy consumption, which is an important inherent characteristic of China's energy consumption, is investigated using panel data for the period 1994-2014 for 30 Chinese provinces. To control for the potential spatial dependence in energy consumption per capita and introduce dynamics, appropriate spatial dynamic econometric models are employed. The empirical results indicate that there are both absolute and conditional. beta-convergences in per capita energy consumption across provinces. In addition, there is also evidence for an inverted U-shaped relationship between per capita energy consumption and per capita GDP. Therefore, per capita energy consumption would increase when economic development is relatively low. However, per capita energy consumption may decrease after a threshold level of economic development is reached, Among the factors that potential influence provincial energy consumption, the ratio of secondary industry value-added to GDP and the spatial correlation of energy consumptions in neighboring provinces are positively related to energy consumption per capita, while population density and per capita foreign direct investment do not affect energy consumption per capita significantly.

Nodes with a below-average number of links prove to be one of the bottlenecks for an efficient transmission of knowledge throughout the analysed networks. This indicates that diffusion-inhibiting overall network structures are the result of the myopic linking strategies of the actors at the micro level.

Critiques of mainstream economics commonly pertain to the inherent narrowness of thought, concomitant methodology, methods, and practice. The author therefore focuses on both pedagogy and curriculum to argue for an approach that (a) methodically broadens the content of core courses while maintaining common departmental curricular goals, (b) develops a variety of conceptually strong upper-level heterodox field courses, and (c) prepares students to explore a diversity of topics for senior theses using relevant heterodox methodologies. Taking a consciously non-divisive and integrative approach that seeks to methodically broaden economic thought and practice by focusing on overall programmatic integration helps to build bridges both within one's department and more broadly in the discipline. This paper uses a curricular map and examples from the author's course content to illustrate integrating heterodox economics into an existing program. The final section provides examples from student research in economics that have made use of non-reductionist methodologies. While making observations about constraints in sustaining such an approach, the paper strongly argues that there is a greater possibility of creating a stronger identity for heterodox approaches with conceptual rigor, if developed not in deliberate opposition to the mainstream or any other approach.","[Natarajan, Tara] St Michaels Coll, Dept Econ, Colchester, VT 05439 USA",,"Natarajan, T (通讯作者)，St Michaels Coll, Dept Econ, Colchester, VT 05439 USA.",,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,2,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

In our framework, investors with smaller information frictions are better able to distinguish between potential investment vehicles, which both allows them to identify higher-quality assets and reduces the subjective uncertainty about returns to investment for any given asset. We embed our framework into an otherwise-standard quantitative model of saving and investment over the life cycle. Our calibrated model generates substantial financial income inequality across investors and is fully consistent with the empirical evidence that financially unsophisticated investors save at lower rates, participate less in the stock market, obtain less well-diversified portfolios when they do, and as a result, accumulate less wealth by retirement than their financially sophisticated peers.

The results show a positive association between the presence of Asian firms in downstream sectors and the productivity of Vietnamese firms in supply industries, but no significant relationship in the case of European and North American affiliates. Within Asia, we find that foreign direct investment from China and Taiwan generates positive vertical spillovers to local suppliers.

Furthermore, in order to provide power exchange between the retailer and the power market, bidding and offering curves should be prepared to bid and offer to the day-ahead market. Therefore, this paper proposes a robust optimization approach (ROA) to obtain optimal bidding and offering strategies for the retailer. To achieve this, ROA is used for uncertainty modeling of power market prices in which the minimum and maximum limits of prices are considered for uncertainty modeling. Lower and upper bounds of price is consecutively subdivided into sequentially nested subintervals which allows formulating robust mixed-integer linear programming (RMIP) problem. The proposed RMIP model helps retailer to select a robust decision in the presence of market price uncertainty. Furthermore, the bidding and offering curves of the retailer are obtained from sufficient data through solving these problems. Meanwhile, the uncertainty of customers demand and variable climate condition are modeled based on stochastic programming. To validate the proposed robust optimization model, three case studies are evaluated and the results are compared. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Although variations in the income elasticity of demand across goods play an important role in initial approaches, recent models stress the role of supply-side factors in this process of structural change, in particular sector-specific technical change and sectoral differences in factor proportions. We explore a general framework that features an additional supply-side mechanism and also encompasses these two known mechanisms. Our model shows that sectoral differences in the degree of capital-labor substitutability-a new mechanism-are a driving force for structural change. When the flexibility to combine capital and labor differs across sectors, a factor rebalancing effect is operative. It tends to make production in the more flexible sector more intensive in the input that becomes more abundant. As a result, growth rates of sectoral capital-labor ratios can differ and, if this effect dominates, shares of each factor used in a given sector can move in different directions. We identify conditions under which this occurs and analyze the dynamics of such a case. We also provide some suggestive evidence consistent with this new mechanism. A quantitative analysis suggests that this channel was an important contributor to structural change out of agriculture in the United States.","[Alvarez-Cuadrado, Francisco; Van Long, Ngo; Poschke, Markus] McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada",McGill University,"Alvarez-Cuadrado, F (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",francisco.alvarez-cuadrado@mcgill.ca; ngo.long@mcgill.ca; markus.poschke@mcgill.ca,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council [SSHRC 430-2013-000424, 410-2011-1607]",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"We would like to thank three anonymous referees and the editor for their valuable suggestions.

Several explanations have been proposed: some focus on demand- side effects, working through Kaldor's second law of economic growth (also known as Verdoorn's law), others on supply-side effects determined by a misallocation of the factors of production, caused either by labour market reforms or by perverse effects of financial integration (in Europe, related to the adoption of the euro). The latter explanation is put forward by some recent studies that stress how low interest rates brought about by the monetary union may have lowered productivity by inducing capital misallocation. The aim of this paper is to investigate the robustness of the latter empirical findings and to compare them with the alternative explanation offered by the post-Keynesian growth model, which instead emphasises the relation between foreign trade and productivity, along lines that go back to Adam Smith. To do so, we use a panel of industry-level data extracted from the EU KLEMS database, comparing these alternative explanations by panel cointegration techniques. The results shed some light on the role played by the single currency in the structural divergences among euro area member countries.","[Bagnai, Alberto; Mongeau Ospina, Christian Alexander] Univ Gabriele dAnnunzio, Dept Econ, Pescara, Italy; [Mongeau Ospina, Christian Alexander] Italian Assoc Study Econ Asymmetries, Rome, Italy",G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara,"Bagnai, A (通讯作者)，Univ Gabriele dAnnunzio, Dept Econ, Pescara, Italy.",alberto.bagnai@unich.it; c.mongeau@asimmetrie.org,"Ospina, Christian Alexander Mongeau/N-1556-2014","Bagnai, Alberto/0000-0002-3668-7567",,,,,41,2,2,1,5,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

The agents interact through a social network and react to their exposure to neighbors' actions. The reaction function describes, for example, the best response in a strategic game, a mechanical influence in a contagion disease or a mimetic behavior. The reaction is assumed to be increasing in exposure, resulting in complementarity in actions. When it is linear, the optimal planner's strategies are explicit, characterized by well-known centralities indices computed on the bilateral impacts. When the reaction function is concave or convex, the optimal strategies depend not only on the impacts but also on the pattern of agents' attentions. The value of information on the interaction structure is shown to be (almost always) positive and related to some form of heterogeneity between agents. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

One of these concerns what has been called the paradox of embedded agency - how social innovators conceive of something new when working with existing social institutions. So far few writers have considered whether historical examples can, with benefit of hindsight, shed light on the relationships between social innovators and social institutions. This paper considers the example of Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen, creator of rural credit unions and agricultural co-operatives in 19th-century Germany. Raiffeisen was a social conservative who worked in many ways within existing social institutions. At the same time, his desire to meet social needs drove him to create new forms of action and organization that resulted in social innovation. Raiffeisen's process of invention shows that social innovation, particularly in transitional eras like his, need not be a matter of using logical-deductive processes to address a social need, but may depend critically on values, will, a readiness to experiment, and an ability to find allies. These qualities enabled Raiffeisen to break through existing institutions to do something fundamentally new, and they may be qualities that provide new focus for social-innovation research and policy.","[Fairbairn, Brett] Univ Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada",University of Saskatchewan,"Fairbairn, B (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.",brett.fairbairn@usask.ca,,,,,,,61,7,7,2,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

First, whenever possible, multiple constraints on the minimum level of equity capital should be consolidated into a single constraint. This helps to avoid a distortionary situation where different constraints bind for different banks performing the same activity. Second, the best way to deal with the inevitable gaming of any set of ex ante capital rules is not to propose further rules, but rather to allow the regulator sufficient flexibility to address unforeseen contingencies ex post. Third, though a regulatory framework that relies primarily on minimum capital ratios is appropriate for normal times, such a framework is inadequate in the wake of a large negative shock to the system. Following an adverse shock, it becomes critical to emphasize dynamic resilience, which involves forcing banks to actively recapitalize-that is, regulation needs to focus on getting banks to raise new dollars of equity capital, rather than just maintaining their capital ratios. Applying these principles, we suggest a number of modifications to the current set of risk-based capital requirements, to the leverage ratio, and to the Federal Reserve's stress-testing framework.","[Greenwood, Robin; Hanson, Samuel G.; Sunderam, Adi] Harvard Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA; [Stein, Jeremy C.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; Harvard University,"Greenwood, R (通讯作者)，Harvard Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA.",,"Stein, Jeremy/AAA-4003-2019",,,,,,63,24,29,0,8,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

The availability of physical service infrastructure is approximated by data on nighttime light intensity in the areas in which survey respondents reside. After controlling for a number of individual and household characteristics including disposable income, we find that adoption of mobile phones is higher in areas with better physical infrastructure. However, mobile phone users who live in areas with poor infrastructure are more likely to rely on mobile phones to make financial transactions than individuals living in areas with better infrastructure. On the other hand, the use of mobile phones to access services such as email, skype, social media networks and Internet browsing is not dependent on the availability of physical infrastructure. Our results support the notion that mobile phones improve the livelihood of individuals residing in remote areas by providing them with access to financial services which are otherwise not available physically.

We start by dissecting long-run and time-varying short-run dynamics as well as causalities between both variables. Following this, we extend our framework by including short-term interest rates. Finally, we examine common exchange rate and current account dynamics across countries based on common factors. Our results show that a real appreciation coincides with a worsening of the current account in most cases. The adjustment pattern is time varying but suggests that the causality mainly runs from effective exchange rates to current accounts. However, an extension of our framework based on monthly data shows that trade balance adjustment is observed less frequently, suggesting that valuation effects play an important role for the relationship between current accounts and exchange rates. From a global point of view, cross-country trends that drive exchange rates and current accounts also share similar dynamics over the long run, which is an important finding in the context of global imbalances.","[Beckmann, Joscha; Czudaj, Robert] Univ Duisburg Essen, Dept Econ, Macroecon, D-45117 Essen, Germany; [Beckmann, Joscha] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Bochum, Germany; [Beckmann, Joscha] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Czudaj, Robert] Tech Univ Chemnitz, Chemnitz, Germany; [Czudaj, Robert] Univ Appl Sci, FOM Hsch Oekon & Management, Essen, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen; Ruhr University Bochum; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); Technische Universitat Chemnitz,"Beckmann, J (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Dept Econ, Macroecon, D-45117 Essen, Germany.;Beckmann, J (通讯作者)，Ruhr Univ Bochum, Bochum, Germany.;Beckmann, J (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany.",joscha.beckmann@uni-due.de,"Beckmann, Joscha/J-4234-2019; Czudaj, Robert L./I-2286-2019","Czudaj, Robert L./0000-0002-3313-8204",MERCUR [An-2014-0004],MERCUR,"Thanks for valuable comments are due to two anonymous reviewers and the associate editor Raphael Auer as well as Takuma Kunieda, Joshua Aizenman, Yin-Wong Cheung, Soyoung Kim, Pietro Cova, Jeffrey Sheen, Davide Romelli and the participants of the EEA-ESEM 2014 at Toulouse School of Economics, the annual meeting of the German Economic Association at University of Hamburg, the International Conference on Pacific Rim Economies and the Evolution of the International Monetary Architecture at City University of Hong Kong, as well as the INFINITI Conference on International Finance at Monash University Prato Centre, Italy.

Among these, Kiyotaki et al. (2012) is a prominent example. In this paper, we investigate whether the liquidity shocks and financial frictions proposed by Kiyotaki et al. (2012) can improve the asset pricing predictions of the frictionless RBC model. We study the quantitative business cycle and asset pricing properties in an economy in which agents feature recursive preferences, are subject to a liquidity constraint, and suffer liquidity shocks. We find that the model predicts highly nonlinear time variation and levels of risk premia, which are driven by endogenous fluctuations in equity prices. However, the model fails to account for a basic fact: Periods of scarce liquidity are associated with high asset prices and low expected returns. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We find clear evidence in favor of a breakdown of the liquidity effect after an unexpected increase in M2 in the 1921-1940 period. This evidence, which is consistent with the Keynesian view on a liquidity trap, is shown to be state contingent. In particular, it emerges only when a speculative regime identified by high realizations of the Dow Jones index is considered. A standard linear framework is shown to be ill-suited to test the hypothesis of a Keynesian liquidity trap. An investigation performed with the same data for the period 1991-2010 confirms the presence of a liquidity trap just in the speculative regime. This last result emerges significantly only when we consider the federal funds rate as the policy instrument and we model the Divisia M2 measure of liquidity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This study takes advantage of natural experiment data from September 2006 to March 2013 in Western Australia in which DST was observed from December 2006 to March 2009, to estimate the effect of DST on electricity demand. Using the difference-in-differences (DD) approach, we find that DST has little effect on overall electricity demand and electricity generation costs. However, it has a strong redistributional effect by reducing electricity demand substantially in the late afternoon and early evening. This redistributional effect of DST may be of particular interest for policymakers who are interested in controlling high demand and the short term energy market price. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This measurement might allow a central bank to assess the gains and losses in sovereign affecting the national money market when the country's own currency is given up and a common one is adopted. The study applies a multivariate GARCH-model to the money market rates of six members of the European Union (EU) that have not adopted the common currency. It finds that the central banks of Sweden, Romania, and Poland would not lose considerable de-facto independence by adopting the euro. Their daily money market rates co-move strongly with the euro money market rates, which is a sign of already low monetary policy dependence despite floating exchange rates. This result confirms other research with co-integration techniques, although the coefficients of co-movement with the euro money market are lower in the present study. Lower coefficients can be explained by the impact of non-mean reverting money market rates after heavy shocks in turbulent market periods, which slacken the co-movement ties. The opposite results were obtained for the central banks of the UK, the Czech Republic and Hungary. Hungary is a problematic case: notwithstanding a low co-movement of money market rates with the euro market rates, the almost explosive volatility of money market rates after a shock signals a very poor effectiveness of monetary policy.","[Gabrisch, Hubert] Wiesbaden Inst Law & Econ, Lerchenweg 14, D-65232 Taunusstein, Germany",,"Gabrisch, H (通讯作者)，Wiesbaden Inst Law & Econ, Lerchenweg 14, D-65232 Taunusstein, Germany.",gab@antec-kabel.de,,"Gabrisch, Hubert/0000-0001-8825-4600",,,,,23,1,1,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,AUG,2017,44.0,3,,,,,567,584,,10.1007/s10663-016-9337-3,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FC2FA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000406651500009,0

Unlike previous studies, we provide a more concise comparative analysis by focusing on different classes of commodities for a large sample, including 5 developed and 3 emerging regions and covering 46 countries. We apply different parametric and non-parametric econometric tests. Our study provides two interesting findings. First, we show that commodity markets are informationally inefficient in the short term. Our portfolio simulations highlight that commodities might provide good investment opportunities, but those opportunities vary according to commodity class and regions. Second, we show that most commodity markets become informationally efficient in the long term, thereby reducing investors' interest for the duration. Thus, commodity markets might be used to hedge investor's portfolios, particularly for speculators and chartists in the short term, while these investments might not be appealing in these markets in the long term.","[Jawadi, Fredj; Hdia, Mouna] Univ Evry, 2 Rue Facteur Cheval, F-91025 Evry, France; [Jawadi, Fredj; Hdia, Mouna] EconomiX Univ Evry, 2 Rue Facteur Cheval, F-91025 Evry, France; [Ftiti, Zied] EDC Paris Business Sch, OCRE Lab, 70 Galeries Des Damiers,La Def 1, F-92415 Paris, France",Universite Paris Saclay,"Ftiti, Z (通讯作者)，EDC Paris Business Sch, OCRE Lab, 70 Galeries Des Damiers,La Def 1, F-92415 Paris, France.",fredj.jawadi@univ-evry.fr; Zied.Ftiti@edcparis.edu,"Ftiti, Zied/J-6533-2019; HDIA, Mouna/GZL-8660-2022","Ftiti, Zied/0000-0002-6216-1104; JAWADI, Fredj/0000-0003-3655-8391",,,,,32,11,12,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

We show that the (residual-based) bootstrap consistently estimates the limiting distributions of interest under these asymptotic frameworks. Interestingly, such bootstrap validity holds even if the bootstrap cannot mimic well certain important properties in the model. In addition, the studied bootstrap procedures are easy to implement in practice because they do not require an a priori choice between the conventional asymptotics and the many/many weak instrument asymptotics. Monte Carlo simulation shows that the bootstrap techniques provide a more reliable method to approximate the null distribution of the J and AR test statistics under many/many weak instruments.

What were the causes behind this ubiquitous mathematisation of economic science? Recent scholarship places excessive emphasis on the role and prestige of mathematics as a scientific tool. In this paper we argue this is inadequate, not least because it fails to account for the whole classical era when mathematical economists failed to have any impact. Explaining this failure is one of the main aims of this paper. Most accounts focus mostly on the intellectual factors involved failing to do justice to what amounts to a multifaceted and complicated phenomenon involving social, economic, political, intellectual, normative and institutional factors.

Second, we analyse how the distribution of frequency and severity varies depending on the modelling approach and examine how they are projected into SCR estimates according to the Solvency II Directive. In addition, we show that neglecting of large claims is as consequential as neglecting the heterogeneity of claim frequency. The claim frequency and severity are managed using generalized linear models, that is, negative-binomial and gamma regression. However, the different individual probabilities of large claims are represented by the binomial model and the large claim severity is managed using generalized Pareto distribution.

We find that stronger anti-corruption efforts make firms more likely to acquire external funds, mainly the long-term debt. Moreover, we show that firms located in provinces with stronger anti-corruption efforts invest significantly more of their newly acquired funds in R&D and generate more patents. Further empirical tests suggest this positive and statistically significant effect almost comes entirely from the current massive anticorruption campaign launched by President Xi Jinping since 2013. We further test two mechanisms regarding the corruption-innovation nexus: the expropriation hypothesis and the rent-seeking hypothesis. The results show that only firms without political connections, non-state owned enterprises (non-SOEs), firms operating in non-regulated industries and younger firms benefit from the stronger anti-corruption efforts, all supportive of the former mechanism.

In a study of US art museums, I find that this practice has grown significantly in recent years, and it represents the largest source of permanent capital in the industry. When donor restrictions are strong, museums shift their cost structures away from administration and toward program services, and they exhibit very high savings rates, retaining in their endowments 45 cents of each incremental dollar donated. Retention rates are near zero for cash generated from other activities. Restricted donations appear to stabilize nonprofits and significantly influence their activities, but they reduce management flexibility and may contribute to lower profit margins. Rising donor governance in US art museums may represent a reaction by contributors to the industry's high rates of financial distress, weak boards of trustees, and large private benefits of control enjoyed by managers.","[Yermack, David] NYU, Stern Sch Business, Dept Finance, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Yermack, David] Natl Bur Econ Res, New York, NY 10003 USA",New York University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Yermack, D (通讯作者)，NYU, Stern Sch Business, Dept Finance, New York, NY 10003 USA.;Yermack, D (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, New York, NY 10003 USA.",dyermack@stern.nyu.edu,,,,,,,31,16,22,1,40,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

We study the licensing incentives of an independent input producer owning a patented product innovation which allows the downstream firms to improve the quality of their final goods. We consider two-part tariff contracts for both outside and incumbent innovators. We find that the incumbent innovator has always the incentive to license its innovation to the rival firm so that under vertical integration complete technology diffusion takes place. In contrast, the external patent holder may prefer exclusive licensing depending on the innovation size as well as on the set of allowed contracts. As a result vertical integration does not entail innovation foreclosure, rather it facilitates innovation diffusion with respect to vertical separation. As for the profitability, the vertical integration with either downstream firm is always privately profitable and it is welfare improving for large innovations: this implies that not all profitable mergers should be rejected.","[Filippini, Luigi] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Largo Gemelli 1, Milan, Italy; [Vergari, Cecilia] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, Bologna, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; University of Bologna,"Vergari, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, Bologna, Italy.",luigi.filippini@unicatt.it; cecilia.vergari@unibo.it,,"FILIPPINI, Luigi/0000-0002-8099-0774",,,,,41,5,5,4,28,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The paper provides a number of contributions to the innovation literature: first, it adds to the revived debate on demand-pull perspectives in innovation studies by examining demand-related (lack of) incentives to invest in innovation. Second, it complements the literature on barriers to innovation by focusing on demand-related obstacles rather than the more frequently explored financial barriers. Third, it analyses whether experiencing demand barriers is a sector-specific feature. Firms active in high-or low-tech manufacturing or in knowledge-intensive or low-tech services might be more or less dependent on demand conditions when deciding to perform R&D. We find that uncertain demand and lack of demand are perceived as two quite distinct barriers. While the perception of a lack of demand has a marked negative impact not only on the amount of investment in R&D but also the likelihood of firms to engage in R&D activities, demand uncertainty seems, on the contrary, to represent an incentive to spend more in R&D, although only in low-tech sectors. We interpret this evidence in terms of the specific phase of the innovation cycle in which decisions to invest in R&D are taken. Sectoral affiliation seems to be playing a role only for demand uncertainty, supporting the conjecture that positive expectations on the presence of adequate market demand are a necessary condition to invest in R&D.","[Garcia-Quevedo, Jose] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ, Barcelona, Spain; [Garcia-Quevedo, Jose; Pellegrino, Gabriele] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona Inst Econ, Barcelona, Spain; [Pellegrino, Gabriele] World Intellectual Property Org, Econ & Stat Div, Geneva, Switzerland; [Pellegrino, Gabriele] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Coll Management Technol, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Savona, Maria] Univ Lille, Sci Policy Res Unit, Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Savona, Maria] Univ Lille, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Villeneuve Dascq, France",University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Universite de Lille; Universite de Lille,"Savona, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Sci Policy Res Unit, Jubilee Bldg, Brighton BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England.",M.Savona@sussex.ac.uk,"Garcia-Quevedo, Jose/AAG-9597-2019","Garcia-Quevedo, Jose/0000-0001-8078-1203",European Union [649186]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Education [ECO2010-16934]; Generalitat of Catalonia [2014SGR420],European Union(European Union (EU)); Spanish Ministry of Science and Education(Spanish Government); Generalitat of Catalonia,"Department of Economics and Barcelona Institute of Economics, University of Barcelona, Barcelona (JG-Q); World Intellectual Property Organization, Economics and Statistics Division, Geneva (GP); EPFL, College of Management of Technology, Lausanne (GP); Barcelona Institute of Economics, University of Barcelona, Barcelona (GP); and SPRU, Science Policy Research Unit, and Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences, University of Lille, France (MS).

This paper suggests an alternative way forward, based on the GARCH approach, which allows conditional covariance matrices of unlimited size to be constructed.

Consumers with low degree (few friends) have incentives to adopt early, while consumers with high degree have incentives to free ride. The seller can induce high degree consumers to adopt early by offering referral incentives-rewards to early adopters whose friends buy in the second period. Referral incentives thus lead to a 'double-threshold strategy' by which low and high-degree agents adopt the product early while middle degree agents wait.

The large-scale agreement of two vastly different models gives confidence that the conclusions on Polish data are robust to varying many of the underlying economic and econometric assumptions, and not likely just a modeling artifact.

But the marginal external cost is often difficult to estimate. This is especially the case when it comes to climate change; estimates of the social cost of carbon (SCC) range from around $10 per metric ton to well over $200 per metric ton, and there has been little or no movement toward a consensus number. Partly as a result, rather than an SCC-based carbon tax, climate policy has focused on a set of targets that would put limits on temperature increases or atmospheric CO2 concentrations, which in turn imply targets for emission reductions. Economics, however, can tell us little about whether such targets are socially optimal. I discuss the trade-off between taxes versus targets as the focus of policy, explain why it has been so difficult to estimate a marginal SCC, and suggest an approach to estimating an average SCC through the use of expert elicitation. I argue that such an approach could serve as the basis for a harmonized carbon tax.","[Pindyck, Robert S.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Pindyck, RS (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,,,,,,33,23,24,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,JUL,2017,84.0,335,,,,,345,364,,10.1111/ecca.12243,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EW9FM,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402822200001,0

Both effects are studied for a small open economy affected by climate change. We find that setting an export revenue tax rate to fall over time at the marginal social cost of depletion due to lower productivity from climate change encourages a resource exporter to leave an optimal stock in the ground unextracted and unburnable. Growing prices during the past decade similarly curb depletion. Falling prices bring forward extraction. Because production is independent of consumption, the marginal social cost is independent of utility parameters which are difficult to estimate. Slowing fossil fuel extraction and the effective export of emissions is a contemporary challenge for climate policy. Our findings identify both why an export revenue tax should decline over time and an estimable target rate of decline to help meet this challenge amid changing world prices.","[Day, Creina] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Day, Garth] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University; Australian National University,"Day, C (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",creina.day@anu.edu.au; garth.day@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,17,48,53,2,22,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

We extend this literature by assessing which personal traits may lead to changes in decisions. Specifically, we investigate how risk preferences and self-monitoring are related to decision changes in the Stag Hunt game under different levels of responsibility. As expected, we find that risk-averse individuals, tend to make riskier choices less often than risk-loving individuals do in a series of economic games. Having responsibility for another player in the Stag Hunt seems to amplify risk attitudes as risk-averse individuals are more likely to make cautious choices and risk loving participants are more likely to make risky choices with responsibility than without it. High self-monitors are more likely to switch their strategy than low self-monitors when faced with responsibility over another's outcomes, and when they change strategies they tend to change in a manner consistent with their own preferences for risk.

As smoking is a major problem of public health, lowering the extent of smoking is one of the conditions for developing a healthy society. Based on the research revealing that the pairing of the product with negative stimuli enhances the possibility of negative reaction to the product as negative stimulus transfers it's meaning to the product, tobacco packaging was labelled with negative smoking-related pictures illustrating the danger of smoking. Nevertheless, the extent of smoking is still large in many countries. Hence, the effect of negative smoking-related pictures has been the subject of intense debate within the scientific community. Purpose of the article: The aim of this research is to determine the effect of negative smoking-related pictures on the both implicit and explicit attitude toward smoking. Methods: For the purpose of determining the effect of negative smoking-related pictures on the both implicit and explicit attitude toward smoking, Implicit Association Test and questionnaire survey were provided. The questionnaire was elaborated based on the analysis and synthesis of scientific literature. Findings & Value added: The theoretical analysis substantiated the influence of attitude toward the product on consumer purchase decisions. Nevertheless, people do not always want to reveal their opinion, hence traditional marketing research methods for measuring explicit attitude are not sufficient as they are often not objective. Therefore, neuromarketing research methods complement traditional marketing research methods by providing more objectivity. Consequently, the Implicit Association Test and traditional questionnaire research are applied for the empirical research, revealing the effect of negative smoking-related pictures on the both implicit and explicit attitude toward smoking. The recommendations for the usage of negative smoking-related pictures on purpose to influence attitude toward smoking and consumer purchase behaviour are substantiated.","[Grigaliunaite, Viktorija; Pileliene, Lina] Vytautas Magnus Univ, Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Grigaliunaite, V (通讯作者)，Vytautas Magnus Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Mkt, S Daukanto St 28, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania.",viktorija.grigaliunaite@vdu.lt,"Pileliene, Lina/B-3293-2014; Pileliene, Lina/AAP-2315-2020; Grigaliūnaitė, Viktorija/GXG-1429-2022","Pileliene, Lina/0000-0003-2704-8314; Pileliene, Lina/0000-0003-2704-8314; Grigaliūnaitė, Viktorija/0000-0001-8340-2993",,,,,15,6,6,4,27,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

Our results show that, the stronger individual preferences, the harder to achieve consensus in choices. However, in cases where the payoff ratio is less extreme, full coordination (consensus) is always an equilibrium.

Prior to the estimation of the metafrontier function, it is generally suggested to conduct a likelihood-ratio (LR) test to test if all group frontiers are the same. In this short note, we point out that although the null hypothesis of the suggested LR test restricts all frontiers to be the same for all groups, the heterogeneity in the error distribution may exist and should be considered.

A prevalent problem is scarcity of empirical evidence informative about how interventions affect illness. Randomized trials, which have been important to evaluation of treatments for noninfectious diseases, are less informative about treatment of communicable diseases because they do not fully reveal the indirect preventive (herd immunity) effect of vaccination on persons who are not vaccinated or are unsuccessfully vaccinated. This paper studies the decision problem faced by a health planner who observes the illness rate that occurs when persons make decentralized vaccination choices and who contemplates whether to mandate vaccination. The planner's objective is to minimize the social cost of illness and vaccination. Uncertainty about the magnitude of the indirect effect of vaccination implies uncertainty about the illness rate that a mandate would yield. I first study a simple representative-agent setting and derive conditions under which the planner can determine whether mandating vaccination is optimal. When optimal policy is indeterminate, I juxtapose several criteria for decision making-expected utility, minimax, and minimax-regret- and compare the policies they generate. I then extend the analysis to a more general setting in which members of the populationmay have heterogenous attributes. I have benefitted from the opportunity to present this work in seminars at the Booth School of Business, University of Chicago, the Department of Economics, University of California at Santa Barbara, and the Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics, University of Southern California.

The persistence of the unemployment disparity in China has prevented the aggregate unemployment rate from decreasing even when the country's GDP was growing at 10 percent per year. Unemployment rates rose and unemployment disparities widened in other transition economies too, but what made China's disparities wider than those in other transition economies is the existence of a large subsistence sector, where unemployment exists only in a disguised form. This study explains the wide unemployment disparity in China with the geographically uneven distribution of the three sectors: the state sector, which suffers from a steep rise of unemployment during transition; the capitalist sector, which absorbs labor from the subsistence sector and grows rapidly; and the subsistence sector, which supplies its redundant labor to the capitalist sector. The study also presents a case study of Fuxin City, which has experienced an extremely high unemployment rate due to the reform of its main industry. Fuxin's case is presented as a microcosm of the problems that give rise to unemployment disparities, such as massive layoffs in the state sector, lack of labor mobility in the unemployment-stricken regions, and inadequate development of the capitalist sector.","[Marukawa, Tomoo] Univ Tokyo, Inst Social Sci, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Marukawa, T (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Inst Social Sci, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",marukawa@iss.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,"National Institutes for the Humanities (NIHU); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H01849, 16H02004] Funding Source: KAKEN","National Institutes for the Humanities (NIHU); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This study was supported by a grant-in-aid from the National Institutes for the Humanities (NIHU) Contemporary Chinese Area Studies Program.

A span-of-control model is embedded into a search and matching environment. A cut to the tax on profits in isolation improves job creation and reduces before-tax income inequality. The impact of a budget-balancing increase in the wage tax depends on the bargaining power of firms. When it is high, firms pick up the lion's share of the tax burden. The tax acts like a barrier to entry: it benefits large firms at the expense of marginal ones. Net effects are an increase in unemployment and before-tax income dispersion. Low firm bargaining power means workers pick up more of the tax burden. It acts like a subsidy to entrepreneurship reinforcing the impact of the profit tax reduction.

This paper examines the extent and robustness of the relationship between trade intensity and business cycle synchronization for nine East Asian countries in the period 1965-2008. Unlike previous studies which assume away the region's concurrent connection with the rest of the world, in our regressions we control for both the US effect and the exchange rate co-movement in the region. We find that the coefficient estimates for intra-industry trade intensity remain robust and significant even after controlling for the US effect and the exchange rate co-movement.

To assess causality, I use a bivariate discrete-time hazard model with shared frailty and exploit over time and cross-country variation in early retirement legislation. Overall, the results indicate a positive and significant influence of paternal retirement on the probability of first nest-leaving of children residing in Southern European countries, for both sons and daughters. Focusing on Southern Europe, I find that the increase in children's nest-leaving around the time of paternal retirement does not appear to be justified by changes in parental resources. Rather, channels involving the supply of informal child care provided by grandparents or the quality of the home should be the focus of study.","[Stella, Luca] Univ Wuppertal, Wuppertal, Germany; [Stella, Luca] IZA, Wuppertal, Germany; [Stella, Luca] Schumpeter Sch Business & Econ, Rainer Gruenter Str 21, D-42119 Wuppertal, Germany",University of Wuppertal; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Stella, L (通讯作者)，Univ Wuppertal, Wuppertal, Germany.;Stella, L (通讯作者)，IZA, Wuppertal, Germany.;Stella, L (通讯作者)，Schumpeter Sch Business & Econ, Rainer Gruenter Str 21, D-42119 Wuppertal, Germany.",Stella@wiwi.uni-wuppertal.de,,,,,,,43,5,5,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

This study examines managerial sources of operational efficiency or inefficiency on 855 large commercial rooftop PV power systems in California by examining both scale efficiency and Returns to Scale (RTS). For the research purpose, this study utilizes Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) as a methodology to assess the scale measures. A difficulty in applying DEA to the performance analysis of PV power systems is that it contains uncontrollable variables such as ambient temperature and solar irradiation, all of which are influenced by weather. It is also widely known that PV power systems cannot produce electricity during night, so being unable to serve as a base load. Thus, these uncontrollable factors often influence the performance of PV power systems. Paying attention to the effects of those uncontrollable factors, this study discusses how to measure scale efficiency and RTS within the framework of DEA. Then, as an application of the proposed approach, this study examines the performance of large commercial rooftop PV power systems in California. This study finds that they belong to increasing (48), constant (807) and decreasing (0) RTS, implying that most of the PV power systems in California have been operating in their appropriate sizes. This further indicates that the operational inefficiency of PV power systems is due to managerial inappropriateness, not their sizes for generation. Thus, there is a space to improve operational efficiency of rooftop PV systems under constant RTS, through managerial efforts such as increase in transmission capacity and operational flexibility to improve solar penetration, and routine maintenance to minimize detrimental effects of dust deposition.

We show that fixed fee emerges as the equilibrium licensing scheme when both the transfer of his technology is relatively efficient and the licensee is sufficiently cost competitive in the domestic market, and that royalty licensing prevails otherwise.

The survey's expectational series on business operational forecasts across the period 1990 to 2010 is inconsistent with Muth's concept of rational expectations. Although strict rationality failed to be evidenced, weakly rational conduct can be observed in capital expenditure forecasts. Nevertheless, both operational variables in question are optimistically biased upward and neither of them can accurately reflect the true market perception. This evidence casts doubt on the usefulness of the investigated survey series in providing a realistic panorama of the construction sector in the near future. Notwithstanding, the irrational upshot may drop a hint to the reader on the root of alarming property overhang and price hikes in construction-related markets since expectations play a foremost role in providing equilibrium in the supply and demand in this growth-initiating market.","[Puah, Chin-Hong; Wong, Shirly Siew-Ling] Univ Malaysia Sarawak, Fac Econ & Business, Sarawak, Malaysia; [Habibullah, Muzafar Shah] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fact Econ & Management, Serdang, Malaysia",University of Malaysia Sarawak; Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Puah, CH (通讯作者)，Univ Malaysia Sarawak, Fac Econ & Business, Sarawak, Malaysia.",chpuah@unmias.my,"Puah, Chin-Hong/O-9658-2018","Habibullah, Muzafar Shah/0000-0002-2853-8019","Centre for Business, Economics and Finance Forecasting (BEFfore) in Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS) [03(TD04)/1054/2013(02)]","Centre for Business, Economics and Finance Forecasting (BEFfore) in Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS)","Financial support from the Centre for Business, Economics and Finance Forecasting (BEFfore) in Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS) via top-down research grant: 03(TD04)/1054/2013(02) is gratefully acknowledged.

Evolutionary finance is defined by Minsky as the process through which changes in effective demand, uncertainty and cash flows trigger solvency and liquidity risk that increase financial fragility and the possibility of financial instability and debt deflation. Emphasis is placed on the role of Ponzi position making operations and failed margins of safety in inducing low-quality leverage and liability structures. Evolutionary central banking is defined by Minsky as the process that central banks use by applying qualitative monetary policy through discount window procedures and lender-of-last-resort interventions to target Ponzi leverage structures and financial stability. Evolutionary central banking provides operational guidelines and objectives that help us understand the monetary policies adopted by central banks after the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2008, as well as the limitations of the non-conventional monetary policies.","[Argitis, Giorgos] Univ Athens, Athens, Greece",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens,"Argitis, G (通讯作者)，Univ Athens, Dept Econ, 1 Sofokleous & Aristidou St, Athens 10559, Greece.",gargeitis@econ.uoa.gr,,,European Union [266800],European Union(European Union (EU)),National and Kapodistrian University of Athens.

It can be concluded that the market behaves strategically, but an inflation bias does not emerge from data. The source of non-credibility cannot be the bank's lack of commitment, but it may be a partial inability to control or to communicate economic shocks.

Their unilateral incentives to invest in maintaining underused units, such as dispatchable gas-fired plants, are underrated by plant profitability indicators. From a policy perspective, decentralized strategic investment incentives reduce the possible need for centralized security of supply measures.

We apply the method to the problems of managing unemployment allowances (in the context of macroeconomic fluctuations) and catastrophic risks (in the context of climate change). The method guarantees ex post fairness and pays attention to individuals' risk attitudes, while ensuring rationality properties for social preferences, revisiting basic ideas from Harsanyi's celebrated aggregation theorem (Harsanyi, 1955). The social preferences that we obtain do not always take the form of an expected utility criterion, but they always satisfy statewise dominance. When we require social preferences to be expected utilities, we obtain a variant of Harsanyi's result under a weak version of the Pareto principle, and a maximin criterion under a stronger Pareto requirement, whenever the ex post social ordering does not depend on people's risk attitudes.

Thus, it becomes important to understand the factors conducive to teamwork. In this paper, we analyze the relationship between teamwork and the firm organizational design, with a particular emphasis on the decentralization of decision rights. We develop a simple model allowing for different organizational structures, according to whether or not production and firm strategic decisions are delegated. We find that overall delegation of decision making is positively associated with teamwork. However, when we distinguish between delegation of firm strategic decisions and delegation of production decisions, we obtain that it is just the delegation of firm strategic decisions that induces teamwork. We test the model predictions on a unique dataset of Spanish small and medium size firms that contains information on worker self-reported importance of teamwork. The empirical analysis also corroborates previous findings in the literature regarding the positive relation between cooperation and pay incentives. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Simulation results highlight the interplay and varying importance of these channels at increasing blend mandate levels. In addition, we establish how RIN prices are formed: The value of a RIN in equilibrium is shown to reflect the marginal cost of compensating the blender for employing one additional ethanol-equivalent unit of biofuel. This contrasts with existing research equating the price of RINs to the gap between ethanol supply and demand evaluated at the mandate level. We demonstrate the importance of this distinction in case of binding demand side infrastructure constraints such as the ethanol blend wall: as percentage blend mandates increase, the market for low-ethanol blends may contract in order to reduce the overall compliance base. This has important implications for implied ethanol demand in the economy. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The effects of these policies are analysed with a simulation model first separately and then jointly to assess possible complementarities. We reach several results. First, we confirm that capability building and firms' learning are important drivers of catch-up. Second, we find that when a large technological discontinuity takes place, entry support favours catch-up while protectionism has the opposite effect. Protectionism favours catch-up only when no technological discontinuity opens up. Third, we find that depending on the technological conditions, different policy complementarities exist; therefore, different policy mixes should be at the base of a country catch-up strategy. These results add to the previous literature on public policy and catching up by developing countries in an industry by distinguishing the different effects of various types of public policy and relating them to the technological conditions that are present in an industry.","[Malerba, Franco] Bocconi Univ, ICRIOS, Milan, Italy; [Malerba, Franco] Univ Parma, Parma, Italy",Bocconi University; University of Parma,"Malerba, F (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, ICRIOS, Milan, Italy.",franco.malerba@-unibocconi.it,,,,,,,76,27,29,1,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The data provided here show that only about a quarter of imports are potentially subject to trade diversion from new agreements (i.e. they come from countries outside of regional trading blocs and in industries with positive most-favored nation tariffs). Since this percentage is steadily declining with the increasing number of regional trade agreements and the falling level of tariffs, trade diversion is becoming increasingly irrelevant as a concern for new trade deals. The paper also estimates how each potential new bilateral free trade agreement would affect a country's imports and exports, as well as whether the increased imports would replace domestic production, imports from other RTA partners, or imports from non-RTA partners. In this way, the estimates are able to shed light on which countries make the best partners for new regional trade agreements. Finally, the paper provides estimates of the trade effects for two large potential new regional agreements: the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.","[Magee, Christopher S.

Innovative stochastic models are used to generate synthetic time series for the random variables water inflow, wind speed, solar irradiance, temperature of the photovoltaic panel, and average generation capacity of the Mechanism for Reallocation of Energy. The simulation is implemented using the Monte Carlo method associated with a Cholesky decomposition. An economic approach is presented taking into account taxation and financing, as well as the Markowitz Portfolio theory. The results show that the initial correlation between the energy resources is altered by the cash flow model and mainly by the debt. In the diversification process, the complementarity between sources helps to reduce the economic risk. The increase in debt increases the correlation, decreases the return and risk and, consequently, affects the diversification process and economic results.

It highlights that the ubiquitous rationalities of failure, be it of markets, governments or systems, are rooted in a peculiar habit of accepting hypothetical perfect states as normative benchmarks. In contrast, a dynamic logic of intervention should start from the question, what the system aims to accomplish. Combining the structuralist ontology of micro-, meso-and macro with the functional principles of evolutionary change, the paper proposes a general typology of economic policies based on their respective contributions to the system's ability to evolve.","[Peneder, Michael] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Vienna, Austria",,"Peneder, M (通讯作者)，Austrian Inst Econ Res, Arsenal Obj 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",Michael.Peneder@wifo.ac.at,,,,,,,122,30,30,1,67,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Due to their substantial temporal and spatial aggregation, IAMs cannot explicitly represent all detailed challenges of integrating the variable renewable energies (VRE) wind and solar in power systems, but rather rely on parameterized modeling approaches. In the ADVANCE project, six international modeling teams have developed new approaches to improve the representation of power sector dynamics and VRE integration in IAMs. In this study, we qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the last years' modeling progress and study the impact of VRE integration modeling on VRE deployment in IAM scenarios. For a comprehensive and transparent qualitative evaluation, we first develop a framework of 18 features of power sector dynamics and VRE integration. We then apply this framework to the newly-developed modeling approaches to derive a detailed map of strengths and limitations of the different approaches. For the quantitative evaluation, we compare the IAMs to the detailed hourly-resolution power sector model REMIX. We find that the new modeling approaches manage to represent a large number of features of the power sector, and the numerical results are in reasonable agreement with those derived from the detailed power sector model. Updating the power sector representation and the cost and resources of wind and solar substantially increased wind and solar shares across models: Under a carbon price of 30$/tCO(2) in 2020 (increasing by 5% per year), the model-average cost-minimizing VRE share over the period 2050-2100 is 62% of electricity generation, 24%-points higher than with the old model version.

In this paper we ask whether bottom-up institutions that rely on voluntary and anonymous reports of bribe demands, such as the I paid a bribe website first launched in India in 2010, could act as effective anti-corruption tools, and, if this is the case, whether and how their effectiveness could be improved. We overcome measurement and identification problems by addressing our research questions in the laboratory. Our results show that the presence of a reporting platform like the I paid a bribe website may be insufficient to systematically lower bribery. A more effective platform is one where posts disclose specific information about the size of the bribes and the location of their requestors, i.e., a platform that could serve as a search engine for the least corrupt officials, especially if posting is restricted to service recipients. Our results also show that while citizens rarely post false information, lying by officials, when allowed to post on the platform, is widespread. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We show that optimism is a natural explanation for why some new issues are underpriced and others overpriced. We also show that the impact of optimism on entrepreneurs' equity holdings depends on the number of optimists, absolute risk aversion, and cash flow variance. Optimism makes entrepreneurs worse off. In contrast, optimism can make outside investors better off when entrepreneurs signal firm value by retaining shares and underpricing.","Univ Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland; Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy",University of Lausanne; Bocconi University,"Santos-Pinto, L (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, Fac Business & Econ, Internef 535, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",LuisPedro.SantosPinto@unil.ch,"Pinto, Luis Santos/AAS-3514-2021",,,,,,40,1,1,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-6598,1468-2354,,INT ECON REV,Int.

These incentives are present when the agent is tempted to either overstate or understate his private information depending upon the specific realization of his type. These problems were first analyzed by Lewis and Sappington (1989) and have been characterized and extended by Maggi and Rodriguez-Clare (1995a) and Jullien (2000). In this paper we propose a simple method of characterizing countervailing incentives in which the key element is the analysis of the properties of the full information problem. Our method for solving the principal problem, once identified the presence of countervailing incentives, follows closely the Baron's (1989) approach, which does not require using optimal control theory. The methodology we present can be easily applied to many different economic settings. For example, in health economics, an insurer (or a hospital manager) might act as a principal and a physician as an agent. In labor settings, an employer may play the role of principal and a worker may act as the agent. In regulated industries, the regulatory agency might act as a principal designing incentive schemes for firms (the agents). In environmental regulation or resource exploitation, the principal might be an international agency dealing with national governments or firms.","[Aguirre, Inaki; Beitia, Arantza] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Lejona, Vizcaya, Spain",University of Basque Country,"Aguirre, I (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ 1, Avda Lehendakari Aguirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain.;Aguirre, I (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Bridge Grp, Avda Lehendakari Aguirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain.",inaki.aguirre@ehu.es; arantza.beitia@ehu.es,"Aguirre, Iñaki/H-4611-2015; Beitia, Arantza/AAA-1247-2019","Aguirre, Iñaki/0000-0001-9544-4373; BEITIA RUIZ DE MENDAROZQUETA, MARIA ARANZAZU/0000-0001-6829-391X",,,,,25,7,7,1,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

This suggests at first sight a tendency to slow down in private consumption. This tendency has to be reconsidered taking into account the fact that Engel curves usually shift significantly over time. We introduce the notion of intertemporal propensity to consume to shed more light on the drivers and patterns of the evolution of Engel curves. Using this notion, we are able to identify and measure the direction of the expansion path of consumption as time goes by, while controlling for household characteristics and price levels. Using German household data, we show that, over time, the intertemporal propensity to consume systematically offsets the consumption paths implied by the marginal propensity to consume that is derived cross-sectionally at one point in time. We claim that this difference between marginal and intertemporal propensity to consume should be ascribed to variations in the socioeconomic structures that occur over time and that may be linked both to the supply side (innovation and technical change) and the demand side (learning dynamics of consumers). We also show that changes in relative prices play a minor role in the evolution of Engel curves.","[Bruns, Stephan B.] Univ Kassel, Meta Res Econ Grp, Nora Platiel Str 5, D-34109 Kassel, Germany; [Moneta, Alessio] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, Piazza Martiri Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy",Universitat Kassel; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"Moneta, A (通讯作者)，Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, Piazza Martiri Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy.",bruns@uni-kassel.de; amoneta@sssup.it,,"MONETA, Alessio/0000-0003-4786-9507",,,,,30,3,3,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Studies of firm entry usually focus on the impact of regulation on economic outcomes within an industry, thereby neglecting its impact on neighboring industries. Using changes in regulation in the Spanish local TV station industry, we estimate the impact of TV entry on the movie theater industry between 1993 and 2005. Our findings show that local TV entry decreased the number of theaters and screens in a province, as well as movie attendance and box office revenues.

(2005) to develop a methodology that distinguishes information unknown to the econometrician but forecastable by the agent from information unknown to both, at each point in an agent's lifecycle. Predictable variability and uncertainty have different implications in terms of welfare, especially when markets are incomplete. We apply our procedure in the context of an incomplete markets lifecycle model of consumption, labor supply, and schooling decisions, when borrowing limits arise from repayment constraints. Using microdata on earnings, hours worked, schooling choices, and consumption of white males in the US, we infer the agent's information set. We then estimate the model using the identified agent's information set. We find that 52% and 56% of the variance of college and high school log wages respectively are predictable by the agent at the time schooling choices are made. When we complete the market, college attendance increases from 48% to 59%, about half of this increase is due to uncertainty, and the other half because of the borrowing limits. To illustrate the importance of assumptions about what is forecastable by the agent, we simulate a minimum wage insurance policy under different assumptions about the information available to the agents in the model. When we allow for asymmetric information between the insurance institution and the individual, adverse selection turns profits negative. Consumer welfare, however, increases by about 28% when we give individuals access to their estimated information set regardless of asymmetries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We introduce a simple model of human capital production in which investments and time allocation differ by age. Using data on test scores and schooling from rural India, we show that higher wages increase human capital investment in early life (in utero to age 2) but decrease human capital from age 5 to 16. Children switch out of school into productive work when rainfall is higher. The opportunity cost of schooling, even for fairly young children, is an important factor in determining overall human capital investment.","[Shah, Manisha] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Shah, Manisha] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Steinberg, Bryce Millett] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; National Bureau of Economic Research; Brown University,"Shah, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.;Shah, M (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,40,143,172,2,40,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-3808,1537-534X,,J POLIT ECON,J.

Using the Dubin-McFadden two-step estimation method, the results show that women are more likely than men to engage in non-farm self-employment but earn significantly less than men employed in the non-farm sector. Non-farm wage employment is a common choice among more educated individuals in landless households, while farm wage employment seems to be the only source of employment for uneducated landless people. Participation in non-farm work is more likely in areas located near medium-sized cities with dynamic economies. Finally, there are regional differences in employment patterns which appear to be associated with both the availability and the quality of land. This information is relevant in relation both to rural population growth and to the continuous process of land fragmentation in rural Ecuador.","[Vasco, Cristian] Cent Univ Ecuador, Fac Agr Sci, Quito, Ecuador; [Natalie Tamayo, Grace] Indoamer Technol Univ, Fac Management & Econ Sci, Ambato, Ecuador",Universidad Central del Ecuador,"Vasco, C (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Ecuador, Fac Agr Sci, Quito, Ecuador.",clvasco@uce.edu.ec; grace.tamayo@indoamerica.edu.ec,"Vasco, Cristian/AAK-6842-2020",,,,,,33,5,5,0,4,COMISION ECONOMICA PARA AMERICA LATINA Y EL CARIBE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 179-D, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0251-2920,1684-0348,,CEPAL REV,Cepal Rev.,APR,2017,,121,,,,,53,67,,,,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FE9AI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408496200003,0

Firms can price discriminate based on perfect data on consumer addresses and (possibly) imperfect data on consumer flexibility. We show that firms' location choices depend on how strongly consumers differ in flexibility. Precisely, when consumers are relatively homogeneous, equilibrium locations are socially optimal regardless of the quality of customer flexibility data. However, when consumers are relatively differentiated, firms make socially optimal location choices only when customer flexibility data becomes perfect. These results are driven by the optimal strategy of a firm on its turf, monopolization or market-sharing, which in turn depends on consumer heterogeneity in flexibility. Our analysis is motivated by the availability of customer data, which allows firms to practice third-degree price discrimination based on both consumer characteristics relevant in spatial competition, addresses and transport cost parameters.","[Baye, Irina; Hasnas, Irina] Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, DICE, Dusseldorf, Germany",Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf,"Baye, I (通讯作者)，Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, DICE, Dusseldorf, Germany.",baye@dice.uni-duesseldorf.de; hasnas@dice.uni-duesseldorf.de,,,,,,,22,2,3,3,25,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

However, after ensuring common support on observables via propensity score matching and controlling for unmeasured family level heterogeneity common to siblings via family fixed effects, the estimated associations become much smaller and are statistically indistinguishable from zero.

Subjects of our experiment bid consistently with the leading equilibrium notions, but exhibit significant overbidding relative to the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) outcome favored as an equilibrium selection in the literature. The observed bidding behavior is well explained by a model that explicitly accounts for the strategic uncertainty facing a bidder, which suggests strategic uncertainty as a source of the observed departure from the VCG outcome. Meanwhile, the observed bidding behavior in static environment approximates those of dynamic environments for important cases. Our finding thus provides some empirical support for the use of a static game as a valid modeling proxy, but calls into question the prevailing equilibrium selection. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Each establishment may have a different probability of hiring an individual from the minority group. We define segregation indices as inequality indices on these unobserved, random probabilities. Because these probabilities are measured with error by proportions, standard estimators are inconsistent. We model this problem as a nonparametric binomial mixture. Under this testable assumption and conditions satisfied by standard segregation indices, such indices are partially identified and sharp bounds can be easily obtained by an optimization over a low dimensional space. We also develop bootstrap confidence intervals and a test of the binomial mixture model. Finally, we apply our method to measure the segregation of foreigners in small French firms.","[D'Haultfoeuille, Xavier] CREST, Lab Microeconometrie, Paris, France; [Rathelot, Roland] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"D'Haultfoeuille, X (通讯作者)，CREST, Lab Microeconometrie, Paris, France.",xavier.dhaultfoeuille@ensae.fr; r.rathelot@warwick.ac.uk,,"Rathelot, Roland/0000-0001-5694-0112",[ANR-10-EQPX-17]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: UKRI,; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We would like to thank the editor, two anonymous referees, Romain Aeberhardt, Mathias Andre, Christian Bontemps, Clement de Chaisemartin, Laurent Davezies, Guy Laroque, Adam Rosen, and the participants of the ESEM in Oslo and the 21st EC2 conference in Toulouse, as well as seminars at Crest, INSEE, and Lausanne.

Belarus has followed an original path; it has, much more than Russia, preserved the USSR's legal legacy. While claiming to be a market economy, it has maintained major restrictions on private property rights over the land. The combination, under the law, of a market orientation with the Soviet legal tradition is in line with the proclaimed determination to modernize the country and develop private property while contributing to the nation's economic development. In fact, this claim by government authorities stems from two rhetorical sources: modernity (since property rights are formally recognized) and progress (since property rights are established for the purpose of a state-run economic development).","[Flavier, Hugo] Univ Bordeaux, Droit Publ, Bordeaux, France",Universite de Bordeaux,"Flavier, H (通讯作者)，Univ Bordeaux, Droit Publ, Bordeaux, France.",hugo.flavier@gmail.com,,"Flavier, Hugo/0000-0001-9082-3040",,,,,34,0,0,0,3,NECPLUS,PARIS,"16, RUE CLAUDE TILLIER, PARIS, 75012, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

In post-transition economies such approach is a threat for energy security and local and regional economic development. Nowadays, coal mining survival in Central-East Europe is additionally threatened by accumulative global risk factors, especially by price differentiation and shale gas revolution in United States of America. Revealed circumstances require deepen research and diagnosis in the area of risk and corporate management in mining enterprises in Central- East Europe. Purpose of the article: The main aim of the article is to assess industrial risk in coal mining in Central-East Europe. The research is divided into three parts. In the first one the situation of coal mining in Central-East Europe is characterized. It is the basis for selection of the countries for the detailed analysis. In the second part the industrial risk factors are assessed and described. Finally, in the third part their influence on financial results in the examined mining enterprises is evaluated. In the summary the international comparison is made and general assumptions for risk and corporate management are formulated. Methods: In the article a risk checklist is used to identify the economic and industrial risk factors. To determine their influence on financial results on the first stage of research Pearson's coefficients are used. Than regression functions are developed. The data are collected on the basis of public statistics and financial statements of the examined mining enterprises. Findings & Value added: On the basis of research results it may be stated that there are only a few countries in Europe in which mining enterprises still operate as separate economic units and all of them have experienced serious financial troubles in the last years. Risk intensification contributed mostly to revenues reduction and negative financial results.","[Jonek-Kowalska, Izabela] Silesian Tech Univ, Zabrze, Poland",Silesian University of Technology,"Jonek-Kowalska, I (通讯作者)，Silesian Tech Univ, Fac Org & Management, Ul Roosevelta 26, PL-41800 Zabrze, Poland.",izabela.jonek-kowalska@polsl.pl,,,,,,,31,13,13,0,13,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

Our analysis focusses on a subset of the parameter space where several attractors coexist. Applying a semi-numerical approach based on the stochastic sensitivity function and confidence domains due to Milstein and Ryashko (1995), we study random transitions between stable attractors in the context of the Goodwin-type economy embedded in an uncertain environment. Relying on a mix of analytical considerations and simulations we demonstrate that under weak noise levels regime switching is a prominent feature in the presence of low saving rates. Moreover, we explain how increased uncertainty can induce an essentially unpredictable income process out of an apparently stable high-income level situation. All dynamic phenomena are explained in terms of key concepts constituting the stochastic sensitivity function method. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

It is therefore crucial to ensure that the data are of the highest quality and international comparability. This paper is aimed at identifying unexpected developments in income levels, income mobility, and inequality in the EU-SILC data between 2005 and 2009. We examine the consistency of EU-SILC by comparing cross-sectional results with findings based on two-year longitudinal samples. Although the data represent similar populations, for several countries the results of this comparison differ widely. One important outcome is the high degree of variability over time in countries that obtain their income information from register data. This suggests methodological challenges in the clear designation of new subsample members, in the reweighting of the data, in imputation of missing values, and in other areas.","[Krell, Kristina] Univ Bielefeld, Gesis Leibniz Inst Social Sci, Bielefeld, Germany; [Frick, Joachim R.; Grabka, Markus M.] DIW Berlin, SOEP, Berlin, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Sozialwissenschaften (GESIS); University of Bielefeld; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Krell, K (通讯作者)，Univ Bielefeld, Dept Sociol, POB 10 01 31, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany.",kristina.krell@uni-bielefeld.de,,,,,,,41,14,15,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

The EKC concept is usually used with per capita Gross Domestic Product as the explanatory variable. As others, we find mixed evidence, at best, of such a pattern for CO2 emissions with respect to per capita GDP. We also show that the share of manufacture in GDP and governance/institutions play a significant role in the CO2 emissions-income relationship. As GDP presents shortcomings in representing income, development in a broad perspective or human wellbeing, it is then replaced by the World Bank's Adjusted Net Savings (ANS, also known as Genuine Savings). Using the ANS as an explanatory variable, we show that the EKC is generally empirically supported for CO2 emissions.

Before learning his production cost, the agent knows his probability of having a low cost his ex ante type and decides whether to pay an entry fee to contract with the principal. There are two cut-off equilibria that determine the possible types of an agent who actually enters the market, and neither equilibrium can be discarded by standard selection criteria. Contrasting with standard intuition, in the equilibrium with the highest cut-off an increase in the entry fee reduces the marginal type of the agent who enters, thus increasing entry and the expected cost of an entrant. This equilibrium is selected by a criterion based on robustness to equilibrium risk, even though the equilibrium with the lowest cut-off is Pareto dominant for the agent. Public policies that increase entry barriers may be welfare improving. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

It highlights some early movements in Sraffa's position on classical economics and then a major shift in his position on Ricardo in the 'Introduction' to Ricardo's Principles in 1951. It brings forward archival evidence to suggest that Sraffa's new interpretation of Ricardo was perhaps influenced by his attempt to prove his 'Hypothesis' that the output/capital ratio of a given economic system remains constant with respect to changes in the rate of profits. This hypothesis as such, however, had nothing to do with Ricardo's problem of the 'invariable measure of value'. The paper concludes by pointing out that as early as 1927-28, Sraffa had set himself a task of constructing a homogenous understanding of classical economics in terms of modern terminology that would be helpful in understanding their scope from the point of view of his own theoretical project. Our story told here fits well with the task Sraffa had set himself at the beginning of his project.","[Sinha, Ajit] Azim Premji Univ, PES Inst Technol Campus,Hosur Rd, Bangalore 560100, Karnataka, India",PES University,"Sinha, A (通讯作者)，Azim Premji Univ, PES Inst Technol Campus,Hosur Rd, Bangalore 560100, Karnataka, India.",Sinha_a99@yahoo.com,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

In response to this need, a variety of social orders has emerged with differing institutional, political and economic characteristics. One of these social orders is the limited access order that was prevalent in most of history and still is nowadays. Taking the conceptual framework of North et al. as a starting point, we make three advances to their analysis of limited access orders. First, we analyse the incentive structure of actors involved, using a formal model of the main interactions in a limited access order. Second, we decompose organizations into two types and analyse their respective roles. Third, we use insights from historical research to scrutinize the chronology of the rise of organizations. Jointly, this allows us to refine and substantiate the insights gained by North et al., highlight the role of organizations and place the start of relevant developments earlier in time.","[Van Bavel, Bas; Ansink, Erik; Van Besouw, Bram] Univ Utrecht, Econ & Social Hist, Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Van Bavel, B (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Econ & Social Hist, Utrecht, Netherlands.",b.j.p.vanbavel@uu.nl; j.h.ansink@uu.nl; b.vanbesouw@uu.nl,"Ansink, Erik/N-1613-2019; van Bavel, Bert/K-1377-2015","Ansink, Erik/0000-0003-4094-2468;",European Research Council (ERC) [339647],European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We thank Maarten Prak, Jip van Besouw, Mark Sanders and the participants of the Economic and Social History seminar at Utrecht University for their comments on an earlier version of this paper.

Type-complementarity rules out all but the rank-ordered grouping. Type-substitutability (for example, matching to share risk) rules out much less. It requires that every two groups must be intertwined, in that each dominates the other at some rank. Intertwined matching is necessary and, in one context, sufficient for any grouping to be a potential equilibrium. But there are many intertwined matching patterns when n > 2. Thus, substitutability can be observationally similar to complementarity; we demonstrate this by showing that dyadic regressions can register intertwined (negative assortative) matching as homogeneous matching.

As productivity is the determinant factor for long-term economic growth and the PRC watches soaring labor cost while no serious unemployment recently, this article tries to understand its slowdown from the supply side. Based on provincial panel data, it first identifies the determinants of productivity growth and then uses counterfactual analysis to simulate effects of the PRC's policy-induced investment boom on its economic growth. It finds that economic openness enhances productivity, whereas economies at higher stages of development on average have lower productivity growth. Second, productivity of economies accumulating more stock of inventory grows more slowly, while the opposite is observed for those with higher labor involvement rates. Third, government size and investment rate both have significantly negative effects on productivity growth. Finally, the diminishing late-mover advantage and the growth in investment rate are both major contributors to the current decline in the PRC's productivity growth. The current economic slowdown does not seem to be a cyclical downturn. Indeed, further reforms are needed to stabilize the PRC's growth.","[Bai, Chong-En] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qiong] Renmin Univ China, Sch Publ Adm & Policy, Inst Social Secur, Beijing, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; Renmin University of China,"Zhang, Q (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Publ Adm & Policy, Inst Social Secur, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhangqiong8@ruc.edu.cn,,,Natural Social Science Foundation of China [10zd007]; Natural Science Foundation of China [71573291],Natural Social Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Natural Social Science Foundation of China research fund [grant number 10zd& the Natural Science Foundation of China research fund [grant number 71573291].,,44,10,10,3,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Consider the case of the European Central Bank (ECB) Securities Markets Programme: If Eurosystem interventions were triggered by sudden and strong price deteriorations, looking at daily price changes may bias downward the correlation between yields and the amounts of bonds purchased. Simple regressions of daily changes in yields on quantities often give insignificant or even positive coefficients and therefore suggest that Securities Markets Programme (SMP) interventions have been ineffective, or worse counterproductive. We use high-frequency data on purchases of the ECB Securities Markets Programme and sovereign bond quotes to address the simultaneity and endogeneity issues.

The third RCT tested a program with partially overlapping components carried out in the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC), which reduced readmission rates to the facility by 21%. These large behavioral responses combined with modest program costs imply benefit-cost ratios for these interventions from 5-to-1 up to 30-to-1 or more. Our data on mechanisms are not ideal, but we find no positive evidence that these effects are due to changes in emotional intelligence or social skills, self-control or grit, or a generic mentoring effect. We find suggestive support for the hypothesis that the programs work by helping youth slow down and reflect on whether their automatic thoughts and behaviors are well suited to the situation they are in, or whether the situation could be construed differently.","[Heller, Sara B.] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Pennsylvania; University of Chicago; Northwestern University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University,"Heller, SB (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",,,"Mullainathan, Sendhil/0000-0001-8508-4052","University of Chicago's Office of the Provost, Center for Health Administration Studies; School of Social Service Administration, the city of Chicago; Chicago Public Schools; Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development of the National Institutes of Health [R21-HD061757, P01-HD076816]; CDC [5U01CE001949-02]; Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice [2012-JU-FX-0019]; Laura and John Arnold Foundation; Chicago Community Trust; Edna McConnell Clark Foundation; Crown Family; Exelon corporation; Joyce Foundation; J-PAL; Reva and David Logan Foundation; John D. and Catherine T.

These differences then cause disagreements in inflation expectations and eventually have a significant effect on households' asset allocation and consumption decisions. The asset allocation model in this paper explains how inflation experiences affect household investment and consumption through corresponding inflation expectations, which are characterized by long-term expected inflation, the impact coefficient of the expected inflation and the correlation between expected inflation and the risky return. Using China's economic data, the empirical results show that significant differences in inflation expectation arise from income gap, regional inequality, different inflation measures and economic sector spending differences. Using the estimated coefficients, the calibration results have policy implications that households need more financing channels to resist inflation, especially in rural areas and in the raw material sector.","[Li, Shaoyu; Xu, Zhiwei] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Secur & Futures, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Wei, Lijia] Wuhan Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Xu, Zhiwei] Rutgers State Univ, Rutgers Business Sch Newark & New Brunswick, New Brunswick, NJ USA",Wuhan University; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University Newark; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Wei, LJ (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",ljwei.whu@gmail.com,"li, xiao/GSN-6181-2022","Wei, Lijia/0000-0002-5032-0788","National Natural Science Foundation of China [NSFC71301131, NSFC71403192]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research is supported by research grants NSFC71301131 and NSFC71403192 from National Natural Science Foundation of China.,,36,9,9,4,31,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Based on firm level balanced panel data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) Prowess database, we assess the differential impact of this policy on the performance of food and agrobased versus non-food and non-agro based firms as well as on large versus small firms, while controlling for firm and industry specific characteristics. By using a semi parametric Difference in Difference model we find that the EXIM policy had a positive effect on firm level productivity and profitability in the case of non-food and non-agro based firms which experienced significant trade liberalization while food and agro-based firms, which remained relatively protected, exhibited stagnant and weak performance. We also find that trade liberalization mainly benefited large as opposed to Small and Medium sized firms. We conclude that continued trade protection has hurt certain Indian manufacturing industries and that alongside trade liberalization, complementary policies that address structural and other constraints faced by certain groups of firms, also need to be implemented.","[Mukherjee, Subhadip] IFHE Univ, IBS Hyderabad, Hyderabad, Telangana, India; [Chanda, Rupa] IIM Bangalore, Bengaluru, India",The ICFAI Foundation for Higher Education (IFHE); ICFAI Business School (IBS); Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Bangalore,"Chanda, R (通讯作者)，IIM Bangalore, Bengaluru, India.",subhadip.mukherjee@ibsindia.org; rupa@iimb.ernet.in,"Mukherjee, Subhadip/AAP-8795-2020","Mukherjee, Subhadip/0000-0002-7540-8989",,,,,41,10,10,1,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

However, little is established about the relation between globalization and domestic growth in the temporary workforce. This study examines that relationship. It investigates whether the initiation of foreign direct investment (FDI) into Asia increased temporary workers' share of total wages and employment. This study employs a first-differenced difference-in-difference estimation with propensity score matching to examine how the initiation of FDI among Japanese manufacturers during 2003-2004 affected domestic employment. Firm-level data cover the period following the 2004 deregulation, which accelerated increases in the number of temporary workers by allowing manufacturers to employ such workers indirectly through employment agencies. Positive effects of vertical FDI are observed on the temporary worker ratio one year after starting FDI, but vanish in subsequent years. Therefore, this study concludes that the relationship between temporary workers and offshoring is complementary in the early stage of FDI and that no persistent effect of offshoring occurs that results in greater income inequality and greater job insecurity through an increase in the number of temporary workers.

We focus on the external imbalances and especially on the lower limit of -4% imposed on the current account deficit to GDP ratio. Using a 2 region, 2 sector New Keynesian DSGE model and Woodford's technique to operationalise inequality constraints, we demonstrate that it is possible to accordingly adjust monetary and fiscal policy. The utility based welfare loss remains very limited as compared to optimum unconstrained policy, as measured for Poland on the basis of Bayesian estimation, and this result is robust over a wide range of parameter values. The cost is slightly lower i.a. when (i) the monetary policy is autonomous (outside the euro area), (ii) for non converging economies, (iii) when the limit is relaxed by incorporating positive capital account to GDP ratio. The procedure also envisages lower limits on REER and ULC dynamics, but the latter can be in conflict with the CA constraint, especially in the monetary union. Therefore, the scoreboard based evaluation of external imbalances while not very costly has definitely some room for fine-tuning in the course of future MIP reforms.","[Toroj, Andrzej] Warsaw Sch Econ, Inst Econometr, Ul Madalinskiego 6-8, PL-02513 Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Torój, A (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Inst Econometr, Ul Madalinskiego 6-8, PL-02513 Warsaw, Poland.",andrzej.toroj@sgh.waw.pl,,"Toroj, Andrzej/0000-0003-3623-168X",Ministry of Science in Poland [KAE/BMN14/06/15],Ministry of Science in Poland,The paper has been prepared thanks to the research grant KAE/BMN14/06/15 funded by the Ministry of Science in Poland.,,53,2,2,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

We observe that unwinding the cross-shareholding between banks and corporations and mutual transfers among non-financial institutions allows for efficiency gain.

Supporting the risk management use of derivative instruments, the study finds that the usage of derivative instruments significantly minimizes firm's risk, with respect to operating cash flow variability in both Pakistan and Malaysia, although the extent of risk reduction is higher in Malaysian firms. While considering variability in earning per share as a firm's risk, the findings imply that Pakistani firm's earning per share variability is irrelevant for firm's derivative usage, whereas Malaysian firms are able to minimize such volatility by using derivative instruments. The results show the insignificant effect regarding the relationship of derivative usage with firm's value of Malaysian corporations, indicating that as Malaysia has developed capital market and firms are more geographically diversified in comparison to Pakistan, thus their value relevance of derivative usage are limited. While in the case of Pakistan, the use of derivative instruments significantly enhances firm's value.","[Alam, Atia] COMSATS Inst Informat Technol, Lahore, Pakistan; [Afza, Talat] Govt Sadiq Coll Women Univ Bahalwalpur, Bahalwalpur, Pakistan",COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI),"Alam, A (通讯作者)，COMSATS Inst Informat Technol, Lahore, Pakistan.",,"Alam, Atia/JHU-9507-2023","Alam, Atia/0000-0002-2144-735X",,,,,63,1,2,0,12,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

Theoretically, one of the reasons is Islamic banks operate in poor contracting environments where equity financing is very risky.

We find no evidence that contracting environments do, which means debt-like instruments will continue dominating Islamic banks' assets in the near future.","[Alam, Nafis; Parinduri, Rasyad A.] Univ Nottingham Malaysia Campus, Nottingham Univ Business Sch, Jalan Broga, Semenyih, Malaysia",University of Nottingham Malaysia,"Parinduri, RA (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham Malaysia Campus, Nottingham Univ Business Sch, Jalan Broga, Semenyih, Malaysia.",rasyad.parinduri@nottingham.edu.my,"Alam, Nafis/AAG-5557-2021; Parinduri, Rasyad A./E-9684-2011; Alam, Nafis/AAN-6699-2021","Alam, Nafis/0000-0002-7096-3692; Parinduri, Rasyad A./0000-0001-7540-8906; Alam, Nafis/0000-0002-7096-3692",,,,,9,10,10,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We try to assess the level of transparency and to determine if there are any factors that systematically influence corporate behaviour in this regard. Using a sample of 145 companies from Croatia, Macedonia, Slovenia and Serbia, we apply Standard & Poor's (S&P) methodology for assessment of transparency and disclosure levels and find that the companies in these countries generally lag in terms of transparency behind their peers worldwide as measured one decade ago. Additionally, using the same sample, we apply a regression analysis and conclude that the level of transparency is positively related to the size of the company and the need for external financing, but negatively to the concentration of ownership and we also observe important country effects. We do not find a statistically significant relationship between transparency and profitability and relate this finding with the prevailing attitude of the companies towards the stock market. Having in mind the different scores by country and by area of disclosure, we believe that there is still scope for improvement using proper advising and public policy measures.","[Arsov, Sasho; Bucevska, Vesna] Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ, Fac Econ, Skopje, Macedonia",Saints Cyril & Methodius University of Skopje; Institute of Economics Skopje,"Arsov, S (通讯作者)，Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ, Fac Econ, Skopje, Macedonia.",sarsov@eccf.ukim.edu.mk,,"Arsov, Sasho/0000-0002-8149-1504; Bucevska, Vesna/0000-0002-4411-4953",,,,,43,20,23,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

In order to estimate the productivity spillovers from FDI at the regional level, we select 10 industrial clusters across 4 regions in India. In estimating productivity, we control for a possible simultaneity bias by using semi-parametric estimation techniques. We find that local firms benefit from horizontal and vertical FDI, but the benefits from the latter are found to be substantially stronger. The absorptive capacity of domestic firms is highly relevant to harvest the spilled technology from foreign-owned firms. Furthermore, we find that domestic firms belonging to high-technology industries benefit more from FDI at the regional level. We also find that market concentration is a crucial conduit for firm innovation, technological upgradation, and having a direct effect on local firm total factor productivity.","[Behera, Smruti Ranjan] Indian Inst Technol Ropar, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Nangal Rd, Rupnagar 140001, Punjab, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Ropar,"Behera, SR (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol Ropar, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Nangal Rd, Rupnagar 140001, Punjab, India.",smrutibehera2003@gmail.com,,,,,,,57,7,7,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

We use the social capital lens to study this issue and on this basis build our discussion around two types of trust: particularised (PST) and generalised (GST) social trust. Trust and corruption are first discussed in both theoretical and empirical terms from the Czech experience before exposing them to the corruption-trust relationship model. The information about the Czech Republic has been obtained from data published by Transparency International (TI), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the World Values Survey (WVS) and the Polity IV project (CSP, 2014). The data suggest that the Czech experience is similar to that of other countries. However, the proportion between PST and GST seems to bear some importance in its explanatory value of corruption levels. Different types of corruption also have positive effect on PST and negative effect on GST. We conclude this paper by proposing directions for further research and their implications for the study of social capital in the Czech Republic.","[Benesova, Hana; Anchor, John] Univ Huddersfield, Huddersfield Business Sch, Dept Management, Queensgate, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England",University of Huddersfield,"Benesová, H (通讯作者)，Univ Huddersfield, Huddersfield Business Sch, Dept Management, Queensgate, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England.",h.benesova@hud.ac.uk,"Anchor, John/AFM-0328-2022","Anchor, John/0000-0003-2885-9450",,,,,19,0,0,0,4,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-349-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,420,430,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6CS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000426486500047,0

Economics often pictures this phenomenon as a case of signalling: individuals engage in the volunteer programming of open-source software (OSS) as a labour-market signal resulting in a wage premium. Yet, this explanation could so far not be empirically tested. This article fills this gap by estimating an upper-bound composite wage premium of voluntary OSS contributions and by separating the potential signalling effect of OSS engagement from other effects. Although some 70% of OSS contributors believe that OSS involvement benefits their careers, we find no actual labour-market premium for OSS engagement. The presence of other motives, such as fun of play or altruism, renders OSS contributions too noisy to function as a signal.","[Bitzer, Juergen] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ, Oldenburg, Germany; [Geishecker, Ingo] European Univ Viadrina, Fac Business Adm & Econ, Frankfurt, Oder, Germany; [Schroeder, Philipp J.

It intends to help unify the behavioral foundations of these two strands of thought by returning to the original views of their main historical inspirations. It thus proposes a comparative analysis of the theory of human behavior developed by Thorstein Veblen and Herbert Simon, respectively. The article notably discusses how Simon's early work links together the notions of habit, rationality, and the decision-making process, and explores the extent to which his views are consistent with, complementary to, or divergent from Veblen's. The article highlights several commonalities between Simon and Veblen's views on habits. However, Simon departs from Veblen in developing a dual model of human behavior which clearly differentiates habit-based from decision-based behaviors. The article argues that neo-Schumpeterian evolutionary economists should go beyond this binary model and build on the pragmatist-Veblenian approach, in which these two dimensions are intimately entangled. This process could allow the economists in question to take advantage of the most valuable insights of institutional economics regarding the interactions between individual choices and habits and institutions.","[Brette, Olivier] Univ Lyon, INSA, Econ, Lyon, France; [Brette, Olivier] CNRS, UMR 5206, Res Unit TRIANGLE, Lyon, France; [Lazaric, Nathalie] Univ Cote Azur, CNRS, GREDEG, Nice, France; [Lazaric, Nathalie] EAEPE, Bremen, Germany; [da Silva, Victor Vieira] Lycee Edouard Herriot Lyon, Econ & Sociol, Lyon, France",Institut National des Sciences Appliquees de Lyon - INSA Lyon; Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Institut National de Recherche sur les Transports et leur Securite (INRETS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; Universite Paris-VIII; Universite Paul-Valery; CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Cote d'Azur,"Brette, O (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon, INSA, Econ, Lyon, France.;Brette, O (通讯作者)，CNRS, UMR 5206, Res Unit TRIANGLE, Lyon, France.",,"Brette, olivier/HNR-7906-2023","Brette, olivier/0000-0003-4779-7486",,,,,72,8,11,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

The positive effect survives when we control for social capital accumulation, investor protection, and market liberalization.

We find lower levels of mobility compared to previous studies, with a new estimate of the father-son intergenerational earnings elasticity of 0.32. Our analysis also shows that the father-daughter elasticity is much less sensitive to these biases. We investigate whether improved measures of father/child permanent earnings may have a distinct impact on the estimated intergenerational persistence at different parts of the distribution. Taking advantage of exceptionally high sample sizes, we find that the impact of lifecycle bias is more pronounced at the top of the income distribution. We also document that much of the average intergenerational income persistence in Canada can be accounted for by limited mobility at the top, while mobility is significantly higher among children born to low-income fathers.

Workers who find a job that is a good match for their functional limitations (i.e. a job where their limitations have little or no impact on important job functions) should expect better employment outcomes (e.g. higher wages, longer job tenure) than workers with similar disabilities who are mismatched in their jobs. Merging data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation with O*Net data on job demands, we construct two continuous measures of job mismatch for workers with physical disabilities. We then extend the literature on disability and employment by exploring relationships between duration of disability, job mismatch, wages and hours worked. The results indicate that workers with long durations of disability are employed in jobs that are a better match to their physical limitations than are similar workers with shorter durations of disability. And, workers who are mismatched earn lower wages and work fewer hours than their counterparts whose jobs are a better match. Overall, the findings suggest that disability employment policies should include systematic efforts to help workers with disabilities find good job matches.","[Choe, Chung] Hanyang Univ, Dept Econ, Ansan, South Korea; [Baldwin, Marjorie L.] Arizona State Univ, Dept Econ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Hanyang University; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Choe, C (通讯作者)，Hanyang Univ, Dept Econ, Ansan, South Korea.",choechung@hanyang.ac.kr,"Choe, Chung/L-6921-2013","Choe, Chung/0000-0002-5173-9644",Hanyang University [HY-2014-00000002195],Hanyang University,This work was supported by the Hanyang University [HY-2014-00000002195].,,26,11,13,1,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The results indicate substantial increases in shareholder returns occur around the time of announcements of government approval for projects, the finalization of feasibility studies and changes in the status of projects such as when a company decides to finally commit to invest in a project.

The literature on coopetition characterizes these relationships mostly in the context of the benefits achieved; however, coopetition is fraught with threats arising mainly from both the coexistence and interaction of streams of cooperation and competition between competitors. Research on a sample of 235 companies operating in the high technology sector (HT) in Poland has shown that there is a number of risks accompanying coopetition. The most common amongst them are the low efficiency of activities and goals pursued (statistically significant for all the activities of the value chain as areas of cooperation). The areas of coopetition that are most exposed to risk are sales and distribution, logistics and finance (nine out of 12 risks analysed). Due to the similarity of the frequency of occurrence of particular threats to coopetition, and using the method of cluster analysis, four groups of value chain areas with similar risks have been identified. The first such group is finance and marketing, the second is sales and production, the third is human resources and logistics, and finally the fourth is information technology, purchasing inputs and R&D. When selecting the area of competitive cooperation corresponding to the individual clusters of the value chain activities, one may expect the occurrence of similar threats to coopetition. The research findings allow interested parties to predict threats to coopetition when choosing specific areas of cooperation and thus an extension to cooperation between competitors which will not increase the quantity of these threats.","[Cygler, Joanna] Warsaw Sch Econ, 162 Niepodleglosci Ave, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland; [Sroka, Wlodzimierz] Univ Dabrowa Gornicza, 1c Cieplaka St, PL-41300 Dabrowa Gornicza, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Cygler, J (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, 162 Niepodleglosci Ave, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland.",cygler@sgh.waw.pl; wsroka@wsb.edu.pl,"Sroka, Włodzimierz/I-1805-2013","Sroka, Włodzimierz/0000-0002-8701-0716",,,,,73,34,34,2,34,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Evidence is based on panel Poisson models drawing on two investment monitors at the individual project level. Greenfield investments (GI) and mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are distinguished. The findings indicate that market size and bilateral trade are the main factors for Chinese investment in the EU. In contrast, business-friendly institutions do not foster FDI. Probably, Chinese investors are risk averse, and prefer regions with less competitive markets. The striking difference between GIs and M&As is related to unit labour costs. Higher costs make the host country less attractive for the establishment of new firms, but do not affect the involvement in existing firms. The sectoral dispersion of Chinese FDI in the EU did not change much since the global financial crisis. Most relevant shifts have occurred in research and development (R&D), where low-income EU countries have become increasingly attractive.","[Dreger, Christian] DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Schueler-Zhou, Yun; Schueller, Margot] GIGA Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Dreger, C (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany.",cdreger@diw.de,"Dreger, Christian/AAF-6719-2020",,,,,,30,20,24,0,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The paper deals with corporate entrepreneurship in mature organisations. The theoretical model of CE, including innovations, strategic objectives and potential for growth, is described in the article. It is different from common approaches to CE in the field by attributing characteristics frequently used in CE research to institutional factors of CE. Three institutional factors and their relations with CE are analysed: managers' attitudes toward entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial culture and institutional support systems. Medium and large sized Lithuanian mature organisations have been researched in regard to CE and its factors using the random sampling method and online survey. The results have shown that Lithuanian mature organisations reveal a high level of CE; however, innovations are at the lowest level in comparison with the other two characteristics of CE. Managers' attitudes toward entrepreneurship, enfrepreneurial culture and institutional support systems positively correlate with CE, but the strength of correlation is different. The results have disclosed the importance of managers' attitudes toward entrepreneurship to institutional support systems and enfrepreneurial culture as well as the importance of managers' attitudes toward enfrepreneurship to CE through the moderating effect of institutional support systems and entrepreneurial culture.","[Duobiene, Jurga] Kaunas Univ Technol, Gedimino St 50, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Duobiene, J (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Gedimino St 50, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",jurga.duobiene@ktu.lt,,,,,,,105,0,0,0,19,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Analysis focuses on the fiscal and external disequilibrium associated with the fiscal treatment of the copper price and the adoption of a free exchange rate since 1999. Subsequently, the focus is on the macroeconomic situation in 2013 and five sources of accumulated disequilibria that suggested a high probability of significant deceleration of the economy. The article ends with a discussion of the actual deceleration in more recent years, converging with the negative average outcome of the region, and concludes that worsening economic performance has been associated mainly with the shift from the coherent countercyclical policies of the 1990s to the procyclical opening of the capital account, liberalization of the exchange rate, and adoption of sharp inflation targeting overcoming other relevant macroeconomic targets since then.","[Ffrench-Davis, Ricardo] Univ Chile, Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Ffrench-Davis, Ricardo] Cent Bank Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Ffrench-Davis, Ricardo] Comis Econ Amer Latina & Carib, Santiago, Chile; [Ffrench-Davis, Ricardo] CIEPLAN, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile; Central Bank of Chile,"Ffrench-Davis, R (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Econ, Santiago, Chile.;Ffrench-Davis, R (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Chile, Santiago, Chile.;Ffrench-Davis, R (通讯作者)，Comis Econ Amer Latina & Carib, Santiago, Chile.;Ffrench-Davis, R (通讯作者)，CIEPLAN, Santiago, Chile.",,,,,,,,11,1,3,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

While such analyses have produced valuable insights they all share a common shortcoming; their theoretical models do not take into account the impact of savings on worker's decision to participate in the informal sector. The objective of this paper is to fill this important gap in the literature. To this end, I explore the impact of social security and severance payment policies on levels of informality in the labour market using a search and match model. The novelty of my model is that it allows workers to save. I find that high levels of social security payments, while protecting workers from being liquidity constrained, do increase levels of informality.

We consider the results on the impact of transaction costs on implied volatility and then use the utility maximization of a market-maker and its asymptotic solution. The FTT impact on volatility, in highly liquid equity option markets, is within two decimals ('the tick value') and is insignificant. The volatility impact is considerable for illiquid option markets especially long-dated equity options, used for the hedging of credit default swaps (CDS). The credit spread increase is computed using a structural model, and amounts between 30 and 60 basis points (b.p). per annum, for 520 year maturities, and a volatility level of 30%. The impact decreases with the corporation leverage ratio. We calibrate from the CDS market the implied volatility for six European corporations and find an increase in spreads by up to 60%. For a corporation with a 343 b.p. 5-year CDS spread, the increase amounts to 174 b.p. On the basis of this sample, the impact we find is between 5 and 20 times higher than the one computed in the study of Lendvai et al. which has been used by European Union authorities to assess the impact on the cost of capital.","[Fraichot, Jean Pierre] PSL Res Univ, Univ Paris Dauphine, LEDa, Pl Marechal Lattre de Tassigny, F-75775 Paris, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire dEconomie de Dauphine LEDa,"Fraichot, JP (通讯作者)，PSL Res Univ, Univ Paris Dauphine, LEDa, Pl Marechal Lattre de Tassigny, F-75775 Paris, France.",jean-pierre.fraichot@dauphine.fr,,,,,,,25,1,1,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In this review, we survey the economic literature on the health-retirement link in developed countries. We describe the mechanisms through which health affects labor supply and discuss how these mechanisms interact with public pensions and public health insurance. The historical evidence suggests that health is not the primary source of variation in retirement across countries and over time. Furthermore, the decline of health with age can only explain a small share of the decline in employment near retirement age. Health considerations nonetheless play an important role, especially in explaining cross-sectional variation in employment and other outcomes within countries. We review the mechanisms through which health affects retirement and discuss recent empirical analyses.","[French, Eric] UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1E 6BT, England; [French, Eric] Ctr Econ Policy Res, Washington, DC 20009 USA; [French, Eric] Inst Fis Studies, London EC1V 0DX, England; [Jones, John Bailey] Fed Reserve Bank Richmond, Res Dept, Richmond, VA 23261 USA; [Jones, John Bailey] SUNY Albany, Dept Econ, Albany, NY 12222 USA",University of London; University College London; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Richmond; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany,"French, E (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1E 6BT, England.;French, E (通讯作者)，Ctr Econ Policy Res, Washington, DC 20009 USA.;French, E (通讯作者)，Inst Fis Studies, London EC1V 0DX, England.",eric.french.econ@gmail.com; john.jones@rich.frb.org,,,"ESRC [ES/M010147/1, ES/P001831/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010147/1, ES/P001831/1] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,120,27,32,4,37,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4609-6,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

We focus on the accounting advantage of off-balance financing, which does not affect the typical accounting-based covenants especially important in bank-oriented countries. However, we also consider other economically based arguments. Using manually collected operating lease data for Spanish listed firms, we use the constructive capitalization method to measure as-if liabilities. The results confirm that not only size and industry affect the decision but that firms closer to breaching their covenants are also more inclined to choose operating leases. Consequently, it is argued that such firms will be more affected by the accounting change; indeed, the inclusion of liabilities in the balance sheet might tighten financial covenants in loan agreements as evidenced in the paper. Not surprisingly, firms are strongly opposed to the accounting change.","[Giner, Begona; Pardo, Francisca] Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Dept Accounting, Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia,"Giner, B (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Dept Accounting, Valencia, Spain.",begona.giner@uv.es,"GIner, Begona/Y-6806-2018","GIner, Begona/0000-0002-9958-9008; PARDO, FRANCISCA/0000-0002-1836-5775",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2013-48208-P],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),Financial contribution from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [Research project ECO2013-48208-P] is much appreciated.,,56,5,5,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Applying a holistic framework from the World Values Survey (WVS), we create individual measures of cultural values, and show that the self-expression values of this framework are positively associated with households' financial decisions. Examining the individual cultural values that make up the WVS model, we further show that happiness, trust, and playing an active role in society, are individually important determinants of household financial decision-making. Our study shows that cultural values can be brought from a generalized national level to the individual level in order to improve our understanding of household financial decision-making.","[Gogolin, Fabian] Queens Univ Belfast, Queens Management Sch, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Dowling, Michael] Rennes Sch Business, 2 Rue Robert Arbrissel, F-35065 Rennes, France; [Cummins, Mark] Dublin City Univ, DCU Business Sch, Dublin, Ireland",Queens University Belfast; Universite de Rennes; Dublin City University,"Dowling, M (通讯作者)，Rennes Sch Business, 2 Rue Robert Arbrissel, F-35065 Rennes, France.",michael.dowling@esc-rennes.com,"Vieira de Souza, M.Alexandre/CAH-8316-2022","Vieira de Souza, M.Alexandre/0000-0002-5626-5898; Cummins, Mark/0000-0002-3539-8843; Dowling, Michael/0000-0002-8093-9039",Business School of Dublin City University,Business School of Dublin City University,This work was supported by Business School of Dublin City University.,,51,7,8,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Based on symmetric causality tests, we find no causal effect of oil prices on the stock prices of the world market or any of the G7 countries. However, when we apply an asymmetric causality test, we find that increasing oil prices cause stock prices to rise in the world, the U.S. and Japan while decreasing oil prices cause stock prices to fall in Germany. This may imply that the world, the U.S. and Japanese stock markets consider increases in oil prices as an indicator of good news as this may mean that there is an increase in oil demand due to an expected growth in the economy while the German stock market treats decreasing oil prices as a signal of an expected contraction in the economy.","[Hatemi-J, Abdulnasser; Al Shayeb, Abdulrahman] UAE Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates; [Roca, Eduardo] Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Nathan, Qld, Australia",United Arab Emirates University; Griffith University,"Hatemi-J, A (通讯作者)，UAE Univ, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates.",AHatemi@uaeu.ac.ae,"Roca, Eduardo/JEO-3020-2023; Hatemi-J, Abdulnasser/AAC-3942-2019","Hatemi-J, Abdulnasser/0000-0002-6212-1292",UAE National Research Fund via the UAE University [31B028],UAE National Research Fund via the UAE University,This work was supported by The UAE National Research Fund via the UAE University: [Grant Number # 31B028].,,53,52,54,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The analysis is carried out in an extended version of the ECB's New Area-Wide Model, which contains various fiscal instruments. The results show that the size of fiscal multipliers depends heavily on the length of the period during which the interest rate is binding. Government consumption is the most efficient instrument of fiscal policy; the value of its multiplier is well above one and can even be double for a long time at the ZLB. The multiplier for consumption taxes is also influenced substantially by the interest rate constraint, but its value remains below one. The multipliers for social security contributions and labour income taxes are not influenced much. The behaviour of the government investment multiplier is quite tricky: an amplfying effect on output is present only when the economy stays at the zero lower bound for just a few years; when there is a longer time at the ZLB, this multiplier can even be negative.","[Hlousek, Miroslav] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Hlousek, M (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",hlousek@econ.muni.cz,"Hlousek, Miroslav/G-8508-2013",,"Norway Grants programme [CZ07, NF-CZ07-INP-3-1592014]; Masaryk University [MUNI/A/0943/2016]",Norway Grants programme; Masaryk University,"This research was supported by the Norway Grants programme CZ07, grant No.NF-CZ07-INP-3-1592014 and by specific research project No. MUNI/A/0943/2016 at Masaryk University.

Here, the main novelty is that we consider alternative asymptotics in which the bandwidth is kept fixed. This does not yield a consistent estimator of the long run variance, but, for the weakly dependent case, the studentized sample mean has a Student-t limit distribution, which, for any given bandwidth, appears to be more precise than the traditional Gaussian limit. When data are fractionally integrated, the fixed bandwidth limit distribution of the studentized mean is not standard, and we derive critical values for various bandwidths. By a Monte Carlo experiment of finite sample performance we find that this asymptotic result provides a better approximation than other proposals like the test statistic based on the Memory Autocorrelation Consistent (MAC) estimator of the variance of the sample mean.

However, the discussion lacks emphasis on industry conglomerates such as clusters. The research reviews different aspects of the cluster towards the application of industry 4.0 and its possible consequences, limitations and relations typical for clusters. It applies Porter's cluster mapping to determine the current cluster competitive advantages. Semistructured interviews with cluster management and survey among active cluster members determine relevant dimensions to measure the cluster preparedness for industry 4.0. The identified industry 4.0 aspects enhance the current cluster mapping with insights for the application of industry 4.0 in an industrial cluster.

By developing a general methodological framework, we show that, for the dynamics of the structure analysis, the appropriate model is a panel data with time specific fixed effects and with cross-section specific effects, weighted by the growth rate of total employment. To analyze the change in structures, the appropriate model is, likewise, a panel data, without time specific (fixed or random) effects, but with cross-section specific ones, weighted by total employment. We find that for Agriculture, forestry and fishery, Manufacturing and Accommodation and food services, the growth of FDI was associated with a decrease in industry share in total employment, both at global level, as well as regarding the private and public employment structures. This means that, for the industries concerned, the FDI effect on productivity improvement was superior to the effect induced on employment growth. For Mining, Electricity, Natural gas and water, Information technology and communications, Financial intermediation and insurance, Professional, scientific, technical and administrative activities and support services the effect is positive for the private sector and negative for the public one. For the remaining industries (Construction and real estate transactions, Trade, Transportation) the effects of FDI was rather positive than otherwise. Consequently, for those industries, the FDI effect on employment growth exceeds that on productivity.","[Jula, Dorin] Romanian Acad, Inst Econ Forecasting, Bucharest, Romania; [Jula, Dorin] Univ Bucharest, Ecol, Financial Management Fac, Bucharest, Romania; [Jula, Nicolae-Marius] Nicolae Titulescu Univ Bucharest, Fac Econ Sci, Bucharest, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences; University of Bucharest,"Jula, D (通讯作者)，Romanian Acad, Inst Econ Forecasting, Bucharest, Romania.;Jula, D (通讯作者)，Univ Bucharest, Ecol, Financial Management Fac, Bucharest, Romania.",dorinjula@yahoo.fr; mariusjula@yahoo.com,"JULA, Dorin/JKI-6633-2023; Jula, Nicolae Marius/A-9011-2012","Jula, Nicolae Marius/0000-0002-0389-165X",,,,,25,2,2,1,15,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

But increasing environmental cost of mega events has been highlighted recently, which affected local residents' actual perception. The inconsistence between governments propagandizing benefits from holding mega-events and citizens' real experience will decrease the real effect of the events. This paper demonstrates the inconsistence by Shanghai example, which is a support to the theory of mega-event impact on city. Shanghai 2010 World Expo officially aimed to improve the quality of life and building a harmonious society, while there are fewer studies focusing on whether the proposed vision is accepted by citizens. This paper explored the influences with a particular focus on residents' attitudinal survey after the event from December 2010 to February 2011 and 148 respondents were collected. Using structural equation model, the results illustrated that surveyed residents recognized more with 4 dimensions (culture, environment, economic and technology), which reflected the harmony between man and nature, as well as harmony between spiritual and material content. However, they did not perceive the upgrade of community cohesion, communication between urban and rural areas, and living condition after the mega-event. In conclusion, the residents form their preconceptions based on both individual experience and official vision. The whole concept of Shanghai Expo is not totally recognized by local residents. This mismatch is related to the existence of social challenges and the absence of a two-way communication. Shanghai branding should properly conceptualize and manage the city's core values with residents' participation in policy making process.","[Kangjuan, L., V; Wang, Mengyi; Zheng, Xiaosong; Sun, Yan] Shanghai Univ, SILC Business Sch, 20 Chengzhong Rd, Shanghai 201800, Peoples R China; [Mosoni, Gyula] Shanghai Univ, Sch Econ, 99 Shangda Rd, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shanghai University; Shanghai University,"Kangjuan, LV (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ, SILC Business Sch, 20 Chengzhong Rd, Shanghai 201800, Peoples R China.",lvkangjuan@shu.edu.cn; gyulamosoni@yahoo.com; wmy.1009@163.com; littlepine88@163.com; nancysun@shu.edu.cn,"Zheng, Xiaosong/AAN-7934-2021",,,,,,55,3,3,6,34,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

In this article, we find there is a difference. More specifically, using an event study we find larger abnormal returns for secured loan disclosures to lower quality borrowers when the lender is a finance company versus a bank. This suggests the market views finance companies as more effective than banks in evaluating/monitoring lower quality borrowers obtaining secured loans. We posit this is due to finance companies' greater expertise in this type of lending, resulting from specialization. Our findings extend the literature on how lender identity can influence signals about firm value from loan disclosures. Our results also support recent findings that positive abnormal returns to borrowing firms may not be a general feature across the loan population, but may be restricted to smaller, lower quality borrowers.

The quantitative research was held by means of questionnaires (N = 863) in 2017. The survey involved students from a large Russian region. During the quantitative study it was found that students' volunteering contributes to their professional self-actualization. Firstly, volunteering helps significantly develop such practices as communication skills and the ability to work as part of a team. Secondly, volunteering helps students get works much easier corresponding with professions they got after graduating from the higher school during studying at the university. The results of 12 in-depth interviews with students who have experience of participating in international volunteering projects abroad made it possible to confirm the acquired quantitative data and supplement them contensive.","[Kuzminchuk, Anna; Pevnaya, Maria] Ural Fed Univ, Mira St 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia",Ural Federal University,"Kuzminchuk, A (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, Mira St 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia.",a.a.kuzminchuk@urfu.ru; m.v.pevnaya@urfu.ru,"Pevnaya, Maria/AAA-6886-2019; Drozdova, Anna A/L-4435-2016","Pevnaya, Maria/0000-0003-3591-1181; Drozdova, Anna A/0000-0002-1599-8446",Russian Foundation for Humanities [16-03-00016],Russian Foundation for Humanities,The research is supported by the Russian Foundation for Humanities (Project No 16-03-00016).

The results indicate that guanxi with clients' has a negative influence on perceptions of auditor independence for Chinese auditors, but not for the U.S. auditors. According to our findings, both groups agree that imposing regulations/code has a positive influence on perceptions of auditor independence. Gender has no influence on the perceived independence of either group. After controlling for social desirability bias, our results remain robust. Sensitivity analysis further increases the robustness of the findings. Our results provide empirical support for public interest theory and pose implications for Western multinational companies contemplating doing business in the Chinese economy. This investigation is particularly relevant in the wake of the rise of China as a global power.

Using the Public Use Tax File data, the author finds that the ratios of dividends to long-term capital gains before the 2003 tax act significantly declined with household tax rate differentials between dividends and long-term capital gains, but such a negative tax effect on the ratios disappears afterwards. This seemingly tax-inefficient composition of dividends and long-term capital gains after the tax act arises from households' ability to reduce their tax burdens on stocks by exploiting the new preferential tax treatments on qualified dividends under JGTRRA. That is, households in the upper tax bracket hold significantly greater shares of qualified dividends relative to ordinary dividends after the tax act.","[Lee, Daeyong] Peking Univ, HSBC Business Sch, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Lee, D (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, HSBC Business Sch, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.",daeyong@phbs.pku.edu.cn,,"Lee, Daeyong/0000-0002-8247-9179",,,,,23,1,1,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

To our best knowledge, existing models in the literature for pricing and hedging VIX derivatives do not have these features. This paper fills this gap by developing a novel class of parsimonious pure jump models with such features for VIX based on the additive time change technique proposed in Li et al. (2016a, 2016b). We time change the 3/2 diffusion by a class of additive subordinators with infinite activity, yielding pure jump Markov semimartingales with infinite activity and infinite variation. These processes have time and state dependent jumps that are mean reverting and are able to capture stylized features of VIX. Our models take the initial term structure of VIX futures as input and are analytically tractable for pricing VIX futures and European options via eigenfunction expansions. Through calibration exercises, we show that our model is able to achieve excellent fit for the VIX implied volatility surface which typically exhibits very steep skews. Comparison to two other models in terms of calibration reveals that our model performs better both in-sample and out-of-sample. We explain the ability of our model to fit the volatility surface by evaluating the matching of moments implied from market VIX option prices. To hedge VIX options, we develop a dynamic strategy which minimizes instantaneous jump risk at each rebalancing time while controlling transaction cost. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through a simulation study on hedging Bermudan style VIX options. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To examine the plausible links between these indicators, we used semi-parametric, heterogeneous and panel causality analysis by employing data covering the period 1990-2014. The semi-parametric estimates indicate a U-shape effect between growth and taxation, along with elastic opposite direction effects of stock traded on taxation. This suggests that higher growth will have a positive influence on taxation in emerging Asian countries. The findings of the Dumitrescu and Hurlin (DH) heterogeneous Granger causality test revealed that there is a bi-directional causality running between growth and taxation, and a uni-directional causality running from stock traded to taxation,and from growth to stock traded.

We contribute to this literature by using a detailed data set for rural Mexico that allows us to understand how remittances reshape rural livelihoods by modifying labour allocation decisions. Following previous evidence, we analyse female and male responses separately. Our results show that the income effect of remittances dominates male labour allocation decisions: the probability of participating in the labour market and the total number of hours worked decrease with remittances. We find no effect for female labour allocation decisions. The effects are not uniform across the different productive activities and remittances seem to be contributing to a trend in which Mexican rural inhabitants increasingly move away from agriculture- or nature-based activities. This reinforces the direct effect that emigration has in terms of a reduction in total supply of local labour.","[Lopez-Feldman, Alejandro] Ctr Invest & Docencia Econ, Dept Econ, Lomas De Santa Fe, Mexico; [Escalona, Daniel] Comis Fed Competencia Econ, Lomas De Santa Fe, Mexico",Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

Our estimation result shows that the degree of free-riding not only varies across industries but is particularly high in larger industries indicating the underutilization of lobbying.

Keynes' paradox of thrift deals with equilibrium conditions relating to the flows of savings and investment.

Balanced growth cannot be considered an equilibrium condition without specifying an adjustment mechanism whereby balanced growth is re-established when the capital-output ratio becomes unbalanced.

In China, the monetary authority actively undertakes sterilization intervention in order to remove the influence of passive release of base money caused by foreign reserve accumulation.","[Nie, Li] Hitotsubashi Univ, Grad Sch Commerce & Management, 2-1 Naka, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868601, Japan",Hitotsubashi University,"Nie, L (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Grad Sch Commerce & Management, 2-1 Naka, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868601, Japan.",cd142007@ghit-u.ac.jp,,"Nie, Li/0000-0002-1971-667X",Ministry of Education Humanities & Social Science Fund [15YJC790086]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2015T80276],Ministry of Education Humanities & Social Science Fund; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),This work was supported by the Ministry of Education Humanities & Social Science Fund under: [Grant Number 15YJC790086] and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation under: [Grant Number 2015T80276].,,25,2,2,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We analyse whether migrants' children are more or less likely than natives' children to achieve upward educational mobility across generations, and study differences in the factors, which contribute to differences in mobility for the two groups. We find that migrants' descendants are more often upwardly mobile (and less often downwardly mobile) than their native peers in the majority of countries studied, and show that the main factor contributing to these patterns is the education level of parents. Although a lower parental education means that their children are less likely to access the same amount of human, social and financial capital as children of more highly educated parents, migrants' descendants over the last two generations were able to make significant progress in reducing education gaps with natives.","[Oberdabernig, Doris] Univ Bern, WTI, Bern, Switzerland; [Schneebaum, Alyssa] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria",University of Bern; Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Schneebaum, A (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria.",alyssa.schneebaum@wu.ac.at,,"Schneebaum, Alyssa/0000-0002-0320-5525; Oberdabernig, Doris/0000-0002-9913-3844",Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [T 714-G11],Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),A.

Using German microdata, the observed distribution of couples' earnings is compared to a counterfactual of random matches. In West Germany, marital sorting is found to be disequalizing only after adjusting for labour supply. This means that positive sorting in earnings potential is veiled by low female participation rates. In East Germany, the impact is highly disequalizing even when earnings are taken as given, due to the fact that East German women are more attached to the labour market.","[Pestel, Nico] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Pestel, Nico] Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany; [Pestel, Nico] ZEW, Mannheim, Germany",IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Cologne; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Pestel, N (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.;Pestel, N (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany.;Pestel, N (通讯作者)，ZEW, Mannheim, Germany.",,,"Pestel, Nico/0000-0003-0062-9514",,,,,41,12,12,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,JAN,2017,84.0,333,,,,,104,127,,10.1111/ecca.12189,0.0,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EO0FI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000396373300006,0

Using a rich panel dataset of 160 countries observed over 1950-2007, we find that earthquake shocks, measured in terms of the effect of ground-motion amplitude on death toll, have two contradicting effects on political change. On the one hand, earthquakes drive transitions into democracy due to an affective shock, which we interpret to be the reaction of citizens by which they hold the incumbent government responsible for earthquake damages. On the other hand, earthquakes indirectly hasten transitions into a less democratic regime because they increase the income level contemporaneously, possibly due to short-term emergency response and recovery expenditures, and thus, raising the opportunity cost of contesting the incumbent government. Overall, we show that, while not leading to a full-fledged regime transition, earthquake shocks open a new democratic window of opportunity, but this window is narrowed by improved economic conditions.","[Rahman, Muhammad Habibur; Anbarci, Nejat; Bhattacharya, Prasad Sankar; Ulubasoglu, Mehmet Ali] Deakin Univ, Dept Econ, 70 Elgar Rd, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia",Deakin University,"Ulubasoglu, MA (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Dept Econ, 70 Elgar Rd, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",maulubas@deakin.edu.au,"Ulubasoglu, Mehmet/AAT-2856-2021; Ulubasoglu, Mehmet/AAI-8535-2020; Rahman, Muhammad Habibur/N-5154-2016","Anbarci, Nejat/0000-0001-5952-8086; Rahman, Muhammad Habibur/0000-0002-8493-3873; Ulubasoglu, Mehmet/0000-0003-3055-5755",,,,,40,5,6,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

This is because the models used are focused on deviations of inflation from a steady state level exogenously given. The quantity of money in the economy determines the price level in the long-run, but does not necessarily influence the deviations from that level. Therefore, monetary aggregates have lost importance in the short-run analysis. Methods: An extensive econometric analysis of the long-run money demand is carried out for Mexico using the monetary aggregate M1. The demand for M1 monetary aggregate is estimated by an autoregressive distributed lag model, with quarterly data for Mexico for the period 2001-2014. The model is assessed with a variety of specification and diagnostics tests, furthermore, a thorough analysis of the stability of the parameters is performed. Based on such a demand two indicators of inflationary pressures are calculated: money gap and m* indicator. Results: This article illustrates how to use monetary aggregates as indicators of inflationary pressures. This is possible since there is a long-run relationship between such aggregates and prices. Specifically, two indicators are obtained. On the one hand, the money gap, which measures deviations of real M1 from its relationship with its long-run determinants. On the other, the m* indicator is based on the estimation of the price index that is congruent with the quantity of M1 in the economy, once it is adjusted for the long-run trend of its determinants considering its long-run coefficients. Thus, with respect to the long-run inflation trend, the m* indicator suggests that the money growth during the inflation targeting regime was consistent with an important disinflation effort, and then converge to an approximate 3 percent growth; i.e., towards inflationary conditions consistent with the inflation target. Conclusions: Monetary policy has been congruent with the inflation target of Banco de Mexico.",,,,mrfran@banxico.org.mx; anoriega@banxico.org.mx; cidrodriguez@banxico.org.mx,,,,,,,64,2,4,1,13,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

The subject deals with the question to what extend regional marketing is able to support a sustainable land use according to the guiding principle of Protect by Use. We all depend on the variety of nature, the biodiversity. That is the basis for the provision of manifold ecosystem services (ES). We not only benefit from food production and fresh water supply but also from flood control and recreation through intact and aesthetic landscapes. However the biodiversity is threatened even on our doorstep by different factors. The ES-concept provides an appropriate conceptual framework for assessing sustainability in land use. In the scientific community there is currently a high demand in measuring and evaluating ES and in regional case studies. As research area the Zittau Mountains Nature Park (Naturpark Zittauer Gebirge) and the Protected Landscape Area (PLA) Lusatian Mountains (Chranena krajinna oblast Luzicke hory) were chosen, because they form a unique and connected cross-border landscape. Due to its landscape diversity it is a representative area for Central Europe. Despite its rich natural and cultural heritage there are significant ecologic deficits and challenges. With that in mind the project aims to work out potentials of regional marketing for maintaining ES in this area in order to generate transferable recommendations and well-founded arguments for local decision makers. The dissertation is still at the very beginning, but some researches and methodical considerations have been already done.","[Seidel, Boris] Tech Univ Dresden, Int Inst IHI Zittau, Chair Gen Business Econ Esp Controlling & Environ, Markt 23, D-02763 Zittau, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden,"Seidel, B (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Dresden, Int Inst IHI Zittau, Chair Gen Business Econ Esp Controlling & Environ, Markt 23, D-02763 Zittau, Germany.",boris.seidel@tu-dresden.de,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,3,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-349-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,530,537,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6CS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000426486500060,0

Using dynamic panel and panel vector-auto-regression models for European Union countries during 2010-2015, we proved that only the energy consumption in transport based on biodiesel had a positive impact on economic growth. The greenhouse emissions did not have any impact on economic growth while the energy consumption in transport based on bioethanol negatively affected the economic growth. The Granger causality tests on panel data indicated a bilateral relationship between economic growth and energy consumption in transport based on biodiesel and between economic growth and energy consumption in transport based on bioethanol.

The paper proposes the concept of a pseudo-Goodwin cycle. We define this as a counter-clockwise movement in output and wage share space which is not generated by the usual Goodwin mechanism. In particular, it does not depend on a profit-led demand regime. As a demonstration, a simple Minsky model is extended by adding a reserve army distribution mechanism such that the wage share responds positively to output. In the extended Minsky model, cycles are generated purely through the interaction between financial fragility and demand. In a first step we assume no feedback from income distribution to demand. We demonstrate that the model generates a pseudo-Goodwin cycle in output-wage share space. In a second step, we show that the result continues to hold even if a wage-led demand regime is introduced, although this can introduce instability. Our models demonstrate that the existence of a counter-clockwise movement of output and the wage share cannot be regarded as proof of the existence of a Goodwin cycle and a profit-led demand regime.","[Stockhammer, E.] Univ Kingston, Kingston Upon Thames KT1 2EE, Surrey, England; [Michell, J.] Univ West England, Bristol, Avon, England",Kingston University; University of West England,"Stockhammer, E (通讯作者)，Univ Kingston, Kingston Upon Thames KT1 2EE, Surrey, England.",e.stockhammer@kingston.ac.uk,"Stockhammer, Engelbert/M-1744-2019","Stockhammer, Engelbert/0000-0002-5329-3535",,,,,44,31,33,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Although significant research progress has been made on the impacts of IT use at the individual level, the mechanism of how IT use increases individual performance at work has not been fully explored. In an attempt to examine the IT effects on performance, we focus on individual work productivity gained from IT use. Following the discussion of previous works, we develop a research model, describing that the ubiquitous IT transforms the way individual employers' work in organizations, and facilitates working processes and practices that may affect the decision-making of individual performance.As a result of testing the research model, we found not only that IT use does have a direct effect on the quality of decision-making in organizations, but that this effect is partially mediated by the extent of IT-facilitated autonomy and of IT-facilitated coordination. These findings suggest that the effects of IT use on decision-makings in an organization may be attributed, in part, to its beneficial use in coordination and tendency to foster more discretion.","[Sun, Jonghak] Weber State Univ, John B Goddard Sch Business & Econ, Dept Business Adm, Ogden, UT 84408 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Weber State University,"Sun, J (通讯作者)，Weber State Univ, John B Goddard Sch Business & Econ, Dept Business Adm, Ogden, UT 84408 USA.",jonghaksun@weber.edu,,,,,,,109,6,7,3,53,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We compare the results obtained for PIIGS with those of Germany and the USA, and also with those of France, which despite its government's efforts demonstrate relatively poor recent economic performance. The main objective of this paper is to establish whether it is still reasonable to consider PIIGS as a group apart. Our methodological strategy is based on the Okun Law (OL) which is incorporated in a Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) model with Blanchard-Quah (BQ) restrictions. We address two drawbacks that usually present in the OL: the interdependency problem and the non-stationarity problem. By using a non-parametric representation of OL, we identify the heterogeneity between countries. We build stable VAR models for each of the economies and use the BQ SVAR impulses to analyse the importance of contemporary and long-run effects of supply and demand shocks. The main conclusion of this paper is that it does not make any sense today to identify PIIGS as a separate group. Additionally, a country that stands out from our analysis is France. The question can thus be posed that if PIIGS signifies countries with poor economic performances then should not France also belong to this group?","[Syssoyeva-Masson, Irina; Andrade, Joao Sousa] CEMAFI Int Assoc, Nice, France; [Syssoyeva-Masson, Irina] Univ Savoy Mt Blanc, Chambery, France; [Andrade, Joao Sousa] Univ Coimbra, Dept Econ, Grp Monetary & Financial Studies GEMF, Coimbra, Portugal",Universite Savoie Mont Blanc; Universidade de Coimbra,"Andrade, JS (通讯作者)，CEMAFI Int Assoc, Nice, France.;Andrade, JS (通讯作者)，Univ Coimbra, Dept Econ, Grp Monetary & Financial Studies GEMF, Coimbra, Portugal.",irina_masson@hotmail.fr; jasa@fe.uc.pt,,"Andrade, Joao/0000-0003-0999-2264",,,,,97,2,2,0,7,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2017,64.0,2,,,SI,,189,222,,10.2298/PAN1702189S,0.0,,,34,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EX3IA,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000403124600005,0

Its implementation is expected to reduce defects, improve quality, increase safety and the morale of the employees, and improve employees' productivity. In the present paper, over the period of seven years, we investigate the case of a rubber goods manufacturer from Serbia which has implemented 5S in one of its subsidiaries. To assess the effects of the 5S implementation we use operational and financial performance indicators. Our results suggest that the implementation of 5S can contribute to performance of an organization in the short and medium term. In the case we analyze here, effects of 5S were not evident in longer term due to the influence of some external factors (increase in raw material prices and decrease in purchasing power of demand) and strong investment activity of the subsidiary. We argue that the performance of the subsidiary under the influence of these factors would be weaker if it did not implement 5S. In addition, subsidiary in our study implemented TDABC to make possible preparation of reports important for efficient decision making in the new business environment. This finding points to the importance of the management accounting system improvements after the continuous improvements implementation.","[Todorovic, Mirjana; Cupic, Milan] Univ Kragujevac, Dj Pucara Starog 3, Kragujevac 34000, Serbia",University of Kragujevac,"Todorovic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Kragujevac, Dj Pucara Starog 3, Kragujevac 34000, Serbia.",mtodorovic@kg.ac.rs; mcupic@kg.ac.rs,"Todorović, Mirjana/GPP-3497-2022; Cupic, Milan/K-7577-2012","Cupic, Milan/0000-0002-0150-6682; Todorovic, Mirjana/0000-0003-0209-6694",,,,,47,9,12,6,25,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

This is a new aspect as previous studies investigated the impact of immigration on trade from host countries perspective. However, there are also reasons to believe that trade may affect the propensity to emigrate in the home countries, leading to potential brain drain in developing countries, especially given the theoretical hypothesis in Stolper-Samuelson (S-S) theorem within Heckscher-Ohlin (H-O) factor-proportion model that more educated workers are more likely to emigrate due to an increase in international trade. When low-skill abundant developing countries liberalize trade, the reward of the scarce factor (skilled labor) is reduced in these countries, but it increases in the high-skill abundant developed countries. Therefore, skilled workers in the developing countries see a strong incentive to migrate to developed countries. To test this hypothesis, this paper utilizes a panel of 133 developing countries for the period of 1980-2010 and finds that high-skilled workers are more likely to emigrate with trade while there appears to be no effect of trade on low-skilled workers.","[Uprety, Dambar] Univ North Carolina Wilmington, Dept Econ & Finance, Wilmington, NC 28403 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Wilmington,"Uprety, D (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Wilmington, Dept Econ & Finance, Wilmington, NC 28403 USA.",upretyd@uncw.edu,"Uprety, Dambar/AAR-8137-2020",,,,,,26,8,8,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

The overall improvement in EU monetary zone is expected to continue also as a consequence of the monetary policy actions taken by the European Central Bank to restore the bank intermediation channel as well as of the effective implementation of the Banking Union which should have positive effects especially on banking integration.

The model features heterogeneous production sectors in which private firms face discriminatory borrowing constraints while state-owned firms are not. Fitted to China's quarterly data from 2005Q3 to 2014Q4, the quantitative general equilibrium model enables us to identify the driving forces behind and the macroeconomic variables interacting with land price. It confirms the existence of the collateral channel in the private sector without bearing the potential endogeneity problems in empirical studies. More importantly, we identify a crowding out channel between private and state-owned firms caused by discriminatory financial constraints. The crowding out channel implies a negative relationship between real estate prices and the investment of state-owned firms, which has been documented in empirical research but short of explanation so far.","[Wang, Ren] Hunan Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Changsha 410205, Peoples R China; [Hou, Jie] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Int Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China; [He, Xiaobei] China Finance 40 Forum, Beijing, Peoples R China",Hunan University; Capital University of Economics & Business,"Hou, J (通讯作者)，Capital Univ Econ & Business, Int Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China.",renwang@hnu.edu.cn; jie_hou_cueb@163.com; hexb@cf40.org.cn,,,"School of Economics and Trade, Hunan University; Research and Innovation Center of Metropolis Economic and Social Development, CUEB","School of Economics and Trade, Hunan University; Research and Innovation Center of Metropolis Economic and Social Development, CUEB","Ren Wang acknowledges financial support from School of Economics and Trade, Hunan University; Jie Hou acknowledges financial support from Research and Innovation Center of Metropolis Economic and Social Development, CUEB.",,44,26,28,1,81,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

To this end, we consider data on oil price and Islamic stock investment, evaluate their interactions through vector autoregressive modelling and estimate the impulse response functions. Further, we perform portfolio simulations and measure further diversification benefits. First, we find that the risk of the economy's dependency on the crude oil industry is not rejected, given the recent strong deterioration of oil returns. Second, the portfolio simulations highlight that the consideration of investment in Islamic stock shares not only generates diversification benefits but also provides a portfolio with the highest returns and lowest financial risk, for which we compute the optimal composition. Third, the analysis of the impulse response functions shows that the investment in the Islamic stock market in Saudi Arabia implies positive effects on the oil industry, which is a priori favourable to the recent challenge of undertaking the national development programme, Saudi Vision 2030.","[Jawadi, Fredj] Univ Evry, Evry, France; [Jawadi, Nabila] Ipag Business Sch, Paris, France; [Cheffou, Abdoulkarim Idi] EDC Paris Business Sch, Paris, France",Universite Paris Saclay; IPAG Business School,"Jawadi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Evry, Evry, France.",fredj.jawadi@univ-evry.fr,,"JAWADI, Fredj/0000-0003-3655-8391",,,,,7,7,8,0,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We find that overall wealth dropped by 15 percent between 2008 and 2011, with losses concentrating among households in the mid and top wealth quintiles. The most hard hit wealth components were business assets, primary home equity, and durable assets, which declined by 40 percent, 23 percent and 19 percent, respectively. Wealth losses among all households were likely sustained by restricted access to credit. Nonetheless, in part due to their more diversified wealth portfolios, households in the top wealth quintile amassed a greater share of the country's wealth during the recession. Consequently, wealth inequality, which receded during the expansionary years of 2002 through 2005, rose by 2008 and continued its trend in 2011.","[Amuedo-Dorantes, Catalina] San Diego State Univ, Dept Econ, Catalina Amuedo Dorantes, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Borra, Cristina] Univ Seville, Dept Econ & Econ Hist, Cristina Bona, Campus Ramon & Cajal, Seville 41018, Spain",California State University System; San Diego State University; University of Sevilla,"Borra, C (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Dept Econ & Econ Hist, Cristina Bona, Campus Ramon & Cajal, Seville 41018, Spain.",cborra@us.es,"Amuedo-Dorantes, Catalina/AAI-7730-2020; Borra, Cristina/E-6281-2010; Islam, Md/Q-8401-2018","Amuedo-Dorantes, Catalina/0000-0002-4750-309X; Borra, Cristina/0000-0003-2277-8342;",Spanish Instituto de Estudios Fiscales [1874/0654],Spanish Instituto de Estudios Fiscales,This work was funded by the Spanish Instituto de Estudios Fiscales under grant reference 1874/0654.

With the aid of the dynamic panel generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation technique, this paper evaluates the synergistic effect of both sectors on economic growth in a panel of 10 African countries that are responsible for most of the activities in the continent's financial sector. The insurance-banking-growth nexus was also examined through bootstrap panel causality tests. The results show that the life insurance market and the banking sector, as well as the non-life insurance market and the banking sector, are complimentary. We find that, overall, the relationship between the insurance and banking sectors in Africa is a complimentary one and that their synergistic impact on economic growth is positive. The feedback hypothesis was also confirmed in the relationship between the insurance sector and economic growth and between the banking sector and economic growth.","[Balcilar, Mehmet] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Econ, Via Mersin 10, Famagusta, Northern Cyprus, Turkey; [Balcilar, Mehmet; Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Balcilar, Mehmet] Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier, France; [Lee, Chien-Chiang] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Olasehinde-Williams, Godwin] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Econ, Via Mersin 10, Famagusta, Northern Cyprus, Turkey",Eastern Mediterranean University; University of Pretoria; Montpellier Business School; National Sun Yat Sen University; Eastern Mediterranean University,"Lee, CC (通讯作者)，Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",mehmet@mbalcilar.net; rangan.gupta@up.ac.za; cclee@cm.nsysu.edu.tw; alanisey@gmail.com,"BALCILAR, MEHMET/K-7346-2019; Olasehinde-Williams, Godwin Oluseye/AFP-8837-2022; Lee, Chien-Chiang/AAZ-9983-2020; Olasehinde-Williams, Godwin/AAM-1696-2020","BALCILAR, MEHMET/0000-0001-9694-5196; Olasehinde-Williams, Godwin Oluseye/0000-0002-3710-6146; Lee, Chien-Chiang/0000-0003-0037-4347; Olasehinde-Williams, Godwin/0000-0002-3710-6146",Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [MOST 107-2410-H-110-005-MY2],"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",The authors are grateful to the editor and two anonymous referees for helpful comments and suggestions.

One economic theory builds on this relationship and argues that rising inequality leads to greater differential fertility between rich and poor. We show that the relationship between income and fertility has flattened between 1980 and 2010 in the US, a time of increasing inequality, as high income families increased their fertility. These facts challenge the standard theory. We propose that marketization of parental time costs can explain the changing relationship between income and fertility. We show this result both theoretically and quantitatively, after disciplining the model on US data. We explore implications of changing differential fertility for aggregate human capital. Additionally, policies, such as the minimum wage, that affect the cost of marketization, have a negative effect on the fertility and labor supply of high income women. We end by discussing the insights of this theory to the economics of marital sorting.","[Bar, Michael] San Francisco State Univ, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA; [Hazan, Moshe] Tel Aviv Univ, CEPR, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Leukhina, Oksana] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA; [Weiss, David] Tel Aviv Univ, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Zoabi, Hosny] New Econ Sch, Moscow, Russia",California State University System; San Francisco State University; Tel Aviv University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; Tel Aviv University; New Economic School,"Hazan, M (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, CEPR, Tel Aviv, Israel.",mbar@sfsu.edu; moshehaz@post.tau.ac.il; oksana.m.leukhina@gmail.com; davidweiss@post.tau.ac.il; hosny.zoabi@gmail.com,"Hazan, Moshe/S-2470-2019","Hazan, Moshe/0000-0002-5459-5455",Russian Science Foundation [18-18-00466] Funding Source: Russian Science Foundation,Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)),,,48,22,23,5,46,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

Using the abandonment of pulmonary artery catheters (PACs) as an empirical application, we aim to understand patterns of human behavior when information that a technology is ineffective becomes available. This study focuses on the role of peer interaction in explaining medical technology abandonment.

Data from auction annuals during the years from 1991 to 2012 and repeat-sales regression (RSR) method are used to create the index of 28,951 art transactions. Based on the art index values, we observe that the art index for the Polish auction market exhibits similar returns to the ones on treasury bonds and much lower returns than the ones on the Polish stock and gold prices. The volatility of the art index is, what is striking, much lower than the volatility of stocks, comparable to gold prices and much higher than the volatility of treasury bonds.

While we find significant heterogeneity in wage levels (via differences in starting wages), we find no evidence of systematic heterogeneity in wage growth. Instead, highly persistent wage shocks are found to account entirely for the rise in wage inequality with age.

Lack of market integration and limited information on non-local products often leave consumers unaware of the prices and quality of non-local firms. They therefore mostly buy locally, limiting firms' potential market size (and competition). We explore this hypothesis using a natural experiment in the Kerala boat-building industry. As consumers learn more about non-local builders, high-quality builders gain market share and grow, while low-quality firms exit.

In particular, an increase in risk and that in ambiguity (Knightian uncertainty) work in the opposite directions with higher ambiguity rather than risk being a significant source of populism.","[Kishishita, Daiki] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Econ, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Kishishita, D (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Econ, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",daiki.kishishita@gmail.com,,,,,,,9,3,3,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

The U.S. ranks 102nd in the world in the percentage of women serving in the national legislature. A leading explanation is the persistence of a substantial gender gap in political ambition. Research explaining the gender gap in political ambition has focused primarily on factors such as self-assessed qualifications, risk aversion, and competitiveness. We make two advances on the existing literature: first, we examine the extent of the gender gap in political ambition using a discrete elicitation measure that provides a more precise measurement of the degree to which women and men exhibit electoral aversion. Second, we test three recruitment appeals - a leadership message, community service message, and qualifications message - to determine which type of appeal could reduce or eliminate the gender gap in political ambition. Our results, based on a laboratory experiment, confirm that women are less interested than men in standing for elective office. However, we also find that while women are less willing to enter an election, women are not unwilling to run for election. We conclude that women's lack of interest is not as definitive as prior research may have suggested. In terms of recruitment, all three messages significantly boost women's willingness to run in the election. Notably, though, the message describing running for office as a collective endeavor to help serve the community actually reduces men's willingness to enter the election, closing the gap in ambition.

It is common indeed for the institutional changes that accompany development to generate tensions and frictions, notably regarding land rights. Using survey data on land practices and governance in Chinese villages and prefecture-level statistics about investment in the real estate sector, we show that administrative reallocations of village land by local authorities increase with the level of real estate activity and that this effect is mitigated by the development of village-level democracy. These results are consistent with those of the handful of existing empirical studies on this topic. We thus provide empirical insight into the factors governing the evolution of land rights and land institutions in rural areas in China and the related conflicts, as well as, more generally, into the dynamics of institutional change.","[Shi, Li] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Vendryes, Thomas] Univ Paris Saclay, CREST, ENS Paris Saclay, F-94235 Cachan, France",Beijing Normal University; Universite Paris Saclay,"Vendryes, T (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Saclay, CREST, ENS Paris Saclay, F-94235 Cachan, France.",thomas.venchyes@ens-paris-saclay.fr,"Vendryes, Thomas/V-3249-2019","Vendryes, Thomas/0000-0001-9238-415X",ANR Finurbasie project [ANR-12-BSH1-0014]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-12-BSH1-0014] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR),ANR Finurbasie project; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"This research was supported by funding from the ANR Finurbasie project (Project reference: ANR-12-BSH1-0014).

The government, the MNB (the central bank of Hungary) as well as the domestic and foreign analysts cited the high public debt and the volume of unsecured foreign-currency loans as the main reasons for the crises. Though these were real weaknesses, this diagnosis was false as much as the following treatment. First and foremost, it was the inadequate level of foreign exchange reserves that made Hungary to request outside financial assistance. The excessive fiscal tightening urged by the MNB only led to deepening of the crises. In general, the macropolicy-both fiscal and monetary policy-before, during and after the crises turned out to be painfully pro-cyclical. Due to the lack of sufficient reserves, the MNB became virtually powerless to intervene and could only watch from the side-lines as events unfolded. The orthodox mind-set after replenishing the forex reserves prevented it from implementing a broad scale of unconventional measures to ease the crises. The fiscal authority lost its capacity long before to reduce the severity of the crises. Thus, the excessive and incorrect structure of fiscal correction coupled with an unjustified orthodox monetary policy, the contraction of the Hungarian economy went much beyond the inevitable amount.","[Suranyi, Gyorgy] Cent Bank Hungary MNB, Budapest, Hungary",,"Surányi, G (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Hungary MNB, Budapest, Hungary.",gyorgysuranyi@gmail.com,,,,,,,0,1,1,0,4,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

Pessimistic monetary authorities behave as if they believed that the worst economic conditions were very likely and move the policy instrument to hedge against their negative consequences. With respect to their risk neutral counterparts, they apply a more aggressive Taylor rule, reducing the inflation rate volatility. The impact of pessimism on monetary policy is magnified by economic uncertainty. A calibration exercise for the U.S. economy confirms the relevance of pessimism as it shows that pessimistic monetary authorities react to a one-standard-deviation supply shock moving the policy instrument by about one percent more than their risk-neutral counterparts.

Structural change in construction industry has been promoted to mitigate CO2. This paper estimates CO2 shadow price of construction industry and its supporting materials industries in China so as to help them to mitigate CO2 cost-effectively. A parametric directional distance function model, taking into account all possible directional vectors, is applied to address issues regarding arbitrary selection of direction that will affect estimation of shadow price. Results show that there is larger potential for CO2 reduction in supporting material industries than in construction industry itself and shadow price of overall CO2 is much lower than that of direct CO2. The existence of enlarging heterogeneity in shadow prices among different regions provides strong support for introducing a national carbon trading market, thereby helping construction industry and building materials industries to reduce their abatement costs.

In the literature there are a variety of methods used for such elicitation; the concern of the experiment reported in this paper is to compare them. The methods we investigate are the following: Holt-Laury price lists; pairwise choices, the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak method; allocation questions. Clearly their relative efficiency in measuring risk aversion depends upon the numbers of questions asked; but the method itself may well influence the estimated risk-aversion. While it is impossible to determine a best' method (as the truth is unknown) we can look at the differences between the different methods. We carried out an experiment in four parts, corresponding to the four different methods, with 96 subjects. In analysing the data our methodology involves fitting preference functionals; we use four, Expected Utility and Rank-Dependent Expected Utility, each combined with either a CRRA or a CARA utility function. Our results show that the inferred level of risk aversion is more sensitive to the elicitation method than to the assumed-true preference functional. Experimenters should worry most about context.","[Zhou, Wenting; Hey, John] Univ York, Dept Econ, York YO10 4GA, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Zhou, WT (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Econ, York YO10 4GA, N Yorkshire, England.",wentingzhou123@gmail.com; john.hey@york.ac.uk,,,,,,,44,17,21,2,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

This paper questions if this development is beneficial for bank efficiency in African countries by investigating if Pan-African banks are more efficient than other types of foreign and domestic banks. We analyse the relation between ownership type and bank efficiency on a large sample of African banks covering 39 African countries over the period 2002-2015. We find that Pan-African banks are the most efficient banks in the African banking industries. We explain this finding with the fact that these banks combine the best of both worlds: they have the global advantages of foreign banks and the home field advantages of domestic banks. They are therefore able to be more efficient than both foreign banks from developed countries and domestic banks. This suggests that favouring the entry of Pan-African banks would be beneficial to bank efficiency in Africa.","[Zins, Alexandra] Univ Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France; [Weill, Laurent] Univ Strasbourg, EM Strasbourg Business Sch, Strasbourg, France; [Weill, Laurent] MGIMO Univ, Moscow State Inst Int Relat, Moscow, Russia",Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; MGIMO University,"Weill, L (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, Inst Etud Polit, 47 Ave Foret Noire, F-67082 Strasbourg, France.",azins@unistra.fr; laurent.weill@unistra.fr,,,,,,,39,7,7,1,1,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0939-3625,1878-5433,,ECON SYST,Econ.

The demise of traditional industries and the rise of the service sector during the 1990s inclined economic structure towards deindustrialisation. In years that followed, new industries emerged in many of these countries and brought them back on the route of reindustrialisation. Across countries, this process developed at an uneven pace. The recent rise of awareness about the importance of industrial development for the well-being of nations makes it relevant to investigate the sources behind changes in the economic structure of CEECs. Our findings reveal that reindustrialisation takes place at an uneven pace. No support was found for horizontal economy-wide industrial policies advocated within new classical economics. Strong impulse to reindustrialisation comes through improvements in export sophistication.

However, the economic effects of such policies vary across countries' economic structures; for instance, developing countries face higher fixed trade costs (partly due to higher government border-crossing costs and weaker port infrastructures). We offer three potential contributions. First, we extend a standard Melitz general equilibrium trade model with firm heterogeneity to show how variable-cost and fixed-cost trade elasticities associated with trade liberalizations are heterogeneous and endogenous to levels of country-pairs' bilateral policy and non-policy, variable and fixed trade costs - even allowing for CES preferences and an untruncated Pareto distribution of productivities. Using associated comparative statics, we provide several explicit predictions of the heterogeneous (variable- and fixed-cost) bilateral extensive-margin, intensive-margin, and trade elasticities. Second, we provide empirical support for the theoretical hypotheses. Trade elasticities vary across particular settings. Third, we demonstrate the relevance of these theoretical and empirical results for ex ante trade-flow predictions of potential EIAs. For instance, we show that a 10 percent lower average per capita income of a country-pair is associated with a 60 percent higher partial EIA effect. Moreover, we show empirically that 95-99 percent of the welfare (or probability) estimates of EIA liberalizations between 1,358 North-North, North-South, and South-South country-pairs can be explained by our heterogeneous EIA partial treatment effects.","[Baier, Scott L.] Clemson Univ, John E Walker Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Bergstrand, Jeffrey H.] Univ Notre Dame, Mendoza Coll Business, Dept Econ, Dept Finance, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Bergstrand, Jeffrey H.] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Clance, Matthew W.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0028 Hatfield, South Africa",Clemson University; University of Notre Dame; Ifo Institut; University of Pretoria,"Bergstrand, JH (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Mendoza Coll Business, Dept Finance, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",sbaier@clemson.edu; bergstrand.1@nd.edu; matthew.clance@up.ac.za,"Clance, Matthew/R-1518-2018","Clance, Matthew/0000-0002-9280-7324",Notre Dame Mendoza College of Business; Kellogg Institute for International Studies; University of Pretoria's Research Development Program,Notre Dame Mendoza College of Business; Kellogg Institute for International Studies; University of Pretoria's Research Development Program,"We thank the editor, Nathan Nunn, three anonymous referees, Costas Arkolakis, Antoine Gervais, Marc Melitz, Stephen Redding and seminar and conference participants at Arizona State University, Southern Methodist University, University of Nottingham, the International Economics and Finance Society, and the Latin American and Caribbean Economics Association for excellent comments on earlier drafts.

It suggests that these are a move in the right direction in so far as they acknowledge 'place' as a key, constituent part of policymaking. Drawing upon examples from across the world, we emphasise the importance of regions pursuing strategies that allow them to capture-in a sustainable way-a part of the value they help create and co-create with other entities, such as multinational firms and other organisations. This involves policymakers acting as public entrepreneurs, devising and implementing strategies, structures and policies to enable the regional ecosystem and its constituent parts to capture value sustainably. In addition to the extant focus on linkages and embeddedness, a key aspect of this involves the adoption of regional value capture and positioning strategies.","[Bailey, David] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Pitelis, Christos] Brunel Univ London, Uxbridge, Middx, England; [Pitelis, Christos] Queens Coll, Cambridge, England; [Tomlinson, Philip R.] Univ Bath, Ctr Governance Regulat & Ind Strategy, Sch Management, Bath, Avon, England",Aston University; Brunel University; University of Cambridge; University of Bath,"Tomlinson, PR (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Sch Management, Bath, Avon, England.;Tomlinson, PR (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Inst Policy Res, Bath, Avon, England.;Tomlinson, PR (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Ctr Governance Regulat & Ind Strategy, Sch Management, Bath, Avon, England.",P.R.Tomlinson@bath.ac.uk,"Tomlinson, Philip/AFJ-1113-2022; Pitelis, Christos N./O-3145-2015","Tomlinson, Philip/0000-0001-6292-3204;",,,,,108,72,73,1,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Agents use simple heuristics to forecast the interest rate and the real wage. The fraction of agents using a specific heuristic depends on its relative forecasting performance. In the absence of heuristic switching, the results indicate that there is a lot of variation in the transitional dynamics over different parameter values and heuristics. When agents switch between heuristics, however, the variation in the transitional dynamics decreases significantly. We show that heuristic switching has a stabilising effect on transitional dynamics that would otherwise exhibit permanent oscillations. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We adopt a moment inequality approach, placing weak assumptions on firms' expectations. The framework allows us to test whether firms differ in the information they have about foreign markets. We find that larger firms possess better knowledge of market conditions in foreign countries, even when those firms have not exported in the past.

This premise, however, does not seem validated as there is no consensus in the empirical literature regarding the impact of exchange rate changes on trade flows. We reexamine whether currency fluctuations are systematically associated with trade flows using a rich and unique Chinese customs dataset spanning the universe of bilateral Chinese transaction level trades over the 2000 to 2011 period. This dataset allows us to consider firm-level involvement in processing trade and firm-level dynamics in both export and import markets. Key findings of our firm-level estimations of trade elasticities include that the response of Chinese firms to exchanges rate changes depends strongly on the extent to which firms are involved in processing trade, i.e. heterogeneity in the extent of processing trade is crucial to understanding trade elasticities, and that the Chinese trade balance responds strongly to changes in the relative value of the Chinese Yuan, thereby implying that the influence of exchange rates on trade flows is significant and that currency depreciations do in fact lead to export growth and trade balance improvement.

Yet it is difficult to demonstrate this effect empirically, partly because citizens are not randomly assigned to different administrations and standard impact evaluation techniques are thus not viable. Within education, randomised trials that attribute educational improvement to specific interventions have been influential. Yet critics have argued that these studies, by focussing on single interventions, fail to prove their validity in a context of multiple interventions and, above all, weak system governance. The current paper takes advantage of provincial boundary changes occurring in South Africa, where provinces manage schools, to measure the effects of better administration, using a quasi-experimental approach. Changing to a more effective province was found to improve the mathematics performance of secondary school students, in national examinations, by a magnitude that is half of that seen in the fastest improving countries in international testing programmes. The replacement of teachers or school principals does not explain the improvement, though the addition of administrative support staff does emerge as a likely contributing factor. Greater efficiency, and not additional funding, appears to account for most of the change. It seems noteworthy that one of the provinces found to be relatively effective makes use of fixed-term contracts for senior managers in the administration, as opposed to permanent tenure, to enhance organisational capacity.","[Gustafsson, Martin; Taylor, Stephen] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Econ, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Gustafsson, Martin; Taylor, Stephen] Dept Basic Educ, Pretoria, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Gustafsson, M (通讯作者)，Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Econ, Stellenbosch, South Africa.;Gustafsson, M (通讯作者)，Dept Basic Educ, Pretoria, South Africa.",mgustafsson@sun.ac.za,,,,,,,16,2,3,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

The study adopts panel data for 30 provinces from 2010 to 2014 to estimate a one-way fixed-effect spatial Durbin model. The primary finding of this study is that a higher level of fiscal transparency will attract more FDI, while keeping other factors constant and considering the spatial dependence of FDI. Other explanatory variables, such as gross regional product and the density of railways, also have statistically significant influences on FDI. Consequently, this study suggests that the Chinese local governments should improve their fiscal transparency in order to attract more foreign capital and further stimulate their economic development as well as China's economic growth as a whole.","[Huang, Jr-Tsung] Natl Chengchi Univ, 64,ZhiNan Rd Sec 2, Taipei 116, Taiwan; [Chang, Ming-Lei] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Taoyuan 32023, Taiwan",National Chengchi University; Chung Yuan Christian University,"Chang, ML (通讯作者)，Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Taoyuan 32023, Taiwan.",jthuang@nccu.edu.tw; minglei@cycu.edu.tw,"Huang, Jr-Tsung/AAV-6995-2021",,"National Science Council, Taiwan [MOST 103-2410-H-004-018]","National Science Council, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","The authors acknowledge the financial support provided for this research by the National Science Council, Taiwan (MOST 103-2410-H-004-018).

To this end, I employ a time-varying structural VAR model consisting of dispersion among forecasters and the absolute value of their mean forecast revision. The results show that the level of information inattentiveness about inflation increases monotonically from the early 1980s, while a procyclical information stickiness is identified for GDP growth forecasts. I find, however, that countercyclicality in the professional forecasters' forecast revisions, rather than information stickiness, is the main driver of countercyclical fluctuations in disagreement.","[Hur, Joonyoung] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Div Econ, 107 Imun Ro, Seoul, South Korea",Hankuk University Foreign Studies,"Hur, J (通讯作者)，Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Div Econ, 107 Imun Ro, Seoul, South Korea.",joonyhur@hufs.ac.kr,,,Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund,Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund,"I am grateful to Paresh Narayan (the editor) and two anonymous referees, whose comments were particularly helpful.

We develop a multi-country general equilibrium trade model that features multistage production, with different stages having different productivities and using factors (occupations) with different intensities. The model also features a Roy mechanism, in which heterogeneous workers endogenously choose their sector and occupation. Country- and worker-level comparative advantages interact. A reduction in trade costs leads to countries specializing in their comparative advantage sectors and production stages. This specialization changes labor demand and also leads to more workers shifting to their comparative advantage sectors and occupations. We calibrate our model to the U.S., China, and the rest of the world in 2000 and we simulate a decline in China's trade costs with the U.S., designed to mimic China's entry into the WTO. Our simulation results imply an increase in the skill premium in both the U.S. and China, and the GVC,i.e., specialization across stages, is critical to this outcome. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

To test this proposition, our research examines the geographic variation of five key categories of music preferences across 95 of the largest US metropolitan areas. We use factor analysis to identify and map geographic variation of musical preferences, and we use both bivariate correlation analyses and regression analysis to examine the associations between metro-level musical preferences and key economic, demographic, political, and psychological variables.

We first showcase the importance of analyzing autocratic regimes as non-unitary actors by discussing extant work on non-democracies in sub-Saharan Africa and China, where the prevailing view of winner-take-all contests can be clearly rejected. We show how specific biographical information about powerful cadres helps shed light upon the composition of the inner circles that empower autocrats. We further provide an application of these methods to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), one of the most personalistic, opaque and data-poor political regimes in the world today. Employing information from DPRK state media on participants at official state events, we are able to trace the evolution and consolidation of Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un around the transition period following the death of his father, Kim Jong Il. The internal factional divisions of the DPRK are explored during and after this transition.

After detailing and interpreting the Initiative's timeline, key aspects of the government's policy are analysed; its financial arrangements are noted; and the initial 64 countries covered by the Belt and Road identified. The signature Land Belt and the Sea Road components are analysed using an array of tools: economic corridors, blue economic passages, and economic circles. Reference is made to specific projects and the varied reactions stemming from other countries to the implications of China's policy implementation. Finally, an assessment of the Initiative's first five years is made before looking ahead to consider how it may dovetail with other government programs as Beijing addresses the next 45 years of its planned life.","[Rimmer, Peter J.] Australian Natl Univ, ANU Coll Asia & Pacific, Sch Culture Hist & Language, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Rimmer, PJ (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, ANU Coll Asia & Pacific, Sch Culture Hist & Language, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",peter.rimmer@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,91,16,16,3,68,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

We present three main findings. First, tax base rules and credits explain more of the variation in state corporate tax revenues than tax rates do. Second, although states typically do not offset tax rate changes with base and credit changes, the effects of tax rate changes on tax revenue and economic activity depend on the breadth of the base. Third, as states have narrowed their tax bases, the relationship between tax rates and tax revenues has diminished. Overall, changes in state tax bases have made the state corporate tax system more favorable for corporations and are reducing the extent to which tax rate increases raise corporate tax revenue.

Internal adjustment to these changes has often proved to be extremely slow and painful. This paper combines elements of urban and international economics to draw out the implications of trade shocks for city performance. Localization economies in production of internationally tradable goods mean that cities divide into two types, those producing tradables and those specializing in sectors producing just for the national market (nontradables). Negative trade shocks (and possibly also some positive ones) reduce the number of cities engaged in tradable production, increasing the number producing just nontradables. This has a negative effect across all nontradable cities, which lose population and land value. Remaining tradable cities boom, gaining population and land value. Depending on the initial position, city size dispersion may increase, thus raising the share of urban land rents in national income and reducing the share of labor.","[Venables, Anthony J.] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [Venables, Anthony J.] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England; [Venables, Anthony J.] Int Growth Ctr, London, England",University of Oxford; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Venables, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",tony.venables@economics.ox.ac.uk,"venables, anthony/JDW-7805-2023","venables, anthony/0000-0003-0251-7479",ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,12,6,7,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Unlike Indonesia in recent years - whose automotive development up to the late 1990s was considered a failure - the Philippines has not succeeded in developing significant exports of vehicles. Although at first sight there have been early similarities in industrial policies towards the automotive industry in the two countries, we identify various key policy differences, including tax policy to promote particular types of vehicle. Although now the Philippines is starting to see the sort of growth in vehicle ownership that is currently well underway in Indonesia, it will have to struggle under its new CARS policy to stop the growth in the market simply being met by more imports.","[Thoburn, John] Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Econ, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Natsuda, Kaoru] Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific Univ, Coll Int Management, Dev Econ, Beppu, Oita, Japan",University of East Anglia; Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University,"Thoburn, J (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Econ, Norwich, Norfolk, England.",j.t.thoburn@uea.ac.uk; natsuda@apu.ac.jp,"Natsuda, Kaoru/U-2584-2019","Natsuda, Kaoru/0000-0001-8034-5137",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [KAKENHI] [15K03496]; Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K03496] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [KAKENHI](Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [KAKENHI Grant No. 15K03496], and by a Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University academic research subsidy.",,51,9,9,2,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

It models the interaction between the wage rates of mothers as second earners and variation in child care prices and productivities as determinants of heterogeneity in second earner labour supply. We find that individual taxation welfare dominates joint taxation on grounds of both efficiency and equity. Heterogeneous labour supplies, the positive relationship between household wages and child care quality, and the sharp rise in wage rates in the top percentiles of the primary wage distribution account for this result. In addition to reducing the intra-household net-of-tax wage gap, individual taxation removes the opportunity for tax avoidance that income-splitting makes available to high-wage primary earners, leading to a much fairer distribution of the tax burden.","[Apps, Patricia; Rees, Ray] Univ Sydney, Law Sch, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia; [Apps, Patricia] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Rees, Ray] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Munich, Germany; [Rees, Ray] CESifo, Munich, Germany",University of Sydney; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Munich; Ifo Institut,"Apps, P (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Law Sch, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia.;Apps, P (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.",patricia.apps@sydney.edu.au,,,Australian Research Council [DP120104115],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"We are grateful to Vidar Christiansen and participants in the 2016 CESIfo Public Economics Conference, and to Kai Konrad and participants at the 2016 Tax Research Conference organised by the Max Planck Institute for Tax Law and Public Finance and the Ross Parsons Centre, The University of Sydney Law School, as well as to the two referees, for very helpful comments.

Moreover, this underperformance is concentrated in male horses, despite these being purchased exclusively for racing purposes. These puzzling findings cannot be explained by differences in horse risk or breeder abilities, or by nonfinancial objectives, or by behavioral or selection biases.","[Boyle, Glenn] Sapere Res Grp, Wellington 6140, New Zealand; [Boyle, Glenn] Univ Canterbury, Dept Econ & Finance, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand; [Ward, Gerald] Univ Maryland, Robert H Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University of Canterbury; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Boyle, G (通讯作者)，Sapere Res Grp, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.;Boyle, G (通讯作者)，Univ Canterbury, Dept Econ & Finance, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand.",glenn.boyle@canterbury.ac.nz; geraldward@rhsmith.umd.edu,,,University of Canterbury School of Business and Economics,University of Canterbury School of Business and Economics,"We are grateful for the assistance of many people.

A First Assesment,TRIMESTRE ECONOMICO,,,Spanish,Article,,,,,,Mexico; fiscal reform; fiscal deficit; public debt; fiscal burden,,"This paper presents a preliminary assessment of the various impacts of the fiscal reform undertaken by President Enrique Pena Nieto. First, the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of the fiscal structure that the new administration had to face are shown, in particular the dependence on oil revenues. The need for a fiscal reform that increased income, diminish fiscal evasion and labour informality was evident. In the second part of the paper the actual reform measures are discussed, as well as its various measurable impacts. It is particularly relevant the unexpected oil price drop and the government response to maintain gasoline prices and thus prevent fiscal revenues from declining, as well as the government's repeated forecasting mistakes. Finally, it is concluded that in spite of being insufficient, Pena Nieto's fiscal reform was successful in increasing the fiscal burden from 8.4% of GDP in 2012 to 13.1% in 2017. However, such increase in revenues was not enough to prevent the rise of the public debt in almost 10 percentage points of GDP, in spite of the fact that the government took the operational surpluses of Banco de Mexico.","[Cardenas Sanchez, Enrique] Univ Iberoamer Puebla, Cholula, Mexico",,"Sánchez, EC (通讯作者)，Univ Iberoamer Puebla, Cholula, Mexico.",enrique.cardenas@iberopuebla.mx,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,3,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

The results, based on data from 285 cities in China from 2003 to 2014, show the following. (1) Not only does environmental regulation have a significant impact on the location choice of FDI, but FDI tends to flow to a city with more relaxed environmental regulation. Environmental regulation can also trigger the near transfer effect of FDI. (2) FDI has a significant spatial spillover effect and this spatial spillover effect has an important impact on FDI and environmental regulation in a particular city. (3) Although multinationals choose a city with more relaxed environmental regulations when they invest in China, FDI inflows have increased both the number and severity of local environmental regulations, indicating that the pollution haven hypothesis does not hold in China. (4) Environmental regulation has a significant spatial spillover effect, and this spatial spillover effect has an important impact on both environmental regulation and FDI in cities.

We examine the impact of competition from these surgical centres on the efficiency - measured by pre-surgery length of stay for hip and knee replacement patients - and case mix of incumbent public hospitals. We exploit the fact that the government chose the broad locations where these surgical centres (Independent Sector Treatment Centres or ISTCs) would be built based on local patient waiting times - not length of stay or clinical quality - to construct treatment and control groups that are comparable with respect to key outcome variables of interest. Using a difference-in-difference estimation strategy, we find that the government-facilitated entry of surgical centres led to shorter pre-surgery length of stay at nearby public hospitals. However, these new entrants took on healthier patients and left incumbent hospitals treating patients who were sicker. This paper highlights a potential trade-off that policymakers face when they promote competition from private, for-profit firms in markets for the provision of public services. (C) 2018 The Authors.

In contrast to most Europeans, who get universal health insurance from the government, most working-age Americans get health insurance through their employers. We find that the employment-based health insurance system provides Americans with an extra incentive to work and work full-time. In a calibrated version of the model, we assess the extent to which the different health insurance systems account for the differences in employment rate and full-time/part-time shares of workers between the U.S. and European countries. Our quantitative results suggest that the different health insurance systems can account for a significant fraction of the differences in employment rate and full-time/part-time shares of workers between the two regions. In addition, we find that the employment-based health insurance system is one of the reasons why many Americans work more than Europeans. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Informational frictions limit the amount of external funds that banks can raise. In this framework, I consider two types of financial intermediation: traditional banking and shadow banking. By pooling different loans, shadow banks achieve a higher endogenous leverage compared to traditional banks, increasing credit availability. However, shadow banks also make the financial sector more fragile because of the lower quality of the loans they finance and because of their exposure to bank runs. In this setting, unconventional monetary policy can reduce macroeconomic instability.","[Ferrante, Francesco] Fed Reserve Board, 20th & C St NW, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Ferrante, F (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board, 20th & C St NW, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",francesco.ferrante@frb.gov,,,,,,,65,17,22,5,35,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7707,1945-7715,,AM ECON J-MACROECON,Am.

Our results demonstrate that the welfare consequences of a given policy vary substantially across these two groups. For agents born into the future steady state, the expected non-environmental welfare costs are minimized when carbon tax revenue is used to reduce an existing distortionary tax. In contrast, among the agents alive when the policy is adopted, recycling revenue through uniform, lump-sum rebates results in the largest welfare increase across the policies we examine. Moreover, we find that the regressivity or progressivity of a policy also differs within the living population versus the future steady state population. Overall, our results illustrate that estimates of the non-environmental welfare costs of carbon tax policies that are based on the long-run outcomes miss-represent the near-term consequences. Given the potential importance of these near-term effects on the political feasibility of a policy, our findings indicate that, when designing a carbon tax, policy makers must pay careful attention to not only the long-run outcomes, but also to the transitional welfare effects of the policy.

The study finds significant variation in the time and cost to obtain an electricity connection across countries. In low-income countries, for instance, the cost of an electricity connection is 70 times higher than in high income countries. The study finds that income levels and a newly constructed Getting Electricity index that combines data for the three measures (procedures, cost and time) are strongly correlated and that the new index cannot predict electrification rates and losses in the electricity system once differences in income level are considered. However, the new index presented has explanatory power for economic losses that firms report due to the poor quality of electricity supply and the likelihood of bribe payments asked from firms by electric utilities. The paper also finds that procedures for connection processes tend to be more cumbersome in countries where other regulatory processes are also complex, suggesting a persistence of bureaucracy across public sector entities in countries. Finally, the study finds that simpler and less costly electricity connection processes are associated with better firm performance in industries with high electricity needs, such as manufacturing motor vehicles.

Their Phillips curve was vertical in the long run at the natural unemployment rate, and their short-run curve shifted up whenever unemployment was pushed below the natural rate. This paper criticizes the underlying assumption of the Friedman-Phelps approach that the labor market continuously clears and that changes in unemployment down or up occur only in response to 'fooling' of workers, firms, or both. A preferable and resolutely Keynesian approach explains quantity rationing by inertia in price and wage setting. The positive correlation of inflation and unemployment in the 1970s and again in the 1990s is explained by joining the negatively sloped Phillips curve with a positively sloped dynamic demand curve. For any given growth of nominal GDP, higher inflation implies slower real GDP growth and higher unemployment. This 'triangle' model based on demand, supply, and inertia worked well to explain why inflation and unemployment were both positively and negatively correlated between the 1960s and 1990s, but in the past decade the slope of the short-run Phillips curve has flattened as inflation exhibited a muted response to high unemployment in 2009-2013 and low unemployment in 2016-2018.","[Gordon, Robert J.] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Gordon, Robert J.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Northwestern University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Gordon, RJ (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.;Gordon, RJ (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,Smith-Richardson Foundation,Smith-Richardson Foundation,This research has been supported by the Smith-Richardson Foundation.

In other models, mixtures of debt and equity are exactly optimal, and pure debt securities are approximately optimal.

Decades after the SDY program ended, increased access to migration in cities that sent SDY leads to higher rates of migration from provinces where those SDY temporarily resided. We find that improved access to migration leads to lower consumption volatility and lower asset holding. Furthermore, household production shifts into high-risk, high-return activities.","[Kinnan, Cynthia] Tufts Univ, Dept Econ, 8 Upper Campus Rd, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Wang, Shing-Yi] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, 1456 Steinberg Hall,Dietrich Hall, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Wang, Yongxiang] Univ Southern Calif, Marshall Sch Business, Finance & Business Econ Dept, Los Angeles, CA USA",Tufts University; University of Pennsylvania; University of Southern California,"Kinnan, C (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Dept Econ, 8 Upper Campus Rd, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",cynthia.kinnan@tufts.edu; was@wharton.upenn.edu; yongxiaw@marshall.usc.odu,"Wang, Yongxiang/HGB-4562-2022",,China National Science Foundation [71472180]; Australian Research Council [DP150102339],China National Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"A previous version of this paper was circulated as Relaxing Migration Constraints for Rural Households.

Time-varying volatility connectedness characteristics are identified by combining a multivariate heteroscedastic autoregressive (HAR) model with the DCC-GARCH model. The results verify the existence of volatility spillover from the US crude oil market to China's agricultural commodity markets, although the magnitude of this spillover is weak. Furthermore, the realised volatility is decomposed into positive and negative components to identify the asymmetric effect of volatility connectedness. The results show that market interdependence has obviously increased for negative volatility relative to positive volatility, implying that volatility transmission has a leverage effect across markets.

Evidence from oil-exporting countries,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Crude oil price; Exchange rate; MS-VAR model,SWITCHING MODEL; CRUDE-OIL; REAL; CURRENCIES,"The bi-directional causality between exchange rates and oil prices of oil-exporting countries has been widely investigated since the oil crisis in the 1970s. The classical theoretical framework assumes that countries adopt free-floating exchange rate arrangements, and empirical studies seldom consider exchange rate restrictions when investigating oil exporters that always manage exchange rates. To address these limitations, this study designs a comparative analysis for three groups of oil-exporting economies that adopt different foreign exchange rate policies. The analysis aims to examine whether and how intervention behavior may distort the causal relationship between exchange rates and oil prices. We first show the non-linear causality relationships for countries with free-floating exchange rate arrangements in both long and short terms. Then, we establish how the managed floating policy can eliminate the impact of oil prices on exchange rates in bull markets but fail to prevent exchange rate depreciation in bear markets. In bear markets, a negative non-linear feedback from exchange rates to oil prices prevails in these countries. However, contrary to common wisdom, the strict soft-pegged exchange rate arrangement cannot remove all the linkages between exchange rates and oil prices. A small but significant response of exchange rates toward oil prices is detected for Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. A similar effect for Kazakhstan is only found in bear markets. In addition, this study re-investigates the relationship between exchange rate and the domestic currency price of oil. The conclusions are similar, except that the relationship is weakened in free-floating countries but strengthened in managed floating countries during the bear market periods. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Energy-economic planning models are often used to develop future projections of these technologies, and although it is well-understood that model outcomes are sensitive to assumptions about technology developments and market conditions, it is less clear how underlying model structures might impact outcomes. For wind and solar technologies, model structures might be an even larger driver due to the complexity required to represent their variability, uncertainty, and location-dependence. Here, we apply three state-of-the-art electric sector planning models to evaluate variable renewable generation under different conditions with both harmonized and native input assumptions to isolate the impact that model structures might have on deployment outcomes. We find growth in wind and solar deployment in all models under a business-as-usual scenario (without new policies), where the median value for variable renewable energy generation share is found to be 27% by 2050 but with a wide range of estimates (18-43%), types of renewable technologies deployed, and regional distributions across models. With harmonized assumptions about technology costs and market conditions the range narrows slightly, but a large range in penetration outcomes remains (24-41% by 2050) suggesting that model representations play significant roles in projections of future wind and solar deployment. We also assess the implications of achieving 55% wind and solar penetration by 2050-to assess potential challenges at higher penetration levels and the magnitude of variable generation under a carbon-constrained future. Finally, we identify research needs to better assess the future deployment of variable renewable energy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Methodology: Using the Quadratic Market Model, with mobile time windows, along with Granger causality tests, this article analyzes the performance and leadership in investments of six PFAs in the five existing multifunds in Chile, from September 2010 to March 2016. Results: The results indicate that the multifunds show abilities that do not reach to compensate the commissions charged. However, in terms of net performance of commissions, compared to the industry average, the pension fund administrators, Modelo and Habitat respectively, stand out in all the multifunds. In addition, no relationship between investment leadership and net performance of commissions is detected. Conclusions: The article concludes by highlighting the importance of the commissions in the net performance of the multifunds and the potential effect that a greater number of competitors would have on the industry. In this regard, the Pension Fund Administrator Modelo stands out, which shows approximately 1.63% of better performance than the industry average, due to its lower commission detected in the entire analysis period.","[Sandoval Alamos, Eduardo] Univ Tecnol Metropolitana, Fac Ingn, Dept Ind, Santiago, Chile; [Germany Morrison, Benjamin] Univ Concepcion, Gest Ind, Concepcion, Chile",Universidad Tecnologica Metropolitana; Universidad de Concepcion,"Alamos, ES (通讯作者)，Univ Tecnol Metropolitana, Fac Ingn, Dept Ind, Santiago, Chile.",eduardo.sandoval@utem.cl; benjamin.g.m@gmail.com,"Sandoval Álamos, Eduardo/ABC-2858-2021","Sandoval Álamos, Eduardo/0000-0003-3529-2827",,,,,32,0,0,0,6,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

Factor copula is introduced to simulate the corresponding carbon finance credit risk and market risk by latent variables in an indirect method. In short, the four common factors in carbon financing - exchange rates, interest rates, CER price, and Brent oil prices - are analyzed and explored in factor copula approach that incorporates KMV, GARCH models in two steps. The KMV and GARCH models are used to generate data that reflects the overall credit and market risk associated with each bank. Both normal copula and t-copula functions are used to simulate the parameter estimations for comparison in a new way. The value at risk for each of the six banks is calculated through a Monte Carlo simulation and compared. Additionally, we calculate shock estimates for each factor to explore the changes in both credit risk and market risk given economic shocks, also make a hypothetical analysis of the impact of the financial crisis on common factors. Overall, our findings reveal that exchange rates and oil prices are the key factors to consider in carbon financing. Ping An Bank is facing the most risk of all the banks in the sample, while the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China is carrying the least risk.

Capital flows reduce inefficient output fluctuations in this region by inducing exchange rate movements that reallocate expenditure towards the goods it produces. Restricting capital mobility hampers such an adjustment. From a global perspective, constrained efficiency entails subsidizing capital flows to address an aggregate demand externality associated with exchange rate movements. Absent cooperation, however, dynamic terms-of-trade manipulation motives drive countries to inefficiently restrict capital flows, impeding aggregate demand stabilization. (C)2018 Elsevier B.V.

More recently, especially since the 1980s, Australian governments at national and state levels, involving political parties of both the left and right, have undertaken a program of major reform of their public sectors. The relentless pace of reform has been driven by a variety of motives from pragmatic through to ideological, within a broad consensus that private delivery of services should be privileged over public. As a result, discourse about public enterprises in Australia has tended to focus on divestment and windfall revenues to assist governments to balance their budgets. The analysis in this paper will detail the major players at the national level, their governance arrangements and some consideration of how these enterprises have performed. We will also outline how the public mission of public enterprises has transformed in recent decades from a role as nation builder to one as enabler of services. In conclusion we will consider the long-term outlook including the loss of public value with declining standards of service and the reduced opportunities for further divestments with pressure on governments to seek alternative savings and revenue arrangements.","[Aulich, Chris] Univ Canberra, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Jones, Stephen; Head, Brian] Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",University of Canberra; University of Queensland,"Aulich, C (通讯作者)，Univ Canberra, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",chris.aulich@canberra.edu.au,"Jones, Stephen/AAW-1012-2020; Head, Brian/B-9918-2016","Jones, Stephen/0000-0002-3510-8017; Head, Brian/0000-0002-9915-0628",,,,,45,1,1,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

The analysis is based on the Sraffian notion of subsystems, which allows us to study what the input-output table of a country would look like under different hypotheses on the allocation of the available resources. We use the WIOD input-output tables and the related environmental accounts for 1995-2009. We show that the environmental benefits deriving from appropriate specialization patterns could be substantial. Moreover, our results suggest that CO2 reduction is not necessarily detrimental to economic activity. On the contrary, with the appropriate exploitation of suitable patterns of specialization, CO2 reduction and GDP growth may even be pursued jointly. 2018 Elsevier B.V.

If providers (nursing homes, hospitals, schools, nurseries) use closed-loop decision rules, which imply strategic interaction over time, we show that, although increased competition leads to higher quality in the steady state, quality provision is nevertheless lower than under open-loop rules, and also suboptimally low from a welfare perspective.

We also utilise the method raised by Rodrick to calculate the product and country-level export technological complexity. Based on a multinational panel data set, we show that if a country's exported products with higher product density or higher product path also have higher technological complexity, then in the short term, the country's overall export technological complexity tend to be increased, and in the long term, the effect of distribution of the path of technological complexity of exports is more significant.","[Ding, Yibing] Jilin Univ, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Li, Jiantong] Nankai Univ, Tianjin, Peoples R China",Jilin University; Nankai University,"Ding, YB (通讯作者)，Jilin Univ, Sch Econ, 2699 Qianjin St, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China.",dingyb@jlu.edu.cn,,"Ding, Yibing/0000-0003-2617-0270",,,,,15,3,4,2,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

We find that inheritances reduce wealth inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient or top wealth shares, but that they increase absolute dispersion. This duality in effects stems from the fact that even though richer heirs inherit larger amounts, the relative importance of the inheritance is larger for less wealthy heirs, who inherit more relative to their pre-inheritance wealth. This is in part driven by the fact that heirs do not inherit debts, which makes the distribution of inheritances more equal than the distribution of wealth among the heirs. Behavioral adjustments seem to mitigate the equalizing effect of inheritances, possibly through higher consumption among the poorer heirs. Inheritance taxation counteracts the equalizing inheritance effect, but redistribution of inheritance tax revenues can reverse this result and make the inheritance tax equalizing. Finally, we also find that inheritances increase intragenerational wealth mobility, but the effect is short-lived. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

Even when considering a relatively short time frame spanning the 1960s to the present, it is possible to point to many significant changes to the framework. Some of the changes were precipitated by acute economic conditions; others were considered and implemented only gradually, as a response to long-standing problems with the framework. But to date, the process for evaluating and changing frameworks has not always been transparent, and changes have not always been timely. Could a more formal, and open, review process improve how well we adhere to our current framework? Could transitions to a new framework be made more effectively? We conclude that such a review might indeed be beneficial, and outline one possible review process.","[Fuhrer, Jeff; Olivei, Giovanni P.; Rosengren, Eric S.; Tootell, Geoffrey M.

These models are traditionally based on latent classes, where each class represents a choice heuristic. Different specification challenges arise from applying the traditional approaches and identifiability issues are not unusual. We propose a Mixed Heuristic Model (MHM) to identify the presence of different choice heuristics through a latent class approach, giving higher flexibility to the class membership function through a random variable and analyse it at an individual level. The MHM identifies individuals who are likely to have followed the choice heuristic without explicitly specifying the class membership function. The MHM also avoids specifying the class membership and choice levels simultaneously. The MHM is tested on simulated data and applied to model an air travel survey. Results show that the MHM is able to identify the presence and structure of the heuristics with high accuracy within the simulated data. On the real data, the MHM identifies Random Utility Maximization and Stochastic Satisficing behaviour within the individuals.","[Gonzalez-Valdes, Felipe; Raveau, Sebastian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Transport Engn & Logist, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Gonzalez-Valdes, F (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Transport Engn & Logist, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.",fagonzalezv@uc.cl,"Raveau, Sebastian/M-9209-2013; Raveau, Sebastian/AAB-4613-2021","Raveau, Sebastian/0000-0003-2883-6742","Centro de Desarrollo Urbano Sustantable, CEDEUS (from CONICYT) [FONDAP 15110020]; Bus Rapid Transit Centre of Excellence - Volvo Research and Educational Foundations","Centro de Desarrollo Urbano Sustantable, CEDEUS (from CONICYT); Bus Rapid Transit Centre of Excellence - Volvo Research and Educational Foundations","This research was supported by the Centro de Desarrollo Urbano Sustantable, CEDEUS (FONDAP 15110020 from CONICYT) and the Bus Rapid Transit Centre of Excellence funded by the Volvo Research and Educational Foundations.",,42,7,7,1,16,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

Movements in credit spreads are far more successful than movements in the external finance mix in predicting near-term changes in real economic activity in ten EMU countries. However, the forecasting performance of the three credit spreads evaluated in this paper is uneven. A risk premium extracted from individual corporate bond yields predicts economic activity fairly well in Germany and Southern Europe. Two other credit spreads, the 'spread' and the 'ECB-spread', have predictive power for some measures of economic activity but they fail to predict consistently across either a range of economic indicators or countries.","[Guender, Alfred, V] Univ Canterbury, Dept Econ & Finance, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand",University of Canterbury,"Guender, AV (通讯作者)，Univ Canterbury, Dept Econ & Finance, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand.",Alfred.Guender@canterbury.ac.nz,,"Guender, Alfred/0000-0001-6234-5643",Bank of Estonia in Tallinn,Bank of Estonia in Tallinn,"I am grateful for the hospitality and the research support of the Bank of Estonia in Tallinn.

In this paper, we propose a test that can jointly check the two specifications in an MEM admitting a Markov structure. The proposed test is constructed by comparing the nonparametric kernel estimator with a parametric estimator of the marginal density function. Its asymptotic properties under the null and the alternative hypotheses are established. We propose a parametric bootstrap procedure to approximate the null distribution. A simulation study shows that the proposed test enjoys nice finite sample performance, while a real data example demonstrates its practical merit. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We explore this question by introducing the role of bank conduct into the structure-performance relationship. We apply Two-step System GMM dynamic panel model to commercial banks in the Association of South East Asian Nations over the period of 1999-2014. The results indicate that the higher profits in concentrated banking industries are partially attributable to the anti-competitive conduct of banks. These findings are robust across alternative measures of market structure and bank conduct, and different time horizons. The implications of these findings require regulators to make sure that the consolidation policy for ASEAN is achieving its purpose - i.e. financial stability - and not allowing the banks to earn monopoly rents.
