J,"Abdul-Manan, AFN",,,,"Abdul-Manan, Amir F.

Two documented unintended effects are the indirect land use change (ILUC) and indirect energy use change (IEUC). ILUC has been included in many lifecycle GHG studies of biofuels, but IEUC has remained relatively elusive. This paper presents an updated assessment of the lifecycle GHG emissions of palm biodiesel from Malaysia and, for the first time, incorporating the two estimated indirect effects simultaneously. Future GHG emissions of palm biodiesel are projected by taking into account of Malaysia's Economic Transformation Programme (ETP) that aims to reform the oil palm industry in order to achieve a high-income nation. Uncertainties associated with lifecycle GHG models were dealt with using Monte Carlo simulation in order to identify the breadth and likelihood of GHG reductions relative to petroleum-based fuels in the context of the European directives. This study has shown that the ETP, if successfully implemented, can significantly improve the direct GHG emissions of palm biodiesel, but the benefits are offset by the rise in global emissions due to ILUC and IEUC. Biofuel policies should also include IEUC, in addition to ILUC, to avoid GHG emissions leakages.","[Abdul-Manan, Amir F.

Energy-intensive and trade-exposed (EITE.,) industries in industrialized countries are concerned on stringent domestic emission pricing that puts them at a competitive disadvantage against producers of similar goods in other countries with more lenient emission regulation. This paper focuses on climate policy design in the United States of America (US) and compares the economic implications of four alternative protective measures for US EITE industries: (i) output-based rebates, (ii) exemptions from emission pricing, (iii) energy intensity standards, and (iv) carbon intensity standards. Using a large-scale computable general equilibrium model we quantify how these protective measures affect competitiveness of US EITE industries. We find that protective measures can improve common trade-related competitiveness indicators such as revealed comparative advantage or relative world trade shares but at the same time may lead to a decline in the output value for EITE industries because of negative income effects. The economy-wide cost of emission abatement under protective measures increase as compared to uniform emission pricing stand-alone such that the gains of protective measures for EITE exports may be more than compensated through losses in domestic EITE demand.","[Boehringer, Christoph] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany; [Garcia-Muros, Xaquin; Cazcarro, Ignacio; Arto, Inaki] Basque Ctr Climate Change, Bilbao, Spain",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3),"Böhringer, C (通讯作者)，Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany.",boehringer@uni-oldenburg.de,"C, Ignacio Cazcarro/AFA-1858-2022","C, Ignacio Cazcarro/0000-0001-7517-0053; Garcia-Muros, Xaquin/0000-0002-2667-3292",,,,,41,22,23,1,30,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2017,104.0,,,,,,446,454,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.01.007,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP7HS,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397549500045,0

The mechanism sets binding energy-saving targets on electricity and gas distributors with at least 50,000 clients and includes a voluntary opt-in model for participation from other parties. This paper investigates and assesses the elements of the scheme that help overcome several barriers to deliver industrial energy efficiency. Results from a survey conducted among leading experts indicate that the Italian system provides a strong financial incentive to energy efficiency investments, covering a significant share of investment costs and thus reducing payback time. Moreover, the scheme fosters the development of energy service companies (ESCOs), which are key to developing, installing and arranging finance for projects on the ground. In conjunction with other policies, the mechanism also raises awareness of energy efficiency investment opportunities, thus helping overcome the market failure of insufficient information. Core challenges remain, including tackling regulatory uncertainty and improving access to finance.","[Stede, Jan] German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Climate Policy Dept, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Stede, J (通讯作者)，German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Climate Policy Dept, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",jstede@diw.de,,,,,,,76,31,32,3,23,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2017,104.0,,,,,,112,123,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.01.031,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP7HS,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397549500012,0

It values the improvement of water quality in Switzerland in terms of the reduction in environmental and public health risks that would result from implementing new wastewater treatment technologies that substantially reduce micropollutant discharges into water bodies. Results show that the risk ladder significantly influences respondents' choice behavior and welfare estimates, but not choice certainty.

Less than half of that capital was returned; as a result, funding has dried up in the cleantech sector. But as the International Energy Agency warns, without new energy technologies, the world cannot cost-effectively confront climate change. In this article, we present the most comprehensive account to date of the cleantech VC boom and bust. Our results aggregate hundreds of investments to calculate the risk and return profile of cleantech, and we compare the outcomes with those of medical and software technology investments. Cleantech posed high risks and yielded low returns to VCs. We conclude that among cleantech investments, deep technology investments in companies developing new hardware, materials, chemistries, or manufacturing processes consumed the most capital and yielded the lowest returns. We propose that broader support from policymakers, corporations, and investors is needed to underpin new innovation pathways for cleantech.","[Gaddy, Benjamin E.] Clean Energy Trust, Chicago, IL 60606 USA; [Sivaram, Varun] Council Foreign Relat, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Jones, Timothy B.] TBJ Investments LLC, Washington, DC 20003 USA; [Wayman, Libby] Gen Elect, Boston, MA 02111 USA",General Electric,"Gaddy, BE (通讯作者)，Clean Energy Trust, Chicago, IL 60606 USA.",,,,U.S. Department of Energy; American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Science & Technology Policy Fellowship,U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Science & Technology Policy Fellowship,"The authors are grateful to David Danielson, Reuben Sarkar, Eli Levine, Jennifer Garson, Erik Birkerts, Paul Seidler, Alex Foucault, Johanna Wolfson, Teryn Norris, Sabrina Howell, Melissa Lott, Tonio Buonassisi, Ilan Gur, John MacWilliams, Rob Writz, Stephen Lacey, Shayle Kann, Kenneth Alston, Rob Day, Ashley Grosh, Veery Maxwell, Rich Hossfeld, Alex Payne, Joshua Posamentier, Greg Mulholland, John Balbach, and Tom Burton for helpful discussions and comments.

Scientific policy advice (SPA) has been involved in their evolution from the beginning. This paper draws on the Advocacy Coalition Framework and on discourse and narrative theory to study the role of SPA in recent German energy policy. We explore 1) whether scientific advisors have been members of advocacy coalitions, and 2) how their contributions may have interacted with the evolution of the discourses and major narratives. We perform a qualitative text analysis of 50 SPA reports published between 2000 and 2015. We find that the majority of studies clearly take sides in the debate, and that in most cases the reports' positions are fully transparent. Despite the polarization, SPA provides differentiated information on key aspects of the discourses, and alternative design options for policy instruments. We conclude that SPA contributions have improved the conditions for political consensus and compromise. Collectively, SPA studies provide a basis for mapping different policy pathways and their consequences. In the future, SPA should address additional critical issues such as coal phase-out and international leadership.","[Leipprand, Anna; Flachsland, Christian] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer Str 12-15, D-10829 Berlin, Germany; [Leipprand, Anna] Tech Univ Berlin, Econ Climate Change, Str 17 Juni 145, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; [Flachsland, Christian] Hertie Sch Governance, Friedrichstr 180, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Pahle, Michael] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, POB 60 12 03, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany",Technical University of Berlin; Hertie School; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Leipprand, A (通讯作者)，Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer Str 12-15, D-10829 Berlin, Germany.",leipprand@mcc-berlin.net; flachsland@mcc-berlin.net; michael.pahle@pik-potsdam.de,,"Flachsland, Christian/0000-0001-8632-5794",Reiner Lemoine Stiftung through a PhD fellowship [10041954],Reiner Lemoine Stiftung through a PhD fellowship,"This work was supported by Reiner Lemoine Stiftung through a PhD fellowship to Anna Leipprand, administered by Technische Universitat Berlin under Project Number 10041954.

This will require countries to act upon climate change and achieve a significant reduction in their greenhouse gas emissions which will play a pivotal role in shaping future energy systems. Saudi Arabia is the World's largest exporter of crude oil, and the 11th largest CO2 emitter. Understanding the Kingdom's role in global greenhouse gas reduction is critical in shaping the future of fossil fuels. Hence, this work presents an optimisation study to understand how Saudi Arabia can meet the CO2 reduction targets to achieve the 80% reduction in the power generation sector. It is found that the implementation of energy efficiency measures is necessary to enable meeting the 80% target, and it would also lower costs of transition to low carbon energy system while maintaining cleaner use of hydrocarbons with CCS. Setting very deep GHG reduction targets may be economically uncompetitive in consideration of the energy supply requirements. In addition, we determine the breakeven price of crude oil needed to make CCS economically viable. Results show important dimension for pricing CO2 and the role of CCS compared with alternative sources of energy.","[Alshammari, Yousef M.; Sarathy, S.

They also suffer from sample selection issues and further bias driven by spells out of work. We consider these issues together for UK data, the National Child Development Study and British Cohort Study, for the first time. When all three biases are considered, our best estimate of lifetime intergenerational economic persistence in the UK is 0.43 for children born in 1970. Whilst we argue that this is the best available estimate to date, we discuss why there is good reason to believe that this is still a lower bound, owing to residual attenuation bias.","[Gregg, Paul] Univ Bath, Dept Social & Policy Sci, Bath BA2 7AY, North East Some, England; [Gregg, Paul] Univ Bath, Ctr Anal Social Policy, Bath BA2 7AY, North East Some, England; [MacMillan, Lindsey] UCL Inst Educ, Dept Social Sci, 20 Bedford Way, London WC1H 0AL, England; [Vittori, Claudia] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Econ & Law, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy",University of Bath; University of Bath; University of London; University College London; UCL Institute of Education; Sapienza University Rome,"Gregg, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Dept Social & Policy Sci, Bath BA2 7AY, North East Some, England.;Gregg, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Ctr Anal Social Policy, Bath BA2 7AY, North East Some, England.",p.gregg@bath.ac.uk; l.macmillan@ucl.ac.uk; claudia.vittori@uniroma1.it,"Macmillan, Lindsey/B-1840-2016","Macmillan, Lindsey/0000-0003-1262-303X",ESRC [ES/K005804/1]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K005804/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K005804/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We appreciate the comments from two reviewers who have helped to improve this paper considerably.

Creating interconnected offshore grids that combine cross-border links and connections of offshore plants to shore offers multiple economic and environmental advantages for Europe's energy system. However, despite evidence that integrated solutions can be more beneficial than traditional radial connection practices, no such projects have been deployed yet. In this paper we quantify costs and benefits of integrated projects and investigate to which extent the cost-benefit sharing mechanism between participating countries can impede or encourage the development of integrated projects. Three concrete interconnection case studies in the North Sea area are analysed in detail using a national-level power system model. Model outputs are used to compute the net benefit of all involved stakeholders under different allocation schemes. Given the asymmetric distribution of costs and benefits, we recommend to consistently apply the Positive Net Benefit Differential mechanism as a starting point for negotiations on the financial closure of investments in integrated offshore infrastructure.","[Konstantelos, Ioannis; Pudjianto, Danny; Strbac, Goran] Imperial Coll London, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, London, England; [De Decker, Jan; Joseph, Pieter; Flament, Aurore; Kreutzkamp, Paul] 3E, Brussels, Belgium; [Genoes, Fabio] CEPS, Brussels, Belgium; [Rehfeldt, Leif; Wallasch, Anna-Kathrin; Gerdes, Gerhard] Deutsch WindGuard, Varel, Germany; [Jafar, Muhammad; Yang, Yongtao; Tidemand, Nicolaj] DNV GL, Oslo, Norway; [Jansen, Jaap; Nieuwenhout, Frans; van der Welle, Adriaan; Veum, Karina] ECN, Sint Maartensvlotbrug, Netherlands",Imperial College London; DNV,"Konstantelos, I (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll London, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, London, England.",i.konstantelos@imperial.ac.uk; d.pudjianto@imperial.ac.uk; g.strbac@imperial.ac.uk; jan.dedecker@3e.eu; pieter.joseph@3e.eu; aurore.flament@3e.eu; paul.kreutzkamp@3e.eu; fabio.genoese@ceps.eu; l.rehfeldt@windguard.de; a.wallasch@windguard.de; g.gerdes@windguard.de; muhammad.jafar@dnvgl.com; yongtao.yang@dnvgl.com; nicolaj.tidemand@dnvgl.com; j.jansen@ecn.nl; nieuwenhout@ecn.nl; vanderwelle@ecn.nl; veum@ecn.nl,,,"Intelligent Energy Europe [IEE/12/974]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/N005996/1, EP/E020798/1, EP/N006224/1, EP/L014106/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/N006224/1, EP/E020798/1, EP/N005996/1, EP/L014106/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Intelligent Energy Europe; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This work was funded by Intelligent Energy Europe (Contract number IEE/12/974).,,18,37,37,4,26,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2017,101.0,,,,,,28,41,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.11.024,0.0,,,14,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EI8PD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000392768800004,0

A survey had been carried out about public acceptance of constructing coastal/inland Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) in China. We examined impact factors of public acceptance of nuclear energy and also carried out a comparison between China and OECD. The study revealed that the public still took relatively optimistic attitude although there was a slight decrease just after Fukushima and the public's confidence recovered four years later. The ratio of inland NPPs opponents reached to quite a high level and not-in-my-back-yard still reflected an obvious syndrome. We also found public acceptance is mainly affected by benefit and, to a lesser extent, by knowledge, education and age. Moreover, the study suggested government is still a creditable information resource due to its authority but most of respondents felt little or no well-informed about nuclear safety, which means a significant communication gap exists between government and the public. As China is the most ambitious country to develop nuclear energy, it is proposed to introduce a transparent and open system of third party evaluation, which mainly consists of scientists and non-profit research institutions, to ensure the healthy and sustainable development of nuclear energy.","[Wu, Yican] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Nucl Energy Safety Technol, Key Lab Neutron & Radiat Safety, Hefei 230031, Anhui, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, CAS","Wu, YC (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Nucl Energy Safety Technol, Key Lab Neutron & Radiat Safety, Hefei 230031, Anhui, Peoples R China.",yican.wu@fds.org.cn,,,Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA03040000]; University of Science and Technology of China [2014FXCX004]; Key Technologies of Nuclear Safety and Radiation Protection of Fusion Energy [2014GB112000]; Fusion Reactor Safety and Radioactive Source Term Evaluation System Analysis [2014GB112001]; Research on Reliability Targets and Probabilistic Safety Goals for Fusion Facility [2015GB116000]; Major/Innovative Program of Development Foundation of Hefei Center for Physical Science and Technology,Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); University of Science and Technology of China(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Key Technologies of Nuclear Safety and Radiation Protection of Fusion Energy; Fusion Reactor Safety and Radioactive Source Term Evaluation System Analysis; Research on Reliability Targets and Probabilistic Safety Goals for Fusion Facility; Major/Innovative Program of Development Foundation of Hefei Center for Physical Science and Technology,"The authors appreciate the efforts of the other FDS Team members, as well as the support of Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant no.

As it can be assumed, it is difficult to separate the effects and impacts that the World Bank's loans have had on the economy of Romania, because the Romanian government acts in collaboration with other international financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European Investment Bank. The purpose of the present research is to determine the impact of the World Bank loans to Romania during the global financial and economic crisis. As part of the research, the main factors that influenced the Romanian policy of foreign loans and their impact have been identified. Also, the paper contains the main effects of these loans to the economic and social development of Romania during the 2008-2014 period. The paper also contains a series of recommendations for improving cooperation between Romania and the World Bank in order to strengthen the economic and social growth recorded by Romania in recent years. Data analysis was done by multiple linear regression method. The main results show that Romania's partnership with the World Bank had a positive impact on the economic development of the country. The main areas in which the effects were noticeable are: fiscal management; public administration, energy, health and education. The model developed by Romania can be of interest for the other countries of Central and Eastern Europe too.","[Androniceanu, Armenia] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Dragulanescu, Irina Virginia] Dimitrie Cantemir Christian Univ Constanta, Constanta, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Androniceanu, A (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",armenia.androniceanu@man.ase.ro; dirvimail@yahoo.com,"Dragulanescu, Irina Virginia/IAO-8199-2023; Androniceanu, Armenia/AAC-4697-2020",,,,,,24,0,0,0,4,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,37,44,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059200006,0

International accreditation systems also contribute to such unification, as they enforce standard framework for educational process. However, in reality we see a different situation: customization-up to a single learner's requirements - is a key competitive strength. Customization has become one of the key business principles for saturated markets. We have carried out a survey of Russian Association of Business Education members in order to identify tools that Russian business schools use to adapt to customization trend. The results of our surveys showed that they abandon long expensive educational programs for shorter and cheaper programs (instead of using the package approach they adopt a quantum approach, where each piece is sold separately); report a rapid growth of online education programs (customization of time and place of learning); invite experts from outside of their schools, they use network models to be more flexible and adaptable; adopt new business models (freemium, subscription, dynamic pricing, on-demand courses etc.); introduce marketing, educational, communicative innovations into their processes. Schools consider language barrier, normative regulation and lack of new marketing strategies to be the key factors impeding their ability to compete on global markets. In May 2017 Russia adopted a national program to enhance export of education. Russian educational community will be looking for a balance between standardized global requirements and new approaches to innovative customization of educational programs.","[Gerasimenko, Valentina; Molchanova, Olga] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Econ Fac, Moscow, Russia",Lomonosov Moscow State University,"Gerasimenko, V (通讯作者)，Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Econ Fac, Moscow, Russia.",vv_gerasimenko@mail.ru; molchanovaop@econ.msu.ru,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,503,510,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059200067,0

FDI have been playing important role in the process of development of the Slovak economy, too. Based on this, the main aim of the article is to point out the importance of FDI for Slovakia. The first part is devoted to the theoretical aspects related to FDI and synthesis of existing knowledge; in the following parts, mainly analytical, will be presented chosen findings from the study that is dealing with the relationship between inward FDI inflows and selected macro indicators in Slovakia at the national level and at the level of regions (NUTS 3). The statistical analyses is conducted based on already officially published data. Except that, results from other researches on FDIs are used and presented.","[Kramarova, Katarina] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Kramarova, K (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",katarina.kramarova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Kramarova, Katarina/P-2705-2015","Kramarova, Katarina/0000-0001-6883-3541",,,,,25,1,1,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1169,1177,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059202017,0

Influenced by the boost of electronic and social media, a digital and independent knowledge economy focused on a collective, dispersed cultural idea of reputation as usefulness resulted. Imagining reputation as a type of value is the predominant elucidatory pattern of knowledge work in the digital epoch. We plan to determine that reputation becomes a particular type of particularized social capital for knowledge employees. We use meta-analysis to assess evidence proving that because the social buttons managing social undertakings on digital media platforms deal with and preserve an individual's full online activity, determining it with statistics, the reputation of a distinct employee is publicly observable, concrete, obtainable, and possibly quantifiable. We inspected the Web of Science and identified 240 papers covering the impact of reputation on the socio-economic interactions in digital labor markets. We analyzed them carefully and present our conclusions, highlighting that reputation adjusts the professional market of the knowledge economy by functioning as a particular kind of capital or positive feature for people in a setting constituted of networked and recently mediatized social interplay.","[Lazaroiu, George] Spiru Haret Univ, Fac Sociohuman Sci, Str Ion Ghica 13, Bucharest 030045, Romania; [Nica, Elvira] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Adm & Publ Management, Piata Romana 6, Bucharest 010374, Romania; [Popescu, Gheorghe H.] Dimitrie Cantemir Christian Univ, Fac Banking & Finance, Splaiul Unirii 176, Bucharest 030134, Romania",Spiru Haret University; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Lazaroiu, G (通讯作者)，Spiru Haret Univ, Fac Sociohuman Sci, Str Ion Ghica 13, Bucharest 030045, Romania.",phd_lazaroiu@yahoo.com; elvira.nica.2015@gmail.com; gheorghe.h.popescu@gmail.com,"Lazaroiu, George/A-2262-2015; Nica, Elvira/ADG-5173-2022","Nica, Elvira/0000-0002-7383-2161",,,,,30,0,0,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1275,1282,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059202030,0

For the considered biosensors the following characteristics are taken as objectives: the output current, the enzyme amount, and the biosensor sensitivity. The proposed method consists of two phases. At the first phase an approximated Pareto front is constructed, and a preliminary solution is selected. The second phase is aimed at specification of the Pareto front around the preliminary solution, and at making the final decision.

Capital firewall makes our financial market in the subprime mortgage crisis affected relatively small, reflecting the effectiveness of China's financial regulation. However, it also shows the backwardness of China's financial innovation. China's financial market must sooner or later be integrated into the international financial environment. With the rapid development of global financial markets, new financial products are constantly emerging, more derivatives, longer industrial chains and more hidden financial risks make the prevention and supervision of the financial crisis increasingly difficult. The purpose of financial supervision is to reduce the occurrence of financial risks, maintain the stability of financial order, ensure the correct implementation of monetary policy and promote economic development. Establishing and perfecting the modern financial regulatory system is not only the objective requirement of economic globalization and financial liberalization, but also the fundamental guarantee for the purpose of financial supervision.

Thanks to globalisation, their popularity is growing in all the three sectors public, private or even non-profit - as they accelerate an innovation process.

It represents a state when people living in one country travel abroad to receive a medical, dental, surgical or aesthetic care. Several various organizations, like Medical Tourism Index or Medical Tourism Association, engage in medical tourism by assessing top destinations for medical tourism, thus helping patients to choose on the basis of various indicators. The area of medical tourism in a global economy becomes an attractive business, especially for countries able to offer equal or better quality of health care for a smaller price. Free movement of goods and services, under the auspices of the World Trade Organization and its General Agreement on Trade in Services, has accelerated the liberalization of trade in medical services. Therefore, medical services have become more tradable and mobility of cross-frontier patients has increased, causing the term medical tourism to emerge after this agreement. The paper Medical Tourism in Global Market will address analysing the present state of tourism for health care and also anticipated future development, considering this area of business now worth 439 billion US dollars with 25 percent growth anticipated in next ten years. According to findings of Oxford Economics and VISA, it is expected that, alongside medical tourism, other sectors beside health care will grow - e.g. 340 new international airports in a period of decades, while the market of medical tourism can grow up to 3 trillion dollars by 2025.","[Matus, Jozef; Martovic, Matej] Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius, Fac Mass Media Commun, Skopje, North Macedonia",Saints Cyril & Methodius University of Skopje,"Martovic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius, Fac Mass Media Commun, Skopje, North Macedonia.",rektor@ucm.sk; matej.martovic@fmk.sk,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,4,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1518,1524,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059202059,0

According to the ADAC, the best campsites in Croatia hold second place in the European ranking by quality. Most of these campsites are located in Istria and the Kvarner region. The research focuses on two target groups. The first target group comprises campsite guests and the other, campsite managers. The first target group was surveyed using a structured questionnaire, while the interview method was applied to study the second target group. Research results show that the quality of camping services for guests is related to the selection of campsites and that there is a correlation between campsite quality and the quality of the tourist destination. The core competitive advantages of Croatian campsites are the beach and the sea, safety, and staff kindness. Research results are followed by recommendations for increasing the competitiveness of camping services in Croatia through the implementation of quality evaluation systems. In this respect, the paper provides guidelines for the development of national campsite quality evaluation systems based on institutional and non-institutional standards, with the aim of increasing the competitive advantage of campsites.","[Milohnic, Ines; Hrgovic, Ana-Marija Vrtodusic; Bonifacic, Josipa Cvelic] Univ Rijeka, Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management, Dept Management, Primorska 42,POB 97, Opatija 51410, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Hrgovic, AMV (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management, Dept Management, Primorska 42,POB 97, Opatija 51410, Croatia.",imilohni@fthm.hr; anamariv@fthm.hr; josipa.bonifacic@fthm.hr,"Bonifacic, Josipa Cvelic/KCL-3478-2024; Hrgović, Ana-Marija Vrtodušić/Z-1139-2018; MILOHNIĆ, INES/T-4982-2019","Hrgović, Ana-Marija Vrtodušić/0000-0001-6679-3742; MILOHNIĆ, INES/0000-0001-7487-4286",University of Rijeka [ZP UNIRI 5/17],University of Rijeka,"This paper is an output of the science project Glamping -a Factor of Campsite Quality.

Global business, which in turn leads to falling prices for products and services in the area of pricing, brings its macroeconomic positives when countries involved in the international economy reach a situation where their consumption options always exceed their production possibilities. From a microeconomic point of view, however, the globalization process brings its negative social consequences to employment, as winning global firms displace domestic producers who are unable to succeed in the global international economy. The failure of domestic producers reflects in a rise in domestic unemployment coupled with a significant reallocation of household income with all its socio-economic consequences on the domestic economy. For this reason, the pressure of domestic lobby groups is likely to influence the political and economic decision-making of national governments in the short or medium term, which, in pursuit of electoral victory, benefit from financial, media or other assistance of these very well organized groups. The subject of this contribution is to examine the above-mentioned microeconomic impacts brought about by globalization, from the prism of the theory of public choice, i.e. the economic approach examining the issue of political decision-making using the tools of economic theory.","[Novy, Milos] Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Univ 8, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Novy, M (通讯作者)，Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Univ 8, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic.",novym@kem.zcu.cz,,,Faculty of Economics of the West Bohemia University in Pilsen [SGS -2016-057],Faculty of Economics of the West Bohemia University in Pilsen,This article was created within the project SGS -2016-057 The Application of Quantitative Methods to Economic Problems. at the Faculty of Economics of the West Bohemia University in Pilsen.,,24,1,1,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1772,1780,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059203025,0

An important question is to what extent the goals, strategies and tools used by economic paradiplomacy are identical or compatible with those elements used by the state administration. A significant aspect is the attitude of the state administration towards the activities of the regions and the nature of their cooperation. This paper focuses on economic paradiplomacy in the Czech Republic and introduces a new perspective - the mutual relations of regions and the central state administration. In the introductory part, it takes a detailed look at the system of economic diplomacy and role of both state and non-state actors from the perspective of economic paradiplomacy. The text develops the expectations and aims of the mutual cooperation between regions and the state administration (based on analysis of strategic documents and available empirical data). Further, the contribution concentrates on the activities of the state administration towards regions in the area of economic diplomacy, their strategies and available instruments, and the degree of cooperation of other non-state participants. The main aim of the contribution is to assess the attitude of the state administration to the economic paradiplomacy and involvement of nonstate actors (other than regions) in this area.","[Peterkova, Jana] Univ Econ, Jan Masaryk Ctr Int Studies, Fac Int Relat, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Peterkova, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Jan Masaryk Ctr Int Studies, Fac Int Relat, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",jana.peterkova@vse.cz,"Peterková, Jana/AAY-5723-2021","Peterková, Jana/0000-0002-7206-7648",,,,,16,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1927,1934,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059203045,0

The long term idea is to collect and analyse real traffic traces collecting vehicular information, to cluster them in groups representing similar driving behaviours and then to extract from these clusters relevant parameters to tune the micro simulator. In this paper we have run controlled experiments where traffic traces have been synthetized to obtain different driving styles, so that the effectiveness of the clustering algorithm could be checked on known labels.

This virtual world provides an opportunity to penetrate into the world of E-commerce as a new centre of value creation. The new information marketspace differs significantly from the physical marketplace. When purchasing electronic services with the use of global marketplace in the form of a virtual sphere, there are services in the form of virtual information which are provided through information channels. Companies must therefore create value both in the physical world and in the virtual world. It should be borne in mind that the processes of value creation are not the same in both worlds. A proper understanding of both interacting processes that create an added value for a customer brings new conceptual and tactical challenges. Ultimately, however, companies have to do more than just create value in space; they also have to extract values from it. They can often do it by setting up space-based relationships with customers. Managers must be consciously focused on principles that govern the creation of values and the use of both value chains, individually and in combination.

These considerations are preceded by a short presentation of the essence of globalization, its measurement (the main indices) and the methodology for measuring the degree of globalization by KOF. The KOF index of globalization is in fact the basis for describing the level of globalization of individual countries and its changes in the world economy in the years 1990-2016. The paper presents the general KOF Index of Globalization and its three dimensions: economic, social and political. It presents the most and the least globalized countries. It shows the changes on the continents and in the EU countries, mainly in the EU-11 (the new EU countries - the former socialist countries). The main conclusions of the study are as follows: 1. Globalization has covered all the countries, although their level is varied; 2. The most globalized countries are European medium-sized countries; 3. Europe dominates in all dimensions of globalization; 4. The higher the level of development, the higher the degree of globalization is; 5. The rise in the level of globalization has occurred on all continents in the past quarter century, the largest in Europe (mainly in the new Member States of the EU - the former socialist countries) and Asia, and to a lesser extent in other continents.","[Swadzba, Stanislaw] Univ Econ Katowice, Ul 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Swadzba, S (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Ul 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland.",stanislaw.swadzba@ue.katowice.pl,,"Swadzba, Stanislaw/0000-0002-9006-3595",,,,,24,1,1,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2594,2601,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059204065,0

One can easily consider them as the first manifestation of the globalization processes. The methods of communication constantly improved and diversified - from messengers and postal workers, through telegraph, radio and landline phones to the mobile and satellite communication, VoIP (Skupe, Viber & other), Instagram, Telegram (messenger) etc. The telecommunication industry is rapidly developing throughout the world (Jerbashian, 2015), and Russia is no exception. However, the global economic crisis of 2008-2009 considerably influenced this industry too. The credit risks that the telecommunication companies of Russia had faced in 2006-2007, before the global crisis, caused significant changes within the structure of the Russian mobile service market. (Dengov & Tulyakova, 2015). Where initially there had been several dozen mobile operators, defining the nature of the market as a monopolistic competition, within but a few years all the key positions there were taken by four major companies (domestic MTS, Megafon, Beeline and the Swedish company Tele-2), keeping out any new operators. In the two new articles on this topic, the authors address the analysis of the pricing strategies of the major operators within the Russian telecommunication market. In the first article, they calculated the concentration indices of the industry. Their values lead the authors to the conclusion about the diluted oligopoly that has fully emerged by now in the mobile communication market. As the result of their research, the authors came to certain conclusions about the character of the pricing policies of the main mobile operators in the Russian Federation and the strategies that they implement in view of price differentiation within the different regions.","[Tulyakova, Irina R.; Dengov, Victor V.; Shkorova, Kristina] St Petersburg State Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Econ Policy, Tchaikovskogo Str 62,A 310, St Petersburg 191194, Russia",Saint Petersburg State University,"Shkorova, K (通讯作者)，St Petersburg State Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Econ Policy, Tchaikovskogo Str 62,A 310, St Petersburg 191194, Russia.",irinatulyakova@mail.ru; vvdengov@mail.ru; wxz@ya.ru,"Dengov, Viktor/G-6599-2013; TULYAKOVA, IRINA/G-3032-2015","Dengov, Viktor/0000-0002-4665-0362;",,,,,12,1,1,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2730,2737,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059205016,0

Thus, the partial aim of the paper is to bring a brief history of prediction models in the globalized context, with main emphasis given to international economic environment of V4 countries. The main aim of the paper is to suggest which model to use to predict the financial health of Slovak enterprises taking the results of the comparative analysis of V4 prediction models into account. By analysing and comparing of the V4 prediction models, we found that the processes of prediction and evaluation of an enterprise depend on a suitability of the chosen model and the resulting value reflects the environment in which the company operates as well as the ability of its partners to pay their liabilities. On the basis of the results of the international comparative analysis, the most suitable model is recommended to be used to assess the financial health of Slovak enterprises.","[Valaskova, Katarina; Podhorska, Ivana] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Valaskova, K (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",katarina.valaskova@fpedas.uniza.sk; ivana.podhorska@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Valaskova, Katarina/O-9250-2015; Podhorska, Ivana/P-2800-2015","Valaskova, Katarina/0000-0003-4223-7519; Podhorska, Ivana/0000-0001-5281-9024",Slovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-14-0841],Slovak Research and Development Agency(Slovak Research and Development Agency),"This research was financially supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency, Grant APVV-14-0841: Comprehensive Prediction Model of the Financial Health of Slovak Companies.",,30,1,1,1,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2792,2800,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059205024,0

Based on the literature on the effects of institutions on the economy, such effects are assumed to accrue through total factor productivity (TFP). Five variables to capture decentralization are proposed in order to overcome the recent criticisms of the empirical approaches regarding the proper measures of variables capturing decentralization. Panel data for the regions of Spain over the 1986-2010 period are used. In general, the results show that the financial autonomy and the share of regional investment in public infrastructure seem to positively affect the economic growth of Spanish regions. However, a negative effect is found for a proxy for the number of responsibilities transferred to the regions. Moreover, empirical evidence provided for three sub-sample periods could be suggesting that the Spanish state might be around the optimal level of decentralization. Results are fairly robust to different estimation methods and measures of TFP, regardless of the assumption of constant returns to scale.","[Aray, Henry] Univ Granada, Dept Economics, Campus Cartuja S-N, Granada 18011, Spain",University of Granada,"Aray, H (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Dept Economics, Campus Cartuja S-N, Granada 18011, Spain.",haray@ugr.es,"Aray, Henry/L-7127-2014","Aray, Henry/0000-0001-6081-0441",Fundacion Centro de Estudios Andaluces [PRY108/14],Fundacion Centro de Estudios Andaluces,Financial support from Fundacion Centro de Estudios Andaluces through project PRY108/14 is gratefully acknowledged.,,40,4,4,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

These results are robust to potentially confounding variation associated with wind speed differences determined by weather. Policy makers in regions of increasing wind generation should consider expanding the wholesale market region as a tool to deal with variability of renewable generation. Many technical experts and market participants provide anecdotes that competitive wholesale markets are beneficial for wind energy, this analysis provides the first statistical evidence to support that claim.","[Dahlke, Steve] Colorado Sch Mines, Div Econ & Business, 1500 Illinois St, Golden, CO 80401 USA",Colorado School of Mines,"Dahlke, S (通讯作者)，Colorado Sch Mines, Div Econ & Business, 1500 Illinois St, Golden, CO 80401 USA.",sdahlke@mines.edu,"Dahlke, Steve/P-2636-2019","Dahlke, Steve/0000-0001-5715-9088",Heising Simons Foundation,Heising Simons Foundation,"This report is an extension of a whitepaper published in January of 2017 by the Great Plains Institute titled, Competitive Markets and Renewables: The Effect of Wholesale Electricity Market Restructuring on Wind Generation in the Midwest.

Depending on the pace at which the electric sector decarbonizes, this increase in electric demand could correspond to a decrease in LDV greenhouse gas emissions of up to 80%. In the near term, rapid and complete transport electrification with a carbon-free grid should remain the cornerstones of transport decarbonization policy. However, long-term policy should also aim to mitigate autonomous vehicles' potential to increase driving mileage, urban and suburban sprawl, and traffic congestion while incentivizing potential energy efficiency improvements through both better system management and the lightweighting of an accident-free vehicle fleet.","[Fox-Penner, Peter] Boston Univ, Questrom Sch Business, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Gorman, Will] Univ Calif Berkeley, Energy & Resources Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Fox-Penner, Peter; Hatch, Jennifer] Boston Univ, Inst Sustainable Energy, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Boston University,"Gorman, W (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Energy & Resources Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",pfoxp@bu.edu; gorman_will@berkeley.edu; hatchj@bu.edu,"Gorman, Will/U-2934-2018","Gorman, Will/0000-0003-4990-7685",Hewlett Foundation [2016-5132]; Energy Foundation; Boston University,Hewlett Foundation; Energy Foundation; Boston University,"The authors would like to thank John Paul Helveston and Henry Kelly for their insights and reviews of earlier drafts of this manuscript.

Our analysis has two distinguishing features. Firstly, it adopts a robustness approach by (a) using both parametric and semi-parametric methods, and (b) analysing different geographical scales. Secondly, it strictly adheres to the EKC narrative by (a) not using control variables and (b) taking Energy and CO2 in absolute rather than in per capita terms, which is consistent with the fact that Nature cares about absolute pressures. We show how evidence for EKC changes depending on the model specification, the sample, and the used variables. Hence, this paper contributes to explaining why the literature on the EKC gives mixed results. The multiscale perspective and some theoretical considerations, however, tell how to perform the analysis appropriately. Thus, we can affirm that, both for CO2 and Energy, the fragile evidence of EKC that was emerging at the end of the last century has vanished with the new wave of globalization. There is only evidence of decreasing elasticities for very-high income countries. Interestingly, the great recession might have produced structural reductions in TPES and CO2 in the affected countries. Finally, the case of Germany, which shows EKC patterns, indicates that active energy policies can reduce energy and CO2 without harming the economy.","[Luzzati, Tommaso; Gucciardi, Gianluca] Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Econ & Management, Pisa, Italy; [Orsini, Marco] Inst Etud & Conseils Dev Durable ICEDD, Namur, Belgium",University of Pisa,"Luzzati, T (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Econ & Management, Pisa, Italy.",tommaso.luzzati@unipi.it,"Gucciardi, Gianluca/ABD-6543-2020","Gucciardi, Gianluca/0000-0002-8814-5575",PRA 2017 grant of the University of Pisa,PRA 2017 grant of the University of Pisa,"We gratefully acknowledge precious comments and suggestions on earlier versions of this paper received from participants in the Biennial International Workshop Advances in Energy Studies: Energy futures, environment and well-being (Naples, Italy, 25-28 September 2017), in the 12th Conference of the European Society for Ecological Economics: Ecological Economics in Action: Building a Reflective and Inclusive Community (Budapest, Hungary, 20-23 June 2017), Lisa Gianmoena and the three anonymous referees.

The purpose of this work is to evaluate the roles of market regulation, energy consumption and energy capacity in low carbon transition for distributed energy systems through an agent-based simulation. A set of agent behavioral rules for the competition of high carbon and low carbon energies mimics the local dynamics of the energy production of distributed energy systems and the energy consumption of industrial firms under the impact of energy market fluctuation. Simulation results show that under the condition of increased energy capacities with a positive feedback between supply and demand, low carbon transition can be facilitated by the combination of market adjustment favoring low carbon energies and the policy adjustment for low energy consumptions. By contrast, with low energy capacities and high energy consumptions, transitions from high carbon economy to low-carbon economy inevitably render a catastrophic economic depression. Policy implications for different situations of countries are drawn regarding the regulation of localized energy markets for restricting the supply of high carbon energy while cultivating the demand for low carbon energy, and the improvement on energy saving, energy production efficiency, and storage capacity.","[Wu, Xifeng; Lou, Yuting; Chen, Yu] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Dept Human & Engn Environmen4, SCS Lab, Chiba 2778563, Japan; [Xu, Yuechao] Fudan Univ, Dept Phys, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",University of Tokyo; Fudan University,"Wu, XF; Chen, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Dept Human & Engn Environmen4, SCS Lab, Chiba 2778563, Japan.",xf.wu@scslab.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp; chen@edu.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"WU, XIFENG/JPM-1693-2023","Lou, Yuting/0000-0002-1634-1673",,,,,71,23,23,12,95,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2018,122.0,,,,,,474,485,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.008,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GX2UX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447576700044,0

This paper examines community energy projects in Canada and New Zealand, two understudied countries with high per-capita greenhouse gas emissions, distinct practices of community energy, and Indigenous community participation. This comparison reveals a range of striking differences in what communities do and how community energy projects are structured. We use institutional theories to highlight the role of incumbent resources, actors, and political context to explain the variations of forms and functions of community energy. We provide a re-conceptualization of community energy practice as a much broader in both energy activity and ownership structure than presented in much of the current literature. The distinct national practices of community energy found are explained predominantly by the policy settings: less privatization and more new renewable energy support in some Canadian provinces, with more uniform liberalization and legal support for trusts in New Zealand.","[Hoicka, Christina E.] York Univ, Robarts Ctr Canadian Studies, Fac Environm Studies, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; [MacArthur, Julie L.] Univ Auckland, Sch Social Sci, Private Bag 92019,Victoria St West, Auckland 1142, New Zealand",York University - Canada; University of Auckland,"Hoicka, CE (通讯作者)，York Univ, Robarts Ctr Canadian Studies, Fac Environm Studies, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",cehoicka@yorku.ca; j.macarthur@auckland.ac.nz,"MacArthur, Julie/AAW-1955-2021","Hoicka, Christina/0000-0002-2622-442X; MacArthur, Julie/0000-0003-4796-503X",Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden Fund [3711068]; PowerStream Chair in Sustainable Energy Economics,Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden Fund(Royal Society of New ZealandMarsden Fund (NZ)); PowerStream Chair in Sustainable Energy Economics,"This research was supported by a grant from the Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden Fund 3711068 and from the PowerStream Chair in Sustainable Energy Economics.

To fill this gap, the present study analyzes the evolution of interventions by a leading OEM to secure the acceptance of local communities for wind energy projects and the outcomes of those efforts. The fieldwork consisted of a longitudinal case study carried out from 2014 to 2017 by a leading international OEM. In depth personal interviews were also conducted with six experts in the field. The main efforts of the OEM focused on the visual impact of the developments, health and safety issues, community involvement and social investment in the community. In selecting the location for developing a WF, economic criteria usually prevail over social criteria. Although the company makes social investments in the community, different groups point out that those local communities should be taken more seriously, as they can serve as facilitators in the development of projects.

New BRICS' policy initiatives suggest a more accelerated approach on renewable energy investment and technological cooperation. However, for the foreseeable future, individual members will be the drivers of the transfer process, particularly China and India.

This innovation merits examination because it generates opportunities and challenges - in tension - for regions experiencing UOG development. HZD allows operators to condense their surface impacts by drilling multiple wells per pad. This consolidation benefits the many in a given extractive area, but at the expense of the few who live near intensified sites. HZD also allows operators to more flexibly position these large well pads. Combined, these drilling innovations are further splintering an already fragmented UOG governance space and creating novel procedural fairness challenges, especially in cities. This study offers the concept of piecemeal participation to describe these challenges, drawing from a case study in Colorado. Piecemeal participation occurs when governments structure public input on a site-by-site basis, while operators, leveraging HZD's reach and flexibility, plan drilling and weigh alternative drilling locations at the scale of the city. The analysis evaluates piecemeal participation using standard procedural fairness criteria, generating findings of broader relevance as urban areas anticipate UOG development and HZD worldwide.","[Kroepsch, Adrianne C.] Colorado Sch Mines, Humanities Arts & Social Sci Div, 1500 Illinois St, Golden, CO 80401 USA",Colorado School of Mines,"Kroepsch, AC (通讯作者)，Colorado Sch Mines, Humanities Arts & Social Sci Div, 1500 Illinois St, Golden, CO 80401 USA.",akroepsch@mines.edu,,,University of Colorado via a Dean's Graduate Research Grant; Center to Advance Research and Teaching in the Social Sciences,University of Colorado via a Dean's Graduate Research Grant; Center to Advance Research and Teaching in the Social Sciences,"This work was supported by the University of Colorado via a Dean's Graduate Research Grant and a fieldwork grant from The Center to Advance Research and Teaching in the Social Sciences.

In such a scenario, renewable energy sources, especially solar and wind energy, are likely to play a significant role in providing reliable and sustainable electricity to consumers as they are locally available and their carbon foot print is small. The future share of power by renewables will greatly depend on the expected generation cost and the government's support to investments in the sector. Using levelised cost approach, capital cost, operating and fuel costs of major electricity generation technologies are compared. Then, a forecast is made for electricity generation in India, using non-linear Bass diffusion model over 15-year horizon, until 2030, for all major energy technologies, viz., coal, natural gas, hydro, solar, wind, and biomass. The results show how present trends and future forecasts of electricity-generating technologies change the electricity generation mix, and how solar and wind power may increase their share in the total generation. However, fossil fuels will continue to remain competitive relative to renewables due to their cost advantage. The main issue considered here is whether each energy technology has reached its maximum penetration level. This helps set out a path for renewable energy technology diffusion in the Indian power sector.","[Reddy, B.

One critical solution is to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Although carbon markets may provide some financial sources, other financial institutions are needed to raise green investment in order to achieve low carbon growth. This study examines the determinants of green investment in China from the perspective of public appeal by employing economic and econometric models with a panel dataset for 30 provinces over the period from 1998 to 2014. Our results demonstrate that public appeal tends to have a positive effect on increasing green investment in China's context. Other findings show that industry structure, population, and regional Gross Domestic Product have significantly positive impacts on green investment, while openness, energy mix, carbon markets, and Foreign Direct Investment have significantly negative effects on green investment. Importantly, the results of channel analysis suggest that public appeal promotes local governments' enforcement of stricter environmental regulation, thereby encouraging firms to increase their green investment.","[Liao, Xianchun] Univ Jinan, Business Sch, Jinan 250022, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Liao, Xianchun] Univ Jinan, Inst Green Dev, Jinan 250022, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Shi, Xunpeng (Roc)] Univ Technol Sydney, Australia China Relat Inst, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia; [Shi, Xunpeng (Roc)] Hubei Univ Econ, Ctr Hubei Cooperat Innovat Emiss Trading Syst, Wuhan 430205, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Shi, Xunpeng (Roc)] Natl Univ Singapore, Energy Studies Inst, Singapore 119620, Singapore",University of Jinan; University of Jinan; University of Technology Sydney; Hubei University of Economics; National University of Singapore,"Liao, XC (通讯作者)，Univ Jinan, Business Sch, Jinan 250022, Shandong, Peoples R China.;Liao, XC (通讯作者)，Univ Jinan, Inst Green Dev, Jinan 250022, Shandong, Peoples R China.",liaoxian2@yahoo.com,"Xunpeng, Roc Shi/I-5486-2019; Liao, Xianchun/GSN-7943-2022","Xunpeng, Roc Shi/0000-0001-9653-7395;",Key project of the National Social Science Foundation of China [17AJL008]; Major project of the National Social Science Foundation of China [15ZDB163],Key project of the National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Major project of the National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),The authors thank anonymous referees for their helpful comments.

The large-scale cumulative impacts of UOG extraction makes standardised monitoring across geographic and sociopolitical regions important. This article emphasises the importance of a robust monitoring framework that must serve as a guideline for planning monitoring activities during UOG extraction. A case study from South Africa is presented to illustrate important aspects to address during the development of a UOG extraction monitoring framework. The South African case is critically assessed and resultant policy implications are discussed. Important policy considerations include performing baseline monitoring during UOG extraction, performing UOG extraction monitoring in an integrated, systematic, and standardised manner, ensuring that proper resources are available to perform the monitoring and implementing an adaptive management plan that is linked to UOG extraction monitoring.","[Esterhuyse, Surina; Avenant, Marinda; Kemp, Marthie; Vos, A.

Firstly, four government subsidy strategies are given, and the evolutionary game models are constructed including enterprises and consumers. Then seven diffusion scenarios are analyzed according to different initial states, and discussed in two situations, that is, when there is no fluctuation and when there is fluctuation. And then the related simulation analysis is carried out through a case of new energy vehicles diffusion, and the result shows: (1) when the percents of enterprises and consumers with low-carbon strategy and low-carbon consumption are small, the measure only using government subsidy cannot lead to the success of low-carbon diffusion, only if combined with other measures. (2) when the percents of enterprises and consumers with low-carbon strategy and low-carbon consumption both increase to a certain degree, low-carbon diffusion can be realized successfully even without government subsidy, which is true even when there is periodic fluctuation. (3) as for low-carbon diffusion, it may be better to pull the low-carbon market through the demand side than to push the low-carbon market through the supplier side. Finally, the related policy recommendations are given.","[Fan, Ruguo; Dong, Lili] Wuhan Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China",Wuhan University,"Fan, RG (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.",rgfan@whu.edu.cn; donglilibaihe@163.com,"fan, ru/GYQ-7323-2022",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71271159, 71601148, 71371173]; National Social Science Foundation of China [14ZDA062]; Special Funds for Research on Humanities and Social Sciences from the Ministry of Education of China [14JDGC012]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Special Funds for Research on Humanities and Social Sciences from the Ministry of Education of China,"This work was supported by the Projects supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 71271159, 71601148, 71371173); National Social Science Foundation of China (grant number 14ZDA062); and Special Funds for Research on Humanities and Social Sciences from the Ministry of Education of China (grant number 14JDGC012).The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions for improvements.",,34,87,92,18,198,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUN,2018,117.0,,,,,,252,262,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.12.003,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GF4KU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431932600025,0

This comes to add to social and economic pressures applied to these countries under their process of market liberalization and economic integration, instigated at least in part by the very ENP process. In those conditions, questions of spatial cohesion and thus of regional convergence and divergence become increasingly salient, as the elimination of (social and) spatial imbalances is both a precondition for the legitimacy and successful implementation of the reforms aiming at market liberalization and economic integration and a core objective of such reforms. In this paper, we examine the spatial dynamics of population growth in the ENP countries prior to the recent destabilization in the region, using two complementary approaches-an analysis of the impact of agglomeration on growth and an analysis of club formation in population concentrations (convergence-divergence). We find that, on the whole, the ENPCs South space was characterized in recent years by evidence of regional convergence in the sense that population concentrations were becoming more diffused across regions; while the ENPCs East exhibited stronger and more consistent evidence of regional divergence (increased concentration of population). These findings suggest that agglomeration and cumulative causation forces are more strongly in operation in the more advanced, at least in terms of EU relations, countries of the ENP East, where also the pull factor of the EU economy is stronger.","[Kallioras, Dimitris; Petrakos, George] Univ Thessaly, Dept Planning & Reg Dev, PO 38 334 Volos, Volos, Greece; [Monastiriotis, Vassilis] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, European Inst, Cowdray House,Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of Thessaly; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Monastiriotis, V (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, European Inst, Cowdray House,Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",dkallior@uth.gr; V.Monastiriotis@lse.ac.uk; petrakos@uth.gr,", Vassilis/AAI-9243-2021; Kallioras, Dimitris/C-5315-2014",", Vassilis/0000-0003-3709-3119; Kallioras, Dimitris/0000-0003-3060-3745; Petrakos, George/0000-0001-6542-6799",Project Sharing KnowledgEAssets: InteRregionallyCohesive NeigHborhoods (SEARCH) within the 7th European Community Framework Programme European Commission [FP7-SSH-2010.2.2-1 (266834)],Project Sharing KnowledgEAssets: InteRregionallyCohesive NeigHborhoods (SEARCH) within the 7th European Community Framework Programme European Commission,The research was supported by the Project Sharing KnowledgEAssets: InteRregionallyCohesive NeigHborhoods (SEARCH) within the 7th European Community Framework Programme FP7-SSH-2010.2.2-1 (266834) European Commission.

To understand the role of road transport in energy demand and emissions, five modeling teams developed baseline projections for India's transportation sector as part of inter model comparison exercise under the Sustainable Growth Working Group (SGWG) of the US-India Energy Dialog. Based on modeling results, we explore the developments in India's passenger and freight road transport, including changes in the modal shift and the resulting changes in energy consumption, carbon dioxide (CO2) and particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions. We find significant differences in the base-year data and parameters for future projections, namely energy consumption by transport in general and by mode, service demand for passenger and freight transport. Variation in modeling assumptions across modeling teams reflects the difference in opinion among the different modeling teams which in turn reflects the underlying uncertainty with respect to key assumptions. We have identified several important data gaps in our knowledge about the development of the transportation sector in India. The results of this inter-model study can be used by Indian policy makers to set quantified targets in emission reductions from the transportation sector.","[Paladugula, Anantha Lakshmi] Ctr Study Sci Technol & Policy, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Kholod, Nazar; Clarke, Leon; Evans, Meredydd; Kyle, Page] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Joint Global Change Res Inst, Richland, WA USA; [Chaturvedi, Vaibhav; Koti, Poonam Nagar] Council Energy Environm & Water, New Delhi, India; [Ghosh, Probal Pratap; Parikh, Kirit] Integrated Res & Act Dev, New Delhi, India; [Pal, Sarbojit; Qamar, Sharif; Wilson, Sangeetha Ann] Energy & Resources Inst, New Delhi, India; [Pal, Sarbojit] Clean Energy Ministerial, Paris, France; [Wilson, Sangeetha Ann] Nagoya Univ, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; TERI University; Nagoya University,"Kholod, N (通讯作者)，5825 Univ Res Court,Suite 3500, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.",nazar.kholod@pnnl.gov,"Kyle, Page/AFP-3602-2022; Evans, Meredydd/IST-7936-2023","Evans, Meredydd/0000-0001-5369-151X; Kyle, Page/0000-0002-1257-8358; Ghosh, Probal/0000-0003-4823-1687; Kholod, Nazar/0000-0002-4716-8770","United States Agency for International Development (USAID); National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) [DGG-4-42182-01]; NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India), Government of India; United States Department of Energy by Battelle Memorial Institute [DE-AC05-76RL01830]","United States Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL); NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India), Government of India; United States Department of Energy by Battelle Memorial Institute(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","The research was supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) (contract DGG-4-42182-01), and the NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India), Government of India.

It details a modeling framework that allows us to determine the optimal infrastructure needed to connect a geographically disaggregated set of emitting and storage clusters, along with the threshold CO2 values necessary to ensure that the considered emitters will make the necessary investment decisions. This framework is used to assess the relevance of various policy scenarios, including (i) the perimeter of the targeted emitters for a CCS uptake, and (ii) the relevance of constructing several regional networks instead of a single grid to account for the spatial characteristics of the Spanish peninsula. We find that three networks naturally emerge in the north, center and south of Spain. Moreover, the necessary CO2 break-even price critically depends on the presence of power stations in the capture perimeter. Policy implications of these findings concern the elaboration of relevant, pragmatic recommendations to envisage CCS deployment locally, focusing on emitters with lower substitution options toward low-carbon alternatives.","[Massol, Olivier; Tchung-Ming, Stephane] IFP Energies Nouvelles, 1-4 Ave Bois Preau, F-92852 Rueil Malmaison, France; [Massol, Olivier; Tchung-Ming, Stephane] IFP Sch, Ctr Econ & Management, 228-232 Ave Napoleon Bonaparte, F-92852 Rueil Malmaison, France; [Massol, Olivier; Tchung-Ming, Stephane; Banal-Estanol, Albert] City Univ London, Dept Econ, Northampton Sq, London EC1V 0HB, England; [Massol, Olivier; Tchung-Ming, Stephane] Palais Brongniart, Climate Econ Chair, 28 Pl Bourse, F-75002 Paris, France; [Tchung-Ming, Stephane; Banal-Estanol, Albert] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Business, Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 08005, Spain",IFP Energies Nouvelles; IFP Energies Nouvelles; City University London; Pompeu Fabra University,"Massol, O (通讯作者)，IFP Energies Nouvelles, 1-4 Ave Bois Preau, F-92852 Rueil Malmaison, France.",olivier.massol@ifpen.ft,"Banal-Estanol, Albert/D-7578-2013; DEV, Direction Economie/C-1705-2013","MASSOL, Olivier/0000-0002-9611-7312",,,,,40,13,13,1,20,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,APR,2018,115.0,,,,,,545,560,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.015,0.0,,,16,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GA1TH,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428099800052,0

After controlling for several measures of liquidity, inflation expectations and inflation uncertainty; financial fear itself (proxied with the Volatility Index or VIX) remains a primary influence on BEI. To delve into the mechanism underlying this association, the VIX is decomposed, using intraday data, into conditional variance and the variance premium capturing risk aversion. Aside from the 2008 crisis, most of the effect emanated from the variance premium. Following the crisis, indicators of bank insolvency risk gain prominence as well. Lastly, an automated nonlinear model finds convex effects of variance, and diminishing returns to insolvency risk and liquidity.","[Stillwagon, Josh R.] Babson Coll, Econ Div, Inst New Econ Thinking, Program Imperfect Knowledge Econ IKE, Westgate Hall 313,231 Forest St, Babson Pk, MA 02457 USA",Babson College,"Stillwagon, JR (通讯作者)，Babson Coll, Econ Div, Inst New Econ Thinking, Program Imperfect Knowledge Econ IKE, Westgate Hall 313,231 Forest St, Babson Pk, MA 02457 USA.",jstillwagon@babson.edu,,,INET; Trinity College,INET; Trinity College,"I thank INET and Trinity College for financial support of this research, and Marie Hoerova and Steve Furnagiev for data.

It is argued that the estimates of HMT of the loss of GDP are likely to be overstated, but, nevertheless, there will probably be a fall in output. Given this, the effect on the UK regions is analysed using the regional balance-of-payments constrained growth model.

It has been analyzed globally for Spain and we have also decomposed and analyzed energy poverty for two different groups: three different types of areas, depending on their population share, and regions. The variables used to measure energy poverty are the three energy accessibility indicators: the ability to keep the home adequately warm, the arrears on utility bills (electricity, water, gas) and the presence of a leaking roof, damp walls or rotten windows. Energy poverty is measured using Chakravarty and D'Ambrosio counting poverty measures. These indices have been chosen since they are able to capture inequality, and in our opinion they are the most appropriate poverty indices when multidimensional poverty needs to be measured for dichotomous variables. In addition, counting dominance curves have been computed in order to give more robustness to the obtained results. Results suggest that energy poverty in Spain worsened between 2004 and 2015. Specifically, rural areas and Southern regions show the highest energy poverty values.","[Aristondo, Oihana] Univ Basque Country, Dept Matemat Aplicada, BRIDGE Res Grp, Ave Otaola 29, Eibar Gipuzkoa 20600, Spain; [Onaindia, Eneritz] Univ Basque Country, Dept Org Empresas, Ave Otaola 29, Eibar Gipuzkoa 20600, Spain",University of Basque Country; University of Basque Country,"Aristondo, O (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country, Dept Matemat Aplicada, BRIDGE Res Grp, Ave Otaola 29, Eibar Gipuzkoa 20600, Spain.",oihana.aristondo@ehu.es; eneritz.onaindia@ehu.eus,"Aristondo, EUITI Eibar/H-5380-2015; Onaindia Gerrikabeitia, Eneritz/I-8297-2016","Onaindia Gerrikabeitia, Eneritz/0000-0003-3257-4191","Departamento de Education, Politica Linguistica y Cultura del Gobierno Vasco [IT568-13]; Spanish Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia [ECO2015-67519]; FEDER; UPV/EHU [IT568-13]; UFI [11/46 BETS]; UPV/EHU under the project Ayudas a la innovation para la sostenibilidad de la UPV/EHU","Departamento de Education, Politica Linguistica y Cultura del Gobierno Vasco; Spanish Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia(Spanish Government); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government); UPV/EHU; UFI; UPV/EHU under the project Ayudas a la innovation para la sostenibilidad de la UPV/EHU","O.

Most of the same jurisdictions also subsidize the manufacturing and/or deployment of renewable energy technologies, some being sufficiently aggressive as to engender WTO disputes. We consider a downstream energy-using product produced competitively but not traded across regions, such as electricity or transportation. A renewable energy technology is available, provided by a limited set of upstream suppliers who exercise market power. With multiple market failures (emissions externality and imperfect competition), renewable market share mandates as the binding climate policy, and international trade in equipment, the stage is set to examine rationales for green industrial policy. Subsidies may be provided down-stream to energy suppliers and/or upstream to technology suppliers; each has tradeoffs. Subsidies can offset underprovision of the renewable alternative by the upstream suppliers, but they allow dirty generation to expand as the portfolio standard becomes less costly to fulfill. Downstream subsidies raise all upstream profits and crowd out foreign emissions. Upstream subsidies increase domestic upstream market share but expand emissions globally. In our two-region model, strategic subsidies chosen noncooperatively can be optimal from a global perspective, if both regions value emissions at the global cost of carbon. But if the regions sufficiently undervalue global emissions, restricting the use of upstream subsidies can enhance welfare.

Yet, the rise of China and other emerging economies means a shift away from a reliance on technology transfer and production capabilities to strengthening indigenous innovation capabilities. Drawing on evidence from the hydropower, solar and wind energy industry in China, the paper introduces the concept of 'geographies of technology transfer and cooperation' and challenges the North-South technology transfer and cooperation paradigm for low carbon innovation and climate change mitigation. The empirical evidence shows that for low carbon innovation, the conception that China is lacking behind in innovation capabilities is partly outdated. Instead, there is an increase in indigenous innovation capabilities, resulting in South-South technology transfer and cooperation as well as elements of 'reverse' South-North technology cooperation.","[Urban, Frauke] Univ London, Ctr Dev Environm & Policy CeDEP, SOAS, 36 Gordon Sq, London WC1H 0PD, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Urban, F (通讯作者)，Univ London, Ctr Dev Environm & Policy CeDEP, SOAS, 36 Gordon Sq, London WC1H 0PD, England.",f.urban@soas.ac.uk,,"Urban, Frauke/0000-0003-3021-0220",Economics and Social Research Council ESRC [ES/J01320X/1]; ESRC; Volkswagen Foundation; Svenska Riksbanken Jubileumsfond; Compania di Sao Paolo; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J01320X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/J01320X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economics and Social Research Council ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Volkswagen Foundation(Volkswagen); Svenska Riksbanken Jubileumsfond; Compania di Sao Paolo; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This research has been funded by the Economics and Social Research Council ESRC as part of the research project China goes global: a comparative study of Chinese hydropower dams in low and middle income countries (ES/J01320X/1), the ESRC as part of the project Low Carbon Innovation in China: Prospects, Politics and Practice as well as the Volkswagen Foundation, the Svenska Riksbanken Jubileumsfond and the Compania di Sao Paolo as part of the project Technological trajectories for climate change mitigation in China, India and the EU.

Moreover, employees are more likely to be willing to stay longer at their positions, if it is rather motivators keeping them there.","[Asarkaya, Cigdem] Istanbul Commerce Univ, Dept Business Adm, Istanbul, Turkey; [Girgin, Sefa Zeynep Siretioglu] Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Math Methods Econ, Vienna, Austria",Istanbul Ticaret University; Technische Universitat Wien,"Asarkaya, C (通讯作者)，Istanbul Commerce Univ, Dept Business Adm, Istanbul, Turkey.",casarkaya@ticaret.edu.tr; siretioglu@hotmail.com,"Asarkaya, Cigdem/ABA-8776-2021","Asarkaya, Cigdem/0000-0002-5661-7996",,,,,12,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-67913-6,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2018,8.0,1.0,,,,,283,290,,10.1007/978-3-319-67913-6_19,0.0,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BR9PT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000679398800019,0

Geotargeting provides extensive opportunities, but it can also be used to monitor the value added of marketing activities, which can be one of the pillars of social responsibility. In our case, it is the environmental aspect. The advantage of geotargeting lies in measurability and personalization that is incomparable with traditional media. The use of geotargeting is irreplaceable and its potential is constantly developing and growing in online environment. The main advantage lies in precise targeting, with the greatest possible intervention of the target group at the lowest cost. Geotargeting is mainly used by organizations or companies operating locally and which products are available on the regional or domestic markets. It is very important to be able to orientate correctly the use of location-based marketing to its benefit and to achieve the set goals of the company. However, this basic aspect of geotargeting has much wider potential and can be used in a wider context in favour of nature conservation or ecoinnovation management. The contribution deals with the basic theoretical basics of locationbased marketing and the use of geotargeting as well as other options related to the introduction of these services into practice and its interaction with globalization.","[Bezakova, Zuzana] Fac Mass Media Commun UCM, Namestie J Herdu 2, Trnava, Slovakia",,"Bezakova, Z (通讯作者)，Fac Mass Media Commun UCM, Namestie J Herdu 2, Trnava, Slovakia.",zuzana.bezak@gmail.com,,,VEGA [1/0708/18],VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This paper is an output of the research project VEGA 1/0708/18 titled Aspects of Use of the SoLoMo Marketing Concept to Enhance Awareness of Eco-innovations.,,23,0,0,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1978,1983,,,,,,6,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300252,0

However, although a major desalination plant has been on the table for a number of years, this continues to be regarded as a 'long term option' due to the apparent high costs associated with this technology. We therefore develop a predator-prey system dynamics model to assess the feasibility of a major desalination plant compared with the baseline scenarios of business as usual: (clearing of invasive alien plants in the Berg and Breede water management areas and renovating and constructing dams). Cost include both capital costs, as well as operational costs. We find that increasing block tariffs (IBTs) do not always benefit the poor, since these are not always the lowest water users in volumetric terms. A major outcome is that, in contrast to expectations, a desalination plant may actually reduce tariffs across the full spectrum of water users. A desalination plant also has the potential to increase access to water by the poorest communities. The finding has implications for other developing countries considering a major water infrastructure investment where there are large disparities in income between wealthy and indigent consumers.","[Crookes, D.

However, it can be unclear whether roads increase productivity directly, through improved intra-urban connections, or indirectly, by attracting more people. Our theory suggests that population responses may obscure the direct connectivity effects of roads. Indeed, conditional on population size, highway density does not affect productivity in a sample of US metropolitan areas. However, when exploiting exogenous variation in urban populations, we find that highway density improves agglomeration benefits: moving from the 50th to the 75th percentile of highway density increases the productivity-to-population elasticity from 2% to 4%.

In a Monte Carlo study, we find that the proposed procedure has good finite sample properties in situations with endogeneity, cohort interactive effects, and near nonidentification. Finally, as an illustration the proposed method is applied to data from Ecuador to study labor supply elasticity.

HDI is a combination of three basic components of human development: the standard of living, health and education. In the article, the indicator has been extended by two further components. In the article, the author proposes addition of selected demographic variables and the level of development of the labour market to measure the socio-economic development. Therefore, the aim of the article is to introduce a modified HDI coefficient considering selected features and to compare this coefficient with measures known from the literature. Based on the research, it can be concluded, that the HDI value is strongly positively correlated with selected economic features. There are slight differences between the results depending on the applied research methodology. In addition, the economic activity is not evenly distributed in the geographical space. It is possible to indicate groups of people, wealth and poverty. Analysis of causation and analysis of spatial relationships between economic features is the key to learn about the modern economy.

The analysis in this case is based on the fact, that transport logistics can be seen to have an obvious role here - both directly through investment in transport infrastructure, vehicles, and logistics systems, increasing physical capital; and indirectly through the impact that more efficient transport can have by inducing greater efficiency in the way that other sectors use their own inputs. Beyond the initial effects of transport investment on journey times and costs, labour market, agglomeration and transport network effects also influence the long-term impacts of transport investment on economic growth and urban/regional development. Each of these wider economic impacts has a spatial dimension through their influence on the location and geography of economic and social activity. Objectives, methods, and the particular results of investigations resulted in the definition and characteristics of the transport logistics in terms of the European Union with reference to their application and impact on quality of life in a regional context.

We are looking to determine what these selection processes consist of and which selection methods are used. We compare them to the available theoretical knowledge as reviewed in the second chapter and we draw conclusion from there about the trends in human resource management practices in the field of employee selection for this specific type of position.

The question remains, whether these changes can be considered as an opportunity or a threat. On the one hand, globalization brings innumerable opportunities for businesses to develop areas where they excel, but on the other hand, in areas where they are lagging, they may become more vulnerable. We can also point to the continuing trend of digitization and the use of digital technologies, even in changing business model, providing new and value-producing opportunities. In the presented contribution, authors deal with the topic of globalization in connection with the implementation of social media into the business environment in order to increase interest in eco-products. For businesses, social media represent an information channel by providing them valuable information about consumers and their habits. Authors present results of their own research focused on the use of social media within eco-innovation processes. They also focus on the way of implementing communication strategy at a corporate and an external business communication level to support the introduction of eco-innovations in Slovakia, and compare them with foreign businesses at global level. The contribution consists of two parts - in the first part, authors deal with the aspects of social media use within marketing communication of businesses in order to raise awareness of eco-innovations at the global level. The second part presents partial results of a quantitative marketing survey conducted in Slovakia in comparison to selected foreign studies, in which authors investigated the level of utilization of social media in presentation of eco-innovations.","[Zauskova, Anna; Reznickova, Monika] Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius Trnava, Fac Mass Media Commun, Namestie J Herdu 2, Trnava 91701, Slovakia",University of SS Cyril & Methodius Trnava,"Zauskova, A (通讯作者)，Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius Trnava, Fac Mass Media Commun, Namestie J Herdu 2, Trnava 91701, Slovakia.",anna.zauskova@ucm.sk; monika.reznickova@fmk.sk,"Zaušková, Anna/AAB-6648-2020","Zaušková, Anna/0000-0002-5281-1556",VEGA [1/0708/18],VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This paper is an output of the science project VEGA 1/0708/18 named: Aspects of use of the SoLoMo marketing concept to enhance awareness of eco-innovations.,,23,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,2421,2428,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300310,0

This study is based on three targets, including air quality improvement, water savings, and energy conservation and emissions reduction, and then adopts the LEAP (Long-Range Energy Alternatives Planning System) model to predict Shandong's total coal consumption and its emissions reduction in 2020. Furthermore, it measures the feasibility and concrete path to realize the coal reduction target from three aspects - coal reduction, clean coal utilization and coal substitution. Finally, the quota allocation method is used to breakdown the coal reduction target into various cities and major industries. The results indicate that improving air quality is the primary reason for coal consumption control; coal reduction, clean coal utilization and coal substitution can reduce 36.3, 3.4 and 37.76 million tons of coal equivalent (tce) respectively, thus revealing the possibility of realizing the target of reducing 20 million tee in 2020 compared to 2012. The quota breakdown scheme shows that four cities (Binzhou, Jining, Linyi and Zibo) and three industries (production and supply of electricity and heat industry, coal chemical industry, and ferrous metal smelting and calendaring industry) are the major focus for coal consumption control in Shandong. This study provides valuable suggestions to facilitate the control of coal consumption.","[Zhang, Yiqing; Liu, Chuangeng] Shandong Inst Business & Technol, Sch Business Adm, Synergy Innovat Ctr Energy Econ Shandong, Yantai 264005, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Li, Ke] Hunan Normal Univ, Coll Math & Comp Sci, Minist Educ China, Key Lab High Performance Comp & Stochast Informat, Changsha 410081, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Yong] Shandong Acad Sci, Inst Sci & Technol Dev Strategy, Jinan 250014, Shandong, Peoples R China",Shandong Technology & Business University; Hunan Normal University; Qilu University of Technology,"Li, K (通讯作者)，Hunan Normal Univ, Coll Math & Comp Sci, Changsha 410081, Hunan, Peoples R China.",likekent1208@163.com,,"Li, Ke/0000-0002-1314-7293","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71773028, 71603079, 71703120]; Shandong social science planning project [15CGLG19]; National Social Science Foundation of China [13BGL108]; Education Department of Hunan province [17A142]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shandong social science planning project; National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Education Department of Hunan province,"This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71773028, 71603079 and 71703120).

Biomethane, a subset of renewable natural gas, is produced from a range of waste sources that are distributed across the landscape with uneven access to natural gas infrastructure. Using a spatially explicit techno-economic model of renewable natural gas supply in California, we develop supply curves for producing renewable natural gas and delivering it to California's transportation fuels market in order to estimate the economic potential. The gross potential is 90 bcf per year (94.5 PJ/yr), which is larger than the 17 bcf per year (18 PJ/yr) of natural gas consumed as transportation fuel in California in 2016. Seventy-five percent of the resource is estimated to be economic if the value of existing policy credits are fully capitalized, resulting in 6.9 million Low Carbon Fuel Standard credits. Renewable natural gas provides an economically viable option for methane emission reduction for a quarter of dairy manure in the state. The results suggest that renewable natural gas can play a significant role in meeting low carbon fuel policies in California and that expansion of demand for natural gas in transportation is needed to fully realize this potential.","[Parker, Nathan] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, 800 S Cady Mall, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Williams, Robert] Univ Calif Davis, Calif Biomass Collaborat, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Dominguez-Faus, Rosa; Scheitrum, Daniel] Univ Calif Davis, Inst Transportat Studies, 1605 Tilia St, Davis, CA 95616 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Parker, N (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, 800 S Cady Mall, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA.",,"Parker, Nathan/JXX-6460-2024; Scheitrum, Daniel/KBQ-6842-2024","Scheitrum, Daniel/0000-0002-2301-0928",Alfred P.

To counteract leakage and increase global cost-effectiveness carbon tariffs can be imposed on the emissions embodied in imports from non-regulating regions. We present a stylized model analysis on the economic incentives for emissions abatement of producers subjected to carbon tariffs. The impacts of different carbon tariff designs are, then, quantified by an empirically based multi-sector, multi-region computable general equilibrium model of the global economy. We find that firm-targeted tariffs can deliver considerably stronger leakage reduction and higher gains in global cost-effectiveness than tariff designs operated at the industry level. Moreover, because the exporters are able to reduce their carbon tariffs by adjusting emissions, their competitiveness and the overall welfare of their economies will be less adversely affected than in the case of industry-level carbon tariff regimes.

The empirical evidence is based on a recent set of data at provincial (NUTS 3) level on manufacturing value added at 1911 prices, and a new set of data on human and social capital, political participation, and infrastructures. By focusing on a country and a time when the agglomeration forces and spillover effects advocated by the new economic geography were only starting to operate, we can investigate a particularly interesting case study.

A total of 48 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with community, industry and government representatives were performed in 2015. This research fords that network operators are perceived as 'pushing back' on distributed generation by increasing the complexity, cost and unreliability of connection applications, by restricting further connection of distributed generation to the network, and by requiring consumers to invest in technology for grid protection. Interview respondents suggest network operators do this because: distributed generation creates technical issues at the distribution-scale of the network; distributed generation can reduce financial revenue for the network operator; as a response to a lack of strategic direction on how network operators should respond to distributed generation; and due to a 'risk averse' engineering culture that rejects the unknown. Government intervention may be required to direct network operators to address technical implications of increased distributed generation and redevelop tariff models to allow fair cost recovery of network assets. However, government intervention may lead to adverse outcomes, including in relation to the cost recovery of state-owned assets.","[Simpson, Genevieve] Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth & Environm, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Simpson, G (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth & Environm, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",Genevieve.Simpson@research.uwa.edu.au,"Simpson, Genevieve/B-4872-2013","Simpson, Genevieve/0000-0001-7481-7388","School of Agricultural and Resource Economics, University of Western Australia; Australian Research Council; Australian Government's","School of Agricultural and Resource Economics, University of Western Australia; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Government's(Australian Government)","The author thanks her supervisor for his support during this research and for assistance with copy-editing.

This research uses the Policy Analysis Matrix (PAM) approach to evaluate the PNPB effects and compare the economic efficiency and the competitiveness of biodiesel from three oilseeds: soybean, rapeseed and sunflower. In contrast to papers that present results of experimental biodiesel production initiatives, this paper explores the case of representative production chains (best available technology and management practices). The findings indicate that biodiesel production is competitive from the three oilseeds, but the profitability of biodiesel from the soybean is notably higher. The tax breaks and subsidies provided by the PNPB have a positive impact on the profitability of biodiesel production chains (7.43% for soybean, 3.88% for rapeseed, 5.53% for sunflower). These results are encouraging and suggest two actions: i) to review the incentive policies (tax reduction) and payments to farmers of the different crops (pay for oil content instead of crop yield); and to invest in organizational and managerial approaches in the alternative oilseed agricultural systems to improve their technical and economic efficiency.","[dos Santos Alves, Camila Elisa] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Programa Posgrad Agronegocios, Ave Bento Goncalves 7712,Predio Agron 1 Andar, BR-91540000 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Belarmino, Luiz Clovis] Empresa Brasileira Pesquisa Agr Embrapa, Rodovia BR 392,Km 78,9 Dist, BR-96010971 Pelotas, RS, Brazil; [Padula, Antonio Domingos] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Escola Adm, PPGA, Programa Posgrad Agronegocios, Rua Washington Luis 855, BR-90010460 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA); Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,"Padula, AD (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Escola Adm, PPGA, Programa Posgrad Agronegocios, Rua Washington Luis 855, BR-90010460 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",camilaelisaalves@gmail.com; belarminster@gmail.com; adpadula@ea.ufrgs.br,"dos Santos Alves, Camila Elisa/AAV-6199-2021; Padula, Antonio D/B-2992-2019","Alves, Camila Elisa/0000-0002-4033-6313",Brazilian agencies CAPES; CNPq [303994/2015-0]; EMBRAPA,Brazilian agencies CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); EMBRAPA(Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA)),"The authors are grateful for the support provided by the Brazilian agencies CAPES, CNPq (Processo n. 303994/2015-0) and EMBRAPA.

By using long-term nationwide household data (1999-2014), actual variations in IBP rate structure are explored. Empirical results show that cross-subsidization under IBP have resulted in inefficient over-consumption by the poor and inefficient under-consumption by the rich. In addition, the financial burden increased with decreases of household's income levels and a relatively high percentage of subsidies mistakenly went to non-poor households. The upward price adjustments and broadened first block in recent years have increased the household's financial burden and the rates of wrongly excluding the poor and wrongly including the rich to enjoy the subsidy. Being unable to take family size into consideration and send correct price signals to all users are two serious problems for IBP, which may hinder the achievement of equity and efficiency in electricity use.","[Hung, Ming-Feng; Chie, Bin-Tzong] Tamkang Univ, Dept Ind Econ, New Taipei 25137, Taiwan",Tamkang University,"Hung, MF (通讯作者)，Tamkang Univ, Dept Ind Econ, New Taipei 25137, Taiwan.",eureka@mail.tku.edu.tw,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 104-2410-H-032-005]","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 104-2410-H-032-005].

In each jurisdiction, for a range of PV and storage system sizes, we compute the optimal use of the system, and hence the best possible profitability of that system in that jurisdiction over a 20 year life span. This methodology allows us to quantitatively estimate the influence of a jurisdiction on the (best possible) profitability of PV-storage systems. We find that the choice of jurisdiction has significant impact on the profitability of PV-storage systems. We also find that policy makers can use the price of grid electricity as well as upfront subsidies to influence profitability, and therefore adoption.","[Kazhamiaka, Fiodar; Keshav, Srinivasan] Univ Waterloo, Cheriton Sch Comp Sci, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Jochem, Patrick] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Ind Prod, Kaiserstr 12, D-76133 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Rosenberg, Catherine] Univ Waterloo, Elect & Comp Engn, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON, Canada",University of Waterloo; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; University of Waterloo,"Kazhamiaka, F (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Cheriton Sch Comp Sci, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",fkazhami@uwaterloo.ca,"Keshav, Srinivasan/AAI-3438-2020; Jochem, Patrick/Q-8828-2019","Keshav, Srinivasan/0000-0002-6549-0464; Jochem, Patrick/0000-0002-7486-4958",,,,,44,12,14,1,15,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,428,440,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.07.019,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400040,0

However, a series of obstacles and delays has restricted implementation. To explore why, this study investigates the socio-technical challenges facing the SMIP, with a strong emphasis on the social side of the equation. It explains its two primary sources of data, a systematic review of the academic literature coupled with observation of seven major SMIP events. It offers a history of the SMIP rollout, including a summary of 67 potential benefits as well as often-discussed technical challenges, before delving into pertinent non-technical challenges, specifically vulnerability as well as consumer resistance and ambivalence. In doing so, the paper not only presents a critique of SMIP, it also offers a review of academic studies on consumer responses to smart meters, an analysis of the intersection between smart meters and other social concerns such as poverty or the marginalization of rural areas, and the generation of policy lessons.","[Sovacool, Benjamin K.; Kivimaa, Paula; Hielscher, Sabine; Jenkins, Kirsten] Univ Sussex, Sch Business Management & Econ, SPRU, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Ctr Energy Technol, Aarhus, Denmark; [Kivimaa, Paula] Finnish Environm Inst SYKE, Helsinki, Finland; [Hielscher, Sabine] Tech Univ Berlin ZTG, Berlin, Germany",University of Sussex; Aarhus University; Finnish Environment Institute,"Sovacool, BK (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, SPRU, Jubilee Bldg,Room 367, Falmer BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England.",B.Sovacool@sussex.ac.uk,"Sovacool, Benjamin/Y-2392-2019; Kivimaa, Paula/AAY-3418-2021","Sovacool, Benjamin/0000-0002-4794-9403; Kivimaa, Paula/0000-0003-2812-8017; Jenkins, Kirsten/0000-0002-3681-647X; Hielscher, Sabine/0000-0002-1416-5733",Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK) Energy Program [EP/K011790/1]; European Union's Horizon Research and Innovation Programme [730403]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K011790/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/K011790/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK) Energy Program; European Union's Horizon Research and Innovation Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)Horizon Europe Research Infrastructures); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"The authors are appreciative to the Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK) Energy Program Grant EP/K011790/1 Center on Innovation and Energy Demand and the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under grant agreement No 730403 Innovation pathways, strategies and policies for the Low Carbon Transition in Europe (INNOPATHS), which have supported elements of the work reported here.

Previous research has focussed on theoretical or less formal determinants of energy policy transferability, rather than providing practical analytical tools. The paper presents a practical framework for analysing the transferability of demand-side management (DSM) policies, and to identify where policies are transferable at different levels of policy transfer. The paper tests the framework to determine the transferability of different types of DSM policy across 30 countries and 36 sub-national states. The method is a contextual-based analysis that matches up countries/states that have a comparable context at the proposed three levels of policy transfer: direct copying, adaptation and inspiration. The paper utilises Multi-Criteria Decision-Making analysis with 17 DSM experts to validate the breakdown of contextual factors at different levels of policy transfer. Four groups of countries are identified where policy transfer is possible at the adaptation level and seven groups of countries/states are identified at the inspiration level. Overall, the paper argues that context is key and the level of contextual detail included in methods to analyse energy policy transferability will affect the level of policy transfer that is appropriate.","[Warren, Peter] UCL, Sch Publ Policy, London, England",University of London; University College London,"Warren, P (通讯作者)，30 Tavistock Sq, London WC1H 9QU, England.",peter.warren@ucl.ac.uk,,,UK EPSRC support [EP/H009612/1],UK EPSRC support(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This research was made possible by UK EPSRC support, grant number EP/H009612/1.

Electricity generation and consumption data are taken from the latest power development plans of individual ASEAN countries for the evaluation of optimal cross-border power flow through the interconnections. Results show that APG can enhance power generation from countries with abundant renewable resources to meet the growing demand at load centers in the ASEAN member nations. An annual cost is used as the output matrix for this study.

The paper draws on the national biofuel policies of ten countries and the EU, selected to represent a diverse sample of regions, producers and consumers, and pioneers and latecomers. It proceeds in two steps: firstly, it identifies three risk categories most frequently mentioned across the investigated national policies. Secondly, it conducts a systematic review of available empirical research about biofuels' effects in these risk categories. Findings are discussed regarding the empirical conditions under which related expectations to do no harm have materialized or failed; and concerning the challenges of risks perception and management in actual policies. We observe issues of crop selection and inadequate sectoral governance of biofuels, but also challenges of large-scale modes of intensive production. Effective risk mitigation was often the result of risk adverse choices by contract farmers engaged in biofuels production. National policy documents have insufficiently conceptualized 'do no harm' concepts and strategies in place to address these performance issues; while remaining silent on the particular risk governance and accountability framework that keeps track of actual developments, commitments and responsibilities.","[Goetz, Ariane; Schmidt, Oscar] Inst Adv Sustainabil Studies, Potsdam, Germany; [German, Laura] Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Hunsberger, Carol] Western Univ, London, ON, Canada",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Goetz, A (通讯作者)，Inst Adv Sustainabil Studies, Potsdam, Germany.",,"German, Laura/AAM-9934-2020","German, Laura/0000-0003-4943-4515; Hunsberger, Carol/0000-0002-2761-1333; Goetz, Ariane/0009-0003-4984-5258",,,,,209,16,16,0,20,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2017,108.0,,,,,,776,790,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.03.067,0.0,,,15,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FC3FZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406725800072,0

Previous experiences in the onshore sector (OWP) suggest the UK might fail in fully capturing these macroeconomic benefits. In this work, we investigate the history of UK renewable policies, comparing its national strategy to those of other major OSW-export countries. Through the use of a numerical general equilibrium model, we quantify the macroeconomic impacts under three scenarios: a baseline, which relies on previous estimates and foresee limited local content; a 'contamination' scenario, where the UK content reaches the same levels of OWP; and a 'non-myopic' scenario, where investors expect governmental support to decrease or disappear, replicating a common path of past renewable policies. We identify the UK as a FDI-oriented country. Our results suggest that increasing the share of locally-sourced capital goods in OSP to OWP-level could generate larger income and employment effects in the UK economy. We find that under forward-looking investors the economic benefits are significantly lower than the case of myopic agents.

Further, we decompose this inequality and its variation from the perspectives of production and residential energy consumption, using the source decomposition and source increment decomposition methods. This paper presents a new CEG source increment decomposition method that can achieve complete decomposition. The results reveal a downward trend in China's overall, production sector and residential sector CO2 emissions inequality. Although the Gini coefficient of CO2 emissions from the residential sector is larger than that from the production sector, the contribution of the latter to the overall CEG is higher. The impacts of the spatial inequality of CO2 emissions from China's production and residential sectors depend on the type of energy. The concentration effect is the primary factor responsible for inducing changes in China's overall and production sector CO2 emissions inequality, but it is not the only dominant factor for the residential sector CO2 emissions inequality.","[Chen, Jiandong; Cheng, Shulei] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Finance & Taxat, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China; [Song, Malin] Anhui Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat & Appl Math, Bengbu 233030, Peoples R China",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Anhui University of Finance & Economics,"Song, ML (通讯作者)，Anhui Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat & Appl Math, Bengbu 233030, Peoples R China.",songmartin@163.com,"Cheng, Shulei/HPD-5106-2023; chen, jiandong/AAM-3236-2020","Cheng, Shulei/0000-0002-8045-4429; chen, jiandong/0000-0002-8279-5497","Program for the Major Projects in Philosophy and Social Science Research of the Ministry of Education of China [14JZD031]; Key Program of National Social Science Fund of China [15AJY005]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473203, 71171001, 71471001]; New Century Excellent Talents in University [NCET-12-0595]; Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of Southwestern University of Finance and Economics",Program for the Major Projects in Philosophy and Social Science Research of the Ministry of Education of China; Key Program of National Social Science Fund of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); New Century Excellent Talents in University(Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET)); Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of Southwestern University of Finance and Economics,"This work was supported by the Program for the Major Projects in Philosophy and Social Science Research of the Ministry of Education of China (Grant no. 14JZD031), the Key Program of National Social Science Fund of China (Grant no. 15AJY005), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant nos. 71473203, 71171001, and 71471001), the New Century Excellent Talents in University (Grant no.

It is found that the model explains well the evolution of the primary fossil fuel mix in the USA for the period 1980-2014, suggesting that relative fossil fuel prices generally dominated in determining the mix during this time. However, this is not the case for Germany and the UK. For both countries, the model performs well only for the period after the market-oriented reforms in the 1990s. Additionally, the volatility of private consumption and output for the pre- and post-reform periods is evaluated for Germany and the UK and it is found that the liberalized energy markets brought about a transition from coal to natural gas, but with increased macroeconomic volatility.","[Atalla, Tarek; Blazquez, Jorge; Hunt, Lester C.; Manzano, Baltasar] King Abdullah Petr Studies & Res Ctr KAPSARC, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Hunt, Lester C.] Univ Surrey, Surrey Energy Econ Ctr, Guildford, Surrey, England; [Manzano, Baltasar] Univ Vigo, Vigo, Spain",University of Surrey; Universidade de Vigo,"Hunt, LC (通讯作者)，King Abdullah Petr Studies & Res Ctr KAPSARC, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.;Hunt, LC (通讯作者)，Univ Surrey, Surrey Energy Econ Ctr, Guildford, Surrey, England.",Tarek.Atallah@outlook.com; Jorge.Blazquez@kapsarc.org; Lester.Hunt@kapsarc.org; BManzano@uvigo.es,"Manzano, Baltasar/H-4367-2015","Blazquez, Jorge/0000-0001-5658-3418",Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2015-68367-R],Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government),"Baltasar Manzano acknowledges financial support from Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (ECO2015-68367-R).

As such, in 2015 the United States introduced the Clean Power Plan (CPP) which aims to reduce CO2 emissions from electricity production 32% from 2005 levels by 2030 and the Paris Agreement, which seeks to reduce national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, measured by global warming potential (GWP), 28% from 2005 levels by 2025. However, it remains unknown how the more narrowly-scoped CPP might affect the ability to achieve wider-scoped national GHG targets like the Paris Agreement. In our current state-of-world, characterized by inexpensive natural gas, the CPP will be met through large shifts from high-emitting coal power to less-emitting natural gas power, which translates to a 9.6% reduction in total US 100-year GWP without accounting for the fugitive methane. Spillover from fugitive methane could cut this reduction modestly by 0.2-1.4% or as much as 4.4% if evaluated using 20-year GWP elucidating how different assumptions leads to different perspectives of natural gas as a bridge fuel. The results here demonstrate the need to coordinate policies either through additional policy (e.g. regulation of fugitive methane) or a larger-scoped CPP that includes upstream activities.","[Peters, Jeffrey C.] Stanford Univ, Dept Management Sci & Engn, Studying Complex Syst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Peters, Jeffrey C.] Stanford Univ, Energy Modeling Forum, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University; Stanford University,"Peters, JC (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Management Sci & Engn, Studying Complex Syst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Peters, JC (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Energy Modeling Forum, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jcpeters@stanford.edu,,,,,,,28,32,35,0,41,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2017,106.0,,,,,,41,47,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.03.039,0.0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EW2RL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402343600005,0

The conditions for a systemic transition have been analyzed in this article. The analysis contains three blocks: the vehicle gas development, the policy framework, and commercial projects to produce methane from forest biomass. The results reveal that several conditions for a systemic transition are in place. There is established infrastructure for feedstock supply and biofuels distribution. Infrastructure development is an important albeit not determining factor. Private and public actors have advanced plans for commercial scale plants, technological know-how, and experience from a demonstration plant. However, a major barrier for a systemic transition is the low predictability of Swedish policy instruments. The Swedish government is not free to design policy instruments but must consider compatibility with the EU framework and has changed the energy tax on biofuels several times-to-avoid-overcompensation-according to the EU regulation. This has contributed to the low predictability. The interviewees have suggested several concrete policy instruments. However, they have also emphasized that the exact design of the policy instruments is less important than the predictability of the support.","[Lonnqvist, Tomas; Gronkvist, Stefan] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Chem Engn & Technol, Div Energy Proc, Teknikringen 42, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Sandberg, Thomas] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Ind Econ & Management, Div Sustainabil & Ind Dynam, Lindstedtsvagen 30, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology; Royal Institute of Technology,"Lönnqvist, T (通讯作者)，KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Chem Engn & Technol, Div Energy Proc, Teknikringen 42, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",tomaslo@kth.se; stefangr@kth.se; thomas.sandberg@indek.kth.se,,"Lonnqvist, Tomas/0000-0002-4321-6894",Swedish Knowledge Centre for Renewable Transportation Fuels (f3),Swedish Knowledge Centre for Renewable Transportation Fuels (f3),This work has been financed by the Swedish Knowledge Centre for Renewable Transportation Fuels (f3).

The best model is selected according to explanatory power, out-of-sample prediction accuracy, goodness of fit and interpretability. We then evaluate the effect of mandatory TOU pricing in a local distribution company in southwestern Ontario, Canada. We use a smart meter dataset of over 20,000 households which is particularly suited to our analysis: it contains data from the summer before and after the implementation of TOU pricing in November 2011, and all customers transitioned from tiered rates to TOU rates at the same time. We find that during the summer rate season, TOU pricing results in electricity conservation across all price periods. The average demand change during on-peak and mid-peak periods is 2.6% and 2.4% respectively. Changes during off-peak periods are not statistically significant. These TOU pricing effects are less pronounced compared to previous studies, underscoring the need for clear, reproducible impact analyses which include full details about the model selection process.","[Miller, Reid; Golab, Lukasz; Rosenberg, Catherine] Univ Waterloo, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Golab, L (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",lgolab@uwaterloo.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Waterloo Institute for Sustainable Energy/Cisco Smart Grid Research Fund,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Waterloo Institute for Sustainable Energy/Cisco Smart Grid Research Fund,This research was funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (Rosenberg) and the Waterloo Institute for Sustainable Energy/Cisco Smart Grid Research Fund (Golab).,,43,21,21,0,16,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUN,2017,105.0,,,,,,534,546,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.03.015,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ET8EY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000400532900051,0

Carbon dioxide capture and utilization (CCU) is a promising approach to reduce emissions and the use of expensive and limited fossil resources. Applying CCU, carbon dioxide (CO2) can be incorporated as raw material during the manufacture of plastic products. While most of the studies address technical feasibilities, hardly any systematic research on public perception and acceptance of those specific products exists so far. This study empirically investigates the acceptance of CCU plastic products (mattress as example). First, interviews with experts and lay people revealed critical acceptance factors (CO2 proportion, saving of fossil resources, disposal conditions, perceived health complaints). Their relative importance was detailed in two consecutive conjoint studies. Study I revealed disposal conditions and saving of fossil resources as essential for product selection, while the products' CO2 proportion was less important. In study 2, potential health complaints were integrated as well as individual levels of domain knowledge and risk perception, which significantly affected acceptance of CCU products.

Considering the weak demand growth of coal power since 2014, continuous decline in the annual utilisation hour and the coming market competition, such a planning target is unwelcome and could further the economic deterioration of coal power. In this paper, we employ LCOE (levelised cost of electricity) and project evaluation models to conduct a nationwide survey on the economics of coal power. The economic analysis has clearly indicated that the recent boom of coal power investment in China, which is absurd in many perspectives, is largely the aftermath of uncompleted market reform in the power sector. However, the fundamentals of electricity demand and supply are changing at a speed beyond the imagination of power generators and have foreboded a gloomy prospect for coal power. Our study shows that by 2020, with several exceptions, in most provinces the internal rate of return for coal power will drop below the social average return rate or will even be negative. In this regard, the 13th FYP capacity planning target for coal power is economically untenable and requires radical revision.","[Zhao, Changhong; Zhang, Weirong; Wang, Yang; Guo, Jingsheng; Xiong, Minpeng; Yuan, Jiahai] North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qilin] Univ Pittsburgh, Asian Studies Ctr, 4400 Posvar Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Yuan, Jiahai] Res Ctr Beijing Energy Dev, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China",North China Electric Power University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Yuan, JH (通讯作者)，North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.",yuanjh126@126.com,"Yuan, Jiahai/I-9186-2019; Zhang, Weirong/JQI-4414-2023","Yuan, Jiahai/0000-0002-1150-7750;",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673085],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The authors acknowledge the funding of National Natural Science Foundation of China (71673085).

However, very few contributions analyze the relevance of the spatial level of analysis. Our hypothesis is that studying the convergence at the level of large regions (states) could conceal intraregional heterogeneity. This hypothesis is consistent with the New Economic Geography framework, which highlighted core-periphery patterns at the local level. However, this polarization mechanism may become difficult to identify with aggregated data or neoclassical dynamics operating at the same time. This paper proposes a multilevel approach to study this question. It allows the identification of possible heterogeneous local patterns of behavior within regions. It is applied to the US economy in a hierarchy of two levels: states and counties. The results show high intraclass correlation, indicating significant variance within states. An overall pattern of convergence is observed in line with previous results, although some states present internal patterns of divergence or significant changes in the rate of convergence.","[Diaz Dapena, Alberto; Rubiera Morollon, Fernando] Univ Oviedo, Reg Econ Lab REGIOlab, Oviedo, Spain; [Paredes Araya, Dusan] Univ Catolica Norte, Antofagasta, Chile",University of Oviedo; Universidad Catolica del Norte,"Morollón, FR (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Reg Econ Lab REGIOlab, Oviedo, Spain.",frubiera@uniovi.es,"Paredes, Dusan/G-9432-2012","Paredes, Dusan/0000-0002-7090-5919; Rubiera Morollon, Fernando/0000-0002-4854-0802; Diaz-Dapena, Alberto/0000-0001-9343-5166","H2020 European Research Council [UE-16-726950-IMAJINE]; Secretaria de Estado de Investigacion, Desarrollo e Innovacion [MINECO-13-ECO2013-48161-R]; Direccion General de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnica (FPU Program)","H2020 European Research Council(Horizon 2020European Research Council (ERC)); Secretaria de Estado de Investigacion, Desarrollo e Innovacion; Direccion General de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnica (FPU Program)","Funding was provided by H2020 European Research Council (Grant No. UE-16-726950-IMAJINE); Secretaria de Estado de Investigacion, Desarrollo e Innovacion (Grant No. MINECO-13-ECO2013-48161-R); Direccion General de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnica (Grant No. FPU Program).",,61,4,4,1,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

An important outcome of the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP) to the 1992 UNFCCC may be plugging of carbon leakage. This study examined the bioenergy industry in Ireland to determine the extent of existing carbon leakage due to national energy policy and to establish if measures identified within the relevant intended nationally determined contributions Will result in plugging of carbon leakage. The study focused on co-firing of biomass with peat, the major use of biomass for energy generation in Ireland. The results show that significant levels of carbon leakage occur due to reliance on imported biomass feedstocks to meet co-firing targets under Irish energy policy. In the post-COP21 scenario, one of the three Intended Nationally Determined Contributions analysed contains a measure which has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from imported biomass by 32%, highlighting the potential of the Paris Agreement to reduce carbon leakage.","[Murphy, Fionnuala] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Biosyst & Food Engn, UCD Belfield, Agr Bldg,Room 3-06, Dublin 4, Ireland; [McDonnell, Kevin] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Agr & Food Sci, UCD Belfield, Agr Bldg,Room 3-15, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Murphy, Fionnuala; McDonnell, Kevin] Univ Coll Dublin, NovaUCD, Biosyst Engn Ltd, Belfield Innovat Pk, Dublin 4, Ireland",University College Dublin; University College Dublin; University College Dublin,"Murphy, F (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Biosyst & Food Engn, UCD Belfield, Agr Bldg,Room 3-06, Dublin 4, Ireland.",fionnuala.murphy@ucd.ie; kevin.mcdonnell@ucd.ie,,"McDonnell, Kevin/0000-0002-5499-9898; Murphy, Fionnuala/0000-0002-9759-9421",EPA [2016-CCRP-SS.11],EPA(United States Environmental Protection Agency),This study was funded by the EPA under grant number 2016-CCRP-SS.11.,,42,26,26,4,45,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2017,104.0,,,,,,80,88,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.01.042,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP7HS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397549500009,0

The divergence between official and real-world values undermines national vehicle taxation schemes and EU-wide CO2 standards for passenger cars, particularly since the divergence increases with new model generations. This study examines real-world fuel consumption data from more than 130,000 vehicles to investigate the development of the divergence. The analysis validates and refines a regression model developed by Ntziachristos et al. (2014), which estimates real-world fuel consumption of cars based on readily available vehicle characteristics, namely official fuel consumption values, vehicle mass, and engine capacity. The regression model yielded coefficients of determination of 0.87 or higher, but was found to underestimate fuel consumption of newer vehicles and company cars. This study proposes to add vehicle build year as a regressor to account for the increasing divergence between official and real-world fuel consumption figures.","[Tietge, Uwe; Mock, Peter; Franco, Vicente; Zacharof, Nikiforos] Int Council Clean Transportat, Neue Promenade 6, D-10178 Berlin, Germany",,"Tietge, U (通讯作者)，Int Council Clean Transportat, Neue Promenade 6, D-10178 Berlin, Germany.",uwe.tietge@theicct.org,"Zacharof, Nikiforos/AAF-7828-2021","Zacharof, Nikiforos/0000-0003-4176-3226; Franco, Vicente/0000-0001-5690-7515",ClimateWorks Foundation [1511-55734]; Stiftung Mercator [1339600],ClimateWorks Foundation; Stiftung Mercator,Funding for this work was generously provided by the ClimateWorks Foundation (Grant no. 1511-55734) and Stiftung Mercator (Grant no. 1339600).

Then we use simulation experiments to compare the performance of estimation techniques that use spatial weights matrices (W) and those that do not. The results suggest that the pattern of time varying correlation does impact inference, but not as much as the W misspecification literature suggests. We find choosing the appropriate inferential method is less of a concern if the data generating process follows a hub-spoke correlation structure. Finally, we confirm earlier results that the cluster robust modifications proposed by Bester et al. (2011) perform well if the group sizes are chosen appropriately.

In order to respond to this issue, society has applied such strategies as clean energy development, improving industrial resource efficiency etc. Despite this, GHG emissions are still pursuing an upward trend. As the largest global GHG emitter, China faces a considerable challenge in responding to its agreed target of 40-45% GHG emission mitigation per unit gross domestic production (GDP) by 2020 as compared to 2005 levels. How to practically achieve this is still largely undecided. Comprehensive development of industrial symbiosis around nationwide is considered part of the solution. However, few researchers have studied how to actually implement a comprehensive development of industrial symbiosis for the purpose of GHG emission mitigation. This work intends to address this gap through highlighting the opportunities to develop such an approach for particular application to GHG emissions reduction in China. In addition, this study will also address the challenges ahead associated with the implementation of such a strategy, and outlines the where future research could be focused. Policy implications like establishing industrial symbiosis indicators associated with GHG emission mitigation are proposed.","[Liu, Zhe; Adams, Michelle; Cote, Raymond P.] Dalhousie Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Studies, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada; [Geng, Yong] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Technol, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Chen, Qinghua] Fujian Normal Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Fuzhou 350007, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Liu, Weili] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Shenyang 110016, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Sun, Lu] Univ Tokyo, Dept Environm Syst, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha Kashiwa shi, Chiba 2778563, Japan; [Sun, Lu] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Yu, Xiaoman] Shenyang Agr Univ, Land & Environm Coll, Shenyang 110866, PR, Peoples R China","Dalhousie University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Fujian Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenyang Institute of Applied Ecology, CAS; University of Tokyo; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Shenyang Agricultural University","Liu, Z; Adams, M (通讯作者)，Dalhousie Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Studies, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.",liuzhe@iae.ac.cn,"Sun, Lu/L-2238-2019; Geng, Yong/B-6310-2018; Liu, Zhe/A-4414-2019","Sun, Lu/0000-0001-7356-7866; Geng, Yong/0000-0002-2284-1375; Adams, Michelle/0000-0002-6745-6200; Yu, Xiaoman/0000-0001-8563-5723","Killam Trusts; Natural Science Foundation of China [71690241, 71325006, 71461137008]",Killam Trusts; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was supported by Killam Trusts and Natural Science Foundation of China (71690241, 71325006, 71461137008).

We highlight the significant opportunities for, as well as the political and economic risks of, Chinese investments in the European energy sector. On the one hand, the benefits can be substantial, as China's new role as a global investor offers substantial economic benefits and political partnership. Further benefits might potentially emerge from backward linkages of Chinese investments to improve access to China's restricted markets. Yet, our findings also point to growing concerns among policymakers and business managers in Europe, ranging from worries about unfair competition and economic risks to concerns about national security.

Energy and environmental science literature often takes an approach based on economic variables such as objectively measureable household and technology characteristics. Increasingly, also subjective variables based on personal belief are considered. On the basis of a survey about the intention to adopt an exemplary novel green consumer technology (intelligent thermostats), we contribute to the clarification of the explanatory power of these two approaches. We first compare the economic model to the belief-based model and second, investigate how beliefs about the green technology are influenced by personal environmental norms and innovativeness. Our evaluation shows that the belief-based model explains considerably higher variance in the intention to adopt. Thereby the perceived hedonic satisfaction, usefulness, habit and facilitating conditions reveal as key determinants. Moreover, environmental norms show lower impact than personal innovativeness. In the discussion we consolidate these findings and point to the risk of omitted variable bias when selectively including belief-based variables in adoption models. Our findings suggest that policies can effectively accelerate the early market diffusion of green consumer technologies by incentivizing retailers to introduce and market such technologies.","[Girod, Bastien; Mayer, Sebastian; Nagele, Florian] ETH, Swiss Fed Inst Technol Zurich, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Grp Sustainabil & Technol, Weinbergstr 56-58, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Girod, B (通讯作者)，ETH, Swiss Fed Inst Technol Zurich, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Grp Sustainabil & Technol, Weinbergstr 56-58, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",bgirod@ethz.ch,,,,,,,63,39,39,2,52,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2017,101.0,,,,,,415,426,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.09.065,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EI8PD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000392768800041,0

The ESA does this in part by requiring the designation of habitat within each listed species' range considered Critical to their recovery. Critics have argued that critical habitat (CH) designation creates Significant economic costs while contributing little to species recovery. Here we examine the effects of CH designation on land cover change. We find that the rate of change from 1992 to 2011 in developed (urban and residential) and agricultural land in CH areas was not significantly different compared to similar lands without CH designation, but still subject to ESA regulations. Although CH designation on average does not affect overall rates of land cover change, CH designation did slightly modify the impact of land cover change drivers. Generally, variation in land prices played a larger role in land cover decisions Within CH areas than in similar areas without CH designation. These trends suggest that developers may require a greater than typical expected return to development in CH areas to compensate for the higher risk of regulatory scrutiny. Ultimately, out results bring into question the very rationale for the CH regulation. If it is for the most part not affecting land cover choices, is CH helping species recover?

A critical appraisal of the UNESCO Creative Economy Report 2013. Regional Studies. Cultural segments of the economy have long been the popular targets of policy-makers intending to promote the economy. The United Nations Creative Economy Report intends to harness the creative economy for goals of economic development policy to the benefit of developing countries. This paper demonstrates that the idea of the creative economy, understood as a development policy tool, has several serious theoretical-conceptual weaknesses. Popularity does not mean the policy tools are or will be successful. For that reason, and with all due respect to the strengths of this concept, they should be subject to critical analysis in each individual case.","[Sternberg, Rolf] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Econ & Cultural Geog, Schneiderberg 50, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover,"Sternberg, R (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Econ & Cultural Geog, Schneiderberg 50, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",sternberg@wigeo.uni-hannover.de,,"Sternberg, Rolf/0000-0002-7649-0419",,,,,43,16,16,5,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

For this purpose, contingent valuation survey was conducted on 300 urban and peri-urban households in northern Ethiopia. A bivariate probit model was used to elicit willingness to pay and analyze determinants of household willingness to pay. On the other hand, welfare gains were analyzed using consumer and producer surpluses. The mean willingness to pay was estimated to be Birr 12.5 (0.66 USD) per month per household for five years on top of monthly electricity bill. Among others, income played positive role on willingness to pay while difference in willingness to pay behavior was observed between male and female headed households. In addition, distance to wood and charcoal (alternative energy) markets played encouraging role for willingness to pay. Results from the welfare analysis show that there is significant societal gain to be made both in terms of surplus for households and producers (government) if the previously 'untapped' green electricity service was implemented. The revenue (producer surplus) for the state would be instrumental in contributing to the state's endeavor to generate a much-needed capital for investment in and expansion of renewable energy.","[Arega, Tiruwork; Tadesse, Tewodros] Mekelle Univ, Coll Dryland Agr & Nat Resources, Dept Nat Resource Econ & Management, POB 231, Mekelle, Ethiopia",Mekelle University,"Arega, T (通讯作者)，Mekelle Univ, Coll Dryland Agr & Nat Resources, Dept Nat Resource Econ & Management, POB 231, Mekelle, Ethiopia.",tiruarega21@gmail.com; tewodroslog@yahoo.com,"Arega, Tiruwork/L-2518-2019",", Tiruwork Arega/0000-0002-1717-5144","Foundation Open Society Institute (FOSI) Baarerstrasse, ZUG, Switzreland [OR2010-18955]","Foundation Open Society Institute (FOSI) Baarerstrasse, ZUG, Switzreland","We would like to thank the Africa Climate Change Adaptation Initiative (ACCI) sponsored by Foundation Open Society Institute (FOSI) Baarerstrasse 12, CH 6300 ZUG, Switzreland (Grant Number: OR2010-18955) for granting funds to do this research.

Thanks to the ETFs, various kinds of assets from different countries can be easily traded on the major stock exchanges. The growing popularity of the ETFs is caused also by their ability to provide a cost-efficient portfolio diversification. As the ETFs should track the performance of the assets contained in their portfolios, it is possible to assume that their stock prices are affected by similar factors, the calendar anomalies included. One of the most famous calendar anomalies is the Halloween effect. Asset markets affected by the Halloween effect tend to do significantly better during the winter half (November - April) than during the summer half of year (May - October). The globalisation and internationalisation of the financial markets helped to spread the calendar anomalies, the Halloween effect included, around the World. This paper is aimed on the investigation of the Halloween effect on the ETFs market and on the evaluation of ability of simple Halloween effect-based investment strategies to generate abnormal returns. Price series of several ETFs with history longer than 20 years that are focused on major stock markets were analysed. The data show that a Halloween effect-based investment strategy is able to beat the buy & hold investment strategy when applied on any of the analysed ETFs.","[Arendas, Peter] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dept Banking & Int Finance, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Arendas, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dept Banking & Int Finance, Bratislava, Slovakia.",p.arendas@centrum.sk,"Arendas, Peter/Q-4465-2017","Arendas, Peter/0000-0003-1413-2795",project VEGA [1/0009/17],project VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This paper is an output of the science project VEGA (1/0009/17) Building of the capital union in Europe and its impacts on individual member countries.,,19,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,61,68,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059200009,0

Besides, most healthcare professionals often resist change. To deal with these obstacles, a design pattern useful for modelling and simulation is suggested in this paper. For deriving patterns in this study, current problems focusing on hospital pharmacy management are initially identified through empirical investigation. Then the suitable solutions can be determined based on the literature review. The design pattern is represented through various attributes including pattern name, purpose, description, modelling structure using a modelling language. In addition, more attributes related to simulation modelling are also combined such as control variables and performance measures. Process modellers can rapidly understand the context of problems through design patterns. The proposed patterns can be reused to create a new model and conduct a successful simulation study. This approach can be a valuable tool to redesign healthcare systems.","[Chanpuypetch, Wirachchaya; Kritchanchai, Duangpun] Mahidol Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Fac Engn, Phutthamonthon 4Rd, Nakhon Pathom 73170, Thailand",Mahidol University,"Chanpuypetch, W (通讯作者)，Mahidol Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Fac Engn, Phutthamonthon 4Rd, Nakhon Pathom 73170, Thailand.",wirachchaya@gmail.com; duangpun.skr@mahidol.ac.th,,"Chanpuypetch, Wirachchaya/0000-0001-7550-7760",,,,,30,0,0,1,4,EUROPEAN COUNCIL MODELLING & SIMULATION,NOTTINGHAM,"SCHOOL COMPUTING & MATHEMATICS, NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV, BURTON STREET, NOTTINGHAM, NG1 4BU, ENGLAND",,,978-0-9932440-4-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,222,228,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Economics; Engineering, Industrial",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Engineering,BH9XI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404420000034,0

It's also important to give examples of evaluation after several measurements. The SNA - 211 REN driving simulator was used for each experimental measurement. It was necessary to use some additional equipment, because the driving simulator was used only for simulation. During simulations, drivers have been performing tasks connected with vehicle driving. Driver's eye tracking in specific conditions was also important part of our research.

Regional Studies. This paper reviews the literature on high human capital interregional migration with particular attention paid to the consequences of inflows and outflows on local economies. While other reviews focusing on the determinants of high-skilled interregional migration flows exist, this is the first attempt to organize and examine the extensive literature on the consequences of such flows on the economies of both receiving and sending regions as well as on the overall system. It is found that the majority of existing contributions focus on economic consequences for destination regions and highlight the strong need for future research that explores impacts on origin regions. In the critical assessment of the state-of-the-art, it is observed that lack of availability of suitable data on migration and migrant characteristics hinders the advancement of high-skilled migration research. The review also stresses the necessity of incorporating innovation, skill composition and gender in future analyses of impacts of high-skilled migration. It concludes with suggestions for novel avenues that researchers can exploit when pursuing future research on the consequences of high human capital interregional migration.","[Faggian, Alessandra; Rajbhandari, Isha; Dotzel, Kathryn R.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Faggian, Alessandra] GSSI, Social Sci, Laquila, Italy",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI),"Faggian, A (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.;Faggian, A (通讯作者)，GSSI, Social Sci, Laquila, Italy.",faggian.1@osu.edu; rajbhandari.5@osu.edu; dotzel.3@osu.edu,"Faggian, Alessandra/K-8548-2019","Faggian, Alessandra/0000-0002-2479-2933",,,,,143,96,105,9,118,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Innovation and entrepreneurship and their geography privileges the firm, industry clusters and/or the individual and poses the city as a container for them. By marrying Jacobs' insights on cities to those of Schumpeter on innovation, it is argued that innovation and entrepreneurship do not simply take in place in cities but in fact require them.","[Florida, Richard] Univ Toronto, Martin Prosper Inst, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Adler, Patrick] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Urban Planning, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Mellander, Charlotta] Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Dept Econ, Jonkoping, Sweden",University of Toronto; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Jonkoping University,"Mellander, C (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Dept Econ, Jonkoping, Sweden.",florida@rotman.utoronto.ca; patrickadler@ucla.edu; charlotta.mellander@ju.se,"Adler, Patrick/AAW-3911-2020; Florida, Richard/AAD-7585-2020","Adler, Patrick/0000-0003-2772-5725;",,,,,109,233,257,40,332,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

In this paper, a framework is developed to estimate intra- and interregional input-output tables. The intraregional estimates are based on the well-known FLQ method. The interregional estimates are constructed using gravity modelling to account for factors like geographic distance between regions. The derived (initial) estimates are embedded in an interregional accounting framework that ensures consistency of regional values with the national aggregates. The framework is applied to the German economy of 2010. The relationship between the FLQ formula and the estimated amount of interregional trade in intermediates, the amount of interregional cross-hauling, and the regional distribution of output multipliers is highlighted.","[Jahn, Malte] Hamburg Inst Int Econ HWWI, Energy Climate & Environm, Hamburg, Germany",,"Jahn, M (通讯作者)，Hamburg Inst Int Econ HWWI, Energy Climate & Environm, Hamburg, Germany.",jahn@hwwi.org,,"Jahn, Malte/0000-0002-7165-0428",,,,,31,26,27,2,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The geographic grid method was adopted in this study to account the ecosystem service value of farmland in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. The result showed that total farmland ecosystem service value in 2015 was 110.3 x 109 yuan and the proportion of ecosystem service value in Hebei Province was the highest which reached up to 92.56%.

The paper avails itself of Swedish micro-level data, which make it possible to identify individual workers, and with whom they live next to and work. The spatial extent of the non-workplace social network - from block group to the whole of a metropolitan area - is varied to examine which social community most affects an individual's income. The paper distinguishes between individuals engaged in high- and low-skilled occupations so as to starkly control for differences in education, training and skills. The results suggest that residential neighbourhoods do matter for individuals' income, although the effect is stronger for low-skilled individuals. For both high-and low-skilled individuals, their workplace group skill has the greatest effect on income, but the effect is negative for high-skilled and positive for low-skilled individuals.","[Mellander, Charlotta] Univ Jonkoping, Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Jonkoping, Sweden; [Stolarick, Kevin] Univ Toronto, Urban Studies, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Lobo, Jose] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ USA",Jonkoping University; University of Toronto; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Mellander, C (通讯作者)，Univ Jonkoping, Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Jonkoping, Sweden.",Charlotta.Mellander@ju.se,,,,,,,57,11,11,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Regional Studies. A growing body of literature has analysed the effect of European Cohesion Policy on regional gross domestic product (GDP) growth. The paper contributes to this literature by discussing Structural Funds and assigning an explicit role to the choice of strategy and the economic structure of regions. In particular, adopting a regression discontinuity design with heterogeneous treatment and using data on NUTS-3 regions makes it possible to identify the causal impact of Structural Funds on regional growth according to the size of the service sector, a sector that accounts for a large share of total Structural Funds expenditure. The paper shows that the larger the sector, the greater the amount of financial resources directed to services and the slower is growth. The interpretation pertaining to policy implications is that higher growth rates can be obtained by promoting the service sector at its early stages, i.e., when it is comparatively small and its potential for productivity growth is higher.","[Percoco, Marco] Univ Bocconi, Dept Policy Anal & Publ Management, Milan, Italy; [Percoco, Marco] Univ Bocconi, CERTeT, Milan, Italy",Bocconi University; Bocconi University,"Percoco, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bocconi, Dept Policy Anal & Publ Management, Milan, Italy.;Percoco, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bocconi, CERTeT, Milan, Italy.",marco.percoco@unibocconi.it,,,,,,,19,49,49,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Previous studies argue that voluntary compliance by firms being business-led initiative is appropriate for developing nations, however provides little empirical evidence. The present study investigates the role of voluntary compliance in improving firms' environmental performance in Indian iron and steel sector using sample of 76 firms over years 2006-07 to 2011-12. Environmental performance is measured by CO2 emissions. In absence of emission data at firm level, we quantify CO2 emissions from energy consumption using Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reference approach. Voluntary compliance is indicated by presence of voluntary environmental management standards - ISO 14001. The study finds that 33% of sample firms comply with ISO 14001. Further, the empirical results based on panel data econometric suggests that there is a significant positive relationship between voluntary compliance and improvement in environmental performance, even after addressing simultaneity issues and including other firm characteristics. Thus, voluntary compliance may be used as supplementary policy tool to achieve low carbon growth in industries. Additionally, there is a need to disseminate information about ISO 14001 by government as well as firms to create awareness.","[Prasad, Mousami; Mishra, Trupti] Indian Inst Technol, Shailesh J Mehta Sch Management, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay,"Prasad, M (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol, Shailesh J Mehta Sch Management, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India.",mousamiprasad@iitb.ac.in,"Mishra, Trupti/AAA-8875-2021",,,,,,51,25,26,2,31,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JAN,2017,100.0,,,,,,41,50,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.09.060,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EH6SJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000391903900005,0

The paper presents the research aimed at identifying the key factors of a spa destination in Slovakia. Then, the relation between the results is researched, which means the revealed significance of the factors in the context of the gender and the age of the visitors and the linkage to the loyalty towards the destination. The primary data were obtained through a questionnaire survey. The research sample was created by the intentional quota selection with the range of 419 respondents. The importance of only three factors is influenced by the gender of the respondents (the security in the destination, information, communication before arrival, the level of personnel quality in tourism services); concerning the age of the respondents the dependency was proved in case of 5 out of 20 evaluated quality factors of the spa destination. In case of 6 factors the direct impact on loyalty towards the destination was confirmed (for instance, the image and the uniqueness of the destination or the offer of specialized spa services and procedures). The factors of quality can be used as the tools for evaluating the competitiveness of the spa destination, they can support effective quality management and, last but not least, they can enable effective targeting of marketing communication strategy of the destination as well as the service providers in the spa destination.

In emerging markets, since hedging possibilities are limited, forecasting becomes the foremost important tool to manage spot price risk. Despite the existence of great diversity of spot price forecasting methods, due to the unique characteristics of electricity as a commodity, there are still three key forecasting challenges that a market participant has to take into account: risk of selection of an inadequate forecasting method and transparency level of the market (availability level of public data) and country-specific multi-seasonality factors. We address these challenges by using a detailed market-level data from the Turkish electricity day-ahead auctions, which is an interesting research setting in that it presents a number of challenges for forecasting. We reveal the key distinguishing features of this market quantitatively which then allow us to propose individual and ensemble forecasting models that are particularly well suited to it. This forecasting study is pioneering for Turkey as it is the very first to focus specifically on electricity spot prices since the country's day-ahead market was established in 2012. We also suggested applicable policy and managerial implications for both regulatory bodies, market makers and participants.","[Avci, Ezgi; Ketter, Wolfgang; van Heck, Eric] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Avci, Ezgi] Turkish Stand Inst, Ankara, Turkey; [Ketter, Wolfgang] Univ Cologne, Inst Energy Econ, Cologne, Germany","Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Harran University; Ministry of Science, Industry & Technology - Turkey; University of Cologne","Avci, E (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands.;Avci, E (通讯作者)，Turkish Stand Inst, Ankara, Turkey.",eavci@tse.org.tr,"Ketter, Wolfgang/W-4931-2017","Ketter, Wolfgang/0000-0001-9008-142X","Ministry of Science, Industry of Technology-The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) [114K601]; Jean Monnet Scholarship (2015-2016) in the area of energy - EU through Ministry for EU Affairs","Ministry of Science, Industry of Technology-The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK); Jean Monnet Scholarship (2015-2016) in the area of energy - EU through Ministry for EU Affairs","The corresponding author greatly acknowledge financial support from Ministry of Science, Industry of Technology-The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) under the project 114K601 and Jean Monnet Scholarship (2015-2016) in the area of energy funded by EU through Ministry for EU Affairs.

While large negative estimates dominate the literature, we show that researchers report positive and insignificant estimates less often than they should. After correcting for this publication bias, we find that the literature is consistent with the mean tuition-enrolment elasticity being close to zero. Nevertheless, we identify substantial heterogeneity among the reported effects: for example, male students and students at private universities display larger elasticities.

While transfer mechanisms involving greater cross-border interaction and recipient effort may provide more learning opportunities, there remains a gap about the causal mechanisms and contingent variables involved in technology transfer and technological capability development. This study offers one of the first firm-level causal analyses of transfer mechanisms and technological capabilities, taking into account various firm-and context specific factors. To this end, India's wind power industry is analyzed using firm-level data and semi-structured interviews conducted in 2013 with 15 wind turbine manufacturers covering 76% of the market share and 12 other organizations working on wind power. The analysis demonstrates that innovation capabilities are accumulated mainly through transfer mechanisms enabling recipients' engagement in research and development. Mergers and acquisitions as well as international research and development centers are among the most effective examples. Joint ventures could be appropriate if a local partner gains a large majority shareholding. The knowledge transfer through wholly foreign-owned enterprises may be restricted because intellectual properties are tightly controlled by their parent firms. The creation of a predictable, performance-oriented market enhances firms' financial resources and consequently encourages knowledge acquisition and capability development.","[Hayashi, Daisuke] Univ Zurich, Dept Int Relat, Ritswneikan Univ, Kita Ku, 56-1 Tojiin Kitamachi, Kyoto 6008577, Japan; [Hayashi, Daisuke] Univ Zurich, Dept Polit Sci, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Hayashi, D (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Dept Int Relat, Ritswneikan Univ, Kita Ku, 56-1 Tojiin Kitamachi, Kyoto 6008577, Japan.;Hayashi, D (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Dept Polit Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.",dhayashi@fc.ritsumei.ac.jp,,,"Volkswagen Foundation, Germany [020303-55200275]; JSPS KAKENHI, Japan [15K16163]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K16163] Funding Source: KAKEN","Volkswagen Foundation, Germany(Volkswagen); JSPS KAKENHI, Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The author would like to thank the editor and two anonymous reviewers for constructive feedback; the interviewees for sharing industry insights; Naresh Verma, Youngjoo Jang and Shusuke Aoji for research assistance; and Axel Michaelowa, Katharina Michaelowa, Joanna Lewis, Joern Huenteler, Joern Hoppmann, Masahiro Sato, and Tobias Schmidt for valuable comments on earlier versions of this manuscript.

To date, the surface area required for RE systems is greater than that for non-RE systems, exacerbating existing environmental policy challenges, from increasing land competition, to visual impacts. A suitable metric for comparing the extent of systems is the power density of electricity production, that is, the electrical power produced per horizontal m(2) of surface area. This study systematically reviews power densities for 9 energy-types (wind, solar etc.) and multiple sub-types (e.g., for solar power: PV, solar thermal) in the United States. Median, mean, and uncertainty estimates are provided for 177 different densities from the literature. Non-renewable power densities are found to be three orders of magnitude larger than renewable densities. Natural gas and solar energy yield the highest median density per non-RE, and RE system respectively. Solar energy was the only system to experience a significant, positive relationship in power density over time. We apply these density estimates to NREL scenarios of future energy systems for state-specific assessments, and find that the largest growth in land use is in the southern United States.","[van Zalk, John; Behrens, Paul] Leiden Univ, Leiden Univ Coll, POB 13228, NL-2501 EE The Hague, Netherlands; [Behrens, Paul] Leiden Univ, Inst Environm Sci, POB 9518, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands",Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University; Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC,"Behrens, P (通讯作者)，Leiden Univ, Leiden Univ Coll, POB 13228, NL-2501 EE The Hague, Netherlands.",p.a.behrens@luc.leidenuniv.nl,,"Behrens, Paul/0000-0002-2935-4799",,,,,47,81,90,1,19,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2018,123.0,,,,,,83,91,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.023,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HE6FW,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000453499700009,0
J,"Andersson, ÅE; Johansson, B",,,,"Andersson, Ake E.; Johansson, Borje",,,Inside and outside the black box: organization of interdependencies,ANNALS OF REGIONAL SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Production theory has remained substantially unchanged since the publication of the theory of production by Frisch (Theory of production, D. Reidel, Dordrecht, 1928; Nord 613 Tidskr Tek Okon 1:12-27, 1935). The theory is based on the idea of a firm deciding on the possible input and output combinations of a single unit of production. His theory was substantially copied in contributions by Carlson (A study on the pure theory of production, University of Chicago, Chicago, 1939) and Schneider (Einfuhrung in die Wirtschaftstheorie. 4 Bande, Mohr, Tubingen, 1947), and later by practically all textbooks in microeconomics. The idea is to model the firm as a black box in which a finite number of externally purchased inputs are transformed into a finite number of outputs to be sold in the market(s). Most of the time, the prices are externally determined. Often, the production process is summarized by some simplified production function as, for example, in the form of a CES function. Another and conceptually richer approach is the formulation of an activity analysis model. In the latter case, simple internal interdependencies can be included. In this paper, we indicate how internal interdependencies can also be modeled within a special CES framework. In recent decades, there has been a remarkable growth in the number of production units of firms such as IKEA, Walmart and Apple to name a few such global networking firms. Most of the analysis of these network firms has been modeled by logistics and other operations-research analysts (Simchi-Levi et al. 2008) and to a limited extent by researchers in business administration schools. Very little has been done in economics. We propose a modeling approach consistent with the microeconomic theory.","[Andersson, Ake E.; Johansson, Borje] Jonkoping Univ, JIBS, Box 1026, S-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden; [Johansson, Borje] Royal Inst Technol, Stockholm, Sweden",Jonkoping University; Royal Institute of Technology,"Andersson, ÅE (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Univ, JIBS, Box 1026, S-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden.",Ake.Andersson@ju.se; Borje.Johansson@ju.se,"Andersson, Ake E./L-3339-2016",,,,,,28,2,2,2,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

However, practical experiences remain ambiguous. This holds especially true for on-time implementation rates. In Brazil, only 17% of the awarded capacity in the first ten auction rounds reached commercial operation within the set out deadline. In this article, we investigate the causes for these delays and discuss potential mitigation measures, based on expert interviews and extensive data analysis. The most severe delays were caused by expansion to the transmission grid. Delays in the supply of wind turbines also led to significant project setbacks. Other factors could be considered of minor relevance, but have led in individual cases to significant delays. These include factors related to project financing, project or environmental licenses, logistics, land-use conflicts and poor project management. Brazil effectively reduced delays caused by transmission grid expansion through amendments to the auction design. Our analysis also shows that options to further mitigate delays through an advanced auction design are limited, as they lead to conflicts with other energy policy objectives, e.g. local production of wind turbines, or because the delays are caused by factors beyond the control of the project developers.","[Bayer, Benjamin] Inst Adv Sustainabil Studies, Berliner Str 130, D-14467 Potsdam, Germany; [Berthold, Lennart] Deutsch Bundesstiftung Umwelt, Bornau 2, D-49090 Osnabruck, Germany; [Rodrigo de Freitas, Bruno Moreno] FGV Energia, Praia Botafogo 210, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",,"Bayer, B (通讯作者)，Inst Adv Sustainabil Studies, Berliner Str 130, D-14467 Potsdam, Germany.",benjamin.bayer.work@gmail.com,,"Bayer, Benjamin/0000-0001-5127-1853; Moreno Rodrigo de Freitas, Bruno/0000-0003-3894-2338",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF); Brandenburg Ministry of Science; German Federal Environmental Foundation,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Brandenburg Ministry of Science; German Federal Environmental Foundation,"This work was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), the Brandenburg Ministry of Science and the German Federal Environmental Foundation (DBU).

This paper explicitly distinguishes between the supply side of energy consumption and demand side of energy consumption, and investigates the factors that affect the energy consumption across economies. Using data from the World Input-Output Database (WIOD), this paper decomposes the relative changes of energy consumption into intensity effect, production structure, structural change in final demand, total final demand effect and household consumption. Then it further decomposes production structure into inter-industry structural effect, and trade effect in intermediate inputs. Overall, energy consumption growth is mainly driven by total final demand (55.04% increase at the world level), but can be significantly reduced by intensity effect due to technological change (21.02% decrease at the world level). There is heterogeneity of structure related effects across economies and within the same economy in both aspects of energy consumption. In addition, the trade effect and household effect are relatively small. This paper provides an empirical framework for analyzing energy consumption in a globalizing world, and suggests tailored and integrated energy policies.","[Zhong, Sheng] Natl Univ Singapore, Energy Studies Inst, 29 Heng Mui Keng Terrace,Block A,10-01, Singapore 119620, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Zhong, S (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Energy Studies Inst, 29 Heng Mui Keng Terrace,Block A,10-01, Singapore 119620, Singapore.",esizs@nus.edu.sg,,,United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO),United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO),This study was supported by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO).,,59,33,33,2,45,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2018,122.0,,,,,,655,667,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.017,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GX2UX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447576700061,0

Hence, the omission of transaction costs in the evaluation (and preparation) of energy efficiency policies leads to suboptimal decision-making. However, empirical evidence on the main factors influencing transaction costs of energy efficiency programmes remains insufficient. By investigating two cases of major energy efficiency subsidy programmes in the Czech Republic, we analyse the role of two factors influencing the transaction costs: size of the projects and type of actors. The results show that while the dependence between the size of the projects and the size of transaction costs is rather straightforward, the role of actors is more complex. On one hand, no significant difference has been found between total transaction costs of the two types of actors entering the analysed programmes (private companies and public entities). Our results imply the potential for optimization of transaction costs in energy efficiency subsidy programmes lies in streamlining the internal processes (especially in the preparatory phase and in public tenders) and a clear legal environment. On the other hand, differences between the two entities were found in the costs of external services, indicating a room for optimization for public bodies.","[Valentova, Michaela; Lizal, Lubomir; Knapek, Jaroslav] Czech Tech Univ, Fac Elect Engn, Tech 2, Prague 16627, Czech Republic",Czech Technical University Prague,"Valentová, M (通讯作者)，Czech Tech Univ, Fac Elect Engn, Tech 2, Prague 16627, Czech Republic.",michaela.valentova@fel.cvut.cz; lubomir.lizal@cvut.cz; knapek@fel.cvut.cz,"Lízal, Lubomír M/HZH-4834-2023; Valentová, Michaela/G-3920-2017","Lízal, Lubomír M/0009-0009-0182-454X; Knapek, Jaroslav/0000-0001-5310-7993",Czech Science Foundation [GA18-02756S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),We would like to thank all the respondents of the survey for their time and helpfulness.

This slow uptake is attributed to the lack of awareness of four major stakeholders, namely the house hold, utility, financier and the policy-maker. This paper presents a coherent framework that addresses the concerns of the stakeholders using four country-specific parameters i.e. the local solar irradiation, PV system costs, borrowing and discount rates, and electricity tariffs; to compute NPV, IRR, payback period and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). Assuming net-metering, we model the economic payoffs on self-consumption and sale of PV electricity at varying net-metering rates, system sizes, load-to-generation profiles, borrowing and discount rates. Findings suggest economic competitiveness of PV electricity, with an IRR and payback averaging around 28% and 5 years respectively. Moreover, the LCOE is also found to be significantly lower than the retail rates. The findings inform the household and financier on the economic yield; utility on efficient tariff setting; and government on sustainable policy design. Finally, we argue that GTRPVGS bears huge potential for Pakistan, suffering from energy deficit, unsustainable cost, transmission losses and environmental hazards.","[Aqeeq, Muhammad Arsalan; Hyder, Syed Irfan] Inst Business Management, Karachi 75190, Pakistan; [Shehzad, Farrukh; Tahir, Muhammad Arsalan] Natl Univ Comp & Emerging Sci, Main Natl Highway, Karachi, Pakistan",,"Aqeeq, MA (通讯作者)，Inst Business Management, Karachi 75190, Pakistan.",arsalan@iobm.edu.pk,"Hyder, Syed Irfan/AAP-7829-2020","Hyder, Syed Irfan/0000-0002-4429-0535",,,,,92,15,15,0,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2018,119.0,,,,,,704,722,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.071,0.0,,,37,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO0XY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439671200065,0

Annual and cumulative demands were compared with reserves and current mining rates. The study results showed that reserves are sufficient to support the total level of solar power, wind power and electric motors. Insufficient reserves may very well constrain certain sub-technologies, but substitutes that take the role of 'back-stop' technologies can be used instead. The exception is batteries, since lithium battery chemistries and reserves were incompatible with the scenarios analysed. Batteries of moderate size, lithium-free chemistry or reserve expansion would make the transition feasible. Choice of sub-technology (e.g. type of solar PV) had a decisive impact on demand for certain metals. Perceptions that many metals are critical and scarce for renewable energy transitions appear exaggerated if a dynamic view on technological development is adopted. Policy-relevant conclusions can be drawn from this, regarding e.g. the benefits of technological diversity, increasing metal intensity, recycling and integrating infrastructure and energy policies (e.g. fast chargers).","[Manberger, Andre] Lund Univ, Environm & Energy Syst Studies, POB 118, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Stenqvist, Bjorn] Lund Univ, Phys Chem, POB 124, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University; Lund University,"Månberger, A (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Environm & Energy Syst Studies, POB 118, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.",Andre.Manberger@miljo.lth.se,"Månberger, André/AAA-5608-2019","Månberger, André/0000-0003-1973-7830; Stenqvist, Bjorn/0000-0002-9099-0663",MISTRA The Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research [DIA 2016/11 5],MISTRA The Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research,"This publication is a deliverable of MISTRA GEOPOLITICS, which is funded by the MISTRA The Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research (DIA 2016/11 #5).",,74,135,147,13,131,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2018,119.0,,,,,,226,241,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.056,0.0,,,31,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO0XY,,"hybrid, Green Published",Y,N,2024-03-10,WOS:000439671200022,0

The first one consists of a family of spatial weights matrix, the exchange matrix, possessing a freely adjustable parameter interpretable as the age of the network, and controlling for the distance decay range. The second one is a matrix of chi-square dissimilarities between outgoing or incoming flows. Flows have to be adjusted, that is their diagonal part must first be calibrated from their off-diagonal part, thanks to a new iterative procedure procedure aimed at making flows as independent as possible. Commuter flows in Western Switzerland as well as migration flows in Western US illustrate the statistical testing of flow autocorrelation, as well as the computation, mapping and interpretation of local indicators of flow autocorrelation.

Data on various behavioral drivers of change can explain energy use at the individual level, but it provides little information about implications for macro energy demand on regional or national levels. We address this challenge by presenting a theoretically-based and empirically-driven agent based model to track aggregated impacts of behavioral changes among heterogeneous households. We focus on the representation of the multi-step changes in individual energy use behavior and on a quantitative assessment of their aggregated impacts on the regional level. We understand the behavioral complexity of household energy use as a dynamic process unfolding in stages, and explore the barriers for utilizing the full potential of a region for emissions reduction.

Secondly, we analyse how emerging area-based energy practices are feeding back into the energy policy system. Based on empirical evidence from a desk study and interviews with community energy initiatives and key governance actors we find that the policy does provide a modest incentive for initiatives to develop renewable energy projects under local conditions. Nevertheless, the policy falls short of allowing initiatives to openly seek for locally desired solutions and hence, to increase opportunities at a local level to develop projects based on local conditions. However, current difficulties with the policy are being considered at a national level urging for adaptation of Dutch energy policies.","[de Boer, Jessica; Zuidema, Christian; de Roo, Gert] Univ Groningen, Dept Spatial Planning & Environm, Groningen, Netherlands; [van Hoorn, Anton] PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, The Hague, Netherlands; [van Hoorn, Anton] PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, Bilthoven, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"de Boer, J (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Dept Spatial Planning & Environm, Groningen, Netherlands.",info@jessicadeboer.com,,"Zuidema, Christian/0000-0001-5055-5053; de Boer, jessica/0000-0002-8471-5841","EDGAR research programme; DELaND, a project part of Groen-Gas, European Territorial Cooperation INTERREG IV A Deutschland - Nederland [II-1-01 =174 Groen Gas]; Energy Delta Gas Research (EDGAR) [C6]","EDGAR research programme; DELaND, a project part of Groen-Gas, European Territorial Cooperation INTERREG IV A Deutschland - Nederland; Energy Delta Gas Research (EDGAR)","This paper was based on research undertaken under MACREDES, a project funded by the EDGAR research programme, and DELaND, a project part of Groen-Gas, European Territorial Cooperation INTERREG IV A Deutschland - Nederland Grant 2012-2015 (number II-1-01 =174 Groen Gas) and Energy Delta Gas Research (EDGAR) Grant 2011- 2014 (number C6).",,42,15,16,1,18,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUN,2018,117.0,,,,,,142,150,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.02.008,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GF4KU,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431932600014,0

The global trade in fuelwood is valued between USD 4-26 billion per annum. In South Africa, fuelwood is a widely used domestic energy source; but how that has changed with rapid urbanisation and socio-economic development over the last two decades is unknown. This study examined the presence and nature of urban fuelwood markets in 39 urban areas of the Eastern Cape and Limpopo provinces. Data were collected from 170 informal fuelwood sellers regarding the prevalence, structure, characteristics, and changes over time of the informal fuelwood markets. Over 80% of the sampled towns had an informal fuelwood market and there was a positive relationship between the number of sellers and town population size. For most sellers, the fuelwood trade was their primary occupation and the income earned was supplemented by government social grants. Sellers earned, on average, over US$9 per day. These results show that despite rapid urbanisation and socio-economic development, fuelwood remains an important domestic fuel in towns and cities of South Africa, and an income source for the urban poor.","[Guild, J.; Shackleton, C.

The increasing share of fixed costs became difficult to recover through traditional rate structures, based on volumetric pricing. This trend is exacerbated by the increase in distributed and intermittent generation from renewable sources, and by changes in demand profiles. This study asks whether utilities across North America are adapting to these changes and taking advantage of dynamic pricing tools and demand response technologies, by taking stock of common tariffing practices to see if utilities do implement rates better tailored to support these transformations. We look at the U.S. Energy Information Administration's national survey, and then refine our analysis with 31 cases across North America. By looking at utilities' current rate practices with regard to dynamic pricing, distributed generation, the integration of new technologies, demand response possibilities, as well as electric vehicle recharge, this exploration makes it clear that a large majority are not ready for these challenges and must innovate rapidly. Moreover, regulatory agencies must ensure that utilities do have the option of designing rates that move away from volume-based pricing and allow for the deployment of sophisticated demand response management.","[Langlois-Bertrand, Simon] Carleton Univ, Norman Paterson Sch Int Affairs, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Pineau, Pierre-Olivier] HEC Montreal, Chair Energy Sect Management, 3000 Chemin Cote St Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada",Carleton University; Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal,"Langlois-Bertrand, S (通讯作者)，Carleton Univ, Norman Paterson Sch Int Affairs, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",simonlangloisbertran@cmail.carleton.ca,,,,,,,27,4,5,0,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUN,2018,117.0,,,,,,184,197,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.03.009,0.0,,,14,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GF4KU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431932600019,0

We consider two types of intervention, first the standard case of a parameter change that does not alter the steady state, and second one that does alter the steady state, e.g. the target rate of inflation. We consider two types of test, one a multi-horizon test, where the postintervention policy horizon, H, is small and fixed, and a mean policy effect test where H is allowed to increase without bounds. The multi-horizon test requires Gaussian errors, but the mean policy effect test does not. It is shown that neither of these two tests are consistent, in the sense that the power of the tests does not tend to unity as H, unless the intervention alters the steady state. This follows directly from the fact that DSGE variables are measured as deviations from the steady state, and the effects of policy change on target variables decay exponentially fast. We investigate the size and power of the proposed mean effect test by simulating a standard three equation New Keynesian DSGE model. The simulation results are in line with our theoretical findings and show that in all applications the tests have the correct size; but unless the intervention alters the steady state, their power does not go to unity with H.","[Pesaran, M.

Many African countries have recently experienced substantial economic growth and aim at fulfilling much of the energy needs associated with continuing along paths of economic expansion by exploiting their large domestic potentials of renewable forms of energy. Important benefits of the abundant renewable energy resources in Africa are that they allow for stimulating economic development, increasing energy access and alleviating poverty, while simultaneously avoiding emissions of greenhouse gases. In this study we analyse what the likely energy demand in Africa could be until 2050, and inspect multiple scenarios for the concomitant levels of greenhouse gas emissions and emission intensities. We use the TIAM-ECN model for our study, which enawbbles detailed energy systems research through a technology-rich cost-minimisation procedure. The results from our analysis fully support an Africa-led effort to substantially enhance the use of the continent's renewable energy potential. But they suggest that the current aim of achieving 300 GW of additional renewable electricity generation capacity by 2030 is perhaps unrealistic, even given high GDP and population growth: we find figures that are close to half this level. On the other hand, we find evidence for leap-frogging opportunities, by which renewable energy options rather than fossil fuels could constitute the cost-optimal solution to fulfil most of Africa's growing energy requirements. An important benefit of leap-frogging is that it avoids an ultimately expensive fossil fuels lock-in that would fix the carbon footprint of the continent until at least the middle of the century.","[van der Zwaan, Bob; Kober, Tom; Dalla Longa, Francesco] Energy Res Ctr Netherlands ECN, Policy Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van der Zwaan, Bob] Johns Hopkins Univ, SAIS, Bologna, Italy; [van der Zwaan, Bob] Univ Amsterdam, Fac Sci HIMS, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Kober, Tom] Paul Scherrer Inst, Energy Econ Grp, Villigen, Switzerland; [van der Laan, Anouk] McKinsey & Co Inc, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van der Laan, Anouk] McKinsey & Co Inc, Bogota, Colombia; [Kramer, Gert Jan] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Utrecht, Netherlands",Johns Hopkins University; University of Amsterdam; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Paul Scherrer Institute; Utrecht University,"van der Zwaan, B (通讯作者)，Energy Res Ctr Netherlands ECN, Policy Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;van der Zwaan, B (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, SAIS, Bologna, Italy.;van der Zwaan, B (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Fac Sci HIMS, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",vanderzwaan@ecn.nl,"van der Zwaan, Bob CC/F-4070-2015",,TRANSRISK project (EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme) [642260]; Shell Global Solutions (ECN) [53872]; Shell; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [642260] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme,TRANSRISK project (EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme); Shell Global Solutions (ECN); Shell(Royal Dutch Shell); H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),"The research that allowed the publication of this paper has been produced with financial support from the TRANSRISK project (EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, grant agreement No. 642260).

One possible solution is the promotion of a new electric heating system, low temperature air source heat pump (LTHP) technology. This paper explores the possibility that the public will accept LTHPs for electric heating. We assess people's willingness to adopt (WTA) as well as willingness to pay (WTP) for LTHP technology and sociodemographic and perception information by conducting field surveys in rural Beijing and empirically characterize the determinants of public acceptance. The analysis reveals that income, science literacy and local environmental concern positively affect WTA and WTP, whereas global environmental concern does not. Contrary to our initial expectation, people in mountainous areas express the highest WTA and WTP, followed by those in hilly and plains areas. These findings suggest that efforts to promote this technology could begin in mountainous areas and move to hilly and then to plains areas, thereby advancing public education on local environmental concerns and science literacy. The adoption of such a plan has the potential to promote electric heating systems in the lowest cost manner and ensures a cleaner environment through the shift from coal to electricity in rural Beijing.","[Zhang Jingchao; Kotani, Koji; Saijo, Tatsuyoshi] Kochi Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Kami, Japan; [Zhang Jingchao] Beijing Assoc Sustainable Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Kotani, Koji; Saijo, Tatsuyoshi] Kochi Univ Technol, Res Inst Future Design, Kami, Japan; [Kotani, Koji; Saijo, Tatsuyoshi] Kyushu Univ, Urban Inst, Fukuoka, Japan; [Kotani, Koji] Rikkyo Univ, Coll Business, Tokyo, Japan; [Saijo, Tatsuyoshi] Res Inst Humanity & Nat, Kyoto, Japan",Kochi University Technology; Kochi University Technology; Kyushu University; Rikkyo University; Research Institute for Humanity & Nature (RIHN),"Kotani, K (通讯作者)，Kochi Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Kami, Japan.;Kotani, K (通讯作者)，Kochi Univ Technol, Res Inst Future Design, Kami, Japan.;Kotani, K (通讯作者)，Kyushu Univ, Urban Inst, Fukuoka, Japan.;Kotani, K (通讯作者)，Rikkyo Univ, Coll Business, Tokyo, Japan.",kotani.koji@kochi-teth.ac.jp,"Kotani, Koji/X-7947-2019; Saijo, Tatsuyoshi/D-1788-2012; Kotani, Koji/C-6896-2011","Kotani, Koji/0000-0003-0667-1895; Kotani, Koji/0000-0003-0667-1895","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [24243028, 17H00980, 16H03621, 16K13354, 16K13362]; Kochi University of Technology; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17H00980, 16K13354, 16K13362, 16H03621] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Kochi University of Technology; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors thank the anonymous referees, Yayan Hernuyadin, Jianyun Jiang, Makoto Kakinaka, Hiroaki Miyamoto, Shibly Shahrier, Kenta Tanaka, Raja Timilsina, Jiandong Ye, Fan Zhang and Yongjie Zhang for their helpful comments, advice and support.

One key implication for investors is how to manage this risk. We construct a monthly stock and oil market integration index and demonstrate that oil investors can offset adverse oil price risk by holding diversified global stock portfolios. The portfolios are formed from eight different combinations of developed and emerging stock markets. We show that measuring the degree of stock-oil market integration is critical to managing the time-varying degrees of integration. Under normal market conditions markets are segmented and this yields the opportunity for oil investors to diversify energy price risk through the purchase of stocks. The optimal oil-stock diversified portfolio provides risk-adjusted positive benefits to investors, with portfolio weights changing over time as COP21 implementation proceeds.","[Batten, Jonathan A.] Univ Utara Malaysia, Sch Econ Finance & Banking, Sintok 06010, Kedah Darul Ama, Malaysia; [Kinateder, Harald; Wagner, Niklas F.] Univ Passau, Dept Business & Econ, Innstr 27, D-94030 Passau, Germany; [Batten, Jonathan A.; Szilagyi, Peter G.] Cent European Univ, Nador Utca 9, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary",Universiti Utara Malaysia; University of Passau; Central European University,"Batten, JA (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Dept Banking & Finance, Caulfield Campus,POB 197, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia.",jabatten@gmail.com; harald.kinateder@uni-passau.de; szilagyip@business.ceu.edu; niklas.wagner@uni-passau.de,"Szilagyi, Peter Gabor/AAC-8854-2019; Batten, Jonathan/J-3838-2013","Szilagyi, Peter Gabor/0000-0003-1197-7928; Kinateder, Harald/0000-0002-3176-2812; Batten, Jonathan/0000-0002-3871-7360",,,,,37,20,20,1,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2018,116.0,,,,,,127,136,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.048,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GD8JH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430758200013,0

A major issue regarding biomass resources is crop residues or leftover biomass that is burnt by farmers after harvesting; this happens due to high transportation costs which make burning the cheapest way to remove the residue. We develop a decision support system using a large-scale linear program with the goal of maximizing profit with and without the emission cost. This system helps identify farms that would benefit society were they to be incentivized under a biomass crop assistance program (BCAP). A case study of leftover corn stover in the state of North Dakota is analyzed to validate the model. Our results reveal that an incentive of $7.20 per ton of corn stover converted to ethanol when 20% of rail capacity is allocated is ideal, as it produces the lowest emissions of 16,784,953 metric tons with a $73,462,599 profit. Furthermore, penalizing emissions resulting from the transportation of corn stover also helps reduce emissions; a suitable value for the penalty could be $71.7 per metric ton of CO2 emitted. Such a policy would result in reducing dependency on petroleum, thus promoting a sustainable biomass supply chain.","[Ghani, N.

Such reductions will require transitioning electrical infrastructure to rely on cleaner fuels and power-generation technologies. Despite the myriad factors influencing both the process and eventual outcome of these transitions, it is typically transitions' cost and individuals' willingness to pay (WTP) for them that dominate both strategic planning and political discourse. Studies used to calculate the public's WTP however often rely on vague policy options, ignore important social and environmental attributes, and fail to provide individuals means for engaging tradeoffs. Here we report on three studies that provided individuals multiple choice tasks for evaluating real-world portfolio options across key social and environmental attributes. Our results show that individuals placed high importance on minimizing costs, yet also consistently ranked strategies highest that reduced both greenhouse gas (GHG) and air particulate emissions, even when those portfolios require considerable cost increases. When provided an opportunity to construct their own portfolios, participants again constructed costly portfolios that significantly reduced both GHG emissions and air pollution. Using multiple choice tasks, we demonstrated individuals' WTP for low-emission energy strategies to be higher than previous studies relying on contingent valuation suggest.","[Bessette, Douglas L.] Michigan State Univ, Coll Agr & Nat Resources, Dept Community Sustainabil, Nat Resources Bldg 480,Wilson Rd Room 327, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Arvai, Joseph L.] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Erb Inst Global Sustainable Enterprise, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Arvai, Joseph L.] Univ Michigan, Stephen M Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Arvai, Joseph L.] Decis Res, Eugene, OR USA",Michigan State University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Bessette, DL (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Coll Agr & Nat Resources, Dept Community Sustainabil, Nat Resources Bldg 480,Wilson Rd Room 327, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",bessett6@msu.edu,,"Bessette, Douglas/0000-0001-7709-8518","Institute for Sustainable Energy, Environment & Economy at the University of Calgary; Carbon Management Canada; Canada School for Energy and Environment; Office of the Vice President for Finance and Operations at Michigan State University","Institute for Sustainable Energy, Environment & Economy at the University of Calgary; Carbon Management Canada; Canada School for Energy and Environment; Office of the Vice President for Finance and Operations at Michigan State University","This research was supported by the Institute for Sustainable Energy, Environment & Economy at the University of Calgary, Carbon Management Canada, the Canada School for Energy and Environment, and the Office of the Vice President for Finance and Operations at Michigan State University.

Spatial differences in resilience result significant across Italian regions. Female employment registers low resilience dynamics and increasing vulnerability during shocks. Since the first half of nineties national and international destabilizing events contributed to amplify regional divergences. The uneven evolution and performance of the manufacturing sector across Italy provides some explanations on the asymmetric geographical distribution of resilience in this country.

It contributes to the discussion of the emerging issue of offshore risk regulation in new petroleum producing countries. We present a comparative analysis contrasting two leading safety regimes namely the United Kingdom and Norway to Ghana's emerging regime to benchmark common features as well as weaknesses. Our findings indicate that Ghana requires a robust regulatory regime that ensures that health and safety risks are properly delineated if the country is to avoid catastrophic accidents. This is especially important as these risks are more pronounced with deepwater operations such as those prevalent in the country's petroleum basins. We propose the enactment of a general Health & Safety at Work law in Ghana backed by subsidiary regulations to harmonise the disjointed and sometimes incoherent health and safety provisions. Additionally, we propose that the health and safety regulatory function of the Ghana Petroleum Commission should be decoupled to form an independent Competent Authority as activity levels and the degree of complexity of operations increase to prevent conflict of interest between its regulatory and licensing functions.","[Acheampong, Theophilus] Univ Aberdeen, Dept Econ, ACREEF, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Akumperigya, Rainer] Partners & Associates, Legal Practitioner, Accra, Ghana",University of Aberdeen,"Acheampong, T (通讯作者)，Univ Aberdeen, Dept Econ, ACREEF, Aberdeen, Scotland.",theo.acheampong@abdn.ac.uk; r.akumperigya@partnersghana.com,"Acheampong, Theophilus/AFK-0946-2022","Acheampong, Theophilus/0000-0002-8026-9071",,,,,30,10,12,0,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2018,113.0,,,,,,701,710,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.10.009,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FT2XO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423009500065,0

Many liberalised electricity systems worldwide are seeing growth in DER including significant capacities of distributed renewable generation. The paper starts from the premise that optimal distribution networks are those that satisfy the objective of a lowest cost power system whilst meeting customers' expectations of reliability and societal desire for sustainability. It highlights major challenges that policy makers face in respect of market and regulatory arrangements that support energy and flexibility provision from a large number of small, variable and often uncertain resources. These challenges include the need to respect the technical limits of the system and ensure its operability, development of well designed mechanisms to support innovation, and an appropriate share of risk between market actors. A key contribution of the paper is to discuss the opportunities offered by more active distribution system operation as a substitute for capital investment and its regulatory and policy implications. Finally, the paper presents priorities for policy to facilitate a highly distributed electricity system.","[Bell, Keith; Gill, Simon] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Royal Coll Bldg,204 George St, Glasgow G1 1XW, Lanark, Scotland",University of Strathclyde,"Gill, S (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Royal Coll Bldg,204 George St, Glasgow G1 1XW, Lanark, Scotland.",keith.bell@strath.ac.uk; simon.gill@strath.ac.uk,,"Gill, Simon/0000-0002-4583-6042; Bell, Keith/0000-0001-9612-7345",research programme of the UK Energy Research Centre [EP/L024756/1]; EPSRC [EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: researchfish,research programme of the UK Energy Research Centre; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This work has been carried out as part of the research programmes of the UK Energy Research Centre (grant EP/L024756/1, www.ukerc.ac.uk/) and ClimateXChange (Energy System Modelling Grant, 2014, www.climatexchange.org.uk/).",,56,66,69,1,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2018,113.0,,,,,,765,777,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.11.039,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FT2XO,,"Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423009500071,0

Recently, studies on environmental impacts of OWFs have emerged. Few studies have been carried out to discuss the issues comprehensively. This study develops a set of comprehensive OWF siting criteria; including the profitability, social, security and environmental considerations. It solicits expert opinions from academia and industry through an international Delphi method. Contrary to the typical consensus seeking in Delphi studies, it focuses on understanding the dissensus through a comprehensive discussion. We find that profitability and social considerations are the most commonly agreed siting criteria among the experts whereas environmental and security criteria receive less agreement. As OWFs move further offshore, we are concerned about the understanding of the associated environmental impacts, and how energy and marine policy affect the marine spatial planning and consenting process. Research must get ahead of the developments to provide a better understanding of the potential impacts and to guide the consenting and monitoring processes.","[Ho, Lip-Wah; Lie, Tek-Tjing; Clear, Tony] Auckland Univ Technol, Sch Engn Comp & Math Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Leong, Paul Tm] Auckland Univ Technol, Dept Business Informat Syst, Auckland, New Zealand",Auckland University of Technology; Auckland University of Technology,"Ho, LW (通讯作者)，Auckland Univ Technol, Sch Engn Comp & Math Sci, Auckland, New Zealand.",holipwah@gmail.com,"Ho, Oliver/H-8843-2019; Lie, Tek Tjing/AAI-2900-2020","Ho, Oliver/0000-0001-7706-2275; Lie, Tek Tjing/0000-0002-1091-2121; NGUYEN, BINH/0000-0002-0452-2047; Clear, Tony/0000-0001-6985-5064",,,,,96,29,31,1,32,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2018,113.0,,,,,,53,67,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.10.049,0.0,,,15,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FT2XO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423009500007,0

The relevance of the study of the informal labor market is explained by the following reasons: first of all, the problem is related to poverty, which is a consequence of the informal character of labor relations. The second reason is fiscal: informal and shadow workers do not pay taxes and social contributions, which limits the budget possibilities of the government. The third reason is the limited opportunities for economic growth due to the low level of productivity and inefficient use of labor in the informal sector. The authors analyze the structure and determinants of informal employment and the differences in pay between the employed in formal and informal sectors. The article evaluates the volumes of shadow and informal employment in Ukraine by different methods. The general factors affecting the size of the informal segment for developed and developing countries are defined as well as the mutual influence between macroeconomic and labor indicators.Analyzing the impact of informal employment on the labor market and macroeconomic indicators, the authors conclude that there is a need for institutional changes in the labor sphere in terms of strengthening the state impact on employers in order to enhance their social responsibility.

To reduce electricity consumption-related emissions effectively at the level of individual firms, it is essential that they are measured accurately and that decision-relevant information is provided to managers, consumers, regulators and investors. However, an emergent GHG accounting method for corporate electricity consumption (the 'market-based' method) fails to meet these criteria and therefore is likely to lead to a misallocation of climate change mitigation efforts. We identify two interrelated problems with the market-based method: 1. purchasing contractual emission factors is very unlikely to increase the amount of renewable electricity generation; and 2. the method fails to provide accurate or relevant information in GHG reports. We also identify reasons why the method has nonetheless been accepted by many stakeholders, and provide recommendations for the revision of international standards for GHG accounting. The case is important given the magnitude of emissions attributable to commercial/industrial electricity consumption, and it also provides broader lessons for other forms of GHG accounting.","[Brander, Matthew; Ascui, Francisco] Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Business & Climate Change, Business Sch, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Gillenwater, Michael] GHG Management Inst, Seattle, WA USA",University of Edinburgh,"Brander, M (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Business Sch, 29 Buccleuch Pl, Edinburgh EH8 9JS, Midlothian, Scotland.",Matthew.Brander@ed.ac.uk,"Ascui, Francisco/AAD-4904-2019","Ascui, Francisco/0000-0001-6036-3987",UK's Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC); Society for the Advancement of Management Studies (SAMS); UK Commission for Employment and Skills (UKCES) through Management and Business Development Fellowship Scheme [ES/L002698/1]; ESRC [ES/L002698/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L002698/1] Funding Source: researchfish,UK's Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Society for the Advancement of Management Studies (SAMS); UK Commission for Employment and Skills (UKCES) through Management and Business Development Fellowship Scheme; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Matthew Brander would like to acknowledge the UK's Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), in partnership with the Society for the Advancement of Management Studies (SAMS) and the UK Commission for Employment and Skills (UKCES), for their support through the Management and Business Development Fellowship Scheme (Grant reference: ES/L002698/1).",,35,40,42,5,38,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JAN,2018,112.0,,,,,,29,33,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.09.051,0.0,,,5,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FO2NK,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416615800005,0

Adopting a recently developed technique, it uses a structural vector autoregressive model in which the causal directions between KIBS and other sectors are examined including various time lags. Results show that although regional growth has a negative short-term effect on KIBS, KIBS growth has a long-term positive effect on the whole regional economy.

The goal of safety management is to eliminate, and if it is not possible, to limit the extent of damage that transport incidents can cause. Along with the development of this area, it is necessary to consider all possible actions that are applied after the incident (reactive activities) and those that are implemented preventively based on analysis of processes and risks (proactive activities) described in this paper. Increasingly, this analysis is also based on predictive actions that identify unlikely risks (most often a compilation of unlikely sources of risk) that cause catastrophic consequences. Risk management is one of the most important tools of modern systemic approach to process modelling (Sitarz, 2012). Generally, it may be described as a system of interrelated actions and decisions aimed at integration and coordination of processes in the organization, in cooperation with the external parties. The aim of management is therefore to improve the proficiency, effectiveness and efficiency of the operation and - in the case of risk management arising from the transport processes - to improve transport safety. The paper describes a proposal of a risk management method in transport that can be used globally together with an analysis of railway transport risk sources.","[Chruzik, Katarzyna; Wachnik, Rafal] WSB Univ, Dept Rail Transport, Gdansk, Poland",,"Chruzik, K (通讯作者)，WSB Univ, Dept Rail Transport, Gdansk, Poland.",kchruzik@wsb.edu.pl; rafal_wachnik@tlen.pl,"Chruzik, Katarzyna/D-1831-2016; Chruzik, Katarzyna/G-3494-2018","Chruzik, Katarzyna/0000-0002-6936-8706;",,,,,11,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,561,569,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300074,0

These models generally have a large set of free parameters, whose impact on output needs to be explored. Considering also the need for replication due to stochasticity, a proper analysis requires a very large set of simulation runs. Therefore, obtaining a simpler representation of a simulation model (e.g., metamodel) can prove useful. We primarily focus on the potential utilization of various metamodeling approaches, namely Decision Trees, Random Forests, k-Nearest Neighbor Regression, and Support Vector Regression in predicting the two different types of outputs of an agent-based model. Results show that system-level outputs are predicted with higher accuracy compared to individual-level outputs under equal sample sizes.

Improving environmental performance allows firms to reduce costs, gain a strong reputation among customers, get access to international markets and increase sales. Companies achieve better results through technological advances as well as organizational management improvement. Proactive pollution prevention efforts provide organizations with unique advantages and may even increase manufacturing performance as they require a fundamental rethinking of products and processes that can create opportunities for improvements and innovations. The article presents research results on the interactions between selected environmental initiatives and the internal factors of competitiveness of manufacturing companies located in Poland. The analyzed environmental initiatives include pollution prevention, recycling of materials, reduction of waste generated, reduction of fuel and energy consumption, and reduction of water consumption. Among the analyzed factors of competitiveness are quality, delivery, flexibility and cost. The empirical analysis is based on the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM).

Were these debtors symptomatic of a propertied class that was unable to compete in an unfavourable economic context? Or perhaps, more likely, were they a sign of far-reaching changes in the European economy? Are we seeing passive rentiers, or, rather, landowners who were adapting to the newly triumphant version of capitalism? This article addresses the transformations that Catalan rural elites underwent during the second half of the nineteenth century. The first section examines some of the characteristics of the landowners whose assets were sold at auction. In the second section, the levels of diversification of income sources for the 50 principal taxpayers of the Girona province are analysed. The third and final section demonstrates how the evolution of the number of large-estate auctions was linked to the upheavals of the financial markets.","[Garcia-Orallo, Ricard] Univ Girona, Ctr Recerca Hist Rural, Girona, Spain",Universitat de Girona,"Garcia-Orallo, R (通讯作者)，Univ Girona, Ctr Recerca Hist Rural, Girona, Spain.",,"Garcia-Orallo, Ricard/K-4241-2014",,,,,,80,1,1,0,5,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

Many related policies, such as the fracking tax in the U.S. and the shale subsidies policy in China, depend heavily on whether or not the innovation is commercially successful. This paper develops a two-step approach to evaluate the effect of the revolution on efficiency in the global oilfield service (OFS) market, which can be divided into five segments. In the first step, a new semiparametric model is introduced to evaluate firm-level technical efficiencies assuming segment-specific production functions for each of the five segments. In the second step, this study tests if companies acquiring directional drilling (DD) and/or hydraulic fracturing (HF) techniques can maintain efficiency. The empirical results show that practicing just one of the techniques will decrease efficiency. However, combining the two can produce significant spillover effects and improve efficiency. Therefore, innovation and integration are both crucial for the OFS market. Some policy implications are also discussed.","[Gong, Binlei] Zhejiang Univ, CARD, Sch Publ Affairs, Dept Agr Econ & Management, 688 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University,"Gong, BL (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, CARD, Sch Publ Affairs, Dept Agr Econ & Management, 688 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",gongbinlei@zju.edu.cn,,"Gong, Binlei/0000-0002-0615-9341",,,,,55,21,25,1,59,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JAN,2018,112.0,,,,,,162,172,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.09.054,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FO2NK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416615800018,0

Developing international cooperation, linking economies and emerging multinationals enables businesses to increase their efficiency and performance, and to increase return on investment for investors. Investing in the international space has the need to ensure that corporate management takes its decisions in the interest of business owners. Scandals of the recent past have highlighted the need for a uniform adjustment of corporate governance principles and their constant updating. Corporate governance principles help evaluate and improve the legal, regulatory and institutional framework for corporate governance to promote economic efficiency, sustainable growth, and financial stability of businesses. They help align ownership goals with management decisions, regulate management processes, and thereby ensure that business owners' goals are met, such as achieving the required return on invested resources and long-term growth in the value of the corporate assets. In our contribution, we examine the issue of corporate governance in terms of agency theory. We examine the relationship between corporate governance and firm performance. We are interested in how the selected determinants of corporate governance affect the performance of the corporate, measured by profitability indicators. We will examine the issue on the sample of companies admitted to the regulated market in the Slovak Republic.","[Grofcikova, Janka; Izakova, Katarina] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Grofcíková, J (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia.",janka.grofcikova@umb.sk; katarina.izakova@umb.sk,,,,,,,22,2,2,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,532,539,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300070,0

Using agent-based approaches to solve VRPs allows the analysis of dynamic VRP instances that incorporate congestion effects. By using a domain-specific language as part of a model-driven approach, routing problems can be modelled in an abstract form that does not contain implementation and other technical details. With such a tool domain experts can concentrate on the actual modelling task without being distracted by low-level intricacies. We present the DSL Athos in which computational and platform independent routing problems can be defined. The DSL offers an efficient way to model problems with seamless integration of established optimisation methods. Generators create executable code for several agent based platforms. Proof of concept is given by applying the tools to the Oliver 30 TSP and an instance of a dynamic TSP.","[Hoffmann, Benjamin; Guckert, Michael; Farrenkopf, Thomas] TH Mittelhessen, Kite Kompetenzzentrum Informationstechnol, Giessen, Germany; [Chalmers, Kevin; Urquhart, Neil] Edinburgh Napier Univ, Sch Comp, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",Edinburgh Napier University,"Hoffmann, B (通讯作者)，TH Mittelhessen, Kite Kompetenzzentrum Informationstechnol, Giessen, Germany.",benjamin.hoffmann@mnd.thm.de; michael.guckert@mnd.thm.de; thomas.farrenkopf@mnd.thm.de; k.chalmers@napier.ac.uk; n.urquhart@napier.ac.uk,,,,,,,21,1,1,0,0,EUROPEAN COUNCIL MODELLING & SIMULATION,NOTTINGHAM,"SCHOOL COMPUTING & MATHEMATICS, NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV, BURTON STREET, NOTTINGHAM, NG1 4BU, ENGLAND",,,978-0-9932440-7-0,,,,2018,,,,,,,262,268,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Engineering, Industrial",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Engineering,BR5JS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000656119000038,0

Statutory audit is conducted based on International Standards on Auditing (ISA), which many countries of the world have adopted for their own sake. Depending on the size criteria, audit firms may also be audited. Therefore, the contribution will focus on audits carried out in audit firms based in Slovakia in 2014-2017. Audited companies are generally companies that operate not only on the Slovak market but also abroad, all over the world. In many cases, auditing companies act as part of a network of multinational companies. The auditing firm's audit is therefore important not only for the company itself but primarily for its clients. In globalization, it is not a problem to carry out an audit in one country where the entity is based in another country. The data for the analysis were obtained from the financial statements and from the websites of the individual audit firms.

The score dynamics for the unobserved true covariance matrix are robust to outliers and incidental large observations in both types of data by assuming a matrix-F distribution for the realized covariance measures and a multivariate Student's t distribution for the daily returns. The filter for the unknown covariance matrix has a computationally efficient matrix formulation, which proves beneficial for estimation and simulation purposes. We formulate parameter restrictions for stationarity and positive definiteness. Our simulation study shows that the new model is able to deal with high-dimensional settings (50 or more) and captures unobserved volatility dynamics even if the model is misspecified. We provide an empirical application to daily equity returns and realized covariance matrices up to 30 dimensions. The model statistically and economically outperforms competing multivariate volatility models out-of-sample.

The research uses a Panel Vector Autoregressive framework which accounts for possibility of both dynamism and endogeneity issues in the FDI-Domestic investment link, while at the same time providing interesting insight on the link both in the long and short run. The results from the analysis reveal that in the long run, FDI has a positive impact on domestic investment, with a reported 1% increase in FDI contributing to a boost in domestic investment by 0.22% thus confirming a crowding in effect. The other explanatory variables were reported to have the expected sign and significance with the GDP of the country being one of the most important ingredients of domestic investment. The short run estimates overall confirm those of the long run. The smaller short run coefficients suggest that it may take some time for FDI to have its full effect on domestic investment. The lagged of the investment term is observed to be positive and significant implying that investment is of a dynamic nature. Moreover, domestic investment is reported to have a positive effect on FDI, confirming the presence of bi-causality.","[Seetanah, Boopen; Matadeen, Jevita; Fauzel, Shareen; Kheshansing, Gopal] Univ Mauritius, Fac Law & Management, Reduit 80837, Mauritius",University of Mauritius,"Seetanah, B (通讯作者)，Univ Mauritius, Fac Law & Management, Reduit 80837, Mauritius.",b.seetanah@uom.ac.mu,"Seetanah, Boopen/AAR-2103-2021",,,,,,24,0,0,0,0,EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"UNIV ECONOMICS, EKONOMICKA UNIVERZITA & BRATISLAVE, DOLNOZEMSKA CESTA 1, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-4571-6,,,,2018,,,,,,,429,437,,,,,,9,Business; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BN0SZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000473407100050,0

Proposed map-relative localization method is built upon a combination of vision-based lane markings detection and odometry data. Detected lane markings are aligned with a reference map in order to derive global pose estimate while odometry provides path consistency. To combine heterogeneous sensory data use is made of particle filter method. It allows for non-Gaussian noise common for vision-based detectors as well as a further extension of data sources. The approach described in this work was tested on a real vehicle in urban environment and proved itself to be precise and reliable enough for real-world applications.

Despite the existence of surplus natural gas capacity in the U.S., power system operational constraints not often considered in power sector policy analyses, such as transmission congestion, generator ramping constraints, minimum generation constraints, planned and unplanned generator outages, and ancillary service requirements, could limit the potential and increase the cost of coal-to-gas re-dispatch. Using a highly detailed power system unit commitment and dispatch model, we estimate the maximum potential for re-dispatch in the Eastern Interconnection, which accounts for the majority of coal capacity and generation in the U.S. Under our reference assumptions, we find that maximizing coal-to-gas re-dispatch yields emissions reductions of 230 million metric tons (Mt), or 13% of power sector emissions in the Eastern Interconnection, with a corresponding average abatement cost of $15-$44 per metric ton of CO2, depending on the assumed supply elasticity of natural gas.","[Steinberg, Daniel C.; Bielen, David A.] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Townsend, Aaron] Elect Reliabil Council Texas, Taylor, TX USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA,"Steinberg, DC (通讯作者)，Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Golden, CO 80401 USA.",daniel.steinberg@nrel.gov,,"Steinberg, Daniel/0000-0003-1769-2261","U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Policy and Systems Analysis","U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Policy and Systems Analysis","Support for this work was provided by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Policy and Systems Analysis.

The process is influenced by psychological factors that provoke positive and negative feelings in internal stakeholders. The objective of this paper was to determine the key psychological factors, which influence the perception of financial and non-financial benefits and barriers in the phase of implementing and promoting of controlling in Slovak enterprises from the owner's point of view. Surveying the given problem was performed in Slovak enterprises by questioning method via questionnaire. Based on the achieved results, positive and negative psychological factors were identified and recommendations were proposed. The aim of these recommendations was that owners try to induce positive factors in other internal stakeholders in the phase of implementing and promoting of controlling, and on the other hand, to eliminate negative factors. If they achieve this, their enterprises will be prosperous, and the implementation of controlling will be successful.","[Strokova, Zuzana; Klementova, Jarmila] Tech Univ Zvolen, Fac Wood Sci & Technol, Dept Business Econ, TG Masaryka 24, Zvolen 96053, Slovakia",Technical University Zvolen,"Stroková, Z (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Zvolen, Fac Wood Sci & Technol, Dept Business Econ, TG Masaryka 24, Zvolen 96053, Slovakia.",zuzana.strokova@tuzvo.sk; jarmila.klementova@tuzvo.sk,"Klementová, Jarmila/CAG-9381-2022","Klementová, Jarmila/0000-0002-3024-5899",VEGA MS SR [1/0010/17],VEGA MS SR(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This paper is an output of the science project VEGA MS SR c. 1/0010/17.,,20,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1847,1854,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300236,0

In this paper, we focus on solving two location problems of these sensors: one to observe and one to estimate path flows. These problems have only been solved for small-scale networks until recently due to being computationally expensive. Therefore, we try to present a method to solve these models for large-scale networks. Due to resemblance of these models and set covering problem, we used heuristic and meta-heuristic methods based on set covering problem.

Oil price fluctuation will change consumers' behavior. Understanding how changes in oil price affect the use and purchase of private cars is valuable to formulating price and emissions mitigation policies. In this paper, we use survey data from four cities: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and a total of 715 responses were deemed used for the analyses. The results show that the sensitivity of low-income consumers to oil price is significantly higher than high-income consumers. Compared with low-income consumers, high-income consumers would Drive Less only when oil price rise to a higher level. In addition, for the high-income consumers with a potential purchase intention, only when oil price rise to more than 10 Yuan will they change the purchase intension and choose a lower-emission car or as we called Purchase Lower.","[Du, Zhili] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, China Ctr Energy Econ Res, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Lin, Boqiang] Xiamen Univ, Sch Management, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; Xiamen University,"Lin, BQ (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Sch Management, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",duzhili620@126.com; bqlin@xmu.edu.cn,"Lin, Boqiang/G-3960-2010","Lin, Boqiang/0000-0002-1308-400X; Du, Zhili/0000-0001-5152-737X",Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy [1260-Z0210011]; Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding [1260-Y07200]; China National Social Science Fund [15ZD058],Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy; Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding; China National Social Science Fund,"The paper is supported by the Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy (No: 1260-Z0210011), Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding (No:1260-Y07200) and China National Social Science Fund (No. 15ZD058).",,26,20,20,5,50,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2017,111.0,,,,,,68,74,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.09.017,0.0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FN1VQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000415779700009,0

Using statistical data, simulation modeling, and a dynamic analysis framework, the authors assess the potential and distribution of regional agricultural biomass in Heilongjiang, China. The results indicate 32.48 x 10(6) t of agricultural biomass were available in 2003; this soared to 77.13 x 10(6) t in 2013. Gray correlation analysis demonstrated that precipitation, total population, mechanical power and agricultural planting structure largely influenced the availability of biomass resources. The support of corn oil storage plays an important role of agricultural planting structure. Statistical and Net Primary Production data were used to study the dynamic change in the availability of agricultural biomass. The growth rate of available biomass exceeded 2 t km(-2)y(-1) in most areas of the Sanjiang Plain, and ranged from - 1.5 to 2.0 t km(-2)y(-1) in the Songnen Plain. The establishment of a scientific resource management and scheduling platform is suggested to achieve the dynamic allocation and scheduling of agricultural biomass that will improve resource stability. The methods here can also be applied to other regions and provide baseline data for local authorities to further consider a strategy for bioenergy planning and development.","[Wang, Wenyan; Ouyang, Wei; Hao, Fanghua; Liu, Genyuan] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Water Environm Simulat, 19 Xinjiekouwai St, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University,"Ouyang, W (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Water Environm Simulat, 19 Xinjiekouwai St, Beijing, Peoples R China.",wei@bnu.edu.cn,"wang, wy/JDD-3603-2023; ouyang, wei/AAM-8141-2020","wei, ouyang/0000-0002-5851-056X",Supporting Program of the Twelfth Five-year Plan for Sci & Tech Research of China [2012BAD15B05],Supporting Program of the Twelfth Five-year Plan for Sci & Tech Research of China,This paper was financially supported by the Supporting Program of the Twelfth Five-year Plan for Sci & Tech Research of China (2012BAD15B05).,,31,22,22,1,47,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,337,349,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.06.068,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400031,0

Inefficiency may result from thin allowance markets, poor price discovery, and regulatory or organizational complexities that hinder the recognition of opportunity costs. Concerns about fairness may result from intransparency in the process of transferring substantial allowance value. We explore the role of consignment auctions in mitigating these concerns. These revenue-neutral auctions return the financial value of allowances to their original holders while revealing prices and directing allowances to their highest-valued use. They also can be used to support a minimum price when allowances are freely distributed, which may facilitate program linkage. Consignment auctions have minimal administrative costs and do not necessarily involve government. Experience indicates that they can play an important role, especially in new markets.","[Burtraw, Dallas; McCormack, Kristen] Resources Future Inc, 1616 P St NW, Washington, DC 20026 USA",Resources for the Future,"Burtraw, D (通讯作者)，Resources Future Inc, 1616 P St NW, Washington, DC 20026 USA.",burtraw@rff.org; kem02011@mymail.pomona.edu,,,Energy Foundation [G-1511-24070]; US Department of Energy through National Renewable Energy Laboratory [RGN-6-62501],Energy Foundation; US Department of Energy through National Renewable Energy Laboratory,"We appreciate comments from Nicholas Bianco, Tomas Carbonell, Franz Litz and Karen Palmer.

The reliability of the framework is validated with simulated data in Monte Carlo experiments. The framework is applied to assess the time-varying intra-country synchronization in the US. The main results report substantial changes over time in the cyclical affiliation patterns of US states, and show that the more similar the economic structures of states, the higher the correlation between their business cycles. A synchronization-based network analysis discloses a change in the propagation pattern of aggregate contractionary shocks across states, suggesting that the US has become more internally synchronized since the early 1990s.","[Leiva-Leon, Danilo] Banco Espana, DG Econ & Res, Alcala 48, Madrid 28014, Spain",Banco de Espana,"Leiva-Leon, D (通讯作者)，Banco Espana, DG Econ & Res, Alcala 48, Madrid 28014, Spain.",danilo.leiva@bde.es,,,,,,,45,13,13,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

The study aimed to estimate the external costs of silicon production to inform policy on the sustainable exploitation of solar energy. Specifically, the study estimated the cost of health damage and agricultural loss resulting from the pollution of silicon production. The data was collected from a silicon industrial zone in Southwest China. The cost of agricultural loss was estimated using a production function method, while the cost of health damage was estimated using dose-response functions, in which the air pollutant concentration was estimated based on a Gaussian dispersion model.

The current study, utilizing data from the Santa Cruz Active Management Area in Arizona and from Nogales in Sonora, Mexico, builds an integrated framework of intersectoral water allocation within each region, incorporating relevant economic, physical and institutional constraints. Results from the baseline model and from three scenarios representing population growth and water scarcity, suggest higher optimal water use and net benefits in the urban residential sector for both regions. The outcomes conform to previous studies emphasizing the need for better water supply infrastructure and reuse of treated wastewater to counter demand from a growing population and climate induced water shortages in the region.","[Ghosh, Sanchari] Northeastern State Univ, Dept Accounting & Finance, 700 N Grand Ave, Tahlequah, OK 74464 USA; [Ibarraran, Maria E.] Univ Iberoamericana Puebla, Dept Social Sci, Puebla 72810, Mexico; [Willett, Keith D.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Econ & Legal Studies Business, Spears Sch Business, 339 Business Bldg, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Torres Esqueda, Gerardo Sanchez] Univ Autonoma Tamaulipas, Dept Civil Engn, Tampico 89339, Tamaulipas, Mexico",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; Universidad Autonoma de Tamaulipas,"Ghosh, S (通讯作者)，700 N Grand Ave, Tahlequah, OK 74464 USA.",11.sanchari@gmail.com; mariaeugenia.ibarraran@iberopuebla.mx; keith.willett@okstate.edu; gsanchezt@docentes.uat.edu.mx,,,"Oklahoma NSF EPSCoR, ROA + grant [IIA-1301789]; Office of Integrative Activities; Office Of The Director [1301789] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Oklahoma NSF EPSCoR, ROA + grant; Office of Integrative Activities; Office Of The Director(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)NSF - Office of Integrative Activities (OIA))","This work was supported by Oklahoma NSF (IIA-1301789) EPSCoR, ROA + grant.",,44,9,9,1,27,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4284,,,WATER RESOUR ECON,Water Resour.

We analyze the role of electric utilities as important actors to catalyze the transition to electric cites, drawing upon data for the world's 27 megacities. Progress towards the ideal electric city is most advanced for Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires for low carbon electricity, while Indian megacities have relatively high use of carbon-intensive electricity as a percentage of total energy use. There is wide variety in the structure of markets for electricity provision in megacities, with a dominant, public utility being the most common model. We review literature on electricity sector business models and broadly propose future models dependent on the predominance of locally dispersed generation and the nature of the ownership of the electric grid within the city. Where a high proportion of electricity can be provided by locally distributed supply within a city, the role of utilities could predominantly become that of enabler of exchange with the grid, but new pricing structures are required. A further challenge for utilities in enabling the electric city is to provide a higher level of resilience to events that disrupt power supply.","[Kennedy, Chris; Stewart, Iain D.] Univ Toronto, Dept Civil Engn, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Facchini, Angelo] IMT Sch Adv Studies, Lucca, Italy; [Facchini, Angelo] NRC Inst Complex Syst Studies, Rome, Italy; [Mele, Renata] Enel Fdn, Rome, Italy",University of Toronto; IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca; ENEL SpA,"Kennedy, C (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Civil Engn, Toronto, ON, Canada.",christopher.kennedy@utoronto.ca,,"Kennedy, Christopher/0000-0001-8812-4451; FACCHINI, Angelo/0000-0003-2652-5238",Enel Foundation,Enel Foundation,The Enel Foundation funded and participated in this research.,,44,22,22,3,55,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2017,106.0,,,,,,122,128,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.02.047,0.0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EW2RL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402343600013,0

It tests one aspect of Elinor Ostrom's design principles for successful management of common pool resources: that there should be community accountability for individual consumption behaviour. This is explored through interviews with participants in a community demand response (DR) trial in an urban neighbourhood in the UK. Domestic DR can make a contribution to balancing electricity supply and demand. This relies on smart meters, which raise vertical (individual to large organisation) privacy concerns. Community and local approaches could motivate greater levels of DR than price signals alone. We found that acting as part of a community is motivating, a conclusion which supports local and community based roll out of smart meters. Mutually supportive, voluntary, and anonymous sharing of information was welcomed. However, mutual monitoring was seen as an invasion of horizontal (peer to peer) privacy. We conclude that the research agenda, which asks whether local commons based governance of electricity systems could provide social and environmental benefits, is worth pursuing further. This needs a shift in regulatory barriers and 'governance-system neutral' innovation funding.","[Melville, Emilia; Way, Celia; Hampshire, Phil] BuroHappold Engn, 230 Lower Bristol Rd, Bath BA2 3DQ, Avon, England; [Melville, Emilia; Christie, Ian; Burningham, Kate] Univ Surrey, Ctr Environm Strategy, Fac Engn & Phys Sci, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England; [Way, Celia] Univ Leeds, Inst Publ Hlth & Environm Engn, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Surrey; University of Leeds,"Melville, E (通讯作者)，BuroHappold Engn, 230 Lower Bristol Rd, Bath BA2 3DQ, Avon, England.",emilia.melville@burohappold.com; i.christie@surrey.ac.uk; k.burningham@surrey.ac.uk; phil.hampshire@burohappold.com,,"Burningham, Kate/0000-0001-9408-6180; Christie, Ian/0000-0003-0475-2405; Melville, Emilia/0000-0003-3973-3570",EPSRC; BuroHappold Engineering through the University of Surrey CES EngD programme; Low Carbon Networks Fund; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [1770359] Funding Source: researchfish,EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); BuroHappold Engineering through the University of Surrey CES EngD programme; Low Carbon Networks Fund; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This research was funded by EPSRC and BuroHappold Engineering through the University of Surrey CES EngD programme.

However, due to the impressions of high pollution and high emission in traditional coal-fired power plants, such projects are often opposed by local residents, which hinder the promotion of this technology. This manuscript aims to investigate public attitudes toward these projects and to analyze the influencing mechanisms of the factors of public support. The conceptual model was built with sense of place, trust and environmental attitude as the independent variables, benefit and cost perceptions as the mediating variables and public support as the dependent variable. The model was tested and modified by structural equation modelling. The results revealed that sense of place had a slight indirect impact (-0.043) on public support through benefit perception, whereas trust had a direct impact (0.332) on public support and indirect impacts (0.298) through benefit and cost perceptions. Environmental attitude had indirect impacts on public support through benefit perception (0.180) and cost perception (-0.115).

Both owners and tenants (50-70%) support government policy on energy performance improvements to existing homes. Nevertheless, people also have strong feelings of autonomy regarding their homes. Our results underline the importance of well-informed and competent decision-makers. Introducing the use of Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) into the tax system for energy and residential buildings might therefore be an effective way to increase the interest of owners in the EPC, improve the use and effect of this informative instrument, and make the first step towards bridging the tension between autonomy and more stringent instruments.","[van Middelkoop, Manon; Vringer, Kees; Visser, Hans] PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, POB 30314, NL-2500 GH The Hague, Netherlands",,"van Middelkoop, M (通讯作者)，PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, POB 30314, NL-2500 GH The Hague, Netherlands.",Manon.vanMiddelkoop@pbl.nl; Kees.Vringer@pbl.nl; Hans.Visser@pbl.nl,,"Vringer, Kees/0000-0003-4575-1775",,,,,37,16,16,1,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUN,2017,105.0,,,,,,269,282,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.02.050,0.0,,,14,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ET8EY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000400532900027,0

These remaining emissions would increase by 45 Gt if the average lifetime of China's coal-fired power generators were prolonged to be 45 years. Furthermore, the remaining emissions are very different among various provinces owing to local developments and policy disparities. China's CO2 emission mitigation objectives might be greatly restricted by the existing and planned power plants, which have important policy implications for other rapidly developing countries.","[Jiang, Suqin; Chen, Zun; Shan, Li; Wang, Haikun] Nanjing Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Pollut Control & Resource Reuse, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chen, Zun] Imperial Coll London, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Chen, Xinyu] Harvard Univ, John A Paulson Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Nanjing University; Imperial College London; Harvard University,"Wang, HK (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Pollut Control & Resource Reuse, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",wanghk@nju.edu.cn,"chen, xinyu/HNR-2708-2023; Wang, Haikun/A-3590-2011","Wang, Haikun/0000-0002-2565-5543",Key Research and Development Programs for Global Change and Adaptation of China [2016YFA0600204],Key Research and Development Programs for Global Change and Adaptation of China,This study was supported by Key Research and Development Programs for Global Change and Adaptation of China (2016YFA0600204).

This research is involved with development of a sustainable energy system model and a new method for sustainability assessment. This model represents the flow of energy from primary resources through processing, conversion, and end-use technologies in an optimization framework where the useful energy demand in various social and economic sectors is met. The impact of energy supply and consumption chain on the environment at each level of energy system is also embedded in the model structure. A multi-criteria analysis of changes is then applied and sustainable development indices of the whole system are concluded. Finally, effects of the energy subsidy policy and high economic growth rate on sustainability of the energy system in three scenarios are analyzed. Results demonstrate that energy subsidy decelerates the improvement rate of the total sustainability index. Also, when a high economic growth is accompanied with the energy subsidy this index reduces considerably. Results show that how penetration of renewable energy potentials changes the sustainability situation of energy systems.","[Sahabmanesh, Aref; Saboohi, Yadollah] Sharif Univ Technol, SERI, Tehran, Iran",Sharif University of Technology,"Sahabmanesh, A (通讯作者)，Sharif Univ Technol, SERI, Tehran, Iran.",asahabmanesh@yahoo.com,,"Saboohi, Yadollah/0000-0002-4608-7469",,,,,30,18,18,1,33,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2017,104.0,,,,,,66,79,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.01.039,0.0,,,14,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP7HS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397549500008,0

Several large nuclear reactors are currently under construction in the United States, representing the first new construction in over 30 years. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) have been in design for many years and offer potential technical and economic advantages compared with traditionally larger reactors. Current SMR capital and operational expenses have a wide range of uncertainty. This work evaluates the potential for SMRS in the US, develops a robust techno-economic assessment of SMRs, and leverages the model to evaluate US regulatory fees structures. Modeling includes capital expenses of a factory facility and capital and operational expenses with multiple scenarios explored through a component level capital cost model. Policy regarding the licensing and regulation of SMRs is under development with proposed annual US regulatory fees evaluated through the developed techno-economic model. Results show regulatory fees are a potential barrier to the economic viability of SMRs with an alternate fee structure proposed and evaluated. The proposed fee structure is based on the re-distribution of fees for all nuclear reactors under a single structure based on reactor thermal power rating.","[Vegel, Benjamin] Utah State Univ, Mech & Aerosp Engn, 4130 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84321 USA; [Quinn, Jason C.] Colorado State Univ, Mech Engn, 1374 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Colorado State University,"Quinn, JC (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Mech Engn, 1374 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",Jason.Quinn@colostate.edu,,,Nuclear Regulatory Commission [NRC-HQ-13-G-38-0010]; Idaho National Laboratory,Nuclear Regulatory Commission; Idaho National Laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),This work was supported by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (Grant # NRC-HQ-13-G-38-0010).

This research analyses the factors behind the repair condition of the water supply networks in Spanish municipalities, as rated by local managers of the water utilities. The data used in this study covers 2257 municipalities with between 1000 to 50,000 inhabitants. We compare the modelling with univariate regression techniques of a fractional dependent variable that summarizes the network quality ratings into a single number and the use of a fractional multinomial logit to model the untransformed proportions of the network rated as in poor, moderate, and good condition. Factors both within and beyond the decision-makers' control appear to explain the condition of the networks. The main policy recommendation is a set of enforced regulations that promote the consistent and effective improvement of the condition of networks in Spanish municipalities, regardless of factors such as the political leanings of the local government or the type of ownership of the water supply utility.","[Martinez-Espineira, Roberto] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Econ, St John, NF A1A 5S7, Canada; [Garcia-Rubio, Miguel A.; Gonzalez-Gomez, Francisco] Univ Granada, Fac Econ & Business Sci, Dept Appl Econ, Inst Water Res, Cartuja Campus, E-18071 Granada, Spain",Memorial University Newfoundland; University of Granada,"González-Gómez, F (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Fac Econ & Business Sci, Dept Appl Econ, Inst Water Res, Cartuja Campus, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",rmartinezesp@mun.ca; magrubio@ugr.es; fcojose@ugr.es,"González-Gómez, Francisco/F-3868-2010; García-Rubio, Miguel A./A-5873-2015; Martinez-Espineira, Roberto/A-5804-2008","González-Gómez, Francisco/0000-0002-9800-4944;","Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness of Spain [ECO2012-32189]; Government of Andalusia [P11-SEJ-7039, P11-SEJ-7294]",Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness of Spain; Government of Andalusia,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the following Spanish institutions: the Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness of Spain (Project ECO2012-32189) and the Consejeria de Economia, Innovacion, Ciencia y Empleo from the Government of Andalusia (P11-SEJ-7039 and P11-SEJ-7294).

Government policies supporting clean energy technology development and the development of markets for clean energy create opportunities for CETE. However, the extent to which such opportunities lead to the emergence of new clean energy businesses depends on a favorable external context promoting CETE. This study employs a novel dataset combining indicators of the policy and social context of CETE with information on clean energy technology startup firms in the USA to provide empirical evidence that technological and market conditions supporting clean energy induce more extensive CETE under contexts where local attention to clean energy issues and successful firms commercializing clean energy technologies are more prominent. By establishing that CETE is contingent upon a supportive local environment as well as technology and market opportunities, the study holds relevance for policy makers and clean energy technology firms.","[Malen, Joel] Hitosubashi Univ, Inst Innovat Res, 2-1 Naka, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868603, Japan; [Marcus, Alfred A.] Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Dept Strateg Management & Entrepreneurship, 3-406 CarlSMgmt,321 19th Ave South, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Malen, J (通讯作者)，Hitosubashi Univ, Inst Innovat Res, 2-1 Naka, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868603, Japan.",malen@iir.hit-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,65,47,48,13,116,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2017,102.0,,,,,,7,15,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.11.045,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP4NM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397357200002,0

So the effectiveness of such subsidies has been of much concern to scholars. This research focused on whether, or not, subsidy policies have guided people's intentions and behaviours. We investigated 436 urban residents from 22 provinces in China, covering the seven major geographic regions, and made an empirical analysis of the factors influencing Chinese urban residents' purchasing intentions towards energy-efficient appliances based on the structural equation model. On theoretical aspect, we developed the theory of planned behaviour. Our results show that the variable POLICY is insignificant which indicates that policy environment and media propaganda in China do not have significant effect on Chinese residents' willingness to pay for energy-efficient appliances. While, the residents' environmental awareness, past purchasing experiences, social relationships, age, and level of education all exert a significant influence on Chinese residents' purchasing intentions. Finally, based on the above research results, the corresponding policy suggestions which mainly focus on the time of subsidy, the object of subsidy and the method of subsidy are offered for policy makers.","[Wang, Zhaohua; Wang, Xiaomeng; Guo, Dongxue] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhaohua; Wang, Xiaomeng] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhaohua; Wang, Xiaomeng] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Elect Vehicles Beijing, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Institute of Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology,"Wang, ZH (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",wangzhaohua@bit.edu.cn,"Wang, Zhaohua/AAP-5489-2021; Wang, Zhaohua/JJE-6996-2023",,"Program the National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFA0602504]; National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars [71625003]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71173017, 71573016, 71521002]",Program the National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study is supported by the Program the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Reference no. 2016YFA0602504), National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars (Reference no. 71625003), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Reference no. 71173017, 71573016 and 71521002).

Solar photovoltaics (PV) are a case in point for an industry that experienced several shifts in its spatial organization over a short period of time. A lively debate has recently emerged on whether the spatial dynamics in new cleantech sectors are in line with existing industry lifecycle models or whether globalization created new lifecycle patterns that are not fully explained in the literature. This paper addresses this question based on an extensive analysis of quantitative data in the solar PV sector. Comprehensive global databases containing 86,000 patents as well as manufacturing and sales records are used to analyze geographic shifts in the PV sector's innovation, manufacturing and market deployment activities between 1990 and 2012. The analysis reveals spatial lifecycle patterns with lower-than-expected first mover advantages in manufacturing and market activities and an earlier entry of firms from emerging economies in manufacturing and knowledge creation. We discuss implications of these findings for the competitive positions of companies in developed and emerging economies, derive new stylized hypotheses for industry lifecycle theories, and sketch policy approaches that are reflexive of global interdependencies in emerging cleantech industries.","[Binz, Christian] Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Lund, Sweden; [Tang, Tian] Florida State Univ, Askew Sch Publ Adm & Policy, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Huenteler, Joern] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Lund University; State University System of Florida; Florida State University; The World Bank,"Binz, C (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Lund, Sweden.",christian.binz@circle.lu.se,,"Tang, Tian/0000-0003-3588-6828; Binz, Christian/0000-0002-6878-2606","Sustainability Science Program at Harvard Kennedy School; Swiss National Science Foundation (Early Postdoc.

With small hydropower (SHP) expanding as part of renewable energy and climate mitigation strategies, this review assesses its impacts and identifies escalating policy issues. To provide a comprehensive literature review of small hydropower, we evaluated over 3600 articles and policy documents. This review identified four major concerns: (1) confusion in small hydropower definitions is convoluting scholarship and policy-making; (2) there is a lack of knowledge and acknowledgement of small hydropower's social, environmental, and cumulative impacts; (3) small hydropower's promotion as a climate mitigation strategy can negatively affect local communities, posing contradictions for climate change policy; and (4) institutional analysis is needed to facilitate renewable energy integration with existing environmental laws to ensure sustainable energy development. For readers interested in small hydropower, we clarify areas of confusion in definition and explain the corresponding impacts for distinct system designs. For a broader readership, we situate small hydropower implementation within international trends of renewable energy development the contradictory impacts of climate change policy, emerging dynamics in energy finance, and reliance on market mechanisms.

The aims of the case study research were first to explore the role of public and stakeholder engagement in the processes of innovation in the geothermal energy sector. Second, to design, implement and consolidate a methodological framework for comparative analysis of case studies on citizens' engagement, thus bringing a social scientific perspective into geothermal energy research. The results show general support for renewable energy but knowledge and understanding of the potential of geothermal is remarkably low. Lack of trust in politics and unsure public communication emerged as prominent themes where the common good and community developments are sharply contrasted with corporate and private interests. As geothermal energy is included and encouraged under the European Strategic Energy Plan and in the Paris agreement on halting climate change, the results can make significant input into future policy making, by providing concrete guidelines on citizens' engagement in processes of culturally sustainable innovation.","[Pellizzone, Anna; Muttoni, Giovanni] Univ Milan, Dipartimento Sci Terra Ardito Desio, Via Luigi Mangiagalli 34, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Allansdottir, Agnes] Fdn Toscana Life Sci, Via Fiorentina,1, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Pellizzone, Anna; De Franco, Roberto] CNR, Ist Dinam Proc Ambientali, Via Mario Bianco 9, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Manzella, Adele] CNR, Ist Geosci & Georisorse, Via Moruzzi 1, I-56124 Pisa, Italy",University of Milan; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Geoscienze e Georisorse (IGG-CNR),"Pellizzone, A (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Dipartimento Sci Terra Ardito Desio, Via Luigi Mangiagalli 34, I-20133 Milan, Italy.;Pellizzone, A (通讯作者)，CNR, Ist Dinam Proc Ambientali, Via Mario Bianco 9, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",pellizzone.anna@gmail.com,"Manzella, Adele/AAC-2617-2021; de Franco, Roberto/B-5413-2013","Manzella, Adele/0000-0002-2367-0969; de Franco, Roberto/0000-0002-7037-2833; Pellizzone, Anna/0000-0001-8737-917X; Allansdottir, Agnes/0000-0003-0961-2380; Muttoni, Giovanni/0000-0001-7908-1664",Italian government,Italian government,"The AtlanteGeotermico (Geothermal Atlas) is a research project aimed at assessing conventional and unconventional geothermal resources for power production in southern Italy.

In this study, coal enterprise and local government are treated as game participants, and a three-stage dynamic game model has been developed to depict the boosting effect of the game behavior of coal enterprise's and local government's capacity investments in different markets of supply and demand. The results are shown in the following: (1) local government has been the behind-the-scenes operator of over-investment and redundant construction, and its excessive interventions in coal industry investment have been the primary cause of overcapacity formation; (2) when the market is in short supply, coal enterprise's optimal behavior is to continuously increase the rate of investment growth until it reaches the threshold to obtain the maximum excess profits, ultimately leading to overinvestment in the industry; and (3) the key factors affecting the game abilities of coal enterprise and local government are the market's self-regulation and the central government's supervision intensity. Although the Chinese government, a highly vertically oriented bureaucratic structure, is implementing a mandatory de-capacity policy to alleviate the intensity of excessive coal capacity, it is not a long-term regularization on the supply-side reform.","[Zhang, Yanfang; Zhang, Ming; Liu, Yue; Nie, Rui] China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Management, Xuzhou 221116, Peoples R China",China University of Mining & Technology,"Nie, R (通讯作者)，China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Management, Xuzhou 221116, Peoples R China.",nieruicumt@l63.com,"Zhang, Ming/V-5262-2019; Shi, Yaolin/JXN-8322-2024","Zhang, Ming/0000-0003-3023-1419;","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71273259, 71473250]; Jiangsu Province Graduate Research & Innovation Project [KYLX16_0512]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2015M580484, 2016T90517]; Qing Lan Project of Jiangsu Province",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Jiangsu Province Graduate Research & Innovation Project; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Qing Lan Project of Jiangsu Province,This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 71273259 and No. 71473250; Jiangsu Province Graduate Research & Innovation Project under Grant No. KYLX16_0512; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation under Grant No. 2015M580484 and No. 2016T90517; Qing Lan Project of Jiangsu Province.,,57,89,93,4,157,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2017,101.0,,,,,,162,169,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.11.036,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EI8PD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000392768800015,0

Second, it applies the Hidalgo-Hausmann (HH) methodology to analyze knowledge composition by looking at patent data of 214 regions, located in 27 state members of the European Union during the years 1994-2008. Third, it econometrically assesses the role of knowledge base composition in a knowledge-generation function. The results of the empirical analysis confirm that the characterization of the regional knowledge base through the HH indicators provides interesting information to understanding its composition and to qualify it as a provider of the Jacobs knowledge externalities that account for the dynamics of regional innovative performance.","[Antonelli, Cristiano] Univ Torino, Coll Carlo Alberto, BRICK Bur Res Complex Knowledge Innovat, Dipartimento Econ & Stat, Turin, Italy; [Crespi, Francesco; Mongeau Ospina, Christian A.] Univ Roma Tre, Dipartimento Econ, Rome, Italy; [Crespi, Francesco; Mongeau Ospina, Christian A.; Scellato, Giuseppe] Coll Carlo Alberto, BRICK Bur Res Complex Knowledge Innovat, Turin, Italy; [Mongeau Ospina, Christian A.] Univ Gabriele DAnnunzio Chieti Pescara, Dept Econ, Chieti, Italy; [Scellato, Giuseppe] Politecn Torino, Dipartimento Ingn Gest & Prod, Turin, Italy",University of Turin; Collegio Carlo Alberto; Roma Tre University; Collegio Carlo Alberto; G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara; Polytechnic University of Turin,"Antonelli, C (通讯作者)，Univ Torino, Coll Carlo Alberto, BRICK Bur Res Complex Knowledge Innovat, Dipartimento Econ & Stat, Turin, Italy.",cristiano.antonelli@unito.it; francesco.crespi@uniroma3.it; christian@mongeau.net; giuseppe.scellato@polito.it,"ANTONELLI, CRISTIANO/HTN-7364-2023; Mongeau Ospina, Christian Alexander/N-1556-2014","Mongeau Ospina, Christian Alexander/0000-0002-4047-3924; Scellato, Giuseppe/0000-0003-0927-9346; Antonelli, Cristiano/0000-0002-5652-0510; Crespi, Francesco/0000-0001-7657-7824",European Union [266959],European Union(European Union (EU)),"This paper is a contribution from the research project 'Policy Incentives for the Creation of Knowledge: Methods and Evidence' (PICK-ME), funded by the European Union DG Research [grant number 266959] within the context of the Cooperation Program/Theme 8/Socio-economic Sciences and Humanities (SSH).",,51,25,27,2,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Regional Studies. This paper introduces a novel measure of regional centrality in the context of research and development (R&D) networks. It first demonstrates some substantial problems of social network analysis (SNA)-based centrality measures to cope with regional R&D networks in a meaningful way. It then proposes a new measurement approach of regional network centrality based on the concept of interregional bridging paths (indirect connections at the regional level). The paper shows that the formal definition of the regional bridging centrality measure can be expressed in terms of three simple components: the participation intensity of a region in interregional R&D collaborations; its relative outward orientation in terms of all established links; and its diversification of R&D collaborations among partner regions. The measure and its behaviour with respect to other conventional centrality measures are illustrated by its application to the European co-patent network at the NUTS-2 level.,"[Berge, Laurent R.] Univ Luxembourg, CREA, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Berge, Laurent R.] Univ Bordeaux, GREThA, CNRS, UMR 5113, Bordeaux, France; [Wanzenboeck, Iris] Univ Utrecht, Innovat Studies Grp, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Wanzenboeck, Iris; Scherngell, Thomas] AIT Austrian Inst Technol, Ctr Innovat Syst & Policy, Vienna, Austria; [Scherngell, Thomas] Vienna Univ Econ & Business WU, Inst Econ Geog & GISci, Vienna, Austria",University of Luxembourg; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Bordeaux; Utrecht University; Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT); Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Bergé, LR (通讯作者)，Univ Luxembourg, CREA, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.;Bergé, LR (通讯作者)，Univ Bordeaux, GREThA, CNRS, UMR 5113, Bordeaux, France.",laurent.berge@uni.lu; i.wanzenbock@uu.nl; thomas.scherngell@ait.ac.at,"Wanzenböck, Iris/JEF-4087-2023; Scherngell, Thomas TS/C-6803-2009","Wanzenböck, Iris/0000-0002-1727-5567; Scherngell, Thomas/0000-0003-4592-4103; Berge, Laurent/0000-0003-2736-1917",French region of Aquitaine (Conseil Regional d'Aquitaine) [20101402006]; Anniversary Fund of the Osterreichiche Nationalbank (OenB) [16301]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P28936] Funding Source: Austrian Science Fund (FWF),French region of Aquitaine (Conseil Regional d'Aquitaine); Anniversary Fund of the Osterreichiche Nationalbank (OenB); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),Laurent Berge gratefully acknowledges the financial support of the French region of Aquitaine (Conseil Regional d'Aquitaine) for the research project REGNET [grant number #20101402006].

Often a ruthless approach without environmentally friendly production and production process led to depletion of natural resources and devastation of the natural environment. This is currently reflected on its overall situation and we see the great efforts of states and individual policies to mitigate the situation. The implementation of eco-innovation is subject to national regional policies of the individual states. Over all these we can see organizations, eco-innovation policies of larger clusters such as the EU, various intergovernmental agreements or treaties that govern individual state policies. Eco-innovation efficiency is an important indicator of the national eco-innovation effort and its determination is important in the comparison of states. It also serves as a tool for efforts in increasing eco-innovation and reducing the environmental impacts of the industry, which may be more or less the result of globalization. The measurement of eco-innovations is carried out by establishing different indicators of eco-innovation efficiency. The individual metrics then compare the results of individual countries. The contribution deals with different eco-efficiency measurement metrics and their impact on the following eco-innovation performance of other countries.

In the conditions of economic instability, the efficiency of the national economy decreases, that requires the search of quality tools for solving this problem. The authors prove that a state-private partnership can be considered as such instrument because it combines the advantages of state and market regulation and may provide a solution to the problem of improvement of the business environment. Additionally, the state-private partnership assumes an effective interaction of institutions of the state and business in various directions of their activity. In this case, the state must exercise the functions of not only the partner, but also the organizer, coordinator and the customer for such interaction. These conditions contribute to the creation of a sustainable mechanism of reaction to socioeconomic challenges of globalization. Thus, the creation of a quality business environment needs a combination of efforts of the following parties: the state, entrepreneurs, science and education. The using of the state-private partnership accelerates this process and makes it more planned, which is especially important in conditions of global instability.","[Fakhrutdinova, E., V; Kolesnikova, J.

Information and telecommunication technologies have always been a significant part of the transport systems in the age of globalisation. Being the most frequent mean for transporting people and goods, road transport has become the sectoral leader in deploying intelligent systems. Inland water transport is a newcomer in the use of intelligent transport systems. Unlike road transport, inland navigation does not use any centre to integrate traffic information from all important subjects. The River Information Services (RIS), currently in use on the Danube River, provides navigational, meteorological and traffic information to individual subjects operating in inland navigation, but this system does not integrate individual entities into one centre. The paper informs about the need for a single inland navigation centre based on an already existing information centre created for road transport. The main purpose of such an intelligent transport centre is to increase safety, increase the efficiency of transport by saving time for transport, also to improve the quality of the environment and to improve the productivity of the company's commercial activity","[Galierikova, Andrea; Sosedova, Jarmila] Univ Zilina, Dept Water Transport, Zilina, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Galieriková, A (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Dept Water Transport, Zilina, Slovakia.",andrea.galierikova@fpedas.uniza.sk; jarmila.sosedova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Galierikova, Andrea/O-4819-2015; Maternová, Andrea/AFQ-7891-2022; Maternová, Andrea/HLX-0025-2023",,,,,,17,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,465,471,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059200062,0

For the inbound logistics process, there are two types of receiving products. The first type is Goods Receive, which is to receive new products. The second type is Goods Return, which is to receive the returned products from customers. The received products will be sent to five different departments. Each department has a different amount of incoming products for each day. The inequality workload clearly affects the inefficiency of the inbound logistics process. This research is then conducted to reduce the lead time of the inbound logistics process. Discrete event simulation modeling using ARENA was utilized to allocate workers in the inbound process. The new worker allocation plan can reduce the average total inbound logistics process time for all product groups.

It involves a shift from the confrontation conflict approach to the cooperation model aimed at achieving common goals. Entities recognize that previously used strategies based on standard management tools, such as price, quality, distribution, product or location are no longer sufficient to create the competitive edge. Entrepreneurs realize that solitary and autonomous action is doomed to fail in the age of globalization, since it limits access to new technologies, financial resources, cheap and skilled labour force, as well as to knowledge and experience. It becomes necessary to search for new, distinctive features, resources, methods and activities that allow for the effective implementation of complex goals. To achieve it, entities must create various types of dynamic and multi-dimensional relations based on cooperation. It should be noted, that those inter-organizational relationships can serve as a source of services and tools, they can contribute to problem solving, winning new markets and deploying new technologies, as well as building a sustainable competitive advantage. On the basis of the above considerations, the analysis and assessment of cooperation strategies of Polish enterprises have been conducted.

Despite the existing romantic affirmation of the principle of nationality (narodnost') in philosophy, science and art, Venevitinov and Odoevsky assume that in theory, the development of the philosophical language should not be confined to the national language only. They are most interested in the universalist concepts of the philosophical language, which in the 1920s are represented by romantic natural philosophy and are connected to the concept of mathesis. Venevitinov-Odoevsky's identification of the natural philosophical sources of solving the problem of the philosophical language transforms the current perception of the Russian philosophical romanticism of the 1820s as consistent Schellingianism, since, in this case, it is a matter of the conscious recycling of the Okenian version of natural philosophy.","[Martseva, Anna V.] RUDN Univ, Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Dept Hist Philosophy, 6 Miklukho Maklaya St, Moscow 117198, Russia",Peoples Friendship University of Russia,"Martseva, AV (通讯作者)，RUDN Univ, Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Dept Hist Philosophy, 6 Miklukho Maklaya St, Moscow 117198, Russia.",martseva@mail.ru,"Martseva, Anna/A-7876-2017","Martseva, Anna/0000-0002-6461-8139",,,,,8,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-436-1,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2017,107.0,,,,,,350,351,,,,,,2,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BJ6OF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426885200090,0

A proposed model that highlights the benefits of family businesses for the whole of society was the result of our research.

Meanwhile, her deep-rooted traditional hierarchy ethics refrains the development of Pierre's rational ethical conscious and prohibits the construction of right ethics. Seductive and evil Isabel holds ethics of benefiting oneself at the expense of others' interests, which directly contributes to the change of ethical context, ethical identity of related characters in the novel, subsequently lead to ethical tragedy. Pure and noble-minded Lucy undergoes the growth in love and marriage ethics and ultimately becomes a model of female ethics.

However, in real economic environment labor market cannot exist without a system of regulations which constitute institutional order of this market. These are usually valid at a country level, however, some of them were established under standards introduced by international organizations such as ILO. They vary in complexity and differentiate economic systems. In the globalization era they became a subject to international analyses and comparisons. Additionally, they are regarded as a significant factor of business activity. Facing the contemporary economic practice the question arises what generally is understood under term the free market. This paper aims to present and explain the criteria to recognize the labor market as free, or, more precisely, as being little regulated. As a result, a set of features is be defined, which will enable to identify the minimum indispensable extent of regulations in the labor market, and, at the same time, the maximum level of economic freedom in the labor market. The empirical verification of this freedom proves the relativity of this term as the model of perfectly competitive market should be regarded as a purely theoretical reference point. Accordingly to the analysis performed one may distinguish the least regulated labor markets on a global scale at the country level.

The two sources of error are shown to be present in other performance indicators previously employed in the literature to characterize, so-called, truncation effects. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the magnitude of the estimation error exceeds that of the approximation error, but experimental results based upon a prototypical real business cycle model and a practical example indicate that the approximation error approaches its asymptotic position far more slowly than does the estimation error, their relative orders of magnitude notwithstanding. The experimental results suggest that with sample sizes and lag lengths like those commonly employed in practice models are likely to exhibit serious errors of both types when attempting to replicate the dynamics of the true underlying process and that inferences based on models can be very untrustworthy.","[Poskitt, D.

Nowadays we can find work anywhere in Europe or even across the globe in different international companies through the Internet. How do they look for the job on the online platforms? In 2012 92% of Gen Y were conducting job search online. 13% of members of Gen Y had their own professional website and half of them take the time to check their online reputation and clean it up.

Then, the level of globalization of the three countries is compared, based on the results of some chosen indices and rankings. Longer term trends and some unexpected results are observed, too.

A scaled questionnaire used in previous researches was applied as a tool for data collection in 381 companies operating business in Slovakia. The questionnaire was distributed online through Google documents system. Questionnaire reliability was verified by Cronbach's alpha and reached the level 0.799. To verify the existence of statistically significant differences between individual groups of respondents the Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test were used. We found that existence of HR department is the most important factor of the talent identification and recruitment process in global enterprises, followed by foreign capital, and size of the company.","[Savov, Radovan; Lancaric, Drahoslav; Kozakova, Jana] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Savov, R (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Nitra, Slovakia.",radovan.savov@uniag.sk; drahoslav.lancaric@uniag.sk; jana.kozakova@uniag.sk,"Kozáková, Jana/AAC-7916-2020","Kozáková, Jana/0000-0001-7913-9053","Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic [VEGA 1/0543/17]","Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic","This paper was created within the project VEGA Integrated talent management model and its impact on economic results of enterprises from The Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic.

The reliability of the platforms are comprehensively determined based on the deformation and energy of the jacket platform. The Young's Modulus; the yield strength; the strain hardening rate; the diameter and thickness of members; the water depth; the wave height and period; the wave velocities on the surface, middle, and base of the platform; the drag coefficient; the inertial coefficient; and the horizontal concentrated scaled loads are defined in the study as random variables. The sensitivity of the performance functions to the above-mentioned variables is determined, and the variables that most influence the performance of the platform are identified. Main conclusions are drawn as follows: the increasing mean and decreasing standard deviation of wall thickness in Type-1, Type-4, and Type-2 jacket members can effectively reduce the deformation and total strain energy of platform structures. For jacket structures in the plastic state, increasing the mean and decreasing the standard deviation of yield strength is a reasonable method for reducing deformation. Maximum deformation and strain energy are highly correlated whether the load level is high or low, and the correlation of these indicators with the variables considered gradually increases with the load level.","[Song, Z.

Through outsourcing, a company can access the state of the art in all of its business activities without having to master each one internally. Offshore outsourcing is the process of relocating non-core business activities to countries with lower labour costs but equal expertise. Offshore outsourcing is mainly used by companies with global operations. The outsourcing services are most often used in the area of information technology, law and accounting. The accounting activities are now increasingly the subject of outsourcing. The main reason is that accounting is an activity mandatory for each business entity, but it is rarely related to the core business activities performed by the business entity. Offshore outsourcing of various accounting activities is becoming an increasingly attractive option for many companies as a means of gaining access to scarce skills, cutting costs and obtaining competitiveness. The paper's aim is to describe the process of offshore accounting outsourcing with emphasis on its benefits and risks which have been studied in a particular company.","[Varyova, Ivana; Kosovska, Iveta] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Accountancy, Trieda A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Váryová, I (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Accountancy, Trieda A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",ivana.varyova@uniag.sk; iveta.kosovska@uniag.sk,,,science project VEGA [1/0935/17],science project VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This paper is an output of the science project VEGA No. 1/0935/17 with the title Modelling and prognosis of agro food markets in Slovakia and in the European Union.,,18,0,0,1,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2825,2832,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059205028,0

It introduces the concept of 'scalar logics of regionalism' to characterize the multiple regionalism projects at work throughout the state-economy nexus, and develops a comparative case study of regionalism initiatives in Arizona, Florida and Ohio to demonstrate the importance of interactions and conflict between different scalar logics in determining the multi-scalar outcomes of local growth politics.","[Wachsmuth, David] McGill Univ, Sch Urban Planning, Montreal, PQ, Canada",McGill University,"Wachsmuth, D (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Sch Urban Planning, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",david.wachsmuth@mcgill.ca,,"Wachsmuth, David/0000-0001-5689-9527",Horowitz Foundation for Social Policy research grant; Killam Trusts; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council,Horowitz Foundation for Social Policy research grant; Killam Trusts; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This work was supported by a Horowitz Foundation for Social Policy research grant and by postdoctoral fellowships from the Killam Trusts and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council.,,35,37,43,6,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

However, in the real energy world hydrogen has not yet delivered. The major reason is that it has still to become economically feasible. With increasing electricity generation from variable renewables and its temporarily cheap surplus production, new prospects for hydrogen are on the horizon especially due to the rising need for a solution to the problem of the long-term storage of excess electricity. The core objective of this paper is to analyze the economic prospects of hydrogen use in the energy system keeping in mind two challenges: (i) integration of variable renewables in power systems, and (ii) substitution of fossil fuels in the transport sector. The future economics of hydrogen in passenger car transport is investigated regarding hydrogen production costs and possible learning effects of the fuel cell vehicles. The major conclusion is that the future perspective of hydrogen use depends on the policy framework, the full exploitation of economies-of-scale and technological learning for electrolysis as well as possible full-load hours per year. However, cost reduction of fuel cells for mobility through technological learning is essential for the economic competitiveness of hydrogen use in transport.","[Ajanovic, Amela; Haas, Reinhard] Vienna Univ Technol, Energy Econ Grp, Vienna, Austria",Technische Universitat Wien,"Ajanovic, A (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Technol, Energy Econ Grp, Vienna, Austria.",ajanovic@eeg.tuwien.ac.at; haas@eeg.tuwien.ac.at,,"Ajanovic, Amela/0000-0001-6840-806X; Haas, Reinhard/0000-0001-9361-3452",,,,,37,96,101,3,71,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2018,123.0,,,,,,280,288,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.063,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HE6FW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000453499700028,0

Roughly 70% of the population has no access to electricity, and 90% of those without electricity live in rural areas. The vast majority of its power is imported from neighboring countries, and is often subject to outages. Since 2002, more than $4 billion has been spent on Afghanistan's electrification in cooperation with international funders, yet this has not increased electrification to the level anticipated, particularly in rural areas. This study uses the Institutional Analysis and Development framework to examine the policy and institutional barriers to expanding the power grid. Looking at major laws, policies and actors that comprise the energy sector, and the patterns of interaction among them, this study finds that ambiguity, overlaps and contradiction in the scope of work of five government ministries exacerbates the current challenges. Moreover, the lack of a coordinated development agenda among the government of Afghanistan and international partners has led to fragmented planning and implementation of projects, inadequate prioritization of investments, and much of the work being done by consultants or short-term contractors. The result has been low rates of electrification, diminished institutional capacity and minimal private sector involvement in the energy sector.","[Amin, Mohsin; Bernell, David] Oregon State Univ, Sch Publ Policy, 300 Bexell Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Amin, Mohsin] State Corps Inc, Karte Char, Kabul, Afghanistan",Oregon State University,"Bernell, D (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Sch Publ Policy, 300 Bexell Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",mohsinamin.ice@gmail.com; david.bernell@oregonstate.edu,,,,,,,39,17,17,1,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2018,123.0,,,,,,72,82,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.010,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HE6FW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000453499700008,0

However, some stakeholders have raised concerns about the assumptions underlying the benefits assessments in AMI business cases. Such concerns are especially acute for certain subpopulations of residential customers. Low income, elderly and chronically ill (i.e., vulnerable) customers are believed to have less load that can be shifted or reduced to capture bill savings, lack the know-how or wherewithal with which to curtail usage, likely have more limited financial resources which may compel them to avoid high priced periods by reducing electricity for essential usage potentially causing them physical harm, and more generally may be more adversely affected by higher bills, which might possibly result from certain forms of time-based rates. There is very limited existing literature that addresses these questions specifically with regard to vulnerable subpopulations. This paper, based on a larger report, extends the existing empirical literature on the experiences of low-income customers exposed to critical peak pricing, and provides the first glimpses into the experiences of the elderly and those who reported being chronically ill.","[Cappers, Peter; Spurlock, C.

First and foremost, we identify a key difference in industry outlooks and corresponding strategic mindsets. Specifically, the two outlooks industry optimism and industry pessimism seem to correspond to specific strategic mindsets. Whereas industry optimists (1) stressed diversification, (2) were demand-driven in their decisions about R&D, and generally (3) had a learning orientation to innovations, industry pessimists emphasized the need for (1) premium pricing, (2) government intervention, and (3) economies of scale as key drivers of industry development and growth. We also found geographic differences in industry outlooks among biofuel entrepreneurs and other stakeholders in Australia, Germany, and the USA.

From 2013 until 2015, however, this trend reversed and coal use declined from 2810 million metric tons of coal equivalent (Mtce) to 2752 Mtce, leading to a levelling off of China's overall CO2 emissions. Some analysts have declared that China's coal consumption may have peaked. Preliminary data, however, indicate that coal consumption increased in 2017. To understand future near-term trends in China's coal consumption, we analyze a number of important drivers of coal use and find projected increases in electricity demand that cannot be met by other fossil-fuel or non-fossil-fuel electricity sources, as well as projected increases in coal use in light manufacturing, other non-industrial sectors, and for transformation. We find that these projected increases will lead to near-term growth in China's coal use to levels of approximately 2900 Mtce to 3050 Mtce in 2020, with associated increases in energy-related CO2 emissions.","[Lin, Jiang; Fridley, David; Lu, Hongyou; Price, Lynn; Zhou, Nan] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, China Energy Grp, Energy Anal & Environm Impacts Div, Energy Technol Area, 1 Cyclotron Rd,Mailstop 90R2121, Berkeley, CA 94702 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,"Lin, J (通讯作者)，Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, China Energy Grp, Energy Anal & Environm Impacts Div, Energy Technol Area, 1 Cyclotron Rd,Mailstop 90R2121, Berkeley, CA 94702 USA.",j_lin@lbl.gov,"Lu, Hongyou/HGT-8518-2022","Lu, Hongyou/0000-0003-1399-1977",Hewlett Foundation through the Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231],Hewlett Foundation through the Department of Energy,This work was supported by the Hewlett Foundation through the Department of Energy under contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231.,,20,84,91,10,78,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2018,123.0,,,,,,208,214,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.058,0.0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HE6FW,,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000453499700021,0

The results show that closeness to urban centres is not necessarily beneficial for firm start-ups. On the contrary, regions further away from urban centres of any size experience more firm start-ups. One explanation of this result is that regions experience spatial protection from urban competition. However, regions located further away from larger-sized urban centres experience less firm start-ups due to such remoteness. One explanation of this finding is that remote regions cannot access the agglomeration benefits that larger cities offer. This supports the view that rural regions draw on urban resources but only on those from larger agglomerations.","[Lavesson, Niclas] Lund Univ, CIRCLE, POB 117, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Lavesson, Niclas] Lund Univ, Dept Human & Econ Geog, Lund, Sweden",Lund University; Lund University,"Lavesson, N (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, CIRCLE, POB 117, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.;Lavesson, N (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Human & Econ Geog, Lund, Sweden.",niclas.lavesson@circle.lu.se,,"Lavesson, Niclas/0000-0001-8900-3731",,,,,80,8,9,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

Coal historically the primary power source for the U.S. economy has declined markedly in both production and consumption. Renewables like wind and solar have become much more economically viable in recent years. However, perhaps the most dramatic change has been the drastic increase in oil and gas production since the mid-2000s, due largely to the convergence of unconventional technologies like hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling. The changing energy system presents both opportunities and challenges for local governments, especially those in rural areas that face unique fiscal struggles. In this paper, we present results of a survey of local policy actors in the Mountain West states of Colorado and Utah. Policy actors assessed the fiscal and public service impacts of different types of energy development and we tie these survey responses to spatial energy development data. Results imply that policy actors have nuanced views of all types of energy, though fossil fuels (especially coal) are generally seen as more fiscally beneficial than renewables. Generally, the spatial proximity of a type of energy development has only a weak relationship with perceived fiscal and public service costs and benefits.","[Mayer, Adam] Colorado State Univ, Dept Human Dimens Nat Resources, 1480 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Colorado State University,"Mayer, A (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Dept Human Dimens Nat Resources, 1480 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",adam.mayer@colostate.edu,,,,,,,44,13,14,1,18,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2018,122.0,,,,,,186,193,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.07.043,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GX2UX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447576700018,0

However, the distinction between the dimensions of risk perception and the differentiated effects of such dimensions has been less explored. The present study demonstrates that two distinct dimensions of risk perception from nuclear plants-perceived intrinsic risk and extrinsic risk-reveal contrasting patterns of influence on the acceptance of nuclear power. Our results, using a sample from South Korea, show that the relative effect of perceived extrinsic risk from nuclear plants on the acceptance of nuclear power (compared to that of intrinsic risk) is stronger at higher levels of such acceptance than at lower levels. This finding provides implications for public policy to encourage the acceptance of nuclear power. Such policy should selectively choose between the two approaches-reducing the public's perceived level of intrinsic risk and that of extrinsic risk-depending on whether the policy's aims is to soften opposing voices or to promote positive voices for nuclear power.","[Roh, Seungkook] KAERI, Policy Res Div, 989-111 Daedeok Daero, Daejeon 34057, South Korea; [Lee, Jin Won] Jimei Univ, Sch Business Adm, Mkt Dept, 185 Yinjiang Rd, Xiamen 361021, Peoples R China",Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI); Jimei University,"Lee, JW (通讯作者)，Jimei Univ, Sch Business Adm, Mkt Dept, 185 Yinjiang Rd, Xiamen 361021, Peoples R China.",skroh@kaeri.re.kr; nevermean@empas.com,"Lee, Jin Won/Q-7749-2019; roh, seungkook/IUO-8926-2023","Lee, Jin Won/0000-0001-5658-8964;",,,,,46,10,10,2,34,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2018,122.0,,,,,,727,735,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.018,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GX2UX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447576700068,0

A conceptual framework that modifies the impure altruism model with heterogeneous preferences and further incorporates the impure public good model is presented to study informal recycling behaviors. Based on survey data collected from 755 households in Hanoi, Vietnam, we find that the majority of sample households recycle all the recyclable materials they consume even though such recycling is not obligatory. Half the recycling households sell their recyclables to informal junk buyers, whereas the other half provide recyclables without monetary compensation. Our finding of voluntary recycling implies that a certain proportion of households have a positive marginal willingness to pay for an increase in the environmental public good. The results of the regression analyses show that recycling behavior is associated with altruism, as measured by a modified version of the self-report altruism scale. Among high-income households, recycling behavior is associated with inequality aversion, as elicited from a hypothetical game. These findings suggest that social preferences are important determinants of the private provision of public goods through the informal sector in a developing country. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Many countries are attempting to promote the consumer adoption of BEVs in this sense by providing subsidies and expanding their related infrastructure. The expected environmental effect of BEVs is an important factor in increasing the consumer adoption of BEVs, and the environmental impact of BEVs is directly related to the electricity generation mix. In this study, we analyze how the consumer adoption behavior of BEVs and their environmental impact can be changed by improving the environmental performance of BEVs based on the electricity generation mix. To this end, we estimate consumer preferences in vehicles by using a discrete choice experiment survey and a mixed logit model. Then, on the basis of the estimation results, we simulate changes in consumers' vehicle adoption behavior according to various electricity generation mixes and measure the environmental impact of these changes. Analysis results show changing the electricity generation mix to renewable-oriented mix can promote BEV's market share up to 10% and reduce GHG emissions up to 5% by 2026.","[Choi, Hyunhong] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Engn, Technol Management Econ & Policy Program, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Shin, Jungwoo] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Ind & Management Syst Engn, 1732 Deogyeong Daero, Yongin 17104, Gyeonggi, South Korea; [Woo, JongRoul] MIT, Inst Data Syst & Soc, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Seoul National University (SNU); Kyung Hee University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Woo, J (通讯作者)，MIT, Inst Data Syst & Soc, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",jroul86@mit.edu,"WOO, JONGROUL/AAD-5341-2021; Choi, Hyunhong/AAI-9763-2020; Choi, Hyunhong/V-7165-2019","WOO, JONGROUL/0000-0002-3576-5180; Choi, Hyunhong/0000-0003-2896-9051; Shin, Jungwoo/0000-0002-7772-8636",National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2015S1A3A2046684]; Korea Ministry of Environment as Climate Change Correspondence RD Program [2014001300001],"National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government); Korea Ministry of Environment as Climate Change Correspondence RD Program(Ministry of Environment (ME), Republic of Korea)","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2015S1A3A2046684), the Korea Ministry of Environment as Climate Change Correspondence R&D Program (2014001300001).",,82,99,104,3,69,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2018,121.0,,,,,,13,24,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.06.013,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV3HA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445983800003,0

While solar generation comes in many forms, 'shared solar', or a community-based system with an array size intermediate between a large-field and an individual residential system, offers many advantages that utility-scale projects are not able to deliver. The aim of this paper is to examine the development of shared solar initiatives in the recent history of US energy policy in order to reveal lessons that could be applied to future renewable energy generation in other developed nations including the UK and other European countries. Specifically the paper offers original appraisal of the 'solar gardens' scheme being trialled in Minnesota, drawing on findings from a survey with over 650 respondents representing a range of local renewable energy organizations and their customers. We examine the salience and influence of four key factors, namely: (i) perceived individual benefits; (ii) sources and trustworthiness of information; (iii) location; and (iv) project financing.

In this study, we propose a multi-objective decision approach, incorporating the principles of fairness, efficiency, and feasibility, to allocate the CHAs to emitters from the industry perspective. Taking Guangdong, China as an example, we employ the proposed approach for allocating the CHAs to six major industries of petrochemical, chemical, cement, steel, nonferrous metals, and electricity power by 2030. The empirical results show that there are significant conflicts between principles. The proposed approach can not only effectively eliminate the defects of single-object models to make the allocation results more reasonable and acceptable, but also achieve optimal allocation options under various decision preferences. The power industry has the highest CHA and petrochemical industry has the lowest one, and petrochemical, chemical, and steel industries have the greatest potential to reduce carbon intensity. Single-factor sensitivity analysis shows that the CHA/10(4) Yuan added value (TY) of the industry with lower emissions is more sensitive to the changes of physical capital stock but received fewer impacts from the changes of emissions cap for six industries.","[Zhu, Bangzhu; Jiang, Mingxing] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Business Sch, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [He, Kaijian] Hunan Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Xiangton 411201, Peoples R China; [Chevallier, Julien] IPAG Business Sch, IPAG Lab, 184 Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France; [Chevallier, Julien] Univ Paris 08, LED, 2 Ave Liberte, F-93526 St Denis, France; [Xie, Rui] Hunan Univ, Coll Econ & Trade, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Hunan University of Science & Technology; IPAG Business School; Universite Paris-VIII; Hunan University,"Zhu, BZ; Jiang, MX (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Business Sch, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Chevallier, J (通讯作者)，IPAG Business Sch, IPAG Lab, 184 Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France.",wpzbz@126.com; 18588847515@163.com; julien.chevallier@ipag.fr,"Chevallier, Julien/AAY-9567-2020; XIE, rui/JXR-6421-2024","Chevallier, Julien/0000-0002-4423-9502; Xie, Rui/0000-0001-9300-7145; He, Kaijian/0000-0001-8097-4435","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473180, 71771105]; Guangdong Young Zhujiang Scholar [Yue Jiaoshi [2016]95]; Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Talents of Guangdong [2014A030306031]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangdong Young Zhujiang Scholar; Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Talents of Guangdong,"We express our gratitude to the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71473180 and 71771105), Guangdong Young Zhujiang Scholar (Yue Jiaoshi [2016]95), and the Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Talents of Guangdong (2014A030306031) for funding supports.",,48,21,21,4,68,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2018,121.0,,,,,,441,451,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.07.002,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV3HA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445983800044,0

However, the renewable installed capacity used at that time represented only 12% of the theoretical potential. This prompted the Nicaraguan Government to develop an ambitious national action plan to expand the use of cleaner technologies for electricity generation. Using LEAP and EnergyPLAN, this study simulates the Nicaraguan energy system and provides a prognosis of the outcome of the national action plan by 2030. An additional scenario is created to assess the potential effects of a more intensive use of clean-energy technologies in the Nicaraguan energy system such as biofuels and efficiency measures in the residential sector. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the impact of interest rates and carbon prices on the electricity sector. The study found that focusing efforts solely on the electricity sector is likely to achieve modest changes to the primary energy mix, but no reduction in total GHG emissions by 2030. These findings suggest that decarbonization must take place in the whole energy system and that radical change in the fuels used for transport and cooking are necessary to enable a transition to a smart energy system.","[Cantarero, Maria Mercedes Vanegas] Europa Univ Flensburg, Dept Energy & Environm Management, Interdisciplinary Inst Environm Social & Human St, Munketoft 3B, D-24937 Flensburg, Germany",,"Cantarero, MMV (通讯作者)，Europa Univ Flensburg, Dept Energy & Environm Management, Interdisciplinary Inst Environm Social & Human St, Munketoft 3B, D-24937 Flensburg, Germany.",maria-mercedes.cantarero@studierende.uni-flensburg.de,"Vanegas, Maria/HCI-6889-2022","Vanegas, Maria/0000-0001-8316-9554","Reiner Lemoine Stiftung, Neuss, Germany","Reiner Lemoine Stiftung, Neuss, Germany","This work was supported by the Reiner Lemoine Stiftung, Neuss, Germany.",,99,10,10,4,32,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2018,120.0,,,,,,580,592,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.062,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO6DC,,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440123300054,0

J,"Jain, AK",,,,"Jain, Anil K.",,,A fine balance: Lessons from India's experience with petroleum subsidy reforms,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Oil price decline; Petroleum subsidies; Petroleum taxation; India; Fiscal reforms; Developing countries,,"India's energy sector is passing through a significant transformation, triggered by recent international developments in global oil prices. Historically, diesel, kerosene and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) have been subsidised leaving a small net balance from petroleum taxes for the government, and poor financials for the oil companies. However, all this changed when crude prices declined from over $100/barrel in June 2014 to $50/barrel in June 2017. Concurrent reforms undertaken by the government have radically reduced subsidies from $24.6 billion in 2013 to just $1.16 billion in 2017. This paper shows how reforms involved the strategic application of three different policy 'levers' - retail prices, tax rates and subsidies - with beneficial outcomes for the three main stakeholders - oil companies, the government, and the poorest consumers - the latter through keeping subsidies intact for LPG and kerosene which are used by the poor. It examines policy interventions by the Indian government across these different levers at different points of time. The analysis reveals that petroleum subsidy reform involves much more than simply raising retail prices. The paper brings out policy recommendations from the Indian experience for countries that wish to implement structural reforms in pricing, taxation and subsidies.","[Jain, Anil K.] TERI Univ, Inst Area, New Delhi 110070, India",TERI University,"Jain, AK (通讯作者)，TERI Univ, Inst Area, New Delhi 110070, India.",anilk.jain@gov.in,,,,,,,16,6,6,0,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2018,119.0,,,,,,242,249,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.050,0.0,,,15,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO0XY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439671200023,0

Using rich register data on single-plant firms in the Netherlands 2006-2011, the paper enquires into whether relocation is motivated by the wish to improve the access to employees and the quality of labour force. Not disrupting existing spatial relationships is a prominent consideration of relocating firms, yet in general, relocation does not result in a better spatial match. Some evidence is found for firm-specific human capital functioning as a keep factor. Relocating firms retain predominantly highly skilled employees, but general human capital itself functions neither as a keep factor nor as a pull factor.","[Morkute, Gintare; Koster, Sierdjan] Univ Groningen, Dept Econ Geog, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Morkute, G (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Dept Econ Geog, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",g.morkute@rug.nl; sierdjan.koster@rug.nl,,"koster, sierdjan/0000-0001-6047-920X",,,,,48,6,7,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

We found that technical efficiency is at a moderate level. There are large gaps in efficiency among the eastern, central and western regions. Technical efficiency is highest in the eastern provinces. Ownership structure and technical efficiency exhibit a significant inverted U shaped correlation. While urbanization does not affect technical efficiency, economic, industrial and education levels do have a positive impact on it.

This study thus evaluated the potential of economic diversification (proxied by non-oil export performance) in saving the Naira by analysing a nexus between oil price, exchange rate and nonoil export. Estimation of a rearranged current account equation within Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) and Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models, using monthly data from January 2008 to December 2015 yielded the following results. There is a direct relationship between oil price and exchange rate, and this affirms that sharp decline in the former induced the latter's deterioration. Increase in non-oil exports led to appreciation of USD-Naira exchange rate both in the short run and the long run. Import, on the other hand, induced depreciation of the exchange rate in the long run. Diversification, by increasing export revenue and reducing import bills, therefore has a great potential to improve the value of Naira.","[Alley, Ibrahim] NDIC, Res Policy & Int Relat Dept, Abuja, Nigeria",,"Alley, I (通讯作者)，NDIC, Res Policy & Int Relat Dept, Abuja, Nigeria.",alleyi@yahoo.com,,"Alley, Ibrahim/0000-0002-2268-8171",,,,,75,11,13,0,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2018,118.0,,,,,,245,256,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.03.071,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ1TF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000435050000023,0

To tackle this problem, in 2012, the Peruvian Government created the FISE program, which subsidizes the replacement of traditional stoves with gas cookstoves. This paper describes the challenges faced during the implementation of the FISE, such as the selection of beneficiaries and the creation of a national network of suppliers for the delivery of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders. Using a dataset with information collected from five districts in the department of Ayacucho in 2015, we apply propensity score matching at the household level to evaluate the effects of the program. We show that the FISE favored the adoption of the LPG cookstoves, but that many households still combine their use with traditional cookstoves. We find no evidence that the use of LPG stoves has reduced respiratory problems in the beneficiary households; however, the program has been found to increase the use of LPG stoves for boiling water, which may reduce the exposition of child in beneficiary households to water-related diseases.","[Calzada, Joan] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Calzada, Joan] BEAT, Barcelona, Spain; [Sanz, Alex] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Sanz, A (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.",calzada@ub.edu; Alex.Sanz@uab.cat,"Calzada, Joan/R-8242-2018; Sanz, Alex/T-6284-2019","Calzada, Joan/0000-0002-2976-1677; Sanz, Alex/0000-0002-4750-8392",Ministry of Energy and Mines (MINEM); Fondo de Inclusion Social Energetico (FISE); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2015-69193R],Ministry of Energy and Mines (MINEM); Fondo de Inclusion Social Energetico (FISE); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"In conducting this study we have received support from several Peruvian public institutions, including the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MINEM) and the Fondo de Inclusion Social Energetico (FISE).

Given the potential importance of demand-side actions, both directly and through their relationship with the productive system, as well as the need for a dynamic evolution, we assess the dynamic path and medium-term environmental impact of certain consumer-oriented measures, using a dynamic Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. Specifically, we generate scenarios that follow Spain's strategies and evaluate the dynamic impact of more efficient technologies on electricity consumption and the use of transport services, both in terms of environmental (GHG and SO,,) and economic effects. Our results confirm the role of technology improvements in delivering positive results for the environment, and the importance of economy-wide rebound effects, through a detailed study of energy uses as a result of efficiency improvements in household energy consumption.

The effect of the project evolves over time. The fact that the effect of reducing the concentration of urban air nitrogen dioxide is small is relevant to the small number of new energy vehicles, because the entire project did not attain the expected target. As a result, the promotion of new energy vehicles has become an option to improve urban air quality, especially by reducing air nitrogen dioxide concentration.","[Tan, Ruipeng] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, China Ctr Energy Econ Res, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Tang, Di] China AMC, Int Business, Beijing 100000, Peoples R China; [Lin, Boqiang] Xiamen Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Sch Management, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; Xiamen University,"Lin, BQ (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Sch Management, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",bqlin2004@vip.sina.com,"Lin, Boqiang/G-3960-2010","Lin, Boqiang/0000-0002-1308-400X; Tan, Ruipeng/0000-0002-9613-4518",Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy [1260-Z0210011]; Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding [1260-Y07200]; China National Social Science Fund [17AZD013]; Social Science Planning Project of Fujian Province [2017C075]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71701176],Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy; Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding; China National Social Science Fund; Social Science Planning Project of Fujian Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The paper is supported by the Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy (No. 1260-Z0210011), Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding (No.1260-Y07200), China National Social Science Fund (No. 17AZD013), Social Science Planning Project of Fujian Province (No. 2017C075) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71701176).",,44,65,69,7,149,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2018,118.0,,,,,,33,40,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.03.018,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ1TF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000435050000004,0

Saving energy is an important guarantee for sustainable development. At the same time, many studies have found that changing people's energy consumption behaviours can contribute to solving the high energy consumption problem. Thus, this research chooses the urban residents in China as its object, and studies the factors influencing residents' habitual energy-saving behaviours. We establish a comprehensive theoretical model suitable for this study based on TPB and NAM model. Through on-the-spot investigation, data collection, and model establishment, we find that the daily energy-saving behaviours of urban residents in China are mostly motivated by altruism. In addition, the external factors (social norms and policy environment) have a significant impact on residents' daily energy-saving behaviour. Based on this, we put forward some specific policy suggestions from three aspects: policy effectiveness, information behind the big data and the publicity by the Internet.","[Wang, Bo; Wang, Xiaomeng; Guo, Dongxue; Zhang, Bin; Wang, Zhaohua] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo; Wang, Xiaomeng; Guo, Dongxue; Zhang, Bin; Wang, Zhaohua] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Envirom Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Bin; Wang, Zhaohua] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Elect Vehicles Beijing, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Bin; Wang, Zhaohua] Beijing Key Lab Energy Econ & Environm Management, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Bin; Wang, Zhaohua] Sustainable Dev Res Inst Econ & Soc Beijing, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Beijing Institute of Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology,"Wang, ZH (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",wangzhaohua@bit.edu.cn,"Zhang, Bin/W-2042-2017; Wang, Zhaohua/JJE-6996-2023; Wang, Bo/AAO-8707-2021; Wang, Zhaohua/AAP-5489-2021","Wang, Bo/0000-0002-9245-1006; ZHANG, BIN/0000-0003-0633-2930","National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars [71625003]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFA0602504]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71774014, 91746208, 71403021, 71573016, 71521002]; Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China [17YJC630145]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2017M620648]","National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars); National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation)","This study is supported by the National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars (Reference No. 71625003), National Key Research and Development Program of China (Reference No. Yangtze River Distinguished Professor of MOE, 2016YFA0602504), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Reference No. 71774014, 91746208, 71403021, 71573016, 71521002), Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China (Reference No. 17YJC630145), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Reference No. 2017M620648).",,32,153,160,35,233,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2018,116.0,,,,,,68,77,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.055,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GD8JH,,,Y,N,2024-03-10,WOS:000430758200008,0

Conversely, developing countries tend to be locked in fossil fuels and foster coal-based energy structures, emphasizing reliable and cost-effective energy provision and sidelining environmental concerns. In this study, we identified and analysed the predominant factors related to coal-based power generation in Bangladesh. We applied a mixed-method approach, initially conducting a systematic literature review and, subsequently, semi structured expert interviews to identify and validate relevant factors. We then assessed their relative importance using an Analytical Hierarchy Process based on expert judgments. The results of this assessment reveal that socio-economic aspects and environmental issues scored highest, while technological aspects and sector regulations were considered to be less relevant for large-scale coal power implementation. We conclude that future energy policies created in Bangladesh will need to use appropriate legal instruments and address issues such as human displacement and resettlement, low levels of public acceptance, health hazards and environmental pollution. Participative policy frameworks should be deployed in coal plant projects, and active monitoring systems are necessary to reduce the negative consequences associated with increased electrification and energy consumption. To address foreseeable structural challenges, it furthermore will be crucial to explore sustainable alternatives.","[Zaman, Rafia] Khulna Univ, Business Adm Discipline, Khulna 9208, Bangladesh; [Brudermann, Thomas] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Inst Syst Sci Innovat & Sustainabil Res, Merangasse 18-1, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Kumar, S.] Asian Inst Technol, Sch Environm Resources & Dev, Dept Energy Environm & Climate Change, Khlong Luang 12120, Pathumthani, Thailand; [Zaman, Rafia; Islam, Nazrul] Asian Inst Technol, Sch Management, Khlong Luang 12120, Pathumthani, Thailand",Khulna University; University of Graz; Asian Institute of Technology; Asian Institute of Technology,"Brudermann, T (通讯作者)，Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Inst Syst Sci Innovat & Sustainabil Res, Merangasse 18-1, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",rafiazaman12@gmail.com; Thomas.Brudermann@uni-graz.at; kumar@ait.asia; nazrul@ait.asia,"Islam, Nazrul/AAO-9069-2020; Kumar, S./K-2977-2014; Brudermann, Thomas/ABH-3138-2020","Islam, Nazrul/0000-0002-9276-8388; Brudermann, Thomas/0000-0003-4133-3322; Kumar, Sivanappan/0000-0001-9572-3479",Asian Development Bank - Japan Scholarship Program (ADB-JSP),Asian Development Bank - Japan Scholarship Program (ADB-JSP),"R.

Although China is an authoritarian country with strict media control, public opinion may still affect air quality by putting pressure on the local and central governments to enhance environmental protections. In this paper, the impact of public opinion on air quality in China is for the first time quantitatively examined. Specifically, the monthly average levels of the Air Quality Index (AQI) and the concentrations of several main air pollutants, such as PM2.5, PM10 and SO2, are utilized as indicators for air quality. Using a dataset consisting of 109 prefecture-level Chinese cities for the period between November 2013 and October 2016, the estimation results indicate that air pollution significantly affects public opinion on air quality, and the surge in public opinion on air pollution occurs more frequently in the winter. Public opinion seems to have a positive effect on the environment only in the short run: air quality tends to improve two months after the surge in negative public opinion. In general, public opinion about air pollution helps to improve air quality in China.","[Zhang, Shengling; Li, Yue; Zhang, Yipeng] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Resource Management, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yu] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yu] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, 5 Zhongguancun South St, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yu] Sustainable Dev Res Inst Econ & Soc Beijing, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yu] Beijing Key Lab Energy Econ & Environm Management, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Beijing Institute of Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology,"Hao, Y (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, 5 Zhongguancun South St, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",ierm@bnu.edu.cn; liyue66@mail.bnu.edu.cn; haoyuking@gmail.com; yipengz@mail.bnu.edu.cn,"Hao, Yu/ABF-4628-2021","Zhang, Shengling/0000-0001-7465-4048; Hao, Yu/0000-0001-8394-4215","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71761137001, 71403015, 71521002]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [9162013]; key research program of the Beijing Social Science Foundation [17JDYJA009]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFA0602801, 2016YFA0602603]; Joint Development Program of the Beijing Municipal Commission of Education",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); key research program of the Beijing Social Science Foundation; National Key Research and Development Program of China; Joint Development Program of the Beijing Municipal Commission of Education,"The authors acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71761137001, 71403015, 71521002), the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (9162013), the key research program of the Beijing Social Science Foundation (17JDYJA009), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFA0602801, 2016YFA0602603), and the Joint Development Program of the Beijing Municipal Commission of Education.

Utilities are challenged in recovering the costs of distribution grids, as parts of their revenue basis decreases through self-consumption. Adjusting the grid tariff sets off a reinforcing feedback loop that increases the attractiveness of solar investments, but also leads to a distribution effect between solar prosumers and conventional consumers. The question is: How to recover distribution grid costs equitable without hampering the diffusion of solar power? Can the two criteria be fulfilled at the same time, or is do we aim for squaring a circle? To address this question, I present a System Dynamics simulation model designed to understand the interactions and assess these competing goals. The occurring distribution effect under the volumetric grid tariff with net purchase and sale appears to be rather limited. Simulation experiments reveal that grid tariff designs strongly influence investments for solar power. A capacity tariff can reduce deviations from the cost causation principle of solar prosumers and incentivizes investments in decentralized storage solutions to reduce peak demand. Nevertheless, also the capacity tariff causes a distribution effect.","[Kubli, Merla] Zurich Univ Appl Sci, Inst Sustainable Dev, Technopk Str 2, CH-8401 Winterthur, Switzerland; [Kubli, Merla] Univ St Gallen, Inst Econ & Environm, St Gallen, Switzerland",Zurich University of Applied Sciences; University of St Gallen,"Kubli, M (通讯作者)，Zurich Univ Appl Sci, Inst Sustainable Dev, Technopk Str 2, CH-8401 Winterthur, Switzerland.",merla.kubli@zhaw.ch,,"Kubli, Merla/0009-0007-3948-3491","national research program of the Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research - Center for Research on Economy, Society and Transition (SCCER CREST) [KTI.2014.0114]; Swiss Commission of Technology and Innovation; BKW Energie AG","national research program of the Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research - Center for Research on Economy, Society and Transition (SCCER CREST); Swiss Commission of Technology and Innovation; BKW Energie AG","This research was conducted as part of the national research program of the Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research - Center for Research on Economy, Society and Transition (SCCER CREST, grant number: KTI.2014.0114) in a collaboration with BKW Energie AG.

Integrated modelling of urban water and power systems would facilitate the investment and planning processes, but there is a crucial gap to be filled with regards to extending models to incorporate the food supply in developing contexts. In this paper, a holistic methodology and platform to support the resilient and sustainable planning at city region level for multiple sectors was developed for applications in urban energy systems (UES) and the energy-water-food nexus, combining agent-based modelling - to simulate and forecast resource demands on spatial and temporal scales - with resource network optimization, which incorporates capital expenditures, operational costs, environmental impacts and the opportunity cost of food production foregone (OPF). Via a scenario based approach, innovative water supply and energy deployment policies are presented, which address the provision of clean energy for every citizen and demonstrate the potential effects of climate change. The results highlighted the vulnerability of Ghanas power generation infrastructure and the need for diversification. Feed-in tariffs and investment into supporting infrastructure and agriculture intensification will effectively increase the share of renewable energy and reduce carbon emissions.","[Bieber, Niclas; Ker, Jen Ho; Wang, Xiaonan; van Dam, Koen H.; Shah, Nilay] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Proc Syst Engn, Dept Chem Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Wang, Xiaonan] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Singapore 117585, Singapore; [Triantafyllidis, Charalampos] UCL, Ctr Proc Syst Engn, Dept Chem Engn, London WC1E 7JE, England; [Koppelaar, Rembrandt H.

Regional Studies. This paper adopts a transaction costs' perspective to explain why the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) may vary across regions of an emerging economy. Furthermore, it is argued that young and small firms gain more from the improvement of local governance than do old and large firms. In addition, depending on the institutional history, SMEs will respond differently to the incentives provided by local governance. Analysing more than 300,000 SMEs in Vietnam during 2006-12, it is shown that higher-quality local governance positively influences local SME revenue growth; this effect is stronger for young and small firms, and matters more where institutional history suggests there is less support for entrepreneurship.","[Bach Nguyen; Mickiewicz, Tomasz; Du, Jun] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Econ Finance & Entrepreneurship Dept, Aston Triangle, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",Aston University,"Mickiewicz, T (通讯作者)，Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Econ Finance & Entrepreneurship Dept, Aston Triangle, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",nguyenb@aston.ac.uk; t.mickiewicz@aston.ac.uk; j.du@aston.ac.uk,"Mickiewicz, Tomasz/AAC-8016-2019","Mickiewicz, Tomasz/0000-0001-5261-5662; Du, Jun/0000-0002-0449-4437; NGUYEN, BACH/0000-0003-1527-7443",Leverhulme Trust [RF-2016-661],Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),Jun Du gratefully acknowledges the support of The Leverhulme Trust [grant number RF-2016-661].,,59,39,41,3,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Globalization has exhausted most of the available natural resources and it is therefore necessary to look for certain alternatives to the common principles and procedures of the industrial development. Circular economy provides us with a unique chance to harmonize the post-industrial societies with the nature again. Its essence lies in the growing need for positive changes, mostly in terms of our attitude towards the questions of environmental protection. The amount of people living on our planet is growing exponentially, along with the amount of waste, which disrupts the Earth ecosystem. People, especially the younger generations, perceive these environmental issues very sensitively; that is why most of them try to recycle as much waste as possible. However, given the severity of today's environmental problems on a global scale, we are still far from reaching any long-term solutions. The paper works with the basic assumption that circular economy is one of the pillars of the global environmental protection. The European Union representatives are well aware of this fact. The EU supports innovation processes, recycling and reuse of waste - after all, its financing program Horizon 2020 has been pushed in order to support innovations. One of the program main objectives is to effectively use the EU resources that result from recycling waste and, on the other hand, to preserve the remaining natural resources we possess.

Many generations can be seen in the current society. The customers have some general characteristics resulting from being a part of the concrete cohort. Technology development at international level changes the behaviour of the consumers, which can be perceived as one of the impacts of globalization. Some consumers are more skilled in technology than the others. It is important to determine these differences in order to use the right content and channel for communication with customers. That is why the aim of the paper is to investigate how the consumers from different generations are skilled in technology in the Czech Republic.

Currently, an increasing number of vehicles, especially new constructions in almost every country in the world where railway operates, are subjected only to maintenance and repair activities at precisely defined time intervals, assuming no user intervention. The times in which the driver of the railway vehicle was able to make small repairs on the route were going to become a thing of the past. The maintenance-free trend seems to be justified from an operational and economic point of view, as well as for safety reasons. As part of the work carried out by the author, has been proposed a new method for protecting railway buffers heads against abrasive wear resulting from operation, which allows to completely give up periodic maintenance operations involving the application of grease by an employee to the working surface of buffer head. This solution, based on a durable covering of the surface of the buffer head with a material with favourable tribological properties (aluminum bronze) using laser cladding methods, is characterized by a number of advantages. The article attempts to make a comprehensive analysis of the costs of introducing a new solution for use by railway undertakings and was made an attempt to compare the long-term costs of the solution which is currently in use and a new method of protecting buffers heads.","[Gamon, Wojciech] WSB Univ, Poznan, Poland",,"Gamon, W (通讯作者)，WSB Univ, Poznan, Poland.",wgamon@wsb.edu.pl,"Gamon, Wojciech/E-3214-2018","Gamon, Wojciech/0000-0002-6015-2597",,,,,15,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1576,1582,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300201,0

The further removal of the human factor from the industry and supplementing the manual labour by automation resolves in new opportunities for engineers. The production of the Industry 4.0 is becoming the product of human intellect. The design of such factory and its effective implementation will require skilled Innovators, Mathematicians, Electrical Engineers, Constructors (Machine Engineers), Technologists, Industrial Engineers, Programmers as well as Designers. Therefore, the role of human labour will change from the routine work to more creative and flexible work. The creation of artificial intelligence and introducing of robotic and automated elements into the production cycle will supplement entire physical labour. There are also three stages of exclusion process of a human factor from a technical system described. Forecasting based on the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) of the development of logistic systems in a nowadays conditions determines the Factory of the Future. The further dynamization of production lines makes it possible to reconfigure the factory according to arising needs.

The quality-shaping factors related to internationalization processes are analysed. These factors were subjected to the evaluation of the carriers. The aim of the paper is to identify quality attributes, which should be taken into consideration to develop quality in transport activities on the European market. The information base was provided by qualitative and quantitative methods. The research was conducted based on a questionnaire of 134 interviews with managers (owners), carried out in-person and by phone. These transport companies represented SME sector and mainly with less than 10 employees. In the interpretation of the results, descriptive statistics were used. The study shows that the most important quality determining factor in the field of internationalization is qualified and educated staff. The competition on international transportation markets and international corporations activities are also recognized as significant in creating high quality road freight transport. Furthermore, benchmarking practices and access to EU cabotage markets do not affect quality development in carriers' opinions. The results may confirm low awareness of opportunities that internationalization processes gives.","[Kedzior-Laskowska, Malgorzata] Univ Warmia & Mazury, Dept Microecon, Pl Cieszynski 1 Str, PL-10720 Olsztyn, Poland",University of Warmia & Mazury,"Kedzior-Laskowska, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warmia & Mazury, Dept Microecon, Pl Cieszynski 1 Str, PL-10720 Olsztyn, Poland.",amalgorzata.kedzior@uwm.edu.pl,"Kedzior-Laskowska, Malgorzata/AAY-8637-2021; Kedzior-Laskowska, Malgorzata/AAE-7458-2020","Kedzior-Laskowska, Malgorzata/0000-0003-0651-7740;",,,,,25,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,190,197,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300025,0

Newly observed trend is the integration of brand management into the area of personnel management. The application management practice demonstrated that companies with brands, which are positively perceived by consumers, have no easier or better process of recruiting and eliminating the employees' fluctuation in the specific conditions of the Slovak Republic. This can be justified by the national specifics of the socio-cultural profile that has been identified primarily in the context of Geert Hofstede's sociology. For this reason, the aim of the paper is to analyse the relationship between the socio-cultural profiles of the Slovak Republic and the largest employers in its territory facing the lack of workforce and based on these findings to formulate basic framework recommendations for the practice of incorporating the brand building and managing into personnel management. Based on the above mentioned we found out that dimensions in which the Slovak Republic records the most similarities with the other studied countries are: individualism and long-term orientation. In this context, at the strategic management level, the companies should strive to communicate those aspects of the employer's brand identity which are not principally divergent with the social image and which have the potential to increase its value from the view of its prospective employees.

Due to the rapid technological developments in the world and globalisation, new rules about personal data protection were needed - in the European Union, so-called GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) has become into force. The aim of this paper is to found out whether the degree of perceived sensitivity of selected personal data (namely common personal data and health-related data) is influenced by gender or not. From the results, it is obvious that the degree of perceived sensitivity is independent on respondents' gender (however, there is one exception: Name of your general practitioner is a kind of personal data when men and women have a different view of perceived sensitivity). Besides this it was found out that data such as Personal number, Public identity card number, Passport number, Driver's licence number and Gun licence number are considered as sensitive, whereas First name absolutely belongs to general data. Furthermore, Your height, Your health insurance company and Name of your general practitioner are also understood as rather general data. Presented findings can be used in business practice, especially in the area of loyalty programmes. Customers, who are interested in any loyalty programme, need to register and give required information about them. It is obvious that high degree of perceived sensitivity of required personal data means low willingness to give such personal data and also it leads to considerable effort to protect such data in our globalised and connected world.","[Martiskova, Petra; Svec, Roman; Slaba, Marie] Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Fac Corp Strategy, Dept Tourism & Mkt, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic","Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice","Martiskova, P (通讯作者)，Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Fac Corp Strategy, Dept Tourism & Mkt, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",petramartisek@gmail.com; 17587@mail.vstecb.cz; slaba@mail.vstecb.cz,"Švec, Roman/KCK-8757-2024; Martiskova, Petra/W-6164-2018",,,,,,20,0,0,0,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,2229,2236,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300285,0

The European Union generally supports the greening of transport by supporting the modernization of the fleet. However, this support is not internationally adjusted, so there are considerable differences in car charging within the European Union. In the majority of European countries, revenue from specific road transport taxes (i.e. registration and ownership taxes and fuel excise duties, VAT on registration taxes and fuel excise duties) contributes 5% to 10% of total tax revenue. In some countries (Bulgaria, Greece, Lithuania, Slovakia and Slovenia) this share is slightly higher (11% to 14.5%), while in France and Sweden the share is slightly lower (about 4%). There is an effort of the European Union to reduce transport externalities by decreasing the number of old vehicles that have a serious impact on the environment. General determination on the minimum road tax for the Member States is one of mechanisms that is placed to achieve the environmental protection. But is the resulting tax relief sufficient motivation for the modernization of fleet around all the European Union? This article deals with the issue of the motor vehicle tax in the Slovak Republic where the tax relief for younger vehicles is used. The use of new vehicles requires additional hidden costs, and the tax reduction effect is not be sufficient in general.","[Poliakova, Adela] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Zilina, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Poliaková, A (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Zilina, Slovakia.",adela.poliakova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Poliaková, Adela/ABE-3149-2021",,,,,,18,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1771,1778,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300226,0

Unlike the existing measures, ours are able to detect and quantify nonlinear causal effects. The new measures are based on nonparametric regressions and defined as logarithmic functions of restricted and unrestricted mean square forecast errors. They are easily and consistently estimated by replacing the unknown mean square forecast errors by their nonparametric kernel estimates. We derive the asymptotic normality of nonparametric estimator of causality measures, which we use to build tests for their statistical significance. We establish the validity of smoothed local bootstrap that one can use in finite sample settings to perform statistical tests. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the proposed test has good finite sample size and power properties for a variety of data-generating processes and different sample sizes. Finally, the empirical importance of measuring nonlinear causality in mean is also illustrated. We quantify the degree of nonlinear predictability of equity risk premium using variance risk premium. Our empirical results show that the variance risk premium is a very good predictor of risk premium at horizons less than 6 months. We also find that there is a high degree of predictability at the 1-month horizon, that can be attributed to a nonlinear causal effect.

At the same time, the country is also very dependent on fossil fuel imports. Kiribati uses price controls and tax exemptions to make fossil fuels more affordable for low-income households. This study reviews the subsidies on consumption of fossil fuels, specifically gasoline, diesel, and household kerosene in Kiribati and investigates their macroeconomic, fiscal, distributional, and environmental impact. The subsidies are quantified using price gap approach. Over a five year period, the subsidies were on average AUD 4.2 million when using 2011-2015 data with 2015 tax policies. This is equivalent to 2.2 per cent of Kiribati GDP. Over 2011-2014 the average fiscal impact would have been equivalent to 3.7 per cent of government revenues and 29 per cent of government health expenditure. Apart from being a fiscal burden the subsidies increase greenhouse gas emissions and make Kiribati even more dependent on fossil fuel imports and more vulnerable to volatility in international fuel prices. No evidence was found to support the argument for using the subsidies to support low-income households. In fact, there are signs of considerable leakages to high-income households, which is consistent with findings from studies in other countries.","[Peltovuori, Ville] Pacific Community SPC, Econ Dev Div, Suva, Fiji; [Peltovuori, Ville] Level 2,Lotus Bldg,Ratu Mara Rd,Private Mail Bag, Suva, Fiji",,"Peltovuori, V (通讯作者)，Pacific Community SPC, Econ Dev Div, Suva, Fiji.;Peltovuori, V (通讯作者)，Level 2,Lotus Bldg,Ratu Mara Rd,Private Mail Bag, Suva, Fiji.",ville@peltovuori.fi,,,Pacific Community (SPC) Energy Programme; Overseas Development Institute (ODI),Pacific Community (SPC) Energy Programme; Overseas Development Institute (ODI),This work was supported by the Pacific Community (SPC) Energy Programme and the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) Fellowship Scheme.,,45,6,7,1,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2017,111.0,,,,,,102,110,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.09.021,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FN1VQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000415779700013,0

In this paper, we develop a model of fisheries regulation that includes ecological uncertainly, variable economic uncertainty as well as structural economic uncertainty. We aggregate the effects of these uncertainties into a single welfare measure for comparing tax and quota regulation. It is shown that quotas are always preferred to fees when structural economic uncertainty dominates. Since most regulators are subject to this kind of uncertainty, this result is a potentially important qualification of the pro-price regulation message dominating the fisheries economics literature. We also believe that the model of a fishery developed in this paper could be applied to the regulation of other renewable resources where regulators are subject to uncertainty either directly or with some modification.

A summative evaluation was conducted to understand impacts of different information provision in these cities. Qualitative data were gathered through a set of interviews with 40 building professionals at the central or building level. These interviews identified differences in how the energy efficiency communication-based campaigns were implemented at each site and elicited factors to explain how users' perceptions and understanding changed as a result of the interventions. The evaluation framework helped to identify not only improvements in the delivery of communication-based campaigns, but also the communication factors that impacted on individual behaviour change. The research highlighted the influence of institutional and social effects on individual beliefs and norms. To achieve more effective change in attitudes to reduce use, energy feedback needs to be supported with engagement activities, such as energy coaches, campaigns, and interactive online fora.","[Ozawa-Meida, Leticia; Fleming, Paul; Stuart, Graeme; Holland, Carl] De Montfort Univ, Inst Energy & Sustainable Dev, Leicester LE1 9BH, Leics, England; [Wilson, Caroline] Coventry Univ, Res Ctr Global Educ, Youell House First Floor,1 Hill Top, Coventry CV1 5AB, W Midlands, England",De Montfort University; Coventry University,"Ozawa-Meida, L (通讯作者)，De Montfort Univ, Inst Energy & Sustainable Dev, Leicester LE1 9BH, Leics, England.",lozawa-meida@dmu.ac.uk; ab5868@coventry.ac.uk; PFleming@dmu.ac.ulc; GStuart@dmu.ac.uk; CHolland@dmu.ac.uk,"Wilson, Caroline/AAH-7860-2019","Wilson, Caroline/0000-0002-0213-506X; Stuart, Graeme/0000-0002-4028-2095",European Commission within ICT Policy Support Programme [297273],European Commission within ICT Policy Support Programme,The data referred to in this paper were collected in the project titled SmartSpaces: Saving Energy in Europe's Public Buildings using ICT funded by the European Commission within the ICT Policy Support Programme Grant agreement 297273.

Almost half of Indian manufacturing lies in the small-scale sector, and its productivity is severely affected by power outages. However, there is a surprising paucity of research on small firms' WTP for avoiding outages. We conduct a double-bounded dichotomous choice contingent valuation experiment with a random sample of 260 small-scale firms in the region around Hyderabad. We find that on average, firms are willing to pay approximately 20% more for uninterrupted power supply. The WTP estimates and the explanatory factors for the firms' decisions were tested for robustness using both probit and bivariate probit models. In addition, a two-step Heckman correction was used to control for selection bias induced by protest responses.

Departing from them, this paper took into account energy-related CO2 emissions embodied in intermediate production processes. We used the SRIO model to calculate and analyze the carbon footprint of economic sectors in India during the period of 1995-2009, and also investigated the changes in the carbon emission intensity of each sector. The results showed that, from the production perspective, the most famous high carbon sector was EGW (electricity, gas and water supply), and this sector accounted for 60% of the CO2 emissions of the secondary industry. From the consumption perspective, this ratio was only maintained at between 10%-16%. In contrast, traditional low carbon sector, CON (construction) emitted the largest CO2 to other sectors. In addition, more than 90% of the sectors showed a decreasing trend of carbon emission intensity. The conclusions of this paper have important policy implications for the correct allocation of CO2 emission responsibility, establishment of fair and effective emission reduction policies and the transformation of low carbon economy in India.","[Sun, Chuanwang; Ding, Dan] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, China Ctr Energy Econ Res, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Sun, Chuanwang] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Int Econ & Business, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Yang, Mian] Wuhan Univ, Econ & Management Sch, Luojia Hill, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; Xiamen University; Wuhan University,"Yang, M (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Econ & Management Sch, Luojia Hill, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",yangmian909@163.com,"Ding, Dan/C-7519-2014; Sun, Chuanwang/JOZ-8733-2023","Sun, Chuanwang/0000-0002-1900-4699; Yang, Mian/0000-0001-7806-1311","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673230, 71373218]; Major Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China [13 ZD167]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [20720171001, 20720151026, 20720151039]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Major Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the editor and anonymous referees for their insightful and constructive comments.

In a 100% renewable system some of these forms will have to be provided by conversion from others, mostly from electricity. Conversion involves inefficiencies, losses, and embedded energy costs of infrastructures, and thus energy and dollar costs. In this study an attempt has been made to determine the magnitude and effect of this general problem, by beginning with estimates of the quantities required by different sectors and of the different forms they use. How these needs might best be met in a renewable system is then considered. Although there is insufficient data to enable confident conclusions, this disaggregated approach indicates that a 100% renewable system to meet Australian energy demand would involve costs that would probably constitute an unacceptably large fraction of GDP.","[Trainer, Ted] Univ NSW, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Trainer, T (通讯作者)，Univ NSW, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",,,,,,,,40,12,12,0,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,539,544,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.07.040,0.0,,,6,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400052,0

The main contribution made by this paper stems from application of this ontological construct to the analysis of policies targeting wicked energy problems.

Recently, much interest has been aroused by an approach involving the use of the realized covariance (RCOV) matrix constructed from high-frequency returns as the ex-post realization of the covariance matrix of low-frequency returns. For the analysis of dynamics of RCOV matrices, we propose the generalized conditional autoregressive Wishart (GCAW) model. Both the noncentrality matrix and scale matrix of the Wishart distribution are driven by the lagged values of RCOV matrices, and represent two different sources of dynamics, respectively. The GCAW is a generalization of the existing models, and accounts for symmetry and positive definiteness of RCOV matrices without imposing any parametric restriction. Some important properties such as conditional moments, unconditional moments, and stationarity are discussed. Empirical examples including sequences of daily RCOV matrices from the New York Stock Exchange illustrate that our model outperforms the existing models in terms of model fitting and forecasting.","[Yu, Philip L.

We construct an integrated dataset that includes the compulsory agricultural census and farm structural survey that cover almost all farms in Scotland. In addition to farm owner demographics and farm business structures, we also assess the effect of diversification activities such as tourism and forestry, as well as the spatial, biophysical and geophysical attributes of the farms on the adoption decision. We find that diversified farms are more likely to adopt renewable energy, especially solar and biomass energy. Farms are also more likely to adopt renewable energy if they have high local demand for energy, or suitable conditions for renewable energy production. We find that biophysical factors such as the agricultural potential of farm land are important in adoption decisions. We identify adopter profiles for each type of renewable energy, and map the geographic location of potential adopters. We argue that renewable energy policy should be more integrated with farm diversification policy and farm support schemes. It should also be tailored for each type of renewable energy, for the potential adopter profiles of wind, solar and biomass energy all differ in farm characteristics and geographic distribution.","[Ge, Jiaqi; Polhill, J.

However policy design in Europe, and model-based analysis even more so, is arguably shaped by the neo-classical school of thought. There is a need to provide a structured approach that would facilitate the incorporating of institutional contexts into Renewable Energy Sources for Electricity (RES-E) policy design and analysis. This paper presents a formal approach to RES-E policy design based on Design Theory, the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) Framework, and Agent Based Modelling and Simulation. Given a certain frame of analysis, we propose that it is theoretically possible to identify the complete policy design space, a set of design elements. Crucially, this aspect potentially opens up to the policy analyst new avenues for intervention, and allows her systematically explore, given a range of uncertainties, which element(s) of intervention is(are) the most vital to achieve the goals of the community. Its empirical applicability is demonstrated by representing and differentiating between six RES-E schemes from Western Europe in terms of the design elements; a model-based illustration demonstrates the value of this approach to quantitatively analyse the impact of design elements.","[Iychettira, Kaveri K.; Hakvoort, Rudi A.] Delft Univ Technol, Jaffalaan 5, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands; [Iychettira, Kaveri K.; Linares, Pedro] Comillas Pontifical Univ, Madrid, Spain",Delft University of Technology; Comillas Pontifical University,"Iychettira, KK (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, Jaffalaan 5, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands.",k.k.iychettira@tudelft.nl,"Linares, Pedro/B-7999-2008","Linares, Pedro/0000-0002-0572-1937",Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctorate in Sustainable Energy Technologies and Strategies,Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctorate in Sustainable Energy Technologies and Strategies,"This research was supported by a fellowship from the Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctorate in Sustainable Energy Technologies and Strategies, and the authors gratefully acknowledge the same.

In order to reduce GHG emissions in transportation, leading countries have started to implement renewable fuel standard (RFS) policies. Other countries such as Korea have recently started implementing RFS policies in order to comply with the proposed global GHG reduction target. However, previous research did not consider the impact of RFS policy on consumer acceptance levels. Therefore, this study analyzes consumer preferences and willingness-to pay (WTP) for RFS. To provide detailed policy strategies, this study conducts additional analysis using market segmentation and sensitivity analysis. The results indicate that consumers generally accept the cost of implementing an RFS policy if the cost falls between KRW 101.78/liter (USD 0.33/gal) and KRW 187.26/ liter (USD 0.60/gal). In addition, consumer WTP for implementing an RFS policy changes when the income exceeds KRW 5 million (USD 4229.1) in driver group, and relatively lower-income groups tend not to support RFS policies. Based on the results of this study, we can suggest proper pricing policies for each income group and a public relations strategy to improve the level of policy acceptance.","[Shin, Jungwoo] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Ind & Management Syst Engn, 1732 Deogyeong Daero, Yongin 17104, Gyeonggi, South Korea; [Hwang, Won-Sik] Korea Inst Ind Econ & Trade, 370 Sicheong Daero, Sejong Si 30147, South Korea",Kyung Hee University; Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade (KIET),"Hwang, WS (通讯作者)，Korea Inst Ind Econ & Trade, 370 Sicheong Daero, Sejong Si 30147, South Korea.",shinjung11@gmail.com; yel0sik@snu.ac.kr,,"Shin, Jungwoo/0000-0002-7772-8636",,,,,47,17,17,1,39,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2017,106.0,,,,,,32,40,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.03.042,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EW2RL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402343600004,0

This research explores the role and value of the energy justice concept across the disciplines. It provides the first critical account of the emergence of the energy justice concept in both research and practice. A diagrammatical image for examining the energy justice concepts is presented and this is a tool for interdisciplinary engagement with the concept. In this context, restorative justice is introduced and how it results in energy justice applying in practice is detailed. Energy research scholarship at universities is assessed and it is clear that through universities there is a platform for energy justice scholarship to build on the interdisciplinary energy scholarship at universities. Further, the role of education is vital to policy-making, and the understanding and development of the energy justice concept. Finally, in analysing how the energy justice concept can impact on policy-making, there is a critical examination of the energy justice and its relationship with economics, and how it can transfer directly into practice by assisting in balancing the competing aims of the energy trilemma.","[Heffron, Raphael J.] Queen Mary Univ London, Energy & Nat Resources Law Inst, London, England; [McCauley, Darren] Univ St Andrews, Sch Geog & Sustainable Dev, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland",University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of St Andrews,"Heffron, RJ (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Energy & Nat Resources Law Inst, London, England.",r.heffron@qmul.ac.uk,"Heffron, Raphael/AAQ-4911-2020; Heffron, Raphael/K-4430-2019; McCauley, Darren/GYJ-6924-2022","Heffron, Raphael/0000-0002-3026-9604; McCauley, Darren/0000-0002-3951-1129",,,,,56,274,299,16,121,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUN,2017,105.0,,,,,,658,667,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.03.018,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ET8EY,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, Green Accepted",Y,N,2024-03-10,WOS:000400532900064,0

Game theory is often used to analyze and explain regional cooperation by regarding it as a type of institutional collective action in which the actions of its participants (local governments or nations) greatly depend on those of the other participants. However, considering China's political structure, the political relationship among local government key officials may also influence regional cooperation. This study used the Pan-Pearl River Delta (Pan-PRD) Cooperation, the largest regional cooperation bloc in China formed in 2004. The Pan-PRD covered nine provinces in Mainland China and two special administrative regions as a case study for this research; three models were constructed using game theory to analyze the political incentives of the provincial officials in cooperating with one another under the assumption of relative gains. Results showed that the cooperation incentives are sensitive to the variations of political rankings among the leading provincial officials. Driven by promotion incentives, cooperation is more feasible between jurisdictions with different political rankings and less feasible between jurisdictions with the same political rankings.","[Chen, Yu] Shenzhen Univ, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Yeh, Anthony G.

Under this new structure, characterized by a nodal pricing system and an independent system operator (ISO), we analyze welfare-optimal network expansion with two modeling strategies. In a first model, we propose the use of an incentive price-cap mechanism to promote the expansion of Mexican networks. In a second model, we study centrally-planned grid expansion in Mexico by an ISO within a power-flow model. We carry out comparisons of these models which provide us with hints to evaluate the actual transmission planning process proposed by Mexican authorities (PRODESEN). We obtain that the PRODESEN plan appears to be a convergent welfare-optimal planning process.","[Zenon, Eric] CCGSS, Calle Centenario Inst Juarez S-N, Villahermosa 86080, Tabasco, Mexico; [Rosellon, Juan] CIDE, Dept Econ, Carretera Mexico Toluca 3655, Mexico City 01210, DF, Mexico; [Rosellon, Juan] Univ Panamer, Escuela Ciencias Econam & Empresariales, Campus Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Rosellon, Juan] DIW Berlin, Dept Energy, Transportat, Environm, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

We consider the problem of testing for threshold nonlinearity in the drift term. We do this by developing a quasi-likelihood test derived under the working assumption of a constant diffusion term, which circumvents the problem of generally unknown functional form for the diffusion term. The test is first developed for testing for one threshold at which the drift term breaks into two linear functions. We show that under some mild regularity conditions, the asymptotic null distribution of the proposed test statistic is given by the distribution of certain functional of some centered Gaussian process. We develop a computationally efficient method for calibrating the p-value of the test statistic by bootstrapping its asymptotic null distribution. The local power function is also derived, which establishes the consistency of the proposed test. The test is then extended to testing for multiple thresholds. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed test by simulations. Using the proposed test, we examine the evidence of nonlinearity in the term structure of a long time series of U.S. interest rates.","[Su, Fei] ISO Innovat Analyt, San Francisco, CA 94111 USA; [Chan, Kung-Sik] Univ Iowa, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA",University of Iowa,"Su, F (通讯作者)，ISO Innovat Analyt, San Francisco, CA 94111 USA.",sophysu@gmail.com; kung-sik-chan@uiowa.edu,,,U.S. National Science Foundation [DMS-1021896],U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),The authors thank Bruce Hansen and two anonymous referees for very helpful comments and gratefully acknowledge partial support by the U.S. National Science Foundation (DMS-1021896).,,37,7,7,0,9,AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC,ALEXANDRIA,"732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

Damages from health impacting pollutants (NOx, SO2, particulate matter - PM, and volatile organic compounds - VOCs) as well as greenhouse gases (GHGs) are accounted for by applying emissions fees equal to estimated external damages associated with life-cycle emissions. We determine that in a least-cost framework, fees reduce emissions, including those not targeted by the fees. Emissions reductions are achieved through the use of control technologies, energy efficiency, and shifting of fuels and technologies used in energy conversion. The emissions targeted by fees decrease, and larger fees lead to larger reductions. Compared to the base case with no fees, in 2045, SO2 emissions are reduced up to 70%, NOx emissions up to 30%, PM2.5 up to 45%, and CO2 by as much as 36%. Emissions of some pollutants, particularly VOCs and methane, sometimes increase when fees are applied. The co-benefit of reduction in non-targeted pollutants is not always larger for larger fees. The degree of co-reduced emissions depends on treatment of life-cycle emissions and the technology pathway used to achieve emissions reductions, including the mix of efficiency, fuel switching, and emissions control technologies.","[Brown, Kristen E.; Henze, Daven K.; Milford, Jana B.] Univ Colorado, 1111 Engn Dr, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Brown, KE (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, 1111 Engn Dr, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",Kristen.E.Brown@Colorado.edu; Daven.Henze@Colorado.edu; Jana.Milford@Colorado.edu,"Brown, Kristen E/I-8231-2019; Henze, Daven K/A-1920-2012","Brown, Kristen E/0000-0002-0201-0558;","NASA Applied Sciences Program [NNX11AI54G]; University of Colorado seed grant from the Renewable and Sustainable Energy Institute; NASA [144838, NNX11AI54G] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",NASA Applied Sciences Program(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); University of Colorado seed grant from the Renewable and Sustainable Energy Institute; NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),This work was supported by the NASA Applied Sciences Program (Grant no.

One type of demand response programs, price-based program, induces customers to respond to changes in product rates. However, some large-scale customers find it difficult to change their electricity consumption patterns, even with rate changes, because their electricity demands are commercial and industrial. This study proposes an adaptive in-house pricing model for large-scale customers, particularly those with multiple business facilities, for self-regulating price-based program. The adaptive in-house pricing model charges higher rates to customers with lower load factors by employing a peak-to-off-peak usage ratio in order to reduce usage at times of high prices at each facility. This study analyzes the daily electricity consumption patterns of large-scale customers through a field trial of the proposed pricing model at a telecom company with 447 offices and worksites for one month. The results show that the pricing model corresponds to average reductions of 3.54-28.69% during peak-demand times for four different types of workplaces. However, reductions in electricity consumption during off-peak periods did not show a significant difference. The results of this study prove that this proposed pricing model can be successfully applied to large-scale operations.","[Kim, Min-Jeong] Sookmyung Womens Univ, Dept Consumer Econ, 100 Cheongpa ro 47 gil, Seoul 140742, South Korea",Sookmyung Women's University,"Kim, MJ (通讯作者)，Sookmyung Womens Univ, Dept Consumer Econ, 100 Cheongpa ro 47 gil, Seoul 140742, South Korea.",min-jeong.kim@sm.ac.kr,,,"Sookmyung Women's University Research, South Korea [1-1503-0026]","Sookmyung Women's University Research, South Korea","This Research was supported by the Sookmyung Women's University Research, South Korea Grants (No. 1-1503-0026).",,34,2,2,0,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2017,102.0,,,,,,189,198,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.12.024,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP4NM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397357200020,0

This construction is based on asymptotic results for the maximal deviation between a suitable nonparametric estimator and the true function of interest, which follow after a series of approximation steps including a Bahadur representation, a new strong approximation theorem, and exponential tail inequalities for Gaussian random fields. As a byproduct we also obtain multivariate confidence corridors for the regression function in the classical mean regression. To deal with the problem of slowly decreasing error in coverage probability of the asymptotic confidence corridors, which results in meager coverage for small sample sizes, a simple bootstrap procedure is designed based on the leading term of the Bahadur representation. The finite-sample properties of both procedures are investigated by means of a simulation study and it is demonstrated that the bootstrap procedure considerably outperforms the asymptotic bands in terms of coverage accuracy. Finally, the bootstrap confidence corridors are used to study the efficacy of the National Supported Work Demonstration, which is a randomized employment enhancement program launched in the 1970s.

Taking the example of the Swiss watch industry, it argues that institutional factors played a key role in this process. Cartel agreements, set up in the 1920s, combined with the legal backing of the federal state from 1934 onwards, maintained an industrial organization based on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and prevented the appearance of big firms. However, the liberalization policy adopted in the early 1960s sounded the death knell of the cartel and encouraged industrial restructuring through M&As. Swatch Group was founded in this context in 1983, and went on to establish itself as the largest watch business in Switzerland and in the world. The firm began relocating part of its production facilities abroad in the mid-1980s, especially in East Asia, and turned into a multinational enterprise during the 1990s.","[Donze, Pierre-Yves] Osaka Univ, Suita, Osaka 565, Japan",Osaka University,"Donzé, PY (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Suita, Osaka 565, Japan.",,"Donzé, Pierre-Yves/Z-2029-2019","Donze, Pierre-Yves/0000-0003-2854-5531",,,,,32,1,1,0,4,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

Its current manifestations, which are also the subject of our paper, can be seen in the form of growth of economic activities across regional and national borders. It enables companies to establish themselves in foreign markets, increase profits and gain competitive advantages. The focus of our contribution is to present the impact of globalization in the economic field, especially in the area of financial management of enterprises. Financial management as one of the areas that the company needs to manage consists of planning, organizing financial processes, their leading and control. In our paper, we focus mainly on the processes of planning and controlling the results of the financial activity. We examine how the fact that an enterprise is owned or co-owned by a foreign investor affects the implementation of financial planning and financial control in the financial management process. In the paper, we test the hypothesis that companies with a share of foreign capital in equity use financial planning and financial control more frequently than firms without the influence of a foreign investor, and that foreign companies plan and control more financial indicators than domestic businesses.","[Grofcikova, Janka] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Grofcíková, J (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia.",janka.grofcikova@umb.sk,,,,,,,21,1,1,2,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,589,596,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059201011,0

In this paper the development of a three-dimensional (3D) discrete element soil model for simulation of a cohesive soil's direct shear test is presented. The aim was to calibrate the properties of the Hertz-Mindlin with bonding contact model available in EDEM software to the results of real direct shear box test. The cohesion and internal friction angle were calculated from the equation of the Mohr Coulomb line of the soil model. Results show that direct shear laboratory test can be simulated very well using discrete element method (DEM). The model's calculated cohesion and internal friction angle values and the corresponding mechanical properties of real cohesive soil were in good agreement with relative error of 4.44 percent and 4.66 percent, respectively.","[Kotrocz, Krisztian; Kerenyi, Gyorgy] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Machine & Prod Design, Muegyet Rkp 3-9, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary",Budapest University of Technology & Economics,"Kotrocz, K (通讯作者)，Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Machine & Prod Design, Muegyet Rkp 3-9, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary.",kotrocz.krisztian@gt3.bme.hu; kerenyi.gyorgy@gt3.bme.hu,,,,,,,15,1,1,0,9,EUROPEAN COUNCIL MODELLING & SIMULATION,NOTTINGHAM,"SCHOOL COMPUTING & MATHEMATICS, NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV, BURTON STREET, NOTTINGHAM, NG1 4BU, ENGLAND",,,978-0-9932440-4-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,510,515,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Economics; Engineering, Industrial",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Engineering,BH9XI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404420000076,0

In our constant and rapidly changing globalised world building strategic partnerships is a must for all businesses to survive the intensive competition in the global market. However, it is not exclusively the sole proprietors who are competing but also entire corporate groups. The recent financial and economic recession has had a deep impact and influence on the value-creating processes. Globalisation is observable at international businesses that make further headway and due to the turbulent competition in the market production and manufacturing companies have to rethink their strategies. Thus, under such external circumstances, entrepreneurs must develop their skills in decision-making. The supply chain management concept enables the increase of efficiency on planning and managerial levels, the enhancement of co-operation with suppliers and customers, as well as the response capacity. Moreover, it results in the reduction of incurring - marketing, logistic and manufacturing - costs along the whole supply chain. The objective of this study is to get a deeper insight into and understanding of relationships and factors to determine the supply chain competitiveness of the Hungarian companies in practice. My examination is based on research, interviews and a case study.

Accumulation of human capital attributable to universities' contribution is possible not only when students are attracted to the region for their higher education, but also when graduates stay to work in the university region. Previous research makes a strong argument supporting the notion that the better the quality of the university from which a student graduates, the lower the probability that she/he will migrate after graduation. However, the manner in which the quality of the university affects student mobility might differ, given the vast regional disparities. The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors affecting the migration behavior of students and graduates under the prevailing regional dualism in Korea, using the Korean Labor and Income Panel Study. Two-stage recursive models are applied to investigate how migration choice behaviors of students and graduates in the Seoul Metropolitan Area, which has a greater concentration of political, cultural, and financial functions, differ from those in the rest of the country. The empirical results demonstrate that the probability that the student will migrate for higher education is positively affected by the quality of the university. However, the results also show that the better the quality of the university, the higher the probability that graduates will migrate after completing higher education. Such a phenomenon is much more remarkable in the lesser developed areas.","[Ma, Kang-Rae; Kwon, O-Kyu] Chung Ang Univ, Dept Urban Planning, Seoul, South Korea; [Ma, Kang-Rae; Kwon, O-Kyu] Chung Ang Univ, Real Estate Coll Social Sci, Seoul, South Korea; [Kang, Eun-Taek] Seonam Univ, Coll Humanities & Social Sci, Cheonan, South Korea",Chung Ang University; Chung Ang University; Seonam University,"Kang, ET (通讯作者)，Seonam Univ, Coll Humanities & Social Sci, Cheonan, South Korea.",kma@cau.ac.kr; ket@seonam.ac.kr; kwon0759@gmail.com,,,,,,,35,14,16,1,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

This paper deals with preferences of certain group of consumers, known as generation Y, towards green products. To reveal green preferences the survey method was carried out using a questionnaire. The research was carried out in the Slovak Republic within the sample of generation Y respondents. Basic findings showed that the awareness of green products among a sample of respondents is rather positive. Consumers of generation Y with higher education are willing to prefer green products even if their price is higher. These products must have a clearly recognized environmental label. Regarding attributes of green products, consumers perceived them as high-quality, value-formoney, human-friendly and environmentally friendly. Respondents do not prefer green products to increase their prestige in society, they realize that their actions and lifestyle can influence environmental impacts and contribute to have a better environment.","[Mat'ova, Hana; Kaputa, Vladislav] Tech Univ Zvolen, Fac Wood Sci & Technol, TG Masaryka 24, Zvolen 96053, Slovakia",Technical University Zvolen,"Kaputa, V (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Zvolen, Fac Wood Sci & Technol, TG Masaryka 24, Zvolen 96053, Slovakia.",matova@tuzvo.sk; kaputa@tuzvo.sk,"Kaputa, Vladislav/E-2203-2018","Kaputa, Vladislav/0000-0002-5953-1223",,,,,19,2,2,1,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1510,1517,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059202058,0

This leads to an increasing emphasis on removing gender inequality in research. However, the patterns of this inequality can by very different across the countries.

We build on QFD combined with Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to develop a novel method applied to the area of advanced biofuel policies. This Multi-Stakeholder Policy QFD (MSP QFD) provides a systematic approach to capture the voice of the stakeholders and align it with the broad range of potential advanced biofuels policies. To account for the policy environment, the MSP QFD utilizes a novel approach to stakeholder importance weights.

Any information that helps to identify potential threats in advance is helpful. Therefore, it is necessary to predict their future financial situation in a certain way. On the basis of the information obtained from this prediction, the company can plan its further activities and decide to expand or narrow it down. For the efficient development and evaluation of company's financial analysis, availability of high-quality, up-to-date information is required. The sources of this information are primarily the financial statements of the company, balance sheet and income statement. The results of the company's financial analysis serve the management for decisions about further development of the company. On the other hand, the results of predictive models serve the company to analyze its inclusion into a group of prosperous or non-prosperous ones and to detect its main weaknesses. Practice has shown that it is appropriate to create bankruptcy prediction models specifically for individual sectors of economic activities of companies. In the paper we focus on the financial ratios of companies, globally used in bankruptcy prediction models and by using cluster analysis we create groups of business activities that are so similar in their characteristics that can be analyzed together. Sectors of economic activities are used according to the international NACE classification. The results of our analysis are those NACE categories that are as similar as possible so that predictive models could be created for them.","[Siekelova, Anna] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,,anna.siekelova@fpedas.uniza.sk; lucia.svabova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Svabova, Lucia/P-7174-2015","Svabova, Lucia/0000-0002-4722-4103",Slovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-14-0841],Slovak Research and Development Agency(Slovak Research and Development Agency),This research was financially supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency -Grant NO.

One of the major goal of establishing the unified global space was to empower less developed countries and create more opportunities for new markets and wealth, inspiring the economic growth and social prospects. International development institutions were dedicated to harmonize interactions between diverse actors and to establish common mandatory regimes, incentivizing developing countries to be relevant. As the global order has been transformed by new regional powers, existing international institutional architecture is not adequately facing the challenges posed by the current status of the global economy, and hence could be supplemented by new regional financial mechanisms. The article provides an overview of recent initiatives, launched by BRICS countries: Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, New Development Bank, and Silk Road Foundation, focusing on factors beyond their founding; agenda and first projects; challenges, faced by these institutions. New Development Bank, AIIB, as well as China's One Belt One Road program, have different targets and roles on regional integration, that allows for differentiation of responsibilities and to provide omnichannel support for development projects. It is argued, that new institutions have the potential to achieve several positive and complementary aims: provide additional financial support for infrastructure projects; leverage the savings of emerging economies for the purposes of development; serve as a forum for incorporating emerging economies into the multilateral global system. Also, it is argued, based on comparative analysis, that new BRICS initiatives are complementary to existing international institutions and organizations rather than competitive to them. Given a massive need for greater volumes of development finance (The World Bank estimates an infrastructure deficit of at least $1 trillion in these regions), particularly for basic infrastructure, new development institutions could help to fill infrastructure gaps and provide new prospects for developing countries.","[Volkova, Anna V.; Kulakova, Tatyana A.; Koverzneva, Sofya] St Petersburg State Univ, Univ Skaya Nab 7-9, St Petersburg, Russia",Saint Petersburg State University,"Koverzneva, S (通讯作者)，St Petersburg State Univ, Univ Skaya Nab 7-9, St Petersburg, Russia.",av.volkova@rambler.ru; koulakova812@mail.ru; s.koverzneva@gmail.com,,,,,,,23,1,1,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2911,2918,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059205039,0

However, from the point of view of synergism, this is an evolutionary process that must be considered as a process of bifurcation and creation in the socio-economic system. In the course of the global economic crisis, which has bifurcation processes, and consequently, a split of trajectory, there is a change in the nature of the functioning of the socio-economic system. For the situation to be predicted, neutralized or, on the contrary, created positive synergetic effects, it is crucially important to understand what they are based on, why such nonlinear effects appear in the economy. Thus, it is essential to distinguish the vector as a synergetic economic effect that has a huge impact on bifurcation processes in financial system. This vector is usually measured by the additional monetary incomes obtained as a result of an effective combination of monetary investments, from the point of view of increasing monetary capital, regardless of the actual efficiency of the process of social reproduction. In this regard, in the author's opinion, it seems promising to consider the patterns of the functioning of the financial system in the Russian Federation from the point of view of a synergetic approach to the formation of financial potential, which manifests itself through the functioning of the financial market and its impact on the financial and banking system at the level of the Russian Federation.","[Zakievnal, Bayguzina Lyuza] Bashkir State Univ, Econ Sci, Ufa, Russia; [Zakievnal, Bayguzina Lyuza] Bashkir State Univ, Dept Finance & Taxat, Ufa, Russia",Ufa University of Science & Technology; Ufa University of Science & Technology,"Zakievnal, BL (通讯作者)，Bashkir State Univ, Econ Sci, Ufa, Russia.;Zakievnal, BL (通讯作者)，Bashkir State Univ, Dept Finance & Taxat, Ufa, Russia.",Lyuzab@mail.ru,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,116,122,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059200016,0

It is shown that having the bond prices together with the short rates leads to more efficient estimation of all parameters for the interest rate models. It enhances the estimation efficiency of the maximum likelihood estimation based on the interest rate dynamics alone. The combined estimation based on the bond prices and the interest rate dynamics can also provide inference to the risk premium parameter.

An interactive budget impact model was created for hospitals to use when considering these technologies.MethodsA Microsoft Excel model was built and populated with base-case costs and probabilities identified through literature search and a survey of US hospital transfusion service directors. Annual costs of PC acquisition, testing, wastage, dispensing/transfusion, sepsis, shelf life, and reimbursement for a mid-sized hospital that purchases all of its PCs were compared for four scenarios: 100% conventional PCs (C-PC), 100% RT-PC, 100% PR-PC, and 50% RT-PC/50% PR-PC.ResultsAnnual total costs were US$3.64, US$3.67, and US$3.96 million when all platelets were C-PC, RT-PC, or PR-PC, respectively, or US$3.81 million in the 50% RT-PC/50% PR-PC scenario. The annual net cost of PR-PC, obtained by subtracting annual reimbursements from annual total costs, is 6.18% above that of RT-PC. Maximum usable shelf lives for C-PC, RT-PC, and PR-PC are 3.0, 5.0, and 3.6days, respectively; hospitals obtain PR-PC components earliest at 1.37days.ConclusionThe model predicts minimal cost increase for PR-PC versus RT-PC, including cost offsets such as elimination of bacterial detection and irradiation, and reimbursement. Additional safety provided by PR, including risk mitigation of transfusion-transmission of a broad spectrum of viruses, parasites, and emerging pathogens, may justify this increase. Effective PC shelf life may increase with RT, but platelets can be available sooner with PR due to elimination of bacterial detection, depending on blood center logistics.","[Prioli, Katherine M.; Pizzi, Laura T.] Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Hlth Outcomes Policy & Econ, 160 Frelinghuysen Rd,Suite 417, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Karp, Julie Katz; Herman, Jay H.] Thomas Jefferson Univ Hosp, Dept Pathol Anat & Cell Biol, 111 South 11th St, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; [Lyons, Nina M.] Thomas Jefferson Univ, 901 Walnut St,Suite 901, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; [Chrebtow, Vera] Cerus Corp, Global Mkt & Commun, 2550 Stanwell Dr, Concord, CA 94520 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Jefferson University; Jefferson University; Cerus Corporation,"Pizzi, LT (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Hlth Outcomes Policy & Econ, 160 Frelinghuysen Rd,Suite 417, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",katherine.prioli@rutgers.edu; julie.karp@jefferson.edu; nlyons628@gmail.com; vchrebtow@cerus.com; jay.herman@jefferson.edu; laura.pizzi@rutgers.edu,,"Prioli, Katherine/0000-0003-3987-1738; Karp, Julie/0000-0002-5970-4585",Cerus Corporation,Cerus Corporation,This work was supported by a Grant from Cerus Corporation.,,41,15,15,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Subjective probabilities are mathematically realized in the framework of quantum probability (QP). Utility functions are borrowed from the classical decision theory. But in the model they are represented not only by their values. Heuristically one can say that each value ui u(x(i)) is surrounded by a cloud of information related to the event (A, x(i)). An agent processes this information by using the rules of quantum information and QP. This process is very complex; it combines counterfactual reasoning for comparison between preferences for different outcomes of lotteries which are in general complementary. These comparisons induce interference type effects (constructive or destructive). The decision process is mathematically represented by the comparison operator and the outcome of this process is determined by the sign of the value of corresponding quadratic form on the belief state. This operational process can be decomposed into a few subprocesses. Each of them can be formally treated as a comparison of subjective expected utilities and interference factors (the latter express, in particular, risks related to lottery selection). The main aim of this paper is to analyze the mathematical structure of these processes in the most general situation: representation of lotteries by noncommuting operators. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This paper revisits the GSC versus GSS comparison by establishing a novel connection between them. We show through a network perspective that, when the strategy set of each player is the product of some linearly ordered sets that are order isomorphic to subsets of the real space, every GSC can be embedded into a GSS, such that the set of pure strategy Nash equilibria of the former is a projection of that of the latter. In comparison, no GSS with multiple pure strategy Nash equilibria can be embedded into any GSC. In this sense, the class of GSS is broader than the class of GSC. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed to identify and analyze evidence supporting the use of the emerging magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) compared to alternative stimulatory and ablative interventions for the treatment of medication-refractory essential tremor: radiofrequency thalamotomy, unilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS), and stereotactic radiosurgery. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify clinical, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and economic evidence for each intervention. Because of the lack of comparative evidence captured, a feasibility assessment was performed to determine possible comparisons between interventions, and newly established matching-adjusted indirect comparison and simulated treatment comparison techniques were used to conduct a comparison between unilateral DBS aggregate data and MRgFUS individual patient data. Results: The systematic literature review identified 1,559 records, and screening yielded 46 relevant articles. The captured studies demonstrated that radiofrequency thalamotomy, DBS, stereotactic radiosurgery, and MRgFUS all exhibit clinical efficacy, with variation in onset and duration of tremor relief, and are each associated with a unique safety profile. The matching-adjusted indirect comparison and simulated treatment comparison results demonstrated no evidence of a difference in efficacy (measured by Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor Total) and HRQoL (measured by Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor Part C) outcomes between MRgFUS and unilateral DBS in the short term (<= 12 months). Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence that MRgFUS could elicit similar short-term tremor- and HRQoL-related benefits to DBS, the current standard of care, and allowed for the first robust statistical comparison between these interventions.","[Langford, Bryony E.; Ridley, Christian J.

Methods: A representative sample aged 17 years and older was recruited from the Indonesian general population by stratified quota sampling with respect to residence, sex, and age. Trained interviewers conducted computer-assisted face-to-face interviews using the EuroQol valuation technology. Each respondent valued 10 health states using C-TTO and 7 pairs of health states in a DCE exercise. The retest interview was conducted after 2 weeks by the same interviewer. The Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test, intraclass correlation coefficient, and multilevel regression were applied in comparing the C-TTO test and retest data. For DCE, the analysis of proportions was used. Results: A total of 226 respondents with characteristics similar to the Indonesian population completed the retest interview. For C-TTO, 82 (95.3%) of 86 health states had no significant mean value differences between test and retest. The mean value of the second test was statistically significantly higher than that of the first test by 0.042. For DCE, 72.5% of responses were identical. DCE retest showed a different pattern concerning the relative importance of the dimensions, whereas the C-TTO remained the same. Conclusions: C-TTO is stable over time, whereas in DCE the relative values of the dimensions shift. The results support the use of the C-TTO, in particular the Indonesian EQ-5D-5L value set, and suggest a critical examination of the reliability of DCE results over time.","[Purba, Fredrick Dermawan; Hunfeld, Joke A.

We use 2005-2013 data on Medicare beneficiaries receiving post-acute care (PAC) in the U.S. to examine integration between hospitals and the two most common post-acute care settings: skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and home health agencies (HHA), using two measures of integration formal vertical integration and informal integration representing preferential relationships between providers without formal relationships. Our identification strategy is twofold. First, we use longitudinal models with a fixed effect for each hospital-PAC pair in a market to test how changes in integration impact patient outcomes. Second, we use an instrumental variable approach to account for patient selection into integrated providers. We find that vertical integration between hospitals and SNFs increases Medicare payments and reduces rehospitalization rates. However, vertical integration between hospitals and HHAs has little effect, nor does informal integration between hospitals and either PAC setting. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

Methods for obtaining such estimates include constant uptake estimates based on expert opinion or analogous technologies and on extrapolation from initial data points using parametric curves-but remain divorced from established diffusion theory and modeling. We propose an approach to obtaining diffusion estimates using experts' beliefs calibrated to an established diffusion model to address this methodologic gap. Methods: We performed an elicitation of experts' beliefs on future diffusion of a new preterm birth screening illustrative case study technology. The elicited quantities were chosen such that they could be calibrated to yield the parameters of the Bass model of new product growth, which was chosen based on a review of the diffusion literature. Results: With the elicitation of only three quantities per diffusion curve, our approach enabled us to quantify uncertainty about diffusion of the new technology in different scenarios. Pooled results showed that the attainable number of adoptions was predicted to be relatively low compared with what was thought possible. Further research evidence improved the attainable number of adoptions only slightly but resulted in greater speed of diffusion. Conclusions: The proposed approach of eliciting experts' beliefs about diffusion and informing the Bass model has the potential to fill the methodologic gap evident in value of implementation and research, as well as budget impact and some cost-effectiveness analyses.","[Grimm, Sabine E.] Maastricht Univ, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Med Technol Assessment, Sch Publ Hlth & Primary Care, Med Ctr, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Stevens, John W.; Dixon, Simon] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",Maastricht University; University of Sheffield,"Grimm, SE (通讯作者)，Sch Publ Hlth & Primary Care CAPHRI, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Med Technol Assessment, Oxford Bldg,P Debyelaan 25,POB 5800, NL-6202 AZ Maastricht, Netherlands.",sabine.grimm@mumc.nl,"Grimm, Sabine Elisabeth/HSE-7402-2023","Grimm, Sabine Elisabeth/0000-0002-2175-7999; Dixon, Simon/0000-0001-7394-7009","Department of Health's Policy Research Unit in Economic Evaluation of Health and Care Interventions, a UK government agency","Department of Health's Policy Research Unit in Economic Evaluation of Health and Care Interventions, a UK government agency","Financial support for this study was provided by a grant from the Department of Health's Policy Research Unit in Economic Evaluation of Health and Care Interventions, a UK government agency.

We show that even under random assignment only the instantaneous average treatment effect is point identified. Since treated and control units drop out at different rates, randomization only ensures the comparability of treatment and controls at the time of randomization, so that long-run average treatment effects are not point identified. Instead, we derive bounds on these average effects. Our bounds do not impose (semi)parametric restrictions, for example, proportional hazards. We also explore assumptions such as monotone treatment response, common shocks and positively correlated outcomes that tighten the bounds. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

An updated overview of the economic burden of CVD in T2DM has not been presented to date. Objective: To systematically review published articles describing the costs associated with treating CVD in people with T2DM. Methods: Two reviewers searched MEDLINE, Embase, and abstracts from scientific meetings to identify original research published between 2007 and 2017, with no restrictions on language. Studies reporting direct costs at either a macro level (e.g., burden of illness for a country) or a micro level (e.g., cost incurred by one patient) were included. Extracted costs were inflated to 2016 values using local consumer price indexes, converted into US dollars, and presented as cost per patient per year. Results: Of 81 identified articles, 24 were accepted for analysis, of which 14 were full articles and 10 abstracts. Cardiovascular comorbidities in patients with T2DM incurred a significant burden at both the population and patient levels. From a population level, CVD costs contributed between 20% and 49% of the total direct costs of treating T2DM. The median annual costs per patient for CVD, coronary artery disease, heart failure, and stroke were, respectively, 112%, 107%, 59%, and 322% higher compared with those for T2DM patients without CVD. On average, treating patients with CVD and T2DM resulted in a cost increase ranging from $3418 to $9705 compared with treating patients with T2DM alone. Conclusions: Globally, CVD has a substantial impact on direct medical costs of T2DM at both the patient and population levels.","[Einarson, Thomas R.] Univ Toronto, Leslie Dan Fac Pharm, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Acs, Annabel; Ludwig, Craig] Last Mile, Holte, Denmark; [Panton, Ulrik H.] Novo Nordisk AS, Soborg, Denmark",University of Toronto; Novo Nordisk,"Ludwig, C (通讯作者)，Last Mile, Lyngby Hovedgade 10C, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",cl@last-mile.dk,,,"Novo Nordisk, Soborg, Denmark","Novo Nordisk, Soborg, Denmark","This research was funded by Novo Nordisk, Soborg, Denmark.",,63,165,183,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL,2018,21.0,7.0,,,,,881,890,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.12.019,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GM6VJ,30005761.0,hybrid,Y,N,2024-03-10,WOS:000438314900016,0

This paper proposes a two-step indirect inference approach that disentangles the estimation of the model's macro-economic dynamics and the investor's preference parameters. A Monte Carlo study explores the feasibility and efficiency of the estimation strategy. We apply the method to recent U.S. data and provide a critical reassessment of the long-run risk model's ability to reconcile the real economy and financial markets. This two-step indirect inference approach is potentially useful for the econometric analysis of other prominent consumption-based asset pricing models that are equally difficult to estimate.

The central limit theorems on the test statistics with and without perturbation are established under the null hypothesis that the factor loading matrix is constant as time evolves. The tests perform well in size and power. Interestingly, the test statistic without perturbation converges at a rate that depends not only on the sample size but also on the dimension through the cross-sectional dependence of the residual process, which is a distinctive feature that contrasts with the low-dimensional setting. Extensive numerical studies, including Monte Carlo simulations and real data analysis, validate the performance of our test. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In a stationary equilibrium as derived by Baron and Ferejohn (1989), the proposer offers one third times the discount factor of the surplus to a second player and allocates no payoff to the third player, a proposal which is accepted without delay. Laboratory experiments show various deviations from this equilibrium, where different offers are typically made and delay may occur before acceptance. We address the issue to what extent these findings are compatible with subgame perfect equilibrium and characterize the set of subgame perfect equilibrium payoffs for any value of the discount factor. We show that for any proposal in the interior of the space of possible agreements there exists a discount factor such that the proposal is made and accepted. We characterize the values of the discount factor for which equilibria with one-period delay exist. We show that any amount of equilibrium delay is possible and we construct subgame perfect equilibria such that arbitrary long delay occurs with probability one. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

They may help addicted smokers to consume nicotine in a less harmful manner or to quit tobacco cigarettes entirely, but these products may also entice youth into smoking. This controversy complicates e-cigarette regulation as any regulation may lead to health improvements for some populations, and health declines for other populations. Using data from 2007 to 2016, we examine factors that are plausibly linked with U.S. state e-cigarette regulations. We find that less conservative states are more likely to regulate e-cigarettes and that states with stronger tobacco lobbies are less likely to regulate e-cigarettes. This information can help policymakers as they determine how best to promote public health through regulation.","[Maclean, Johanna Catherine; Oney, Melissa] Temple Univ, 1301 Cecil B Moore Ave,Ritter Annex 869, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Marti, Joachim] Univ Lausanne, Inst Social & Prevent Med IUMSP, Ctr Hosp Univ Vaudois, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Sindelar, Jody] Yale Univ, Lab Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, New Haven, CT USA; [Maclean, Johanna Catherine; Sindelar, Jody] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Maclean, Johanna Catherine; Sindelar, Jody] Inst Labor Econ, Bonn, Germany",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; University of Lausanne; Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV); Yale University; National Bureau of Economic Research; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Maclean, JC (通讯作者)，Temple Univ, 1301 Cecil B Moore Ave,Ritter Annex 869, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",catherine.maclean@temple.edu,"Marti, Joachim/C-5141-2016","Marti, Joachim/0000-0001-5763-3704",Center for Tobacco Products [P50DA036151]; National Institute on Drug Abuse [P50DA036151]; Food and Drug Administration,Center for Tobacco Products; National Institute on Drug Abuse(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)); Food and Drug Administration(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesUS Food & Drug Administration (FDA)),"Center for Tobacco Products, Grant/Award Number: P50DA036151; National Institute on Drug Abuse, Grant/Award Number: P50DA036151; Food and Drug Administration",,38,8,9,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,MAY,2018,27.0,5.0,,,,,897,907,,10.1002/hec.3642,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GB3YG,29468781.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428996100009,0

This paper provides a novel theoretical framework where the orientation of nurses' motivationintrinsic versus extrinsicis taken into account, and the precise distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation is delineated on the basis of self-determination and person-environment fit theories.

Results show that although the information presented guided participants' decisions, there were also several processing biases at work. Evidence was found of (a) top-to-bottom, (b) left-to-right, and (c) first-to-last order biases. Experimental factorswhether attributes are defined as best or worst, choice task complexity, and attribute orderingalso influence information processing.

To say that an investment is cost-effective but not affordable must mean that the (implicit or explicit) threshold used to judge cost-effectiveness does not reflect the scale and value of the opportunity costs. Existing empirical estimates of health opportunity costs are based on cross-sectional variation in expenditure and mortality outcomes by program budget categories (PBCs) and do not reflect the likely effect of nonmarginal budget impacts on health opportunity costs. The UK Department of Health regularly updates the needs-based target allocation of resources to local areas of the National Health Service (NHS), creating two subgroups of local areas (those under target allocation and those over). These data provide the opportunity to explore how the effects of changes in health care expenditure differ with available resources. We use 2008-2009 data to evaluate two econometric approaches to estimation and explore a range of criteria for accepting subgroup specific effects for differences in expenditure and outcome elasticities across the 23 PBCs. Our results indicate that health opportunity costs arising from an investment imposing net increases in expenditure are underestimated unless account is taken of likely nonmarginal effects. They also indicate the benefits (reduced health opportunity costs or increased value-based price of a technology) of being able to smooth these nonmarginal budget impacts by health care systems borrowing against future budgets or from manufacturers offering mortgage type arrangements.

It has been argued that such donors should prioritise interventions based on their cost-effectiveness, that is to say, the ratio of costs to benefits. Against this, we argue that the donor should fund not the most cost-effective interventions, but rather interventions which are just cost-ineffective for the country, thus encouraging the country to contribute its own domestic resources to the fight against disease. We demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can be justified within the context of a model of the problem as a leader-follower game, in which a donor chooses to subsidise interventions which are implemented by a country. We argue that the decision rule we propose provides a basis for the allocation of aid money which is efficient, fair and sustainable. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This model refers to the principles of sustainable development in relation to business, governmental and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as well as universities. The maximum concentration on the construction of trust-based relations with stakeholders, as well as their skillful management should be an integral part of the business strategy of each organization, including universities. The aim of the article is to analyze the perception of social responsibility by two selected universities, the public SGH Warsaw School of Economics and the private WSB University in Wroclaw. The research area is the awareness of stakeholders within the scope of building the strategy of social responsibility of higher education institutions. Based on the research carried out by the authors, the following hypothesis was formulated: dialogue and cooperation between stakeholders is the basis of the university social responsibility strategy. Based on preliminary research, the following conclusions can be formulated: when incorporating the social responsibility strategy into their structures, higher education institutions in Poland should begin the process by paying attention to internal relations. This can be inferred from the assumptions of the model developed on the basis of research. The organization is able to achieve further levels of advancement of the social responsibility concept with a solid foundation only.","[Brdulak, Halina] SGH Warsaw Sch Econ Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland; [Brdulak, Anna] WSB Univ Wroclaw, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Brdulak, H (通讯作者)，SGH Warsaw Sch Econ Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.",halina.brdulak@sgh.waw.pl; anna.brdulak@wsb.wroclaw.pl,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,119,128,,,,,,10,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BP4BP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000550734100014,0

Consequently, many recent researches have put great emphasis on study of total debt service ratio (TDS) as one of the early warning indicators for financial crises. Accurate TDS forecasting can have a huge impact on effective financial management as a country can monitor the signal of financial crisis from a TDS's future trend. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to find the modeling to forecast the growth of TDS. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models tends to be the most popular forecasting method with indispensable requirement of data stationarity. Meanwhile, State Space model (SSM) allows us to examine directly from original data without any data transformation for stationarity. Furthermore, it can model both structural changes or sudden jumps. The empirical result shows that the SSM expresses lower prediction errors with respect to RMSE and MAE in comparison with ARIMA.","[Navapan, Kobpongkit; Boonyakunakorn, Petchaluck; Sriboonchitta, Songsak] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Econ, Chiang Mai 52000, Thailand; [Sriboonchitta, Songsak] Chiang Mai Univ, Ctr Excellence Econometr, Chiang Mai 52000, Thailand",Chiang Mai University; Chiang Mai University,"Boonyakunakorn, P (通讯作者)，Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Econ, Chiang Mai 52000, Thailand.",kobpongkit.nav@gmail.com; petchaluckecon@gmail.com; songsakecon@gmail.com,,"yamaka, woraphon/0000-0002-0787-1437",,,,,13,1,1,0,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1860-949X,1860-9503,978-3-319-70942-0; 978-3-319-70941-3,STUD COMPUT INTELL,,,2018,753.0,,,,,,492,501,,10.1007/978-3-319-70942-0_35,0.0,,,10,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BL5QD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452452200035,0

For those with abdominal stoma surgeries, altered perceptions amplified by peristomal skin condition can increase health burdens. OBJECTIVES: To assess health utility and health-related quality of life in an adult US ostomy sample in the presence of three levels of peristomal skin condition: intact, moderately compromised, and severely compromised. METHODS: The short form 36 health survey version 2, a generic health survey incorporating the six-dimensional health state short form preference-based utility index, was chosen to assess the sample. Analysis of covariance adjusted for age and time from surgery was used. RESULTS: The six-dimensional health state short form utilities for those with intact skin and physical component summary (PCS) levels indicating no physical limitations varied significantly from those with severely compromised skin and indicating the greatest degree of physical limitation (0.833 vs. 0.527). Peristomal skin condition decreases were associated with health utility decreases across all levels of the PCS. Because peristomal skin conditions are intermittent, the analysis presents quality-adjusted life-days (QALDs) per month. Ostomates with intact skin and PCS levels indicating no physical limitations demonstrated significant differences from those with severe skin condition and indicating the greatest degree of physical limitations (26.5 d/mo vs. 15.8 d/mo). As peristomal skin condition worsened, QALDs decreased across all levels of the PCS. A minimally important expected value of health was estimated to be an increase of 2.18 QALDs/mo. CONCLUSIONS: Successful treatment from a clinical perspective is more than the elimination of conditions-it is also a return of quality time to an individual.

Applying appropriate estimation techniques, the results show that the economic growth represented by GDP increments is supported by exports and exchange rate and also the regulation of the CZK/EUR parity evinces a positive effect. The incoming FDI do not affect significantly neither GDP nor exports.

This enables researchers to classify, group and rank a large textual corpus - a useful feature for scholars who study all forms of written text. However, these underlying conditions differ in respect to the way how interpretively-oriented social scientists approach textual data. They aim to understand the meaning of text by heuristically using known categorisations, concepts and other formal methods. More importantly, they are primarily interested in documents that are incomprehensible with our current knowledge because these documents offer a chance to formulate new empirically-grounded typifications, hypotheses, and theories. In this paper, therefore, I propose for a text mining technique with different aims and procedures. It includes a shift away from methods of grouping and clustering the whole text corpus to a process that sorts out uncategorisable documents. Such an approach will be demonstrated using a simple example. While more elaborate text mining techniques might become tools for more complex tasks, the given example just presents the essence of a possible working principle. As such, it supports social inquiries that search for and examine unfamiliar patterns and regularities.","[Philipps, Axel] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Sociol, Hannover, Germany; [Philipps, Axel] Leibniz Univ Hannover, LCSS, Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover; Leibniz University Hannover,"Philipps, A (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Sociol, Hannover, Germany.;Philipps, A (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, LCSS, Hannover, Germany.",,"Philipps, Axel/D-4673-2011","Philipps, Axel/0000-0003-0834-6025",,,,,20,1,1,0,2,UNIV POLITECNICA VALENCIA,VALENCIA,"CAMINO VERA S-N, VALENCIA, 46022, SPAIN",,,978-84-9048-689-4,,,,2018,,,,,,,19,27,,10.4995/CARMA2018.2018.8301,0.0,,,9,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BN2ZN,,"Green Published, Bronze",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000477974500003,0

The main theme of the paper is the well-known problem of testing hypothesis on admissibility of the population total of accounting errors amounts. In auditing, some population elements contains no errors, whereas other population elements contains errors of varying amounts. Usually, statistical inference considered in auditing is focused on estimation of the total or the mean error amount. The inference is based on data observed in samples drawn from a population of documents. An audit sample delivers two pieces of information: the book (recorded) amount and the audited (correct or true) amount. Let us note that a value of the book amount can be a sum of smaller book amounts. The book values will be treated as observation of a random variable distributed according to mixture of two probability distribution. The mixing coefficient is equal to the proportion of the items with non-zero errors amounts. The well-known method of moments is proposed to estimate mixtures of probability distribution. It let us construct some statistic to test the outlined hypothesis. We use the Monte Carlo method in estimating the power of a test.","[Sitek, Grzegorz] Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Stat Econometr & Math, Fac Management, Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Sitek, G (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Stat Econometr & Math, Fac Management, Katowice, Poland.",grzegorz.sitek@ue.katowice.pl,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,"MATFYZPRESS PUBL HOUSE, FAC MATH & PHYSICS",PRAHA 8,"CHARLES UNIV PRAGUE, SOKOLOVSKA 83, PRAHA 8, 186 75, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7378-372-3,,,,2018,,,,,,,482,486,,,,,,5,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BO2PI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000507455300083,0

This is one of the first studies to use genetics as an instrument for BMI and to examine the causal relationship between weight and depression. Results are mixed; I find a meaningful and significant effect of weight on suicidal ideation but no effects on counseling and an index of depression.

Previous research has shown that, without competition, physicians deviate from patient-optimal treatment under payment systems like capitation and fee-for-service. Although competition might reduce these distortions, physicians usually interact with each other repeatedly over time and only a fraction of patients switches providers at all. Both patterns might prevent competition to work in the desired direction. To analyze the behavioral effects of competition, we develop a theoretical benchmark that is then tested in a controlled laboratory experiment. Experimental conditions vary physician payment and patient characteristics. Real patients benefit from provision decisions made in the experiment. Our results reveal that, in line with the theoretical prediction, introducing competition can reduce overprovision and underprovision, respectively. The observed effects depend on patient characteristics and the payment system, though. Tacit collusion is observed and particularly pronounced with fee-for-service payment, but it appears to be less frequent than in related experimental research on price competition.","[Brosig-Koch, Jeannette; Kokot, Johanna] Univ Duisburg Essen, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Hlth Econ Res Ctr CINCH, Essen, Germany; [Hehenkamp, Burkhard] Paderborn Univ, Fac Business Adm & Econ, Paderborn, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen; University of Paderborn,"Brosig-Koch, J (通讯作者)，Res Ctr CINCH, Fac Econ & Business Adm & Hlth Econ, Berliner Pl 6-8, D-45127 Essen, Germany.",,"Hehenkamp, Burkhard/JKJ-5030-2023","Hehenkamp, Burkhard/0000-0002-0128-7264; Brosig-Koch, Jeannette/0000-0003-4420-0787; Kokot, Johanna/0000-0002-2267-9785","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [BR 2346/2-1, SFB 901]",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: BR 2346/2-1 and SFB 901",,52,9,11,2,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,DEC,2017,26.0,,,3.0,SI,,6,20,,10.1002/hec.3583,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,FT6WK,29285872.0,"Green Submitted, Green Published, Bronze",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423294300002,0

However, it has been shown that there is disparity between the valuation of the impact of hypothetical conditions on health and the reported health by those experiencing them. Patients' adaptation to health states is among the most common explanations for this discrepancy. Being diagnosed with a disease appears to affect individual perception of health over time so that better subjective health may be reported over a disease trajectory. This paper examines adaptation to health states using a longitudinal dataset. We use four waves of the British Cohort Study (BCS70), which tracks a sample of British individuals since birth in 1970 and contains information on self-assessed health (SAH), morbidity, and socioeconomic characteristics. We implement a dynamic ordered probit model controlling for health state dependence. Results are supportive of the existence of adaptation: Time since diagnosis has a positive impact on SAH. Moreover, adaptation happens over relatively long durations. We do not find significant results proving different adaptation paths for patients reporting prior better SAH. The analysis by specific conditions generally supports the existence of adaptation, but results are statistically significant only for a subset of conditions.","[Cubi-Molla, Patricia] Off Hlth Econ, London, England; [Jofre-Bonet, Mireia; Serra-Sastre, Victoria] City Univ London, Dept Econ, Northampton Sq, London EC1V 0HB, England",City University London,"Serra-Sastre, V (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Dept Econ, Northampton Sq, London EC1V 0HB, England.",v.serra-sastre@city.ac.uk,"Cubi-Molla, Patricia/K-4973-2015; Jofre-Bonet, Mireia/V-8673-2019","Cubi-Molla, Patricia/0000-0002-2803-7337; Jofre-Bonet, Mireia/0000-0002-2055-2166; Jofre-Bonet, Mireia/0000-0001-6168-0407",,,,,31,8,8,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,DEC,2017,26.0,12.0,,,,,1826,1843,,10.1002/hec.3509,0.0,,,18,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,FT4AW,28425680.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423095100046,0

A Comparison with Discrete Choice Experiments,HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,best-worst scaling; discrete choice experiment; health utility; stated preferences,QUALITY-OF-LIFE; SOCIAL CARE; PREFERENCES; UTILITIES; VALUES; INDEX,"Health utility indices (HUIs) are widely used in economic evaluation. The best-worst scaling (BWS) method is being used to value dimensions of HUIs. However, little is known about the properties of this method. This paper investigates the validity of the BWS method to develop HUI, comparing it to another ordinal valuation method, the discrete choice experiment (DCE). Using a parametric approach, we find a low level of concordance between the two methods, with evidence of preference reversals. BWS responses are subject to decision biases, with significant effects on individuals' preferences. Non parametric tests indicate that BWS data has lower stability, monotonicity and continuity compared to DCE data, suggesting that the BWS provides lower quality data. As a consequence, for both theoretical and technical reasons, practitioners should be cautious both about using the BWS method to measure health-related preferences, and using HUI based on BWS data. Given existing evidence, it seems that the DCE method is a better method, at least because its limitations (and measurement properties) have been extensively researched.

We compare a static version, where average effects of care provision in a certain year on later labor market outcomes are estimated, to a partly dynamic version where the effects of up to three consecutive years of care provision are analyzed. Our results suggest that there are significant initial negative effects of informal care provision on the probability to work full-time. The reduction in the probability to work full-time by 4 percentage points (or 2.4-5.0 if we move from point to partial identification) is persistent over time. Short-run effects on hourly wages are zero but we find considerable long-run wage penalties. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Chandramouli, S; Sethuraman, J",,,,"Chandramouli, Shyam; Sethuraman, Jay",,,Groupstrategyproofness of the egalitarian mechanism for constrained rationing problems,MATHEMATICAL SOCIAL SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PREFERENCES,"Motivated by applications in many economic environments, Bochet et al. (2010) generalize the classic rationing model (Sprumont 1991) as follows: there is a moneyless market, in which a non-storable, homogeneous commodity is reallocated between agents with single-peaked preferences. Agents are either suppliers or demanders. Transfers between a supplier and a demander are feasible only if they are linked, and the links form an arbitrary bipartite graph. Information about individual preferences is private, and so is information about feasible links: an agent may unilaterally close one of her links if it is in her interest to do so. For this problem they propose the egalitarian transfer solution, which equalizes the net transfers of rationed agents as much as permitted by the bilateral constraints. Furthermore, they show that the egalitarian mechanism elicits a truthful report of both preferences and links. In the variant where demanders are not strategic but demands need to be exactly met Bochet et al. (2013), they propose a similar mechanism for which truthfully reporting the peaks is a dominant strategy, but truthful reporting of links is not. The key contribution of the paper is a comprehensive study of the egalitarian mechanism with respect to manipulation by a coalition of agents. Our main result is that the egalitarian mechanism is group strategyproof : no coalition of agents can (weakly) benefit from jointly misreporting their peaks. Furthermore, we show that the egalitarian mechanism cannot be manipulated by misreporting links or by misreporting peaks by any coalition of suppliers (or any coalition of demanders) in the model where both the suppliers and demanders are agents. Our proofs shed light on the structure of the two models and simplify some of the earlier proofs of strategyproofness. An implication of our results is that the well known algorithm of Megiddo (1977) to compute a lexicographically optimal flow in a network is group strategyproof with respect to the source capacities and sink capacities.

In this paper, we explore the regional variation in subsidy schemes in Switzerland, designed as either in kind or cash transfers, to study their impact on the choice of health insurance deductibles. Using health survey data and a difference-in-differences methodology, we find that in-kind transfers increase the likelihood of choosing a low deductible plan by approximately 4 percentage points (or 7%). Our results indicate that the response to in-kind transfers is strongest among women, middle-aged and unmarried individuals, which we explain by differences in risk-taking behavior, health status, financial constraints, health insurance and financial literacy. We discuss our results in the light of potential extra-marginal effects on the demand for health care services, which are however not supported by our data. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we investigate envy-free divisions in the setting where there are multiple players in each interested party. While all players in a party share the same set of resources, each player has her own preferences. Under additive valuations drawn randomly from probability distributions, we show that when all groups contain an equal number of players, a welfare maximizing allocation is likely to be envy-free if the number of items exceeds the total number of players by a logarithmic factor. On the other hand, an envy-free allocation is unlikely to exist if the number of items is less than the total number of players. In addition, we show that a simple truthful mechanism, namely the random assignment mechanism, yields an allocation that satisfies the weaker notion of approximate envy-freeness with high probability.

In this paper, we distinguish between three types of learning when identifying overall learning curves: economies of scale, learning from cumulative experience, and human capital depreciation. In addition, we approach the question of how treating more patients with specific characteristics predicts provider performance. To soften collinearity problems, we explore the use of least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression as a variable selection method and Theil-Goldberger mixed estimation to augment the available information. We use data from the Belgian Transcatheter Aorta Valve Implantation (TAVI) registry, containing information on the first 860 TAVI procedures in Belgium. We find that treating an additional TAVI patient is associated with an increase in the probability of 2-year survival by about 0.16%-points. For adverse events like renal failure and stroke, we find that an extra day between procedures is associated with an increase in the probability for these events by 0.12%-points and 0.07%-points, respectively. Furthermore, we find evidence for positive learning effects from physicians' experience with defibrillation, treating patients with hypertension, and the use of certain types of replacement valves during the TAVI procedure.","[Van Gestel, Raf] Univ Antwerp, Dept Econ, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Mueller, Tobias] Univ Luzern, Seminar Hlth Econ, Frohburgstr 3, CH-6002 Luzern, Switzerland; [Bosmans, Johan] Univ Antwerp, Dept Cardiol, Wilrijkstr 10, B-2650 Edegem, Belgium",University of Antwerp; University of Lucerne; University of Antwerp,"Van Gestel, R (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Dept Econ, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",raf.vangestel@uantwerpen.be,"Van Gestel, Raf/AAR-8473-2021","Van Gestel, Raf/0000-0002-2766-1920",,,,,24,1,1,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,SEP,2017,26.0,9.0,,,,,1094,1109,,10.1002/hec.3505,0.0,,,16,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,FF8BJ,28449316.0,"Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000409239800004,0

The asymptotic properties (consistency and rates) of the corresponding estimators have been studied in Forni et al. (2004). Those estimators, however, rely on Brillinger's concept of dynamic principal components, and thus involve two-sided filters, which leads to rather poor forecasting;performances. No such problem arises with estimators based on standard (static) principal components, which have been dominant in this literature. On the other hand, the consistency of those static estimators requires the assumption that the space spanned by the factors has finite dimension, which severely restricts their generality prohibiting, for instance, autoregressive factor loadings. This paper derives the asymptotic properties of a semiparametric estimator of the loadings and common shocks based on one-sided filters recently proposed by Forni et al., (2015). Consistency and exact rates of convergence are obtained for this estimator, under a general class of GDFMs that does not require a finite-dimensional factor space. A Monte Carlo experiment and an empirical exercise on US macroeconomic data corroborate those theoretical results and demonstrate the excellent performance of those estimators in out-of-sample forecasting.

The paper demonstrates the optimality of cyclical consumption paths in the absence of discounting for the smooth neoclassical growth model.

This phenomenon entails financial issues for host countries. One of these issues are remittances. Remittances produce money flows that can considerably interfere with country micro and macroeconomics. Therefore, the understanding of remittance functioning at global scale is crucial for adopting adequate control policies in areas such as tax evasion, capital flow and money laundering. This work contributes to such understanding by both developing and analyzing a graph modeling approach that describes the interaction, concentration and circular patterns of world-wide remittances. The graph model analyzes degree distribution, vertex degrees and two-vertex cycles and it is constructed from World Bank data. As a result, the remittance graph evidences a power law in the degree distribution, very concentrated producer and receiver remittance communities and large circular flows of remittances.

Based on the fixed-bandwidth asymptotic variance and the pre-asymptotic variance, we propose a heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation robust (HAR) variance estimator that achieves double robustness it is asymptotically valid regardless of whether the temporal dependence is present or not, and whether the kernel smoothing bandwidth is held constant or allowed to decay with the sample size. Using the HAR variance estimator, we construct the studentized test statistic and examine its asymptotic properties under both the fixed-smoothing and increasing-smoothing asymptotics. The fixed-smoothing approximation and the associated convenient t-approximation achieve extra robustness it is asymptotically valid regardless of whether the truncation lag parameter governing the covariance weighting grows at the same rate as or at a slower rate than the sample size. Finally, we suggest a simulation-based calibration approach to choose smoothing parameters that optimize testing oriented criteria. Simulation shows that the proposed procedures work very well in finite samples. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In response to the concerns, an epilepsy-specific preference-based measure (NEWQOL-6D) was developed. The psychometric characteristics of the NEWQOL-6D, however, have not been assessed. Objectives: To investigate the validity and responsiveness of the EQ-5D-3L and the Quality of Life in Newly Diagnosed Epilepsy Instrument-six dimensions (NEWQOL-6D) for use in the assessment of treatments for newly diagnosed focal epilepsy. Methods: The analysis used data from the Standard And New Antiepileptic Drugs trial including patients with focal epilepsy. We assessed convergent validity using correlations, and known-group validity across different epilepsy and general health severity indicators using analysis of variance and effect sizes. The responsiveness of the measures to change over time was assessed using standardized response means. We also assessed agreement between the measures. Results: There was some level of convergence and agreement between the measures in terms of utility score but divergence in the concepts measured by the descriptive systems. Both instruments displayed known-group validity, with significant differences between severity groups, and generally slightly larger effect sizes for the NEWQOL-6D across the epilepsy-specific indicators. Evidence for responsiveness was less clear, with small to moderate standardized response means demonstrating different levels of change across different indicators. Conclusions: There was an overall tendency for the NEWQOL-6D to better reflect differences across groups, but this does not translate into large absolute utility differences. Both the EQ-5D-3L and the NEWQOL-6D show some evidence of validity for providing utility values for economic evaluations in newly diagnosed focal epilepsy.

In particular, we first adapt the wild blocks of blocks bootstrap method suggested for the pre-averaged realized volatility estimator to a general class of estimators of integrated covolatility. We then show the first-order asymptotic validity of this method in the multivariate context with a potential presence of jumps, dependent microstructure noise, irregularly spaced and non-synchronous data. Our results justify using the bootstrap to estimate the covariance matrix of a broad class of covolatility estimators. The bootstrap variance estimator is positive semi definite by construction, an appealing feature that is not always shared by existing variance estimators of the integrated covariance estimator. As an application of our results, we also consider the bootstrap for regression coefficients. We show that the wild blocks of blocks bootstrap, appropriately centered, is able to mimic both the dependence and heterogeneity of the scores. We provide a proof of construction of bootstrap percentile and percentile-t intervals as well as variance estimates in this context. This contrasts the traditional pairs bootstrap which is not able to mimic the score heterogeneity even in the simple case where no microstructure noise is present. Our Monte Carlo simulations show that the wild blocks of blocks bootstrap improve the finite sample properties of the alternative approach based on the Gaussian approximation. We illustrate its practical use on high-frequency equity data. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This offers great promise for people affected by these diseases, but it has also placed stress on the health care system in terms of the growing cost associated with some new interventions. Effort has been taken to create tools to help patients and health care providers assess the value of new medical innovations. These tools may also provide the basis for assessing the price associated with new medical products. Given the growing expenditures in health care, value frameworks present an opportunity to evaluate new therapeutic options in the context of other treatments and potentially lead to a more economically sustainable health care system. In summary, the contribution to meaningful improvements in health outcomes is the primary focus of any assessment of the value of a new intervention. A component of such evaluations, however, should factor in timely access to new products that address an unmet medical need, as well as the magnitude of that beneficial impact. To achieve these goals, value assessment tools should allow for flexibility in clinical end points and trial designs, incorporate patient preferences, and continually evolve as new evidence, practice patterns, and medical progress advance.","[Allen, Jeff D.; Stewart, Mark D.; Roberts, Samantha A.; Sigal, Ellen V.] Friends Canc Res, 1800 M St NW,Suite 1050 South, Washington, DC 20036 USA",,"Allen, JD (通讯作者)，Friends Canc Res, 1800 M St NW,Suite 1050 South, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",jallen@focr.org,,,,,,,13,20,22,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,FEB,2017,20.0,2.0,,,,,283,285,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.11.029,0.0,,,3,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,EO1HX,28237210.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000396450400019,0

Furthermore, cost-utility analyses typically reflect only single perspectives (e.g., individual, business, and societal), further limiting the value for those with different perspectives (patients, providers, payers, producers, and planners the 5Ps). We discuss how models based on multicriteria analyses, which look at problems from many perspectives, can fill this void. Each of the 5Ps can use multicriteria analyses in different ways to aid their decisions. Each perspective may lead to different value measures and outcomes, whereas no single-metric approach (such as cost-utility analysis) can satisfy all these stakeholders. All stakeholders have unique ways to measure value, even if assessing the same health intervention. We illustrate the benefits of this approach by comparing the value of five different hypothetical treatment choices for five hypothetical patients with cancer, each with different preference structures. Nine attributes describe each treatment option. We add a brief discussion regarding the use of these approaches in group-based decisions. We urge that methods to value health interventions embrace the multicriteria approaches that we discuss, because these approaches 1) increase transparency about the decision process, 2) allow flight simulator type evaluation of alternative interventions before actual investment or deployment, 3) help focus efforts to improve data in an efficient manner, 4) at least in some cases help facilitate decision convergence among stakeholders with differing perspectives, and 5) help avoid potential cognitive errors known to impair intuitive judgments.","[Phelps, Charles E.] Univ Rochester, Rochester, NY USA; [Madhavan, Guruprasad] Natl Acad Sci, 2101 Constitut Ave Nw, Washington, DC 20418 USA; [Madhavan, Guruprasad] Natl Acad Engn, Washington, DC 20418 USA; [Madhavan, Guruprasad] Natl Acad Med, Washington, DC USA","University of Rochester; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering & Medicine; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering & Medicine; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering & Medicine","Phelps, CE (通讯作者)，30250 South Highway 1, Gualala, CA 95445 USA.",charles.phelps@rochester.edu,,,,,,,20,26,27,0,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,FEB,2017,20.0,2.0,,,,,251,255,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.11.011,0.0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,EO1HX,28237204.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000396450400013,0

For a conjectured restriction on the parameter, we consider testing the hypothesis that the restriction is satisfied by at least one element of the identified set. We propose using the sieve minimum of a Kolmogorov-Smirnov type statistic as the test statistic, derive its asymptotic distribution, and provide consistent bootstrap critical values. In this way a broad family of restrictions can be consistently tested, making the proposed procedure applicable to testing the model specification and constructing confidence set for any given component or some feature of the parameter. Our methods are robust to partial identification, and allow for the moment functions to be nonsmooth. As an illustration, we apply the proposed inference methods to study the quantile instrumental variable Engel curves for gasoline in Brazil.

Methods: The procedure involved 1) identifying products' key patents as those with a patent term restoration extension (whenever relevant) or otherwise as the first expiring patent listed in the US Food and Drug Administration's patent register, 2) determining whether the key patent had been extended through an associated pediatric extension, 3) identifying other regulatory exclusivities associated with the drug, and 4) categorizing key patents as active ingredient (or extended) patents versus secondary patents. The accuracy and precision of the procedure's predictions were then tested against a database containing the timing of generic entry for 170 top-selling drugs that lost market exclusivity between 2000 and 2012, on the basis of Medicaid data. Results: Overall, the procedure predicted a median market exclusivity period of 12.5 years (interquartile range [IQR] 7.25-14.5) compared with the median actual period of 12.5 years (IQR 8.5-14.75 years). Among the 131 drugs (77%) with active ingredient patents, the median predicted market exclusivity was 12.25 years (IQR 7.5-14.5) compared with a median actual period of 13.0 years (IQR 10.0-14.75). Among the 38 (22%) drugs protected only by secondary patents, the median predicted market exclusivity was 16.0 years (IQR 6.75-19.5), but the median actual market exclusivity was only 8.25 years (IQR 6.25-13.5). Conclusions: The procedure approximated median actual exclusivity with reasonable accuracy and precision for drugs with active ingredient patents, but substantially overestimated exclusivity for drugs with only secondary patents.","[Beall, Reed F.; Darrow, Jonathan J.; Kesselheim, Aaron S.] Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Pharmacoepidemiol & Pharmacoecon, PORTAL,Dept Med, Boston, MA USA",Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Brigham & Women's Hospital,"Beall, RF (通讯作者)，Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, 1620 Tremont St,Suite 3030, Boston, MA 02120 USA.",rbeall@bwh.harvard.edu,"Darrow, J J/R-8365-2019; Kesselheim, Aaron/R-6793-2017","Darrow, J J/0000-0002-7351-4243;",Laura and John Arnold Foundation; Harvard Program in Therapeutic Science; Engelberg Foundation,Laura and John Arnold Foundation; Harvard Program in Therapeutic Science; Engelberg Foundation,This study was funded by the Laura and John Arnold Foundation.

The proposed model can be interpreted as an econometric model of discrete choice with correlated random errors additive on the (latent) utility scale. Behavioral characterization/axiomatization of the model is provided for choice under risk (with expected utility), uncertainty/ambiguity (with subjective expected utility) and intertemporal choice (with additively separable utility that includes constant discounting, quasi-hyperbolic discounting, generalized hyperbolic discounting and liminal discounting as special cases).

The 12-item short form health survey (SF-12) scores are no exception. Data imputation is complicated, because missingness may be partially predicted by the missing data themselves. Objectives: To compare the performance of a Bayesian method for imputing SF-12 data with previously described frequentist imputation methods. Methods: SF-12 data were extracted from a trial assessing continence promotion on health-related quality of life in olderwomen(n = 1052); the data set was split into a model development cohort for creating predictive models and a validation cohort to validate these models. Algorithms were constructed using data from the model development cohort to compute SF-12-related scores (physical health composite scale, the mental health composite scale, and the six-dimensional health state short form utilities). The Bayesian models used missing at random and missing not at random algorithms to impute missing SF-12 answers as categorical data. Comparative models replaced missing data with 0, used the mean weight of the sample, and regressed parameters from sociodemographic predictors. Data randomly deleted from the validation cohort were imputed with each algorithm, and the mean absolute error was used to gauge goodness of fit. Results: Each cohort included 526 persons; mean age was 78.1 +/- 7.8 years. In the model development cohort, 15.6% of the participants had missing data. For the physical health composite scale, the mental health composite scale, and the six-dimensional health state short form utilities, the Bayesian model with missing at random data significantly outperformed all five comparison models, including the Bayesian models with missing not at random data. Conclusions: Bayesian imputation was superior to other previously described methods for computing missing SF-12 data.","[Halme, Alex S.] McGill Univ, Dept Med, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Tannenbaum, Cara] Univ Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada",McGill University; Universite de Montreal,"Tannenbaum, C (通讯作者)，Inst Univ Geriatrie Montreal, Ctr Rech, 4545 Queen Mary Rd, Montreal, PQ H3W 1W5, Canada.",cara.tannenbaum@umontreal.ca,,,European Research Area on Ageing2 program; Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Fonds de la Recherche en Sante du Quebec; Economic and Social Research Council of the United Kingdom; Institut National de Prevention et Education pour la Sante de la France; Agence Regionale de Sante Publique de Poitou-Charentes,European Research Area on Ageing2 program; Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Fonds de la Recherche en Sante du Quebec(Fonds de recherche du Quebec (FRQ)Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Sante (FRQS)); Economic and Social Research Council of the United Kingdom(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Institut National de Prevention et Education pour la Sante de la France; Agence Regionale de Sante Publique de Poitou-Charentes,"Data collection was financed by the European Research Area on Ageing2 program, with joint contributions from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Fonds de la Recherche en Sante du Quebec, the Economic and Social Research Council of the United Kingdom, the Institut National de Prevention et Education pour la Sante de la France, and the Agence Regionale de Sante Publique de Poitou-Charentes.",,23,9,8,1,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2018,21.0,12.0,,,,,1406,1412,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.06.007,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,HC2LE,30502784.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000451632700008,0

The existence of a strictly stationary solution is discussed, for which a necessary and sufficient condition is established. A doubly weighted quantile regression estimation procedure is introduced, where the first set of weights ensures the asymptotic normality of the estimator and the second set improves its efficiency through balancing individual quantile regression estimators across multiple quantile levels. Bayesian information criteria are proposed for model selection, and two goodness-of-fit tests are constructed to check the adequacy of the fitted conditional mean and conditional scale structures. Simulation studies indicate that the proposed inference tools perform well in finite samples, and an empirical example illustrates the usefulness of the new model. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Specific objectives were to 1) describe the methodologies used and 2) identify the strengths and limitations of the studies. Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE and Embase databases for studies that compared predictions of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of vaccination of two or more mathematical models. We categorized studies into two groups on the basis of their data source for comparison (previously published results or new simulation results) and performed a qualitative synthesis of study conclusions. Results: We identified 115 eligible articles (only 5% generated new simulations from the reviewed models) examining the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of vaccination against 14 pathogens (69% of studies examined human papillomavirus, influenza, and/or pneumococcal vaccines). The goal of most of studies was to summarize evidence for vaccination policy decisions, and cost-effectiveness was the most frequent outcome examined. Only 33%, 25%, and 3% of studies followed a systematic approach to identify eligible studies, assessed the quality of studies, and performed a quantitative synthesis of results, respectively. A greater proportion of model comparisons using published studies followed a systematic approach to identify eligible studies and to assess their quality, whereas more studies using new simulations performed quantitative synthesis of results and identified drivers of model conclusions. Most comparative modeling studies concluded that vaccination was cost-effective. Conclusions: Given the variability in methods used to conduct/report comparative modeling studies, guidelines are required to enhance their quality and transparency and to provide better tools for decision making.","[Drolet, Melanie; Benard, Elodie; Brisson, Marc] Univ Laval, Ctr Rech CHU Quebec, Axe Sante Populat & Prat Optimales Sante, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Jit, Mark] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London, England; [Jit, Mark] Publ Hlth England, Modelling & Econ Unit, London, England; [Hutubessy, Raymond] World Hlth Org, Geneva, Switzerland; [Brisson, Marc] Univ Laval, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Brisson, Marc] Imperial Coll, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London, England",Laval University; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; Public Health England; World Health Organization; Laval University; Imperial College London,"Brisson, M (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Ctr Rech CHU Quebec, Axe Sante Populat & Prat Optimales Sante, Hop St Sacrement, 1050 Chemin Ste Foy, Quebec City, PQ G1S 4L8, Canada.",marc.brisson@crchudequebec.ulaval.ca,"Jit, Mark/HDM-7797-2022","Jit, Mark/0000-0001-6658-8255",World Health Organization; foundation scheme grant from the Canadian Institute of Health Research [FDN-143283],World Health Organization(World Health Organization); foundation scheme grant from the Canadian Institute of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),This work was supported by the World Health Organization and a foundation scheme grant from the Canadian Institute of Health Research (grant no.

We investigate the effect of changes in hours worked by GPs on waiting times in primary care using the Medicine in Australia: Balancing Employment and Life longitudinal survey of Australian doctors. We estimate GP fixed effects models for waiting time and use family circumstances to instrument for GP's hours worked. We find that a 10% reduction in hours worked increases average patient waiting time by 12%. Our findings highlight the importance of GPs' labor supply at the intensive margin in determining the length of time patients must wait to see their doctor.,"[Swami, Megha; Scott, Anthony] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Swami, Megha; Williams, Jenny] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Gravelle, Hugh] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England",University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne; University of York - UK,"Swami, M (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Fac Business & Econ, 111 Barry St, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia.",mswami@student.unimelb.edu.au,"Scott, Anthony/E-6636-2010","Scott, Anthony/0000-0002-2851-5378; Williams, Jenny/0000-0002-9084-0446; Gravelle, Hugh/0000-0002-7753-4233",National Health and Medical Research Council; University of Melbourne,National Health and Medical Research Council(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); University of Melbourne(University of Melbourne),"National Health and Medical Research Council; University of Melbourne, Grant/Award Number: Melbourne Research Scholarship",,73,12,13,1,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,OCT,2018,27.0,10.0,,,,,1513,1532,,10.1002/hec.3782,0.0,,,20,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GS6LC,29920838.0,"Green Published, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000443806600009,0

Under ellipticity of the conditional distribution, asymptotic theory for the estimation of the conditional Value-at-Risk (VaR) is developed. An alternative method - the Filtered Historical Simulation - which does not rely on ellipticity, is also studied. Asymptotic confidence intervals for the conditional VaR, which allow for simultaneous quantification of the market and estimation risks, are derived.

Our method combined the efficiency of the model-based approach and the robustness of the nonparametric approach.

A medical device has been developed to prevent the occurrence of DFU. The aim of this study was to investigate the willingness to pay (WTP) for this device among the general public in the UK. A contingent valuation survey was administered to 1051 participants through an online survey including questions on socio-demographic characteristics, self-reported health, knowledge of diabetes and medical devices, and WTP. A two-part model was used to analyse determinants of WTP, including a logistic model in the first part and a generalised linear model with a log-transformed WTP in the second part. More than half (55.9%) of the participants expressed a positive WTP. The annual mean (standard deviation) and median (interquartile range) WTP values were A 76.9 pound (69.1) and A 50 pound (80), respectively. Older age, middle-level education, good/excellent self-reported health, visiting doctors once/2-5 times, diabetes experience, medical device experience and more than average self-perceived likelihood of using similar devices were associated with a higher likelihood of willingness to pay. Younger age, male gender and higher household income were associated with higher WTP values. This study demonstrated that people are willing to pay for this device and they tend to contribute when they have experience of diabetes or similar devices and perceive self-benefit.","[Yang, Fan] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Gannon, Brenda] Univ Queensland, Ctr Business & Econ Hlth, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Weightman, Andrew] Univ Manchester, Sch Mech Aerosp & Civil Engn, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of York - UK; University of Queensland; University of Manchester,"Yang, F (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",fan.bella.yang@york.ac.uk,"Weightman, Andrew/G-9706-2015; Gannon, Brenda/D-2011-2017","Weightman, Andrew/0000-0001-7232-4942; Yang, Fan/0000-0003-4689-265X; Gannon, Brenda/0000-0002-3672-4030",University of Manchester Research Institute,University of Manchester Research Institute,"This study was funded by the University of Manchester Research Institute.

These expansions also decreased mortality due to kidney disease in the under 65 population by between 0.5 and 1.0 deaths per 100,000.

Objectives: To propose a novel methodology for estimating the true prevalence of rare diseases using current incidence adjusted to changing diagnostic practice over time. This article focuses on rare diseases whose diagnosis may have changed over time, and raises the hypothesis that prevalence calculated from current incidence may be higher than diagnosed prevalence, which may lag behind the current disease definition and diagnostic methods. A rare epileptic encephalopathy, Dravet syndrome (DS), is explored as an illustrative example. Methods: A targeted literature review was performed for DS to identify all reported incidence, prevalence, and mortality and depict how diagnostic practice has evolved over time. A conceptual model was developed to calculate prevalence derived from current incidence figures alone (incidence-derived prevalence) or incidence adjusted with factors that cause a diagnostic drag (diagnostic awareness-adjusted prevalence). Results: We identified sufficient publications of incidence and prevalence to test the conceptual model. For pediatric patients with DS, diagnosed prevalence in the field (as reported in current literature) matches incidence-derived prevalence, whereas for adult patients, it is overestimated by incidence-derived prevalence, but not by diagnostic awareness-adjusted prevalence. Conclusions: Care should be taken with current incidence-derived prevalence figures to not overstate the prevalence in rare diseases, as methodological challenges in counting small populations, coupled with advances in rare disease discovery, may cause discrepancies.","[Auvin, Stephane] Univ Paris Diderot, Serv Neurol Pediat, Paris, France; [Irwin, John] Zogenix Int Ltd, Maidenhead, Berks, England; [Abi-Aad, Paul; Battersby, Alysia] Wickenstones, Abingdon, Oxon, England",Universite Paris Cite,"Auvin, S (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Diderot, Serv Neurol Pediat, CHU Robert Debre, 48 Blvd Serurier, F-75019 Paris, France.",stephane.auvin@aphp.fr,"Auvin, Stéphane/AAB-7824-2021","Auvin, Stéphane/0000-0003-3874-9749; Battersby, Alysia/0000-0002-0715-6935",,,,,49,40,44,1,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAY,2018,21.0,5.0,,,,,501,507,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.03.002,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GF7VC,29753345.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432175400003,0

First, when knowledge and belief agree - a situation called parsimony - each state of the world is proved to encode a well-defined single observation and, therefore, observable behavior is consistent with Subjective Expected Utility (SEU). Second, under ambiguity, knowledge and belief disagree but, even in this case, the restriction of observable preferences to the subdomain of events over which knowledge and belief agree necessarily conforms to SEU. Third, beyond this subdomain, observable preferences may contradict SEU and be, for instance, of the Choquet Expected Utility (CEU) type. Finally, knowledge and belief are shown to give rise to a compelling form of dynamic consistency always achieved under ambiguity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Objectives: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an information and communication technology (ICT)-facilitated depression care management program. Methods: Cost-effectiveness of the ICT-facilitated care (TC) delivery model was evaluated relative to a usual care (UC) and a supported care (SC) model. TC added automated low-intensity periodic depression assessment calls to patients. Patient-reported outcomes included the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey converted into quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and the 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire-calculated depression-free days (DFDs). Costs and outcomes data were collected over a 24-month period (-6 to 0 months baseline, 0 to 18 months study intervention). Results: A sample of 1406 patients (484 in UC, 480 in SC, and 442 in TC) was enrolled in the nonrandomized trial. TC had a significant improvement in DFDs (17.3; P = 0.011) and significantly greater 12-Item Short Form Health Survey utility improvement (2.1%; P = 0.031) compared with UC. Medical costs were statistically significantly lower for TC (-$2328; P = 0.001) relative to UC but not significantly lower than for SC. TC had more than a 50% probability of being cost-effective relative to SC at willingness-to-pay thresholds of more than $50,000/QALY. Conclusions: An ICT-facilitated depression care (TC) delivery model improved QALYs, DFDs, and medical costs. It was cost-effective compared with SC and dominant compared with UC.","[Hay, Joel W.; Wu, Shinyi] Univ Southern Calif, Leonard D Schaeffer Ctr Hlth Policy & Econ, Univ Pk Campus,VPG 214-L, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Lee, Pey-Jiuan; Jin, Haomiao; Ell, Kathleen; Wu, Shinyi] Univ Southern Calif, Suzanne Dworak Peck Sch Social Work, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Guterman, Jeffrey J.; Gross-Schulman, Sandra] Los Angeles Cty Dept Hlth Serv, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Guterman, Jeffrey J.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Wu, Shinyi] Univ Southern Calif, Daniel J Epstein Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Viterbi Sch Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California; University of Southern California; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California Los Angeles Medical Center; David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA; University of Southern California,"Hay, JW (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Leonard D Schaeffer Ctr Hlth Policy & Econ, Univ Pk Campus,VPG 214-L, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",jhay@usc.edu,"Jin, Haomiao/K-4556-2019","Jin, Haomiao/0000-0001-8908-1959",Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation for the US Department of Health and Human Services [1R18AE000054-01],Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation for the US Department of Health and Human Services,This study was supported by the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation for the US Department of Health and Human Services (grant no. 1R18AE000054-01) (trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01781013).,,49,14,14,1,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAY,2018,21.0,5.0,,,,,561,568,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.11.005,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GF7VC,29753353.0,"Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432175400011,0

Objectives: To assess long-term consequences of MS on personal salary and disposable income. Methods: Patients with MS in Sweden were identified in a nationwide, disease-specific register and matched with general population controls. We assessed mean annual personal gross salary and disposable income each year before and after index (i.e., the MS diagnosis date) using data from national registers. Results: The final sample consisted of 5,472 patients and 54,195 controls (mean age 39 years; 70% females). There was no significant difference in gross salary between patients and controls in any year within the pre-index period. In contrast, on average during follow-up post diagnosis, patients with MS had (sic)5,130 less gross salary per year compared with controls, ranging from a loss of (sic)2,430 the first year to (sic)9,010 after 11 years. Within 10 years after index, 45% of patients had at least one record of zero gross salary, compared with 32% for controls. Mean annual disposable income was comparable between patients and controls across follow-up, with significant differences only at years 9 and 10 post-index. Conclusions: We show that many patients with MS in Sweden lose their ability to support for themselves financially but still have a relatively high disposable income because of social transfers. Our findings underscore the detrimental impact of MS on affected patients and the considerable economic burden of disease to society.","[Landfeldt, Erik; Castelo-Branco, Anna; Svedbom, Axel] Mapi Grp, Stockholm, Sweden; [Landfeldt, Erik] Karolinska Inst, Inst Environm Med, Nobels Vag 13, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Lofroth, Emil] Novartis, Stockholm, Sweden; [Kavaliunas, Andrius; Hillert, Jan] Karolinska Inst, Dept Clin Neurosci, Stockholm, Sweden",Karolinska Institutet; Novartis; Karolinska Institutet,"Landfeldt, E (通讯作者)，Karolinska Inst, Inst Environm Med, Nobels Vag 13, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden.",erik.landfeldt@ki.se,"Kavaliunas, Andrius/GVS-3565-2022","Kavaliunas, Andrius/0000-0003-3896-7332",Novartis,Novartis(Novartis),This study was funded by Novartis.,,19,15,15,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAY,2018,21.0,5.0,,,,,590,595,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.09.021,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GF7VC,29753357.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432175400015,0

Methods: Adults with self-reported diabetes from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (2011-2013) were identified. Reliability (internal consistency and test-retest) and validity (construct, concurrent, criterion, and predictive) of the SF-12v2 were assessed. The SF-12v2 consists of two normalized composite scores: the physical component summary score (PCS12) and the mental component summary score (MCS12). Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to assess the instrument structure. Concurrent (convergent and discriminant) validity was assessed by a multitrait-multimethod matrix using the Patient Health Questionnaire, the Kessler Scale, and perceived health and mental health questions. The predictive validity was assessed by estimating future limitations. The concurrent validity was tested by comparing the MCS12, PCS12, and utility scores (six-dimensional health state short form) across comorbidity scores. Results: The final sample comprised 2214 diabetic patients with mean normalized (population mean 50; range 0-100) PCS12 and MCS12 scores of 40.81 (standard error 0.33) and 49.82 (standard error 0.26), respectively. The PCS12 and MCS12 scores showed good internal consistency (Cronbach a: PCS12 0.85; MCS12 0.83) and acceptable test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient: PCS12 0.72; MCS12 0.63) and produced acceptable goodness-of-fit indices (normed fit index 0.95; comparative fit index 0.95; root mean square error of approximation 0.11 [95% confidence interval 0.1017-0.1188]). The PCS12 and MCS12 were moderately correlated with perceived health and perceived mental health. The MCS12 was highly correlated with the Patient Health Questionnaire and the Kessler Scale. Both the PCS12 and the MCS12 could predict the future health limitations. The PCS12, MCS12, and utility scores demonstrated sensitivity to the presence of comorbidity scores. Conclusions: The SF-12v2 is a valid generic instrument for measuring quality of life in diabetic patients.","[Kathe, Niranjan; Hayes, Corey J.; Bhandari, Naleen Raj; Payakachat, Nalin] Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Div Pharmaceut Evaluat & Policy, Coll Pharm, 4301 West Markham,Slot 522, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA; [Hayes, Corey J.] Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Inst Psychiat Res, Div Hlth Serv Res, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Medical Sciences; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Medical Sciences,"Payakachat, N (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Div Pharmaceut Evaluat & Policy, Coll Pharm, 4301 West Markham,Slot 522, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA.",npayakachat@uams.edu,"Payakachat, Nalin/H-4666-2019; KATHE, NIRANJAN/AAI-5014-2020; Bhandari, Naleen Raj/W-3669-2018","KATHE, NIRANJAN/0000-0003-4932-6426; Bhandari, Naleen Raj/0000-0002-4452-8021; Payakachat, Nalin/0000-0002-9526-5356",Translational Training in Addiction [1T32 DA 022981],Translational Training in Addiction,C.J.

When the market is modelled as a standard signalling game, inefficient outcomes arise due to the arbitrariness of off-the-equilibrium path beliefs. Such inefficient outcomes are shown not to arise in a novel game that combines signalling and competitive screening. In this game, the informed party makes an initial offer to all uninformed parties, but the uninformed parties are allowed to make counter-offers after accepting the initial offer. The initial offer serves as a barrier to potential cream-skimming deviations, and hence, equilibrium is shown to generically exist. As such, the paper also contributes to the literature that focuses on laying strategic foundations for efficient competition in competitive screening markets. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We investigate whether the effect of cancer varies by skill requirement in the pre-cancer occupation, whether such heterogeneity can explain educational gradients, and whether cancer is associated with changes in job characteristics for cancer survivors who remain employed four years after the diagnosis. We combine Danish administrative registers with detailed skill requirement data and use individuals without cancer as a control group. Our main findings are the following: the negative effect of cancer on employment is stronger if the pre-cancer occupation requires high levels of manual skills or low levels of cognitive skills; the educational gradient diminishes substantially if we allow the effects of cancer to also depend on pre-cancer skill requirements; and cancer is not associated with occupational mobility, indicating potential for policies that reduce labour market frictions for cancer survivors.

Studies on the effect of alcohol use on educational attainment have also failed to find a consistent, negative effect of alcohol use on years of education. Thus, the connections between alcohol use, human capital, and wages remain a topic of debate in the literature. In this study, we use the 1997 cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth to estimate a theoretical model of wage determination that links alcohol use to wages via human capital. We find that nonbinge drinking is associated with lower wage returns to education whereas binge drinking is associated with increased wage returns to both education and work experience. We interpret these counterintuitive results as evidence that alcohol use affects wages through both the allocative and productive efficiency of human capital formation and that these effects operate in offsetting directions. We suggest that alcohol control policies should be more nuanced to target alcohol consumption in the contexts within which it causes harm.","[Bray, Jeremy W.] Univ North Carolina Greensboro, Dept Econ, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA; [Hinde, Jesse M.; Aldridge, Arnie P.] RTI Int, Durham, NC USA; [Hinde, Jesse M.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Publ Policy, Chapel Hill, NC USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Greensboro; Research Triangle Institute; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Bray, JW (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Greensboro, Dept Econ, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA.",jwbray@uncg.edu,"Hinde, Jesse M./AAA-6814-2019; Aldridge, A/X-4091-2019","Aldridge, Arnie/0000-0003-4513-470X; Bray, Jeremy/0000-0001-7712-160X; Hinde, Jesse/0000-0002-0552-401X",RTI Fellows Program,RTI Fellows Program,RTI Fellows Program,,41,3,5,2,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,FEB,2018,27.0,2.0,,,,,E87,E100,,10.1002/hec.3565,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA7NO,28833856.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428523400007,0

Objective In order to inform policy decisions we designed a two-stage study to (1) model the uptake of PHI covering hospital treatment in Australia, and (2) identify the costs of various policy scenarios to the government. Methods Using a microsimulation with a cost-benefit component, we modelled the insurance decisions made by individuals who collectively represented the Australian insurance population in the financial year 2014-15. Results We found that the mean willingness to pay (WTP) for PHI ranged from A$446 to A$1237 per year depending on age and income. Our policy scenarios showed a considerable range of impacts on the government budget (from A$4 billion savings to A$6 billion expense) and PHI uptake (from 3.4 million fewer to 2.5 million more individuals insured), with cost-effectiveness ranging from -A$305 to A$22,624 per additional person insured, relative to the status quo. Conclusions Based on the scenario results we recommend policy adjustments that either increase the PHI uptake at a small per-person cost to the public budget or substantially reduce government subsidisation of PHI at a relatively small loss in terms of persons insured.","[Sowa, P.

We review published commentaries that address the validity, reliability, and conceptual underpinnings of these frameworks. We find common themes of critique regarding the strengths and limitations across frameworks. Particular shortcomings of some frameworks pose greater threats to their face validity and utility compared with others. The most significant limitations include lack of clear perspective (e.g., patient vs. health plan) and poor transparency in accounting for costs and benefits. We then review how each framework adheres to core STF recommendations, with particular emphasis on whether the framework can be used to support coverage decisions by health insurers, and whether it adheres to core principles of cost-effectiveness analysis. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Research framework most closely adheres to core STF recommendations. Others have significant limitations that vary widely from framework to framework. We also review how the frameworks follow STF recommendations for addressing potentially relevant issues beyond cost-effectiveness analysis - for example, equity in resource allocation and patient heterogeneity. Finally, we review whether and how each framework uses value thresholds and addresses affordability concerns. We conclude with suggestions for further research, particularly in the areas of testing the measurement and use of novel elements of value and deliberative processes.","[Willke, Richard J.] Int Soc Pharmacoecon & Outcomes Res, 505 Lawrence Sq Blvd S, Lawrenceville, NJ 08648 USA; [Neumann, Peter J.] Tufts Med Ctr, Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, Boston, MA USA; [Garrison, Louis P., Jr.] Univ Washington, Comparat Hlth Outcomes Policy & Econ Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Ramsey, Scott D.] Univ Washington, Dept Gen Internal Med, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Tufts Medical Center; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Willke, RJ (通讯作者)，Int Soc Pharmacoecon & Outcomes Res, 505 Lawrence Sq Blvd S, Lawrenceville, NJ 08648 USA.",rwillke@ispor.org,,,,,,,49,44,45,1,24,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,FEB,2018,21.0,2.0,,,,,155,160,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.12.011,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,FX2ML,29477393.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000425894000007,0

We do so by focusing in two set of consumption categories: Travel to Catalonia from the main international markets (France, Germany and United Kingdom) and searches on the main consumption categories done from Catalonia and from other five big regions (Madrid, Valencia, Aragon, Andalucia and Basque Country). The preliminary results show that the uncertainty in the political situation has translated unto a decline in searches on terms associated with tourism activities in Barcelona, one broad measure shows that searches for the term Barcelona hotel has declined by 12%, year on year for September 2017 to January 2018, by comparison searches for hotel in other comparable Spanish regions have increased slightly. When comparing searches done from Catalonia with other regions through simple time series models, a sizeable negative residual for Catalonia is present in October 2017 -the most difficult period in the Catalan conundrum- which is not observed in other geographical areas. This is the case for some search topics associated to durable goods and Catering and Accommodation services.

In order to plan the returns management process capacity adequately, it is necessary to forecast the expected amount of returned parcels. Big data analytics provides a vast number of methods to perform such tasks. However, it should be noted that particularly small-and medium-sized e-tailers lack the capabilities and resources to employ such complex techniques. Against this background, this paper analyses the performance of several data analysis methods that differ in application complexitiy using real data from an apparel e-tailer. On the one hand, we find that -as expected-complex methods outperform simple ones. On the other hand, and from a practitioner's perspective probably even more interesting, we also conclude that a binary logistical regression as the simplest analyzed method may already provide satisfactory results. The findings indicate that the use of big data analytics is of great value to effectively and efficiently manage consumer returns -even if not the most sophisticated state-of-the-art method is used.","[Asdecker, Bjoern; Karl, David] Univ Bamberg, Chair Operat Management & Logist, Bamberg, Germany",Otto Friedrich University Bamberg,"Asdecker, B (通讯作者)，Univ Bamberg, Chair Operat Management & Logist, Bamberg, Germany.",,"Asdecker, Björn/JBS-4240-2023; Karl, David/IRZ-3851-2023","Asdecker, Björn/0000-0002-4027-2006; Karl, David/0000-0002-0326-5982",,,,,16,2,2,0,11,UNIV POLITECNICA VALENCIA,VALENCIA,"CAMINO VERA S-N, VALENCIA, 46022, SPAIN",,,978-84-9048-689-4,,,,2018,,,,,,,39,46,,10.4995/CARMA2018.2018.8303,0.0,,,8,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BN2ZN,,"Green Published, Bronze",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000477974500005,0

Environmental information plays a special role in CSR reporting. It presents positive and negative relations between the company and the natural environment. The importance of information on the environment has definitely increased because, firstly, countries have begun to introduce legal obligations to present this information, secondly - the interest in this information from the local community has increased, and thirdly, managers have begun to notice the financial and image benefits of this information. It should be noted that the literature mentions various factors that influence the disclosure of environmental information. The author of the paper divided them into three basic groups: social, macroeconomic and microeconomic. Using a cross-sectional analysis of empirical studies carried out in different countries, it was found that behavioural factors deserve special attention among macroeconomic and microeconomic factors. The paper uses a meta-analysis of the literature devoted to environmental issues in terms of the voluntary disclosure of this information in CSR reporting. The main conclusions from the analysis prepared by the author indicate a marked increase in the importance of behavioural factors in the presentation of CSR information, including the one on the environment. Nevertheless, there are relatively few studies that confirm the influence of behavioural factors on the scope of presented voluntary disclosures in CSR reporting. For this reason, the author believes that this gap should lead to further research in this area. In this view, the analysis of behavioural factors should primarily be taken into account when developing CSR reporting models.","[Ferens, Aleksandra] Univ Econ Katowice, Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Ferens, A (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Katowice, Poland.",aleksandra.ferens@ue.katowice.pl,,,,,,,45,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,38,47,,,,,,10,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BP4BP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000550734100005,0

Weekly data were already used in the 20's by official statisticians to assess the short-term evolution of the Economy. For example, Crum (1927) studied the series of weekly bank debits outside New York city from 1919 to 1026 and proposed a method to seasonally adjust these data based on the median-link-relative method developed by Persons (1919). Nowadays, these data are ubiquitous and concern almost all sectors of the Economy. Numerous variables are collected weekly, daily or even hourly, that could bring valuable information to official statisticians in their evaluation of the state and short-term evolution of the Economy. But these data also bring challenges with them: they are very volatiles and show more outliers and breaks; they present multiple and non integer periodicities and their correct modeling implies numerous regressors: calendar effects, outliers, harmonics. The current statistician's traditional toolbox, methods and algorithms, has been developed mainly for monthly and quarterly series; how should these tools be adapted to handle time series of thousands observations with specific characteristics and dynamics efficiently? We present some ideas to adapt the main seasonal adjustment methods, and especially the X11 family i.e. methods based on moving averages like X11, X11-ARIMA, X12-ARIMA and X-13ARIMA-SEATS.

Recently, it was confirmed that certain Japanese investments will be made in the Romanian economy, mostly through the financial implication of listed firms on the Japanese stock exchange market. The main aim of this paper is to analyse the historical data and future impact of Japanese foreign direct investments (FDI) on the Romanian macroeconomic stability indicators. The foreign direct investments represent the amount of cross-border direct investments between firms residing in different countries, for example Romania and Japan. Direct investments usually refer to acquired equities, which allow control and ownership for more than 10% of an enterprise. The proposed macroeconomic stability indicators consist of real GDP, inflation rate, government deficit, government debt, exchange rates, long-term interest rate and unemployment rate. The empirical analysis and the results are estimated using econometric methodologies and techniques that include estimations of VEC models or VECM (Vector Error Correction Model), which are basically restricted vector autoregression models (VAR) that test the existence of cointegrated time series. By using VECM, the influence of foreign direct investments can be determined through causal relations between the aforementioned variable and other relevant macroeconomic variables. Based on past results mentioned in the international economic literature, these relations can be either unidirectional, bidirectional or non-existent. For this study, quarterly data, during the period 2005-2016, has been extracted from national and international databases, such as Eurostat, UNCTAD and NBR (National Bank of Romania). Based on the obtained results, only two econometric variables, the euro-national currency exchange rate and public debt, have a bidirectional causal relation with FDI.","[Pasmangiu, George] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Finance & Banking, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Pasmangiu, G (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Finance & Banking, Bucharest, Romania.",pasmangiu_george@yahoo.com,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,640,649,,,,,,10,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BP4BP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000550734100067,0

We formulate the problem in a general setting investigating pairwise comparisons matrices with fuzzy elements from Abelian linearly ordered group (alo-group). Such an approach enables extensions of traditional multiplicative, additive or fuzzy approaches. Then we propose new order preservation concept based on alpha-cuts. We define the concept of consistency of PC matrix with fuzzy elements (PCF matrices), generalize the concept of the preference order preservation condition (POP condition) to PCF matrices defining weak POP and strong POP condition and derive sufficient conditions for POP condition to be met.

Using a controlled medically framed laboratory experiment with a sequential within-subject design allows isolating sorting from incentive effects. We observe a strong preference for fee-for-service payment, which does not depend on subjects' prior experience with one of the two payment schemes. Further, we identify a significant sorting effect. Subjects choosing capitation deviate ex ante less from patient-optimal medical treatment than subjects who sort into fee-for-service payment. Particularly the latter become even less patient-oriented after introducing the choice option. Consequently, the opportunity to choose between fee-for-service and capitation payment worsens patient treatment, if at all.

Survival data of the patients of interest are usually highly censored, and observed expenditures are incomplete. In this study, we propose a survival-adjusted estimator for estimating mean lifetime costs, which integrates the product of the survival function and the mean cost function over the lifetime horizon. The survival function is estimated by a new algorithm of rolling extrapolation, aided by external information of age- and sex-matched referents simulated from national vital statistics. The mean cost function is estimated by a weighted average of mean expenditures of patients in a number of months prior to their death, of which the number could be determined by observed costs in their final months, and the weights depend on extrapolated hazards. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach in comparison with that of a popular method using simulated data under various scenarios and 2 cohorts of intracerebral hemorrhage and ischemic stroke patients with a maximum follow-up of 13years and conclude that our new method estimates the mean lifetime costs more accurately.","[Hwang, Jing-Shiang; Hu, Tsuey-Hwa] Acad Sinica, Inst Stat Sci, 128 Acad Rd Sect 2, Taipei, Taiwan; [Lee, Lukas Jyuhn-Hsiarn] Natl Hlth Res Inst, Natl Inst Environm Hlth Sci, Miaoli, Taiwan; [Wang, Jung-Der] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Coll Med, Dept Publ Hlth, Tainan, Taiwan; [Wang, Jung-Der] Natl Cheng Kung Univ Hosp, Dept Occupat & Environm Med, Tainan, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan; National Health Research Institutes - Taiwan; National Cheng Kung University; National Cheng Kung University; National Cheng Kung University Hospital,"Hwang, JS (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, Inst Stat Sci, 128 Acad Rd Sect 2, Taipei, Taiwan.",hwang@sinica.edu.tw,"Lee, Lukas Jyuhn-Hsiarn/AAB-6424-2021; Lee, Lukas Jyuhn-Hsiarn/JVP-0022-2024; Hwang, Jing-Shiang/AAP-2835-2021","Lee, Lukas Jyuhn-Hsiarn/0000-0003-1095-6877; Hwang, Jing-Shiang/0000-0002-5807-7583","Academia Sinica, Taiwan","Academia Sinica, Taiwan(Academia Sinica - Taiwan)","The research was partially supported by the Health Cloud Project 2015-2016 of Academia Sinica, Taiwan.

On the demand side, adverse selection leads to plan price distortions resulting in inefficient sorting of consumers across health plans. On the supply side, adverse selection creates incentives for plans to inefficiently distort benefits to attract profitable enrollees. Reinsurance, risk adjustment, and premium categories address these problems. Building on prior research on health plan payment system evaluation, we develop measures of the efficiency consequences of price and benefit distortions under a given payment system. Our measures are based on explicit economic models of insurer behavior under adverse selection, incorporate multiple features of plan payment systems, and can be calculated prior to observing actual insurer and consumer behavior. We illustrate the use of these measures with data from a simulated market for individual health insurance. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

To investigate this issue, I use exogenous state-year variation in cyberbullying laws and information on high school students from the Youth Risk Behavioral Survey within a bivariate probit framework, and complement these estimates with matching techniques. 1 find that cyberbullying has a strong impact on all suicidal behaviors: it increases suicidal thoughts by 14.5 percentage points and suicide attempts by 8.7 percentage points. Even if the focus is on statewide fatal suicide rates, cyberbullying still leads to significant increases in suicide mortality, with these effects being stronger for men than for women. Since cyberbullying laws have an effect on limiting cyberbullying, investing in cyberbullying-preventing strategies can improve individual health by decreasing suicide attempts, and increase the aggregate health stock by decreasing suicide rates.

To address this issue, matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) measures treatment efficacy after weighting individual patient data to match patient characteristics across trials. To date, however, there is no consensus on how best to implement MAIC. To address this issue, we applied MAIC to measure how two attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) treatments (guanfacine extended release and atomoxetine hydrochloride) affect patients' ADHD symptoms, as measured by the ADHD Rating Scale IV score. We tested MAIC sensitivity to: matched patient characteristics, matched statistical moments, weighting matrix, and placebo-arm matching (i.e., matching on outcomes in the placebo arm). After applying MAIC, guanfacine and atomoxetine had similar reductions in ADHD symptoms (: 0.4, p<0.737). The results were similar for three of four sensitivity analyses. When we applied MAIC with placebo-arm matching, however, guanfacine reduced symptoms more than atomoxetine (: -3.9, p<0.004). We discuss the implication of this finding and advise MAIC practitioners to carefully consider the use of placebo-arm matching, depending on the presence of residual confounding across trials.
