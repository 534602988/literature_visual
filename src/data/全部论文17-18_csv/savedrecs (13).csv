The twentieth century witnessed significant male female convergence in a myriad of positive dimensions including human capital acquisition, labour force participation and wages. This has prompted the question, to what extent are women 'looking more like men'? In this paper we examine whether similar forces are at play in the context of criminality. We study the pattern of gender convergence in crime using rich administrative data on the population of young people in Queensland, Australia. The evidence points to a significant narrowing of the gender gap in criminal activity over the course of the last twenty years. Crime convergence occurs for broad aggregates of both property and violent crime, as well as for almost all sub-component categories. Convergence occurs largely because crime has fallen significantly for men, combined with no downward trend for women. This is confirmed by aggregate analysis of rates of offending in police force districts matched to Census data by gender between 2001 and 2016.

However, traders' acquisition cost of information has typically been ignored. Results from a laboratory experiment involving six treatments varying the cost of acquiring signals of an asset's value suggest that when information is costly, markets do not succeed in aggregating it. At an individual level, having information improves trading performance, but not enough to offset the cost of obtaining the information. Although males earn more through trading than females, this differential is offset by the greater propensity of males to buy information such that total profit is similar for males and females. Looking at individual skills, we find that higher theory of mind is associated with greater trading profit, greater overall profit, and an increased likelihood of acquiring information while cognitive reflection is associated with greater profit but not a greater propensity to acquire information.

Different approaches, methods and models were analysed and the final recomendations were stated. Basic valuation approaches such as the income approach, the market-based approach and the asset-based approach used for traditional entreprises valuation are recommended also for the commercial banks valuation, but it is necessary to adjust them according to some specifics of banks. After the precise analysis it is possible to recommend the application of Market-Based Valuation or in other words Relative Valuation in the combination with Bond Pricing Model.This is the best choice, but only in case there is some comparable bank or comparable transaction available. In the opposite case it is possible to recommend the application ofthe income approach based on DDM or DCFE in the combination with Bond Pricing Model or with Excess Return Model. Asset-Based Valuation could be used in case of valuation of different type of bank's asset or in case of the valuation for accounting or tax purposes. The most important problem lies also in the identification of the coefficient beta that oscillates in case of the large maturity banks according to the magic one'.","[Hrdy, Milan] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Finance & Accounting, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Hrdy, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Finance & Accounting, Prague, Czech Republic.",hrdy@syse.cz,,,Faculty of Finance and Accounting University of Economics in Prague [IP 100040],Faculty of Finance and Accounting University of Economics in Prague,This paper was prepared with the institutional support of the Faculty of Finance and Accounting University of Economics in Prague IP 100040.,,22,0,1,0,9,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Using the real interest rate gap and the credit-to-GDP gap, we provide evidence that monetary policy procyclicality is a material issue occurring in more than 50% of observations in expansionary phase of financial cycle. It indicates that the central bank faces conflicting objectives of price and financial stability (as proxied by cyclical systemic risk). Nevertheless, taking into consideration all financial cycle phases, complementariness between price and financial stability is more frequent than cases with conflicting objectives in the UK, Euro Area and the US. The occurrence of potential procyclical behaviour of monetary policy (especially in the financial cycle expansion phases) underlines the need for proactive macroprudential policy.","[Kurowski, Lukasz; Smaga, Pawel] Warsaw Sch Econ, Finsen Inst, Warsaw, Poland; [Kurowski, Lukasz; Smaga, Pawel] Natl Bank Poland, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics; Narodowy Bank Polski,"Smaga, P (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Finsen Inst, Warsaw, Poland.;Smaga, P (通讯作者)，Natl Bank Poland, Warsaw, Poland.",lukaszkurowskisgh@gmail.com; psmaga@sgh.waw.pl,"Smaga, Paweł/C-2444-2018; Kurowski, Łukasz/R-3631-2019","Smaga, Paweł/0000-0003-3913-0833; Kurowski, Łukasz/0000-0002-3306-4276",statutory research grant at the Warsaw School of Economics in 2016 [KZIF/S/17/16],statutory research grant at the Warsaw School of Economics in 2016,"The paper was written as a part of statutory research grant at the Warsaw School of Economics in 2016 (No. KZIF/S/17/16) entitled Size and Structure of Financial Sectors in Selected Central and Eastern European Countries and Developed Countries.

When the usage of the resources in question generates type-dependent negative externalities, the welfare comparison can become ambiguous. Both types of allocation mechanisms are being implemented in China's major cities to distribute limited vehicle licences as a measure to combat worsening traffic congestion and air pollution. While Beijing employs non-transferable lotteries, Shanghai uses an auction system. This article empirically quantifies the welfare consequences of the two mechanisms by taking into account both allocation efficiency and automobile externalities post-allocation. Our analysis shows that different allocation mechanisms lead to dramatic differences in social welfare. Although Beijing's lottery system has a large advantage in reducing automobile externalities over auction, the advantage is offset by the significant allocative cost from misallocation. The lottery system in Beijing resulted in a social welfare loss of 30 billion Yuan (nearly $5 billion) in 2012 alone. A uniform-price auction would have generated nearly 20 billion Yuan to Beijing municipal government, more than covering all its subsidies to the local public transit system.","[Li, Shanjun] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Li, Shanjun] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Cornell University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Li, SJ (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.;Li, SJ (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,"Li, shanjun/0000-0002-6141-8940",Lehman fund; Institute for the Social Sciences at Cornell University,Lehman fund; Institute for the Social Sciences at Cornell University,"I thank George Akerlof, Panle Jia Barwick, Antonio Bento, Sebastien Houde, Sabrina Howell, Mark Jacobsen, Sarah Jacobson, MatthewKahn, Neha Khanna, Benjamin Leard, Arik Levinson, Greg Lewis, Joshua Linn, Yimin Liu, Lucija Muehlenbachs, Mark Roberts, Stuart Rosenthal, Emily Wang, Catherine Wolfram, Jun Yang, Jerome Adda (editor), three anonymous referees, and seminar participants at Binghamton University, Colorado School of Mines, Ford Motor, Georgetown University, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, TexasA& M, University of Alabama, University of California-Berkeley, University of Calgary, University of Connecticut, University of Massachusetts, University of Sao Paulo, 2014 NBER Workshop on China's Environment, 2014 NBER Summer Institute, and 2014 NBERWorkshop on Chinese Economy for helpful suggestions.

In the bargaining game, two players bargain over the surplus allocation. The relationship lasts for several periods and one player, the first mover, must choose between governing the relationship with a single long-term contract or a sequence of short-term contracts. We focus on two aspects of the choice. First, a long-term contract may increase the surplus because it allows for long-term investments. Second, a long-term contract may, however, reduce bargaining power. We report results of an experiment designed to explore this trade-off. Participants played a sequential bargaining game whereby the first mover selects whether to be the recipient in a single-shot dictator game or a twice-repeated ultimatum game. We find that, in general, participants prefer to retain the bargaining power of the ultimatum games as opposed to engage in a dictator game played over a bigger endowment. This result suggests that diminished bargaining power can be a serious detriment to realizing long-term gains from trade.","[Neilson, William] Univ Tennessee, Dept Econ, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Price, Michael] Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Wichmann, Bruno] Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; University of Alberta,"Wichmann, B (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",wneilson@utk.edu; mkprice2@cba.ua.edu; bwichmann@ualberta.ca,"; Neilson, William/F-6318-2014","Price, Michael/0000-0003-0239-9652; Wichmann, Bruno/0000-0003-1104-0035; Neilson, William/0000-0002-6789-9378",,,,,23,0,0,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

This paper proposes an interval decomposition ensemble (IDE) learning approach to forecast interval-valued crude oil price by integrating bivariate empirical mode decomposition (BEMD), interval MLP (MLPI) and interval exponential smoothing method (Holt(I)). Firstly, the original interval-valued crude oil price is transformed into a complex-valued signal. Secondly, BEMD is used to decompose the constructed complex-valued signal into a finite number of complex-valued intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) components and one complex-valued residual component. Thirdly, MLPI is used to simultaneously forecast the lower and the upper bounds of each IMF (non-linear patterns), and Holt(I) is used for modeling the residual component (linear pattern). Finally, the forecasting results of the lower and upper bounds of all the components are combined to generate the aggregated interval-valued output by employing another MLPI as the ensemble tool.

However, there are still educational gaps among different groups and education inequality remains an issue. Addressing urban disparities remains a pertinent matter in optimizing China's transition towards a knowledge-driven economy. This paper investigates education inequality in urban China, using subgroup and regression-based decompositions of inequality of educational attainment, to evaluate whether the determinants to urban education inequality are similar within and across regions. Using the urban datasets from the China Household Income Project surveys for 2013, education inequality was measured for up to 100 cities from 14 provinces. The results reveal heterogeneity in educational attainment, education inequality, and the determinants of education inequality in urban China. Regression-based decompositions of education inequality revealed that the determinants of education inequality are not homogeneous between and within regions and provinces. While the type of middle school and National Higher Education Entrance Examination scores are predominantly among the largest contributors, the size and order of their contributions vary among different regions, provinces and age cohorts. Other major contributing factors varied from parents' occupation to parent's education and parental employment type. The results imply that since cities aren't homogeneous, therefore, they have different contributing factors towards education inequality. The results suggest that location-specific policy targets and priorities may produce more favorable outcomes in reducing education inequality.","[Valerio Mendoza, Octasiano M.] Ramon Llull Univ, IQS Sch Management, Via Augusta 390, Barcelona 08017, Spain; [Valerio Mendoza, Octasiano M.] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Int Dev, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan",Universitat Ramon Llull; Institut Quimic de Sarria; Nagoya University,"Mendoza, OMV (通讯作者)，Ramon Llull Univ, IQS Sch Management, Via Augusta 390, Barcelona 08017, Spain.;Mendoza, OMV (通讯作者)，Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Int Dev, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",octasiano.valerio@iqs.url.edu,"Mendoza, Octasiano Valerio/N-7244-2019; Valerio, Octasiano/GRF-5202-2022","Mendoza, Octasiano Valerio/0000-0001-9127-8777;",,,,,51,8,8,2,29,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

Treating higher education expansion as an exogenous shock and using a difference-in-difference (DID) strategy, we find that this policy increased the unemployment rate of new college graduates in the short run, but the unemployment rate kept declining and the dis-employment effect mostly disappeared after five years.

It relies on a multivariate CAPM-EGARCH model that accounts for sudden changes in volatility through the application of an iterated cumulative sums of squares (ICSS) algorithm on daily data over the sample period 2008-2014 to model time-varying volatility and ensure reliable estimates. The study confirms the lower systemic risk associated with Islamic indexes during the bearish period and reports that SRI, despite being more subject to systemic risk, offered higher alphas in highly integrated markets, while Islamic indexes performed better in less integrated ones. The evidence also reveals a very limited increase in the models' predictability power from the integration of sudden changes in volatility into the EGARCH models during the full sample period. This limit is more marked during the bearish sub-period. Our findings have important implications for international investment and portfolio diversification perspectives in times of financial downturn.","[Erragragui, Elias; Peillex, Jonathan] Univ Picardie Jules Verne, CRIISEA, 10 Placette Lafleur, F-80027 Amiens 1, France; [Hassan, M.

The focus is put on the interaction between market power and investment incentives, and the trade-off it introduces when designing the optimal regulatory instruments. In contrast to the energy-only market paradigm that assumes perfect competition, our model demonstrates that in the presence of market power scarcity prices do not promote efficient investments, even among risk-neutral investors. Combining price caps and capacity payments allows to disentangle the two-fold objective of inducing the right investment incentives while mitigating market power. Bundling capacity payments with financial obligations further mitigates market power as long as strike prices are set sufficiently close to marginal costs.

During the days of the British Industrial Revolution a sizeable share of the workforce was left worse off by almost any measure as it lost its jobs to technology. The result was a series of riots against machines. In similar fashion, robots have recently reduced employment and wages in US labour markets. Building on the intuition that voters who have lost out to technology are more likely to opt for radical political change, we examine if robots shaped the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election. Pitching technology against a host of alternative explanations, including offshoring and trade exposure, we document that the support for Donald Trump was significantly higher in local labour markets more exposed to the adoption of robots. A counterfactual analysis based on our estimates shows that Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin would have swung in favour of Hillary Clinton if the exposure to robots had not increased in the immediate years leading up to the election, leaving the Democrats with a majority in the Electoral College.","[Frey, Carl Benedikt; Berger, Thor; Chen, Chinchih] Univ Oxford, Oxford Martin Sch, Oxford, England; [Berger, Thor] Lund Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Econ Hist, Lund, Sweden",University of Oxford; Lund University,"Frey, CB (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford Martin Sch, Oxford, England.",carl.frey@oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk; thor.berger@ekh.lu.se; chinchih.chen@oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk,,"Chen, Chinchih/0000-0002-5845-1141",Citi,Citi,"We are grateful for helpful comments and suggestions from the editor, Abigail Adams, an anonymous referee, and participants at the Oxford Review of Economic Policy seminar, as well as to Robert Allen for kindly sharing data.

It models individual i's honesty standard as a profile of (possibly non-empty) collections of ordered pairs of outcomes, one for each member of society, over which individual i feels truth-telling concerns. Individual i is honest provided that she states her true preferences as well as rankings (not necessarily complete) of outcomes that are consistent with the true preferences of individuals in her honesty standard. Under this notion of honesty, we offer a condition, called S(N)-partial-honesty monotonicity, which is necessary for Nash implementation when there are partially-honest agents. In an independent domain of preferences, we show that this condition is equivalent to Maskin monotonicity provided that honesty means stating the orderings of individuals (in a honesty standard) truthfully and individuals' honesty standards are non-connected.

However, its potentially strategic nature and unforeseen side effects provide major policy and scientific challenges. We study the role of SRM in a two-country model with the notable feature of deep uncertainty modeled as model misspecification of SRM side effects. We find that deep uncertainty leads to a reduction in SRM deployment under both global cooperation and strategic Nash behavior, and that the effect is larger if countries act strategically.

However, it should be noted that the unemployment situation of young people (aged 15-24 years) in Poland in general terms seems to be problematic. Overall, the unemployment rate among young people in Poland is significantly higher than the overall unemployment rate in the EU. Moreover, the situation varies greatly across the regions. Purpose of the article: Using multivariate techniques as a theoretical framework, the main goal of the paper is to identify groups of Polish regions that share similar patterns regarding unemployment among young people. To reach this goal, first a set of labour market indicators were selected. Next, the authors compared the labour market situation of young people between the Polish regions in 2005 and in 2014. Finally, the conclusions regarding the conducted analysis are explored. Methods: The initial calculation is based on the concept of the taxonomic measure developed by Hellwig. The final method used to create clusters of objects (across 16 voivodeships of Poland) is cluster analysis. A segmentation of the voivodeships is observed for the years 2005 and 2014, based on selected indicators to determine the labour market situation. The data was gathered from the databases or the Central Statistical Office or Poland and Eurostat. Findings & Value added: Through the exploration or the advantages or multivarite methods, the nature of youth unemployment is revealed in more detail. Indeed, dendrogram analysis divided the voivodeships into five groups, which are characterized by similar features associated with the labour market. It was round that the groups which emerged in 2005 have a different composition or regions than in 2014, this difference seems to be connected with the economic crisis.","[Tatarczak, Anna; Boichuk, Oleksandra] Maria Curie Sklodowska Univ Lublin, Plac Marii Curie Sklodowskiej 5-1115, PL-20031 Lublin, Poland",,"Tatarczak, A (通讯作者)，Maria Curie Sklodowska Univ Lublin, Plac Marii Curie Sklodowskiej 5-1115, PL-20031 Lublin, Poland.",anna.tatarczak@poczta.umcs.lublin.pl,,,,,,,32,17,17,0,7,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

Our approach follows the literature of macroeconomic models of debt management, which we extend to the case where the zero lower bound on the short-term interest rate may bind. We wish to identify the conditions under which removing long maturity government debt from the secondary market can be an optimal policy outcome. We show that the optimal debt-management strategy is to issue short-term debt if the government faces a sizable exogenous increase in public spending and if its initial liability is not very large. In this case, our results run against the standard prescription of the debt-management literature. In contrast, if the initial debt level is high, then issuing long term government bonds is optimal. Finally, we find a role for revisions in the debt management strategy during LT episodes, whereby the government actively manages the maturity structure, in some cases removing long bonds from the secondary market.

In this setting, we find that the big four eurozone economies (France, Germany, Italy, and Spain) can effectively escape from their liquidity trap through fiscal policy interventions caused by government purchases. We estimate the government spending multiplier to be above 1.8 when this policy is associated with a long-term commitment to keeping the nominal interest rate at the zero lower bound, as suggested by Krugman (1998). Notably, the short-term deficit effect on the budget balance can be offset five years after the implementation of a large spending program. We also show that alternative policies with tax cuts that expand the supply do not appear to have the same power in the short run.

We formally argue that a fiscal rule must be pro-cyclical to output for government investment financing and simultaneously has to control for the level of debt adjusting taxation for a policy aiming to escape a situation of exploding debt and low economic activity. Then, when the economy becomes sustainable (or in an economy's high initial private capital), the same rule, has to endogenously adapt to the actual level of debt and income in order to stimulate private investment through lower taxes. We provide a numerical example for our theoretical results and show that in economies with sufficiently low levels of capital and high levels of debt, the tax rate has to adjust non-monotonically during the recover process, reflecting the two counter-balancing properties of the examined fiscal policy rule. However, under a threshold level of initial capital stock, taxes must adjust monotonically (negatively) to boost private investment activity, and in turn, alleviating the volume of debt though a higher tax base.

Moreover, in an open economy it is successful in lowering debt ratios when output is reactive enough to unconventional monetary policy and when the expectations of future inflation are well anchored to the debt-stabilization inflation target. We show that the dynamics of both inflation and public debt ratio are described by first-difference equations with time varying coefficients. We provide some conditions for the asymptotic solutions of the long-run steady states. In particular, we define two regimes of respectively strong and weak fiscal dominance, depending upon whether or not the central bank's action ensures both the sustainability and the speed of convergence of debt to its long-term level.

Involuntary job losses constrain individual choice sets to differing degrees along sociodemographic characteristics. A policy-simulation suggests that the behavioral response to an increase in the NRA from 65 to 67 is moderate, with an average delay of employment exits of only 0.7 years. Widespread reform effectiveness is hampered by the heterogeneous availability of jobs.

It also empirically tests whether energy-efficiency ratings (EERs) are reflected in both housing sales prices and rents in the Australian Capital Territory, the only Australian housing market with mandatory ratings for all dwellings at point of sale or lease. Using a comprehensive dataset of sale and lease transactions during the period 2011-2016, a hedonic framework is applied. The analysis confirms that both the reported energy-efficiency levels and other sustainability-related characteristics that are not part of the formal rating assessment influence the pricing of both sales and rental transactions. Characteristics such as heating and cooling systems and the presence of solar power generators are significantly reflected in rents and sales prices, as tenants and buyers are likely to estimate their expected utility costs based on the EER. It is also shown that the option of leaving the EER of a rental property unreported presents a moral hazard for landlords of sub-standard properties, in that the likelihood of EER disclosure increases in line with the number of energy-efficient features of a property as revealed in the marketing material. The analysis also reveals that socio-economically disadvantaged areas suffer from disproportionately higher levels of EER non-disclosure, potentially constituting a 'double disadvantage' of non-disclosure and low-energy efficiency dwelling stock. From a market and asset-pricing perspective, it thus seems preferable to extend the requirement to obtain and present a valid EER to the rental market. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Such a policy reduces the share of diesel-engines without substantially changing the average fuel consumption or CO2 intensity of new cars. Alternatively, we find that a (revenue-equivalent) carbon tax has only small effects on average fuel consumption and CO2 intensity of new cars. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

I provide robust evidence that firms going public in more concentrated districts are more heavily underpriced than other IPO firms. In general, the results support the notion that the competitive pressures within industrial districts raise the risk profile of IPOs and discourage voluntary disclosure of value-relevant information because of increased proprietary costs. There is also strong evidence to suggest that the increased underpricing of IPOs in industrial districts partially represents investor compensation for the location premium associated with more isolated areas.

Because the literature identifies the impact of long-term exposure to economics instruction (e.g., taking a course), it cannot isolate the specific course content responsible; nor can selection, peer effects, or other confounds be properly controlled for. In a laboratory experiment, we use a within-and across-subject design to identify the impact of brief, randomly-assigned economics lessons on behavior in the ultimatum game (UG), dictator game (DG), prisoner's dilemma (PD), and public-goods game (PGG). We find that a brief lesson that includes the assumptions of self-interest and strategic considerations moves behavior toward traditional economic rationality in UG, PD, and DG. Despite entering the study with higher levels of selfishness than others, subjects with prior exposure to economics instruction have similar training effects. We show that the lesson reduces efficiency and increases inequity in the UG. The results demonstrate that even brief exposure to commonplace neoclassical economics assumptions measurably moves behavior toward self-interest.","[Ifcher, John] Santa Clara Univ, 500 El Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA; [Zarghamee, Homa] Barnard Coll, 3009 Broadway, New York, NY 10027 USA",Santa Clara University,"Zarghamee, H (通讯作者)，Barnard Coll, 3009 Broadway, New York, NY 10027 USA.",jifcher@scu.edu; hzargham@barnard.edu,,"Ifcher, John/0000-0002-3491-8288",,,,,22,10,10,0,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

In 2009, Hypo Alpe Adria International, a bank previously co-owned by the regional government of Carinthia, had been nationalized by Austria's central government in order to avoid a default triggering multi-billion Euro local government guarantees. In 2015, special legislation retroactively introduced collective action clauses allowing a haircut on both the bonds and the guarantees while avoiding formal default. We document that legislative and administrative action designed to partly abrogate the guarantees resulted in a loss of reputation, leading to higher yield spreads for sovereign debt.

The effect of total ALMP (service public employment, training, employment incentives, supported employment and rehabilitation, direct job creation, start-up incentives) is significantly negative on unemployment. Our results show that start-up incentives seem to be the most effective policy to reduce the unemployment rate because of its low cost. Other control variables, such as the tax wedge, employment protection legislation, inflation, investment, and GDP are also important in determining the unemployment rate.","[Sahnoun, Marwa] Univ Sfax, Unit Res CODECI, Fac Econ & Management, Airport Rd Km 4, Sfax 3018, Tunisia; [Abdennadher, Chokri] Univ Sfax, Fac Econ & Management, Sfax, Tunisia",Universite de Sfax; Universite de Monastir; Universite de Sfax; Universite de Monastir,"Sahnoun, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sfax, Unit Res CODECI, Fac Econ & Management, Airport Rd Km 4, Sfax 3018, Tunisia.",marwa.sahnoun1@gmail.com,,"Sahnoun, Marwa/0000-0001-6950-4993",,,,,98,9,9,0,15,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

We build six indicators of economic freedom and cluster them into categories reflecting tax rates and size of the government and public sector. Exploiting the variation in the constructed indices of economic freedom, the evidence suggests less indebted districts with a lower share of taxes and a relatively smaller public sector achieve consistently higher growth rates and income levels. The beneficial effect of economic freedom on growth is robust to the variety of specification checks and does not appear to be driven by sample selection. The evidence does not indicate a lower level of economic freedom in former East German districts or greater economic freedom in West German districts but unveils a persistent north-south divide in the post-unification period. In the counterfactual scenario, a transition to the 90th percentile of economic freedom is associated with large income and growth gains. Such a transition would yield higher income levels and growth rates with a notable decrease in regional economic inequality within Germany.","[Spruk, Rok; Keseljevic, Aleksandar] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Laibach, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Spruk, R (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Laibach, Slovenia.",rok.spruk@ef.uni-lj.si; saso.keseljevic@ef.uni-lj.si,"Spruk, Rok/AAS-8217-2021; Spruk, Rok/ISV-0186-2023","Spruk, Rok/0000-0002-7269-2339",,,,,64,14,14,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

To address this question, we use antidumping filings data combined with micro data on Chinese manufacturing firms for the period 1998-2007. The political connections of a firm are defined by whether it has state-owned capital or whether it is under the administration of central or provincial government. Estimating a probit model of AD filings at the firm level, we find that strong political connections significantly increase the likelihood of AD petitions and affirmative final dumping decisions. State-owned enterprises, firms affiliated with the central or provincial government, low productivity firms, and large firms tend to file AD investigations in China. The industry-level estimation results also confirm that the industries with a greater presence of state-owned enterprises are likely to apply for and receive trade protection from the Chinese government, controlling for import penetration, year, and industry fixed effects.","[Zhang, Hongyong] RIETI, Chiyoda Ku, 1-3-1 Kasumigaseki, Tokyo 1008901, Japan",,"Zhang, HY (通讯作者)，RIETI, Chiyoda Ku, 1-3-1 Kasumigaseki, Tokyo 1008901, Japan.",zhang-hong-yong@rieti.go.jp,"Zhang, Hongyong/AAG-9861-2019","Zhang, Hongyong/0000-0002-2603-1476",,,,,19,10,11,3,33,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

We propose a generalization of the two most traditional indicators used to screen unilateral anti-competitive effects - the HerfindahlHirschman Index and the Gross Up- ward Price Pressure Index - to partial horizontal acquisition settings. The proposed generalized indicators are endogenously derived under a probabilistic voting model in which the manager of each firm is elected in a shareholder assembly between two potential candidates who seek to obtain utility from an exogenous rent associated with corporate office. The model (i) can cope with settings involving all types of owners and rights: owners that can be internal to the industry (rival firms) and external to the industry; and rights that can capture financial and corporate control interests, can be direct and indirect, can be partial or full, (ii) yields an endogenous measure of the owners ultimate corporate control rights, and (iii) can also be used - in case the potential acquisition is inferred to likely enhance market power - to devise divestiture structural remedies. We also provide an empirical application of the two proposed generalized indicators to several acquisitions in the wet shaving industry, with the objective of providing practitioners with a step-by-step illustration of how to compute them in antitrust cases.

The theoretical analysis demonstrates that in the steady state, low levels of inequality are negatively correlated with high informality; conversely, high inequality exacerbates informality. This finding supports the hypothesis of an optimal level of inequality that minimizes the informal economy relative to the impact of other levels of inequality. However, for ordinary income distributions, changes in the level of inequality have only a slight effect on the informality rate. We calibrate the model using data on the U.S. and Mexican economies to estimate the level of inequality that minimizes the informality rate. The self-employment rate emerges as the most relevant determinant of the informality rate.","[Dell'Anno, Roberto] Univ Salerno, Fisciano, Sa, Italy",University of Salerno,"Dell'Anno, R (通讯作者)，Univ Salerno, Dept Econ & Stat DISES, CELPE, Via Giovanni Paolo 2,132, I-84084 Fisciano, Sa, Italy.",rdellanno@unisa.it,"Dell'Anno, Roberto/AAB-6385-2022","Dell'Anno, Roberto/0000-0001-7441-8328",,,,,55,9,9,0,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

I model demand for the product at monetary and non-monetary prices. The model illustrates that monetary prices screen out the poor and that whether non monetary prices screen out the non-poor is theoretically ambiguous because of opposing income and substitution effects. I find monetary prices select richer households and non-monetary prices do not provide strong selection on income. Both the poor and non-poor appear very elastic in the non-monetary price because of the high value of time in home production. I evaluate the problem of a principal with a fixed budget whose objective places some weight on coverage and some weight on targeting. Despite better targeting with non-monetary prices, the principal optimally chooses a monetary price for a large range of parameters.","[Hoffmann, Bridget] Interamer Dev Bank, 1300 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20577 USA",Inter-American Development Bank,"Hoffmann, B (通讯作者)，Interamer Dev Bank, 1300 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20577 USA.",Bridgeth@IADB.org,,,Russell Sage Foundation [RSF] [98-13-041]; Buffett Center at Northwestern University; Graduate School at Northwestern University; Center for the Study of Development Economics at Northwestern University,Russell Sage Foundation [RSF]; Buffett Center at Northwestern University; Graduate School at Northwestern University; Center for the Study of Development Economics at Northwestern University,"I am grateful to Treb Allen, Lori Beaman, Samuel Berlinski, Ofer Cohen, Julian Cristia, Matthias Doepke, Joel Gamoran, Seema Jayachandran, Cynthia Kinnan, Chris Lau, Lee Lockwood, and Juan D.

Our estimates of expenditure shares and income elasticities could be useful in many applications that seek to explain changes in trade behavior from the demand side, and indicate the strong sensitivity of trade to changes in the tails of the income distribution. We explore an application involving the Great Trade Collapse.

It tests the hypothesis that the various manufacturing industries exhibit different values of the Verdoorn coefficient and hence different degrees of increasing returns, broadly defined. The paper analyses especially whether or not these estimates vary according to the level of a country's economic development, controlling for such factors as human capital and the level of technology. It is found that this is the case. Countries in the early stages of development would benefit from specialising in low-tech manufacturing and consumption goods, as these industries have larger Verdoorn coefficients than in the more developed countries. However, as countries reach higher stages of development, it is advantageous for them to specialize in the high-tech manufacturing industries and the capital goods industries. These have relatively high values of the Verdoorn coefficient compared with the less developed countries. It is concluded that the composition of industries that leads to the fastest growth of manufacturing productivity differs depending upon the level of economic development.","Univ Cambridge Rua Para, Dept Land Econ, 126-Apt 51, BR-01243020 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Magacho, Guilherme R.; McCombie, John S.

However, the underlying mechanism of the so-called crisis hypothesis' has yet to be fully understood. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the relevant empirical evidence to date, and scrutinizes the operationalization of the hypothesis' key concepts: crisis, reform and the political mediation of reform during crises. We argue that the social perception of both crises and the subsequent cost of reform requires consideration of how these concepts are operationalized. As a product of the broader economic and institutional environment, social perceptions largely determine the manner in which the political mediation of reform during crises works. Present-day methodological approaches fail to adequately reflect social perceptions and consequently compromise the determination of what constitutes both crisis and the cost of reform in the context of the crisis hypothesis. Most notably, the identification of crises by fixed thresholds constructed around macroeconomic variables impedes the interpretation of the hypothesis' underlying mechanism. A fuller treatment of social perception within the operationalization of the hypothesis' key concepts can enhance our understanding of how economic crises influence political dynamics in bringing about reform.","[Mahmalat, Mounir; Curran, Declan] Dublin City Univ, Sch Business, Dublin, Ireland",Dublin City University,"Mahmalat, M (通讯作者)，Dublin City Univ, Sch Business, Dublin, Ireland.",mounir.mahmalat@gmail.com,,,,,,,80,11,12,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

Let y be an outcome of interest and let (x=k, w=j) be observed patient covariates. Suppose a clinician wants to choose a care option that maximizes a patient's expected utility conditional on the observed covariates. To accomplish this, the clinician needs to know the conditional probability distribution P(y|x=k, w=j). It is common to have a trustworthy evidence-based risk assessment that predicts y conditional on a subset of the observed covariates, say x, but not conditional on (x, w). Then the clinician knows P(y|x=k) but not P(y|x=k, w=j). Research on the ecological inference problem studies partial identification of P(y|x, w) given knowledge of P(y|x) and P(w|x). Combining this knowledge with structural assumptions yields tighter conclusions. A psychological literature comparing actuarial predictions and clinical judgments has concluded that clinicians should not attempt to subjectively predict patient outcomes conditional on covariates that are not utilized in evidence-based risk assessments. I argue that formalizing clinical judgment through analysis of the identification problem can improve risk assessments and care decisions.","[Manski, Charles F.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ & Inst Policy Res, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Manski, CF (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ & Inst Policy Res, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",cfmanski@northwestern.edu,"Manski, Charles/AAV-7497-2021",,,,,,50,12,13,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

This paper demonstrates that the legal origins of these formerly colonized countries significantly determine current-day female HIV rates. In particular, female HIV rates are significantly higher in common law sub-Saharan African countries compared to civil law ones. This paper explains this relationship by focusing on differences in female property rights under the two codes of law. In sub-Saharan Africa, common law is associated with weaker female marital property laws. As a result, women in these common law countries have lower bargaining power within the household and are less able to negotiate safe sex practices and are thus more vulnerable to HIV, compared to their civil law counterparts. Exploiting the fact that some ethnic groups in sub-Saharan Africa cross country borders with different legal systems, we are able to include ethnicity fixed effects into a regression discontinuity approach.

Individuals decide whether to participate as job seekers and if so, how much search effort to exert. Unemployment insurance trades off insurance versus search and participation incentives. We also allow for different productivity types so there is a redistributive role for the income tax and show that a piecewise linear wage tax internalizes the macro effects arising from endogenous wages. Type-specific lump-sum taxes and transfers can then redistribute between individuals of differing skills and employment states. Our analysis embeds optimal unemployment insurance into an extensive-margin optimal redistribution framework where transfers to the involuntarily and voluntarily unemployed can differ, and nests several standard models in the literature.","[Boadway, Robin] Queens Univ, Econ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Cuff, Katherine] McMaster Univ, Econ, 1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada",Queens University - Canada; McMaster University,"Boadway, R (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Econ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",boadwayr@econ.queensu.ca; cuffk@mcmaster.ca,,,Canada Research Chair Programme,Canada Research Chair Programme(Canada Research Chairs),"We are grateful to the associate editor, Etienne Lehmann, and two anonymous referees for their useful suggestions.

Associated with weak correlations between wages and productivity, we reveal the relationship between Japan's dispatched worker system and upward wage rigidity. Unlike the traditional approach focusing on downward wage rigidity, we discover that firms naturally press wages down to gain benefit, in which a high cost of switching jobs for workers fosters businesses to suppress salaries and increase upward wage rigidity. The findings show that upward wage rigidity widely exists in Japan labor markets and significantly increased during the 2008 financial crisis. At that time, the number of temporary workers skyrocketed upward. As dispatched workers usually get lower salaries than regular job workers, this pulls down the payment and increases the degree of upward wage rigidity. In the result analysis, we discover that the revision in the Dispatch Worker Law of 2009 significantly raised temporary workers' wages and improved market efficiency.","[Chen, W.

The role of institutions is assessed using Economic Freedom indices from the Heritage Foundation. We construct a panel dataset from 2000-2015 for 35 European countries to apply a fixed-effects and generalized method of moments model framework in the regression benchmark with the metrics from the Heritage Foundation. Results show that although institutional quality has some impact on the level of investment, it is less significant than expected and far less than suggested by the existing theoretical literature.

We employ rich longitudinal registry data covering the entire Norwegian population between the years 1970 and 2009 and show that a parsimonious set of family and municipality characteristics, measured in childhood, can explain a substantial part of the gender gap in full-time employment. The characteristics primarily operate through their impact on female (not male) employment. Children raised in high gender gap conditions (low-educated parents, non-working mother and raised in a municipality at the highest decile for Christian Democrat voter support and lowest decile in maternal employment rates) demonstrate an employment gender gap almost four times larger than those raised in low gap conditions. Our key childhood characteristics are also related to other career indicators (education, earnings, age at first marriage, age at first childbirth, being the primary breadwinner) in a way that is consistent with the transfer of gender norms. Thus, the gender employment gap appears to be shaped by intergenerational transfers of norms even in one of the most gender equal societies in the world.","[Haaland, Venke Furre; Rege, Mari] Univ Stavanger, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway; [Telle, Kjetil] Stat Norway, Res Dept, Kongensgt 6, N-0033 Oslo, Norway; [Votruba, Mark] Case Western Reserve Univ, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",Universitetet i Stavanger; Statistics Norway; University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University,"Haaland, VF (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway.",venke.f.haaland@uis.no; mari.rege@uis.no; tel@ssb.no; mark.votruba@case.edu,"Haaland, Venke Furre/AAQ-7432-2021; Votruba, Mark Edward/KAM-6544-2024","Votruba, Mark Edward/0000-0002-4870-3376; Rege, Mari/0000-0002-9574-5851",Norwegian Research Council [OF-10018],Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),"We are grateful to Hege Kitterod, Marit Ronsen, a number of seminar participants and the Editor and two anonymous referees for helpful comments and suggestions.

The study uses a nonlinear vector autoregression model and finds that monetary policy becomes ineffective for addressing huge demand contractions in times of financial market turmoil or severe economic downturn, implying a structural change from a non-Keynesian to a Keynesian regime, such as a liquidity trap. Monetary contractions have stronger output effects than monetary expansions, particularly in times of financial distress. We found no evidence in favor of asymmetric effects of monetary shocks of different sizes. Finally, we also found financial shocks to have stronger effects on the real economy in times of financial distress than in normal times.

Previous research has found many negative consequences of food insecurity for families and households but has not examined its relationship with housing instability. Using longitudinal data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, difference-in-difference models show that food insecurity is associated with housing instability. The association remains statistically significant after accounting for potential selection and unobserved heterogeneity using propensity score matching and excluding households that experienced prior housing instability from the sample. Examining potential mediating factors, I find that material hardship explains about half of this association. These findings suggest that maintaining a strong social safety net would reduce the risk that families experience material hardship and housing instability, which may also reduce the risk of homelessness.","[King, Christian] Univ Nebraska, Dept Nutr & Hlth Sci, 104I Ruth Leverton Hall, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"King, C (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Dept Nutr & Hlth Sci, 104I Ruth Leverton Hall, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA.",cking7@unl.edu,"King, Christian/D-8122-2016","King, Christian/0000-0003-1157-5734",Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) [R01 HD36916],Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"I would like to thank Greg Lewis and Sara Markowitz for their helpful comments and suggestions on an early draft.

The returns to experience accumulated in an immigrant's birth country before migrating are positively correlated with birth-country GDP per capita. To understand this fact, we build a model of life-cycle human capital accumulation that features three potential theories: differential human capital accumulation, differential selection, and differential skill loss. We use new data on the characteristics of immigrants and nonmigrants from a large set of countries to distinguish between these theories. The most likely theory is that immigrants from poor countries accumulate less human capital in their birth countries before migrating. Our findings imply that life-cycle human capital stocks are much larger in rich countries.","[Lagakos, David; Porzio, Tommaso] Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Lagakos, David; Moll, Benjamin] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Moll, Benjamin] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Porzio, Tommaso] Ctr Econ Policy Res, Washington, DC USA; [Qian, Nancy] Northwestern Univ, Ctr Econ Policy Res, Natl Bur Econ Res, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Qian, Nancy] Bur Res Econ Anal Dev, Cambridge, MA USA; [Schoellman, Todd] Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN 55480 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; National Bureau of Economic Research; Princeton University; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Northwestern University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Federal Reserve System - USA,"Lagakos, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.;Lagakos, D (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,31,12,15,2,21,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",1932-8575,1932-8664,,J HUM CAPITAL,J.

We use an empirical strategy which allows us to decompose oil price changes from the underlying source of the shock. Our results show that the consequences of oil price changes on UK macroeconomic aggregates depend on different types of oil shocks. While increases in aggregate and oil market-specific demand do not depress the UK economy in the short run, shortfalls in crude oil supply cause an immediate fall in GDP growth. We also find that domestic inflation increases following a rise in the real oil price. Our variance decomposition shows that oil shocks play a non-negligible role in terms of variation in the main UK macroeconomic aggregates. In particular, aggregate and specific oil demand substantially contribute to changes in GDP growth, inflation, nominal interest rate and unemployment rate. Our study provides evidence that the Bank of England responds to the underlying sources of oil price shocks rather than oil price changes themselves. In particular, unanticipated booms in aggregate and specific oil demand cause an increase in the nominal interest rate whereas the opposite occurs in the case of unexpected oil supply disruptions.","[Lorusso, Marco] Heriot Watt Univ, Ctr Energy Econ Res & Policy, Conoco Ctr, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland; [Pieroni, Luca] Univ Perugia, Dept Polit Sci, Via Pascoli 20, I-06123 Perugia, Italy",Heriot Watt University; University of Perugia,"Pieroni, L (通讯作者)，Univ Perugia, Dept Polit Sci, Via Pascoli 20, I-06123 Perugia, Italy.",m.lorusso@hw.ac.uk; luca.pieroni@unipg.it,,"Pieroni, Luca/0000-0003-1841-4351",,,,,46,40,43,2,18,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Moreover, it demonstrates that countries, which throughout the last two millennia were relatively more distant from these frontiers, have higher contemporary levels of innovation and entrepreneurial activity, suggesting that distance from the frontier may have fostered the emergence of a culture conducive to innovation, knowledge creation, and entrepreneurship.","[Ozak, Omer] Southern Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, POB 0496, Dallas, TX 75275 USA",Southern Methodist University,"Özak, Ö (通讯作者)，Southern Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, POB 0496, Dallas, TX 75275 USA.",ozak@smu.edu,"Özak, Ömer/AAA-6787-2020; Özak, Ömer/IAR-1731-2023","Özak, Ömer/0000-0001-6421-2801;",,,,,84,19,20,1,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

Using a two-firm competition model with resource-dependent production technology, we examine the flow of these resources in gradual trading, one-off trading, and Walrasian trading. We find that the evolution of an industry's structure depends on the total amount of resources available relative to the market size. When resources are plentiful, a symmetric duopoly emerges through the trading of the resources. In all three models, a monopoly emerges when the resources are sufficiently scarce.

To investigate this relationship, we use panel data (2002-2015) from the 28 subsectors of the Chinese manufacturing sector. We also perform panel framework analysis to verify the characteristics of the panel data before establishing the panel estimator meant to test the relationships between carbon dioxide emissions, FDI inflows, industrial GDP, industry openness, net domestic fixed capital stock and cleaner production. The results of the panel framework analysis suggest the need to eliminate dynamic panel bias and produce more efficient and consistent parameter estimates. To do so, we use System Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimators with time dummies. Ultimately, the results of the analysis show that FDI is a positive predictor of environmental quality in the host country, which serves as evidence of the halo effect that FDI reduces CO2 emission levels. The study also finds evidence that industrial GDP and cleaner production improve environmental quality. However, the domestic capital stock has a negative effect on environmental quality. By showing that past carbon dioxide emissions significantly influence current emissions, our findings demonstrate the importance of consistency and persistence in efforts to reduce those emissions. Accordingly, we discuss some policy implications based on these results.","[Park, Sang-Do] Woosong Univ, Dept Int Business Management, 186 Jayang Dong, Daejeon 34518, South Korea; [Song, Woo-Yong] Hanbat Natl Univ, Dept Management & Accounting, 125 Dongseo Daero, Daejeon 34158, South Korea; [Sung, Bongsuk] Kyonggi Univ, Dept Int Trade, 154-42 Gwanggyosan Ro, Suwon 16227, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Woosong University; Hanbat National University; Kyonggi University,"Park, SD (通讯作者)，Woosong Univ, Dept Int Business Management, 186 Jayang Dong, Daejeon 34518, South Korea.",bsssung@kgu.ac.kr; wysong@hanbat.ac.kr; psd9576@naver.com,,,,,,,73,95,95,2,34,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0939-3625,1878-5433,,ECON SYST,Econ.

Despite being negatively perceived, it is persistently present in the public, economic and political life of every country as evidenced by a number of press releases on corruption. Research literature analysis reveals the existence of two conflicting opinions with regard to the way in which corruption affects innovative activity of companies and economic growth. The more morally correct theory, which can be dubbed the sand-the-wheels theory, assumes that corruption negatively influences innovative activity and economic growth. Whereas, the grease-the-wheels theory, which is inconsistent with the principles of social responsibility of business, argues for the positive influence of corruption on innovative activity of companies and economic growth.

For every hundred new manufacturing jobs, we find that 34 additional jobs are created in the non-tradable sector. We also show that the effect is heterogeneous along a number of dimensions. More specifically, one new job in high-technology manufacturing creates more jobs in the non-tradable sector while low-technology manufacturing employment growth has no significant multiplier effect. Among the non-tradable industries, the multiplier is the largest for wholesale, retail, and catering. Finally, the effect is also geographically heterogeneous, with the multiplier being greater for inland regions.","[Wang, Ting; Chanda, Areendam] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Econ, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Chanda, A (通讯作者)，Louisiana State Univ, Dept Econ, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",twang16@lsu.edu; achanda@lsu.edu,"Chanda, Areendam/G-1314-2014","Chanda, Areendam/0000-0003-1722-9103",,,,,36,14,17,4,24,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-5967,1095-7227,,J COMP ECON,J.

Using a panel data analysis, the results show a strikingly consistent pattern for the EU Member States. Organized crime mainly operates in the distribution of government spending for local public goods and public provision of private services. There is a decreasing effect on organized crime of the public expenditure devoted to education and social policy.

We construct a tractable theoretical framework where each player has the opportunity to distort the true public signal and each player is uncertain about the distortion technologies available to the other player. We show that when players evaluate strategies according to their worst-case guarantees i.e., are ambiguity averse over certain distributions in the environment perceived continuation payoffs endogenously lie on a positively sloped line. We then provide examples showing that, counterintuitively, identifying deviators can be harmful in enforcing a strategy profile; moreover, we illustrate how the presence of such signal distortion can sustain cooperation when it is impossible in standard settings. We show that the main result and examples are robust to a number of natural modifications to our setting. Finally, we extend our model to a repeated game where our concept is a natural generalization of strongly symmetric equilibria. In this setting, we prove an anti-folk theorem, showing that payoffs under our equilibrium concept are under general conditions bounded away from efficiency. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Using a data set of Italian public procurement auctions run alternately under the two formats, a structural model of bidding is estimated for the subsample of first price auctions and used to quantify the efficiency loss under counterfactual ABAs.","[Decarolis, Francesco] Univ Bocconi, Dept Econ, Via Roentgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy",Bocconi University,"Decarolis, F (通讯作者)，Univ Bocconi, Dept Econ, Via Roentgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy.",francesco.decarolis@unibocconi.it,"Decarolis, Francesco/AAD-6142-2020","Decarolis, Francesco/0000-0002-8547-7021",Henry Morgenthau dissertation fellowship of the University of Chicago; Economic Fellowship of the Bank of Italy,Henry Morgenthau dissertation fellowship of the University of Chicago; Economic Fellowship of the Bank of Italy,"This article supersedes an earlier version circulating under the title When the Highest Bidder Loses the Auction: Theory and Evidence from Procurement Auctions, which was the main chapter of my Ph.D. thesis, supported by the Henry Morgenthau dissertation fellowship of the University of Chicago and the Economic Fellowship of the Bank of Italy.

We apply both a structural modeling approach based on the conduct parameter and a reduced-form regression analysis using different fixed effects. Identification comes from rebate level stepwise changes within each of the three major electric utilities in California and different rebate levels across the utilities. The results from both approaches suggest an average pass-through rate of direct incentives of nearly 100%, though with minor regional differences among California counties. These results suggest a relatively competitive market and a smoothly operating subsidy program, at least from an incentive pass-through perspective. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast to random utility models, CMMs generate closed-form choice probability. Under the axioms, we uniquely identify from the choices an expected utility function that represents the decision maker's true preference and a propensity function that describes how likely an alternative is to be chosen. We introduce a measure of error-proneness and show that the logit model of mistakes is a CMM with a constant measure of error-proneness, characterized by a strong version of the independence axiom from expected utility theory.

This paper explicitly tackles parameter space exploration and calibration of ABMs by combining machine-learning and intelligent iterative sampling. The proposed approach learns a fast surrogate meta-model using a limited number of ABM evaluations and approximates the nonlinear relationship between ABM inputs (initial conditions and parameters) and outputs. Performance is evaluated on the Brock and Hommes (1998) asset pricing model and the Islands endogenous growth model Fagiolo and Dosi (2003). Results demonstrate that machine learning surrogates obtained using the proposed iterative learning procedure provide a quite accurate proxy of the true model and dramatically reduce the computation time necessary for large scale parameter space exploration and calibration.

This article utilizes the market shares of Big Four state-owned banks to investigate whether bank concentration affects debt structure in China. The results show that bank concentration has a stronger positive effect on debt maturity for state-owned enterprises and large-sized enterprises. The effect of bank concentration on debt maturity strengthens with firm state ownership and firm size. Moreover, state-owned enterprises and large-sized enterprises are associated with a longer debt maturity compared to non-state-owned enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, respectively. These results reveal that privatizing state-owned banks and state-owned enterprises would be an effective way to reduce credit discrimination and relieve the capital constraints of non-state-owned enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises.","[Liu, Peisen] Chongqing Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Peisen] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore, Singapore; [Huang, Shoujun] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Lingnan Univ Coll, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Li, Houjian] Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Management, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Chongqing University; National University of Singapore; Sun Yat Sen University; Sichuan Agricultural University,"Li, HJ (通讯作者)，Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Management, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",e0256439@u.nus.edu; huangshj29@mail.sysu.edu.cn; lihoujianguoying@126.com,"Huang, Shoujun/GOH-1927-2022",,National Social Science Foundation of China [13BJL079]; Graduate Scientific Research and Innovation Foundation of Chongqing [CYB16002]; China Scholarship Council,National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Graduate Scientific Research and Innovation Foundation of Chongqing; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),The first author is grateful for financial support from the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 13BJL079) and the Graduate Scientific Research and Innovation Foundation of Chongqing (Grant No. CYB16002).

We develop a simple method to construct every veto equilibrium and identify the most informative equilibrium in a setting that spans prior work. We show that Krishna and Morgan's (2001) equilibrium is maximally informative and strengthen Dessein's (2002) comparison of full delegation and veto. In an application we study the relationship between a patient and a doctor with a financial incentive to overtreat, and show that the doctor's bias harms the patient both through excessive treatment and information loss, that the latter can be substantial, and that insurance benefits both parties by improving communication.

During the 1993-98 period, expenditure inequality increased and the poverty reduction during this period was mainly caused by economic growth. During the 2004-08 period, however, expenditure inequality decreased, thereby contributing to poverty reduction. The poverty incidence declined by around 5 percentage points, of which expenditure growth and redistribution contributed 2.8 and 2.2 percentage points of poverty reduction, respectively.","[Nguyen, Cuong V.] Natl Econ Univ, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Nguyen, Cuong V.] Mekong Dev Res Inst, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Pham, Nguyet M.] Truetech Res, Hanoi, Vietnam",National Economics University - Vietnam,"Nguyen, CV (通讯作者)，Natl Econ Univ, Hanoi, Vietnam.;Nguyen, CV (通讯作者)，Mekong Dev Res Inst, Hanoi, Vietnam.",nguyen.cuong@ippm.edu.vn,"Nguyễn, Cường/JDV-5253-2023; Nguyen, Cuong/L-8044-2018","Nguyen, Cuong/0000-0002-6803-3488",,,,,38,11,12,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

Prior to engaging in bargaining with buyers, sellers exchange access to buyers for negotiated payments to overcome search frictions. With homogeneous preferences, sharing increases market trade volume. Surprisingly, buyers benefit from sharing when sellers have stronger bargaining positions. With heterogeneous preferences, market sharing may decrease market trade volume. Also, when sellers have more bargaining power than buyers, trade volume weakly exceeds Walrasian level, thus causing overproduction by high-cost sellers. Buyers who value the good the least are squeezed out from the market as a result of sharing between sellers. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In a setting with worker heterogeneity, the provision of unemployment benefits achieves two goals: it provides insurance to workers in the event of job loss and it redistributes wealth from individuals with more to those with fewer economic opportunities. Our model features a frictional labour market and an incomplete financial market. When calibrated to match stylised facts of the US economy, the optimal level of unemployment benefits is broadly similar regardless of whether workers differ in economic opportunities. This suggests that taking into consideration the redistributive nature of unemployment benefits has only a limited role in altering the optimal level of unemployment benefits. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We develop a new methodology to separate firm borrowing shocks from bank supply shocks using a vast sample of matched bank-firm lending data. We decompose aggregate loan movements in Japan for the period 1990-2010 into bank, firm, industry, and common shocks. The high degree of financial institution concentration means that individual banks are large relative to the size of the economy, which creates a role for granular shocks as in Gabaix's (2011) study.

For a large sample of 209 firms from 7 countries over the 2004-2014 period, we show that information demand, as proxied by daily search volume in Google, is positively associated with stock market liquidity. Most importantly, this relationship is found to be shaped by the firm's overall visibility and information asymmetry levels. We test the robustness of our results by employing different estimation methods and alternative proxies.

After briefly revisiting gender differences in education, we turn our attention to a body of work that has argued that gender differences in psychological attributes are holding back women's earnings. We then review another active area of research focused on the challenges that women may face when trying to juggle competing demands on their time in the workplace and the home, particularly when the home includes children. We discuss recent work documenting women's greater demand for flexibility in the workplace, as well as work measuring the labour market penalties associated with such demand for flexibility, particularly in the higher paying occupations in the economy. We highlight possible countervailing forces (both at work and at home) that may explain why these work-family considerations may remain highly relevant to today's glass ceiling despite reduced time spent in non-market work and a trend towards a more equal division of non-market work between men and women. Finally, we discuss the role that public policy and human resource practices may play in adding more cracks to the glass ceiling.","[Bertrand, Marianne] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Bertrand, M (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,,,,,,,50,72,90,1,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,APR,2018,85.0,338,,,,,205,231,,10.1111/ecca.12264,0.0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FY0KF,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426499200001,0

This paper divides firm human capital into a specific and a general component to investigate the relationships between firm-and occupation-specific human capital and job switches. Applying the task-based approach, the results show that the degree to which firm knowledge is portable depends on task similarities between the firms. Firm-and occupation-specific knowledge are negatively related to wages in a new job, but achieving a good occupational, instead of firm, match is more important for employees. The occupational intensity, reflecting the overall knowledge composition on the firm level, decreases with experience and can outweigh the costs of covering long task distances. As regards matching, a small distance between the firm and occupational tasks matters for medium-skilled employees.","[Bublitz, Elisabeth] Univ Hamburg, Welckerstr 8, D-20354 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Bublitz, E (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Welckerstr 8, D-20354 Hamburg, Germany.",bublitz.research@mailbox.org,,,German Research Foundation; German Academic Exchange Service,German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Academic Exchange Service(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),This work was supported by the German Research Foundation (doctoral scholarship) and the German Academic Exchange Service (fellowship for research stay abroad and conference travel grant).,,32,2,2,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

It investigates how the rule of law influences federal budgetary allocation for tourism at the state level. Theoretically speaking, the impact of rule of law on budget allocation for the states can be positive or negative, if the prevailing rule of law affects tourism prospects. The centre can transfer more funds to boost tourism and income if state is affected by local unrest, or offer less support to push state for maintaining order. Employing dynamic panel estimates we show that such allocation for tourism responds negatively when rule of law worsens in a state. However, the estimated marginal impacts of rule of law on budget allocation show that the decline in budget allocation is smaller for richer states. From a policy perspective, these results suggest that rule of law and budgetary provisions for tourism are complementary.","[Dutta, Nabamita] Univ Wisconsin, Coll Business Adm, Dept Econ, 1725 State St, La Crosse, WI 54601 USA; [Kar, Saibal] Ctr Studies Social Sci, Kolkata, W Bengal, India; [Kar, Saibal] IZA, R 1, Kolkata 700094, India",University of Wisconsin System,"Dutta, N (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Coll Business Adm, Dept Econ, 1725 State St, La Crosse, WI 54601 USA.",ndutta@uwlax.edu; saibal@cssscal.org,"Dutta, Nabamita/K-3728-2019; Kar, Saibal/AAC-8174-2019","Kar, Saibal/0000-0001-8134-1517; Dutta, Nabamita/0000-0002-0943-5217","Centre for Training and Research in Public Finance and Policy at CSSSC, India","Centre for Training and Research in Public Finance and Policy at CSSSC, India","The paper has greatly benefitted from the invaluable comments of the Editors and the anonymous referees.

In this paper, we examine the effort-maximizing reward design in sequentially played multi-battle competitions between two players. The organizer has a fixed prize budget, and rewards players contingent on the number of battles they win in a three-battle contest. A full spectrum of contest technologies in the Tullock family is accommodated. We find that the optimal design varies with the discriminatory power of the contest technology. In particular, when it is in the low range, winner-take all is optimal. For the intermediate range, as discriminatory power increases, the optimal prize structure evolves continuously from winner-take-all to the proportional-division rule due to the need to mitigate the growing momentum/discouragement effect. For the high range, a wide span of prize structures extracts full surplus and is thus optimal. Several robustness checks confirm that mitigating the momentum/discouragement effect is essential for effort-maximizing prize design in dynamic multi-battle contests.","[Feng, Xin] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Lu, Jingfeng] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore 117570, Singapore",University of International Business & Economics; National University of Singapore,"Lu, JF (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore 117570, Singapore.",a0078175@u.nus.edu; ecsljf@nus.edu.sg,"Lu, Jingfeng/R-2868-2019",,"University of International Business and Economics; MOE, Singapore [R122000252115]","University of International Business and Economics; MOE, Singapore","Xin Feng gratefully acknowledges the financial support from University of International Business and Economics.

In West Virginia, a standard deviation increase in a county's exposure to surface coal mining is associated with 9.85 more asthma hospitalizations per 100,000 residents in a given quarter. Interpreted causally, this suggests over $11 million in hospitalization costs over the 6-year study period. The study builds on earlier cross-sectional research by controlling for unobserved county-level heterogeneity, and by defining more accurate measures of exposure.

In a one-step ML estimation approach, we estimate a class membership model and a behavioral model of the classes jointly. Adopting this approach enables us to simultaneously assess how socio-demographic characteristics affect class membership probabilities and estimate class-specific regression coefficients, to test whether psychological characteristics predict savings behavior differently across latent classes. We apply this approach to a representative sample of UK households (n =3382) and identify two different latent classes: striving versus established households. We find that the relationship between psychological characteristics and savings behavior differs across these two classes, demonstrating the importance of accounting for latent heterogeneity when studying the drivers of savings behavior. Our results have implications for policymakers attempting to improve household savings behavior. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In 2002, China expanded pension mandates from state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to private enterprises. Based on data covering all median and large manufacturers in China (around 250,000 firms), we find that their compliance rates varied widely across firms and increased in the average education level of employees. Utilizing these heterogeneous responses at the firm level, we estimate that the pension reform might have increased the return to education of employees by 8.75%. To address endogeneity in firms' human capital levels, we exploit the historical scale of local university as an instrumental variable. Moreover, we use SOEs as a control group, which was not directly affected by the policy shock. We find our empirical estimates robust to both measures.","[Li, Zhigang] Asian Dev Bank, Mandaluyong, Philippines; [Wu, Mingqin] South China Normal Univ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Asian Development Bank; South China Normal University,"Wu, MQ (通讯作者)，South China Normal Univ, South China Res Ctr Market Econ, Sch Econ & Management, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",mingqinwu@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71703043],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The authors would like to thank the editor and two anonymous referees for their numerous constructive and insightful comments that greatly improved the article.

Based on this fact, this paper develops a multi-sector model to: (1) quantify the effect of different tax regimes in incentivizing woman to enter the labor force, and (2) estimate the feedback effect from women entering the labor force on the service sector size. Counterfactual results suggest that tax progressivity has a stronger effect than tax levels on married female market hours and the speed of structural transformation. In addition, married households react more to progressivity increases and single households are more sensitive to level changes. These results highlight that models ignoring tax structures (levels and progressivity) and household heterogeneity (dual versus single earning households) could lead to erroneous policy conclusions.

This ability to absorb shocks along both margins alters the household's attitudes toward risk, as shown by Swanson (2012). In the present paper, I extend that analysis to the case of generalized recursive preferences, as in Epstein and Zin (1989) and Weil (1989), including multiplier preferences, as in Hansen and Sargent (2001). Understanding risk aversion for these preferences is important because they are a primary mechanism being used to bring macroeconomic models into closer agreement with asset prices. Traditional, fixed-labor measures of risk aversion show no stable relationship to the equity premium in a standard macroeconomic model, while the closed-form expressions I derive here match the equity premium closely.

It facilitates cooperation and information-sharing between economic agents, being hence fundamental for innovation activities. Innovation is the main engine of growth for an increasing number of economies. We introduce an innovation-based growth model with collective social capital that conveys theoretically the argument that social capital influences innovation and consequently economic growth. Social capital stimulates innovation activities, which leads to higher monopolistic profits, which results in higher social capital, in a self-reinforcing mechanism. As the innovation economy grows, social capital grows endogenously with the growth of monopolistic competitors' profits and production. In this neoclassical economy, collective social capital grows naturally and influences economic growth through the innovations sector. In harmony with empirical evidence, the model predicts that economic growth increases with the ratio of output-workers to innovators.","[Thompson, Maria] Univ Minho, Dept Econ, NIPE, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal",Universidade do Minho,"Thompson, M (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, Dept Econ, NIPE, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.",mjthompson@eeg.uminho.pt,"Thompson, Maria/AAF-8254-2021; García, Francisco/AAJ-5004-2021","Thompson, Maria/0000-0003-2080-9600;","FCT/MEC's (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, I.P.)

A typical scenario in panel data is when wanting to estimate the effect of a regressor that is time invariant, such as sex or race, and accidentally including cross-section specific fixed effects. The problem here is that the fixed effects and the regressor are collinear, which causes the resulting pooled least squares estimator to break down. In interactive effects models such breakdowns can occur even if the regressors are not time invariant. The reason is that the interactive effects are flexible enough to generate a wide range of behaviours that are likely to be shared by the regressors. The current paper considers the challenging case when some of the regressors are asymptotically collinear with the interactive effects. The relevant asymptotic theory is developed and tested in small samples using both simulated and real data.","[Westerlund, Joakim; Petrova, Yana] Lund Univ, Lund, Sweden; [Westerlund, Joakim] Deakin Univ, Ctr Financial Econometr, Geelong, Vic, Australia",Lund University; Deakin University,"Westerlund, J (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Box 7082, S-22007 Lund, Sweden.",joakim.westerlund@nek.lu.se,,"Petrova, Yana/0000-0003-3310-6568","Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation through a Wallenberg Academy Fellowship; Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation [P2014-0112:1, W2016-0467:1]",Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation through a Wallenberg Academy Fellowship; Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation,"Westerlund would like to thank the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation for financial support through a Wallenberg Academy Fellowship, and the Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation for financial support under research grant numbers P2014-0112:1 and W2016-0467:1.",,11,3,3,0,1,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Germany is chosen because it is the main trading partner of the majority of the CEECs. The illustration of the position of Germany in GVCs of the CEECs is based on trade statistics in value added terms. The research results show that Germany has become an engine of increasing integration of the CECs in the GVCs.

Although various studies investigate the impact of information feedback on energy consumption, less is known about the heterogeneity of these responses. In this paper, we report the findings from a field experiment where participants are exposed to consumption feedback through the use of in-home displays during two discrete stages. The results show that information provision reduces electricity consumption by around 20%, on average, relative to a sample of non-treated households. Importantly, we also show that this average effect significantly differs based on the time of day and across the treatment group. Most of the feedback effect occurs during off-peak hours, and clusters among households that are older and that are most focused on energy conservation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Regional governments are characterized by their abilities to deliver public goods (administrative capacity) and to raise tax revenues (fiscal capacity). Two regimes are compared on efficiency grounds. Under partial decentralization, regional governments rely on central bailouts to complete local projects in financing needs. Under full decentralization, marginal financing is achieved via local capital taxes. We show that the presence of sufficiently low levels of administrative capacity is a necessary condition for full decentralization dominance. This condition may also be sufficient, depending on the projects' characteristics.

Along with some standard macroeconomic variables, our model contains measures of the shadow monetary policy rate to address the zero lower bound and the implementation of unconventional monetary policy by the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve. We find that these monetary shocks have the expected qualitative effects but their magnitude differs across countries, with southeastern EU economies being less affected than their peers in Central Europe. Euro area monetary shocks have a greater effect than those that emanate from the US. We also find certain evidence that the effects of unconventional monetary policy measures are weaker than those of conventional measures. The spillovers of euro area price shocks to non-euro EU countries are limited, suggesting that the law of one price materializes slowly.","[Hajek, Jan] Czech Natl Bank, Prague, Czech Republic; [Hajek, Jan; Horvath, Roman] Charles Univ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic; [Horvath, Roman] Leibniz Inst East & Southeast European Studies, Regensburg, Germany; [Horvath, Roman] Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius, Trnava, Slovakia",Czech National Bank; Charles University Prague; Leibniz Institut fur Ost und Sudosteuropaforschung; University of SS Cyril & Methodius Trnava,"Horvath, R (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Opletalova 26, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic.",jan.hajek@cnb.cz; roman.horvath@fsv.cuni.cz,"Horvath, Roman/AAD-8248-2019; Horvath, Roman/AAX-8903-2020","Horvath, Roman/0000-0002-9036-9746",Czech National Bank [A1/16]; Czech Science Foundation [P402/12/G097],Czech National Bank; Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"We thank the two anonymous referees, Oxana Babecka-Kucharcukova, Ludmila Fadejeva, Martin Feldkircher, Michal Franta, Giang Ho and seminar participants from the Czech Republic for helpful comments.

We find that in a long run stationary environment, replacing the taxation of Social Security benefits with a revenue-equivalent change in the payroll tax would increase labor supply, consumption, and welfare.

A monopolistic information provider may supply imprecise information to perfectly competitive firms, even if the precision of this information can be increased at no cost.

I find that working while studying substantially reduces the probability of passing and increases the probability of repeating or dropping out during their first year of upper secondary education. Not accounting for selection into working while studying would lead to underestimating the detrimental effect of working. Sensitivity analysis shows that the results are robust.","[Lopez-Mayan, Cristina] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Euncet Business Sch, Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Lopez-Mayan, C (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Euncet Business Sch, Barcelona, Spain.",,"Lopez-Mayan, Cristina/M-2516-2015","Lopez-Mayan, Cristina/0000-0001-7206-1476",Fundacion Ramon Areces,Fundacion Ramon Areces,"I am very grateful to the editor and two anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments.

However, development strategies require a close coordination of the macroeconomic regime with the industrial policy. In addition to Brazil, our analytical discussion and normative implications can be addressed to other developing countries also facing premature deindustrialisation. We propose an analytical discussion of the phenomena of industrialisation, deindustrialisation and reindustrialisation, including a discussion on the connection between the macroeconomic regime and industrial policy, both oriented to reindustrialisation and catching up. The main point is that both policy regimes must be closely coordinated with each other. Concerning the macroeconomic regime, we argue that consistent monetary, fiscal, wage and exchange rate policies are those which are able to not only keep price stabilisation, but also provide average real interest rates below the average real return rates on capital, a competitive real exchange rate and real wage rates increasing in accordance with labour productivity growth. As for industrial policy, theoretical and empirical evidence suggest strategies aimed at the diversification of production, processes and products, especially within the manufacturing sector and within tradable segments of the service sector.","[Nassif, Andre] Fluminense Fed Univ, Rua Joaquim Tavora,24 Ap 703,Bl 2, BR-24230540 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil; [Bresser-Pereira, Luiz Carlos] Getulio Vargas Fdn FGV SP, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil; [Feijo, Carmem] Fluminense Fed Fluminense, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil",Universidade Federal Fluminense,"Nassif, A (通讯作者)，Fluminense Fed Univ, Rua Joaquim Tavora,24 Ap 703,Bl 2, BR-24230540 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil.",andrenassif27@gmail.com,"Bresser-Pereira, Luiz Carlos/D-4258-2017; FEIJO, CARMEM/G-6950-2019","Bresser-Pereira, Luiz Carlos/0000-0001-8679-0557; FEIJO, CARMEM/0000-0002-6376-4599",,,,,61,25,32,4,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

This issue has been typically addressed through three econometric methodologies: structural breaks, Regime Switching, and time-varying parameter models, all requiring some ex ante structure to define the changes. Drawing on the recurrent Chinese restaurant process, a model for an autoregressive process is introduced and estimated via a particle filter. This methodology is employed to study the instability in post World War II US inflation. The application displays a good fit to the data, producing a clusterization of the time series that can be interpreted in terms of economic history, given a relative small number of estimated clusters. In addition, it is able to recover key data features without making restrictive assumptions, as in the case of one-break or time-varying parameter models. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

But strong age-profiles in earnings, among other characteristics that the tax and benefit system conditions upon, combined with individuals' ability to transfer resources across time suggests that measuring circumstances over longer horizons may lead to a very different picture. In this article, we consider how our impression of inequality and the tax and benefit system changes when the horizon under consideration is extended. We show that inequality is lower, redistribution less extensive, and benefit receipt far more widespread from a longer-run perspective. The choice of accounting period can also lead to a very different assessment of the distributional impact of policy reforms. Our results show the importance of policymakers explicitly considering what it is they are trying to achieve through redistribution: the alleviation of short-run hardship or the reduction of lifetime inequality. While there may be good reasons to pursue both objectives, the group of people affected and the appropriate policy response will differ depending on which is prioritized.","[Roantree, Barra; Shaw, Jonathan] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England; [Roantree, Barra] UCL, London, England; [Shaw, Jonathan] Alan Turing Inst, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; University College London,"Roantree, B (通讯作者)，Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England.;Roantree, B (通讯作者)，UCL, London, England.",barra.roantree@ifs.org.uk,,"Roantree, Barra/0000-0002-8738-8225","Nuffield Foundation [OPD/40976]; European Research Council [ERC-2010-AdG-269440-WSCWTBDS]; ESRC Center for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy based at the Institute for Fiscal [RES-544-28-5001, ES/M010147/1]; ESRC [ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [RES-544-28-5001, ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Nuffield Foundation; European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); ESRC Center for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy based at the Institute for Fiscal(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge funding from the Nuffield Foundation (OPD/40976), the European Research Council (reference ERC-2010-AdG-269440-WSCWTBDS) and the ESRC Center for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy based at the Institute for Fiscal (RES-544-28-5001, ES/M010147/1).

The dealer offers the trading mechanism contingent on the aggregate history of his customers summarized by the asset allocation. The equilibrium distortion is type dependent: trade with small surplus breaks down; trade with intermediate surplus may be delayed; trade with large surplus is carried out with a large bid/ask spread but without delay. Because of dealers' limited commitment, the distortions become more severe when the valuation shock is frequent, the valuation dispersion is large or the matching friction to form new relationships is large. Calibrating the model and running a horse race between matching efficiency, trading speed and relationship stability, I found that the liquidity disruption in the market during the recent financial crisis is more consistent with declining matching efficiency of forming trading relationships.

To do so, we use the spillover index approach by Diebold and Yilmaz (2009, 2012, 2014, 2015) and the dynamic correlation coefficient model of Engle (2002) so as to identify the transmission mechanisms of volatility shocks and the contagion of volatility among oil prices and stock prices of oil and gas companies, respectively. Given that volatility transmission across oil and major oil and gas corporations is important for portfolio diversification and risk management, we also examine optimal weights and hedge ratios among the aforementioned series. Our results point to the existence of significant volatility spillover effects among oil and oil and gas companies' stock volatility. However, the spillover is usually unidirectional from oil and gas companies' stock volatility to oil volatility, with BP, CHEVRON, EXXON, SHELL and TOTAL being the major net transmitters of volatility to oil markets.

The competition drives down the monopoly's rents, and as a result, the short position becomes profitable and covers the cost of entry. If entry is impossible, then the speculator may coordinate and pay the firm's counter-parties to stop trading with the monopoly rather than entering. In either case, increasing a speculator's ability to short a firm's rents results in a constraint on the monopoly and forces it to act more like a price taker. Although we are unaware of such a mechanism being attempted in practice, it does provide a potential market based approach to antitrust regulation.

Three main facts are revealed. First, the ratio of domestic financial intermediaries' income to GDP increases continuously in all the countries over the period, even during the 1990s and the 2000s, contrary to the national accountant evaluation. Second, comparing financial income to the quantity of intermediated assets, the analysis shows that the unit cost of financial intermediation does not decrease over the period, except in France. In addition, because European unit cost decreased after the 1990s whereas it remained stable in the United States, the unit cost increased more in the United States than in Europe over the whole period. Third, an econometric investigation shows that (i) the increase in nominal interest rates during the 1970s and the 1980s is positively correlated to unit cost and (ii) the joint development of financial wealth management, credit intermediation, and the securities industry during the 1990s and the 2000s coincides with higher unit cost values.

To understand this puzzling phenomenon, I propose a credit channel as a propagation mechanism of US financial uncertainty shocks to EMEs. I augment a boom-bust cycle model of EMEs by Schneider and Tornell (Rev Econ Stud 71(3):883-913 2004) with a portfolio choice model of constrained international investors. As international investors pull their money from EMEs-to satisfy their Value-at-Risk constraints-in response to financial uncertainty shocks, borrowing costs increase and domestic credit contracts. Higher borrowing costs and a decline in domestic credit, in turn, lead to a fall in investment in the non-tradable sector that causes a real depreciation via currency mismatch prevalent in EMEs and a decline in total output through sectoral linkages. The empirical regularity obtained by estimating structural VARs of 18 EMEs is consistent with the prediction of the model.","[Choi, Sangyup] Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Choi, S (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea.",sangyupchoi@gmail.com,,"Choi, Sangyup/0000-0001-8798-1726",,,,,29,32,35,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

In order to account for potential dynamic effects of wage changes on job satisfaction, we include lead and lag effects of wage changes in our analysis. Furthermore, we examine the role of social comparisons. This strategy allows us to account for implications of behavioural theory and permits an appropriate methodological approach. Our results indicate that wage changes have a statistically significant positive effect on job satisfaction. This effect exhibits a dynamic pattern. We observe an anticipation effect and positive, but declining effects on job satisfaction four years after the wage increase, i.e., partial adaptation. We find that an additional increase in job satisfaction is obtained when the individuals' wage changes exceed the average wage changes for their reference group. However, this effect does not appear to persist, since it fades out two years after the wage change. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

To do this, I exploit an exogenous reform in UK R&D tax policy, which changed the definition of an SME from firms with fewer than 250 employees to those with fewer than 500 employees. I use the UK Business Enterprise Research and Development Survey (BERD), for which companies do not have an incentive to relabel their ordinary employees or spending as R&D. I find that R&D tax incentives help to increase R&D spending at the company level; this translates to a user cost elasticity between -0.88 and -1.18. Further, the additional R&D generated through the tax relief can be attributed entirely to an increase in the number of R&D employees in the companies' workforce. Together, these results challenge a common narrative on the role of R&D tax incentives.","[Guceri, Irem] Univ Oxford, Ctr Business Taxat, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Guceri, I (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Ctr Business Taxat, Oxford, England.",irem.guceri@sbs.ox.ac.uk,,,Office for National Statistics and Secure Data Service (UK Data Archive) from ESRC [ES/L000016/1]; Office for National Statistics and Secure Data Service (UK Data Archive) from Argela; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L000016/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Office for National Statistics and Secure Data Service (UK Data Archive) from ESRC; Office for National Statistics and Secure Data Service (UK Data Archive) from Argela; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"I am grateful for helpful comments from Steve Bond, Michael Devereux, Paul Hunermund, Molly Saunders-Scott, Helen Simpson, Joel Slemrod, Daniel Wilson and two anonymous referees, as well as seminar and conference participants at CBT, ZEW, Max Planck Institute for Tax Law and Public Finance, Koc University, Bilkent University, Ozyegin University, the National Tax Association Annual Congress and the International Institute for Public Finance.

We formulate a mixed complementarity, multi-region, partial equilibrium model, clearing both the electricity and green certificate markets under the assumption of Nash-Cournot market competition. We introduce a mixed complementarity formulation of the tradable green certificate policy scheme. The main contribution of this paper is to combine a public support scheme for electricity production with a power market model in which strategic generators compete and exercise market power in a capacitated transmission network with spatial energy exchange. Any policy instrument interfering with the free market solution in a partial equilibrium model will reduce social welfare as a result of deadweight losses from the policy. These welfare losses may be substantial. We show that losses from tradable green certificates influence different market actors depending on the market conditions, but existing firms are likely to bear most of these losses. In markets with Cournot competition, where producers act strategically, green certificates help to increase market competition if new firms are able to enter the market. Existing firms will not be motivated to compete with new generation capacity. The consumer surplus from introducing tradable green certificates under Cournot competition may increase, despite the deadweight losses the policy incurs. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Deposits are first viewed as an intermediate output, produced by, e.g., fractions of labor and capital. This intermediate output is next used as an input in the second process, together with the remaining labor and capital, to produce output combinations. A problem occurs in that network DEA suffers from the difficulty of determining the fractions of labor and capital used in the first process. This research thus develops an economic model to characterize the underlying multi-stage technologies and proposes a copula-based econometric model to identify parameters of the structural equations, including the fractional parameters, by the maximum likelihood. Our model also estimates technical efficiencies of the stochastic production and cost frontiers.

Using panel data from 1972 to 2007, this paper finds that TELs produce unintended circumvention effects among local governments.

They do that through an agent-based macro model based on adaptive micro-foundations, which works fairly well in replicating a number of stylized facts, including the Beveridge curve, the Phillips curve and the Okun curve. By Monte Carlo experiments they explore the mechanisms behind the movements of the Beveridge curve and the Phillips curve. They discovered that shifts of the Beveridge curve are best explained by the intensity of worker reallocation.

Another main contribution consists in the systematic comparison between old and new European Union member states in terms of determinants of shadow economy, including happiness. Our findings consist in the fact that happier people are more likely to act honestly, thus causing a decrease in the size of shadow economy and this result is valid both for old and new European Union countries. In addition, we found that the quality of public governance and the richness of a country are associated with a lower propensity towards shadow economy for all the member states. However, the relationship between public governance and shadow economy are never significant when the happiness and richness variables vary simultaneously. Our research reveals that the shadow economy in European Union countries is explained in percent of about 62% by richness and happiness of the people. Contrary to our expectations, the fiscal pressure seems not to be a determinant for shadow economy in the European Union space.","[Achim, Monica Violeta; Cuceu, Ionut Constantin] Babes Bolyai Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Finance, Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Borlea, Sorin Nicolae] West Vasile Goldis Univ, Fac Econ Informat & Engn, Dept Accounting & Finance, Arad, Romania; [Gaban, Lucian Vasile] 1 Decembrie 1918 Univ Alba Iulia, Fac Sci, Alba Iulia, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj; Vasile Goldis Western University of Arad; 1 Decembrie 1918 University Alba Iulia,"Achim, MV (通讯作者)，Babes Bolyai Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Finance, Cluj Napoca, Romania.",monica.achim@econ.ubbcluj.ro,"Achim, Monica/C-5811-2017; Cuceu, Ionut Constantin/GXA-3193-2022; Borlea, Sorin Nicolae/AAP-9288-2020","Achim, Monica/0000-0003-4701-041X; Cuceu, Ionut Constantin/0009-0001-9572-6992; Borlea, Sorin Nicolae/0000-0002-9987-3682",,,,,79,18,18,1,15,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Empirical studies on the self-insurance motive suggest that high-reserves economies are more resilient to financial crises and to international capital inflows volatility. They show also that pre-crisis foreign reserve accumulation explains post-crisis growth. However, some papers suggest that the relationship between international reserves holding and reduced vulnerability is nonlinear, meaning that reserve holding is subject to diminishing returns. This article devotes more attention to the potential nonlinear relationship between the foreign reserves holding and macroeconomic resilience to shocks. For a sample of nine emerging economies, we assess to what extent the accumulation of international reserves allows to mitigate negative impacts of external shocks on the output gap. While a major part of the literature focuses on the global financial crisis, we investigate this question by considering two sub-periods: 1995-2003 and 2004-2013. We implement threshold VAR model in which the structure is allow to change if the threshold variable crosses a certain estimated threshold. We find that the effectiveness of reserve holding to improve the resilience of domestic economies to shocks has increased over time. Hence, the diminishing returns of foreign reserve holding stressed in the previous literature must be qualified.","[Allegret, Jean-Pierre] Univ Cote dAzur, CNRS, GREDEG, Nice, France; [Allegret, Audrey] Univ Toulon & Var, LEAD, Toulon, France",Universite Cote d'Azur; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Toulon,"Allegret, A (通讯作者)，Univ Toulon & Var, LEAD, Toulon, France.",audrey.sallegret@gmail.com,,,,,,,48,6,6,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This paper uses firm-level data for the period 2000-12 for the top 2,000 corporate research and development investors worldwide to consider the determinants of patent registration across a large sample of countries. Importantly, we disentangle the effects of corporate income taxation from the tax advantage of patent boxes and exploit a new and original dataset on patent box features such as the conditionality on performing research in the country or their coverage. We find that patent boxes have a considerable effect on attracting patents, mostly because of their favourable tax treatment. Patents with high earnings potential are particularly sensitive. Patent boxes with a large coverage also have stronger effects on the location of patents. We also analyse the impact of patent boxes and their tax advantages on local R&D activities and find that R&D development conditions tend to attenuate the dominant fiscal effect of patent boxes.","[Alstadsaeter, Annette] Sch Econ & Business, As, Norway; Norwegian Univ Life Sci, As, Norway; European Commiss, Brussels, Belgium; Joint Res Ctr, Brussels, Belgium; ULB, European Commiss, CESifo, Brussels, Belgium; CEPR, Washington, DC USA",Norwegian University of Life Sciences; European Commission Joint Research Centre; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Alstadsæter, A (通讯作者)，Sch Econ & Business, As, Norway.",,"Vezzani, Antonio/AAL-9465-2021","Vezzani, Antonio/0000-0001-8077-2489",,,,,65,29,31,8,43,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

During the 1970s, it all reversed, and free markets became paramount to efficiency. F. von Hayek and the Mount Pelerin Society led the way to eliminate the State as a significant economic player, while P.T. Bauer extended such ideas to development economics, which would eventually give way to the Washington Consensus. Beyond actual results of such policies, it is surprising to see the appeal of Bauer's theoretical approach, considering that it is constructed disregarding both empirical evidence, as well as the abundant discussion on development that was taking place contemporarily. This article explores the theoretical process of such reversal in development economics theory.","[Aroche Reyes, Fidel; Ugarteche Galarza, Oscar] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Reyes, FA (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",,"Reyes, Fidel Aroche/AAV-9534-2021",,,,,,57,2,2,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Studies of the pass-through generally rely on econometric analysis implemented on time series data. This study examines pass-through to the domestic price level through an input-output model. The proposed model is implemented on a sample of countries, and a number of different variables connected to the pass-through are examined. A comparison across countries and sectors highlights the importance of the construction sector in price formation. National income is negatively related to the pass-through. A high dependence on intermediate imports implies higher pass-through. Price level volatility and pass-through are positively related; whereas a country's monetary policy stance has no apparent effect. The effect of exchange-rate volatility is unclear; it is negative for the real effective exchange rate, the connection is very weak in the case of the nominal exchange rate.","[Aydogus, Osman; Deger, Cagacan; Caliskan, Elif Tunali; Gunal, Gulcin Gurel] Ege Univ, Dept Econ, Izmir, Turkey",Ege University,"Çaliskan, ET (通讯作者)，Ege Univ, Dept Econ, Izmir, Turkey.",eliftunalicaliskan@gmail.com,"Değer, Çağaçan/P-2699-2018","Değer, Çağaçan/0000-0001-8555-4632; Tunali Caliskan, Elif/0000-0001-5231-9206",,,,,37,8,11,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

While the practice is widely condemned, prominent figures have sought to legitimize it with economic analysis. The institutional competition between ancient usury and modern money and banking has persisted for centuries and seems far from ending. This article examines the institutional factors underpinning the revival of usury in China after a thirty-year stretch (1948-1978), during which the practice had virtually disappeared. The revival of usury is attributed mainly to a pattern of uneven development in China. Usury, by its nature, is a drag on economic productivity and a source of social discord. As China endeavors to achieve a more broad-based human flourishing, the practice of usury must be prohibited strictly once more.","[Cheng, Hao] Nanchang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Finance, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",Nanchang University,"Cheng, H (通讯作者)，Nanchang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Finance, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",,,,School of Economics and Management at Nanchang University (China); National Social Science Foundation of China [15BJY147],School of Economics and Management at Nanchang University (China); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),Hao Cheng is an associate professor of finance in the School of Economics and Management at Nanchang University (China).

The UK government has been an active supporter of loan guarantees since 1981, and has a long track record of modifying its scheme to reflect changing market conditions and the financing needs of its SME sector. Arguably the two most significant changes occurred in 2008 when the 5-Year Rule on eligibility was removed and in 2009 when the long-standing Small Firms Loan Guarantee Scheme was replaced by the Enterprise Finance Guarantee Scheme. We treat the removal of the 5-Year Rule as a natural policy experiment and empirically question whether, on economic grounds, this was a sensible policy.

However, participation requires some degree of financial literacy. It is well recognised that more financially literate individuals are more likely to participate in markets for financial assets. Yet, the link between financial literacy and credit market participation is less studied and - due to the properties of debt - seems to be a more complex issue. We examined not only this link, but also the relation between financial education - both formal and informal - and debt literacy as well as credit market participation. To do so, we processed survey responses obtained in a nationally representative sample of Poles within a series of logistic regressions. We found that actual debt literacy was insignificant in explaining credit market participation, while self-assessed debt literacy was significantly and positively associated with participation. Although both formal and informal financial education were positively linked to higher debt literacy, only informal education turned out to be a significant predictor of credit market participation.","[Cwynar, Andrzej; Cwynar, Wiktor] Univ Econ & Innovat, Projektowa 4, PL-20209 Lublin, Poland; [Szuba, Przemyslaw] Exacto Ltd, Siemienskiego 20-38, PL-35234 Rzeszow, Poland",,"Cwynar, A (通讯作者)，Univ Econ & Innovat, Projektowa 4, PL-20209 Lublin, Poland.",andrzej.cwynar@wsei.lublin.pl; wiktor.cwynar@wsei.lublin.pl; pszuba@exacto.pl,"Aldea, Yesica/AAZ-5287-2021; Cwynar, Wiktor/AAA-9664-2020; Cwynar, Andrzej/AAD-5409-2019","Cwynar, Wiktor/0000-0001-6890-5189; Cwynar, Andrzej/0000-0003-2702-0397",Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education grant [0057/DLG/2016/10],"Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education grant(Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Poland)",This research was financially supported by the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education grant [contract no. 0057/DLG/2016/10 under the programme 'Dialogue' (within the project entitled 'Debt Watch')].,,41,0,0,0,3,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-289-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,44,58,,,,,,15,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BN6JE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000485363200006,0

Worker and workplace endowments can be taken as a proxy for labour productivity. We estimate the extent to which wage differences observed at an aggregate level can be related to the different compositions of workforces and workplaces, as well as the types of jobs conducted in separate countries. We also decompose the observed differences in returns on endowments by identifying the sectors and occupational categories that contribute most to the wage gaps observed at the aggregate level. The wage gaps in low-wage countries actually appear larger once differences in worker, work and workplace characteristics are controlled for. In contrast, the differences in wages between high-wage countries diminish when we control for these endowments. The wage gap between East and West thus seems to be explained by a much lower return on skills and other characteristics rather than by differences in the composition of workforces and firms. Sectoral and occupational analysis suggests that central and eastern European countries have developed a generalised low-cost and low-wage model, with relative returns particularly low on higher skills. There is much less wage disparity across European countries in more labour intensive and lower-paid services sectors, such as accommodation and food service activities. The magnitude of the wage gap seems to be driven by the relative position of sectors and occupations in high-wage countries.","[Drahokoupil, Jan; Piasna, Agnieszka] European Trade Union Inst, Res Dept, Brussels, Belgium",,"Drahokoupil, J (通讯作者)，European Trade Union Inst, Res Dept, Brussels, Belgium.",jdrahokoupil@etui.org,,"Drahokoupil, Jan/0000-0003-1686-1748",,,,,30,12,12,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2018,30.0,4,,,,,421,439,,10.1080/14631377.2018.1442037,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GH9MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000433994000001,0

Despite the high degree of integration of European regions, the EU is still an area where significant differences in key economic indicators exist across Member States. The aim of the paper is to evaluate the process of economic convergence within the European Union based on the analysis of the economic and wage level development and the evaluation of the Czech Republic's position in this process. Based on econometric modelling of beta-convergence, it has been found that the countries surveyed converge to a common steady state, which is defined as the EU average economic and wage level. Empirical results also show that economic level convergence is proceeding faster than wage convergence. The results of the analysis further prove the convergence of the Czech Republic to the average economic and wage level of the most advanced euro area countries (EA-6), although in the terms of speed of the convergence the Czech Republic is lagging behind other CEE countries, especially Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Slovakia.","[Dvorokova, Katerina; Krupa, Tomas] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava 70200, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Dvoroková, K (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava 70200, Czech Republic.",katerina.dvorokova@vsb.cz; tomas.krupa.st1@vsb.cz,,,Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296],Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness,This research was financially supported by Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness Project No. CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296.,,10,0,0,0,1,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-289-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,67,75,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BN6JE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000485363200008,0

Determining the performance of M-banking services helps bank practitioners identify better policy to improve their positions. The aim of this study is to develop an integrated model for evaluating M-banking services by two methods, namely the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) with an extent analysis approach and ARAS (Additive Ratio ASsessment). In this study, the priority weights obtained through the FAHP are combined with the ARAS method to assess and rank the M-banking services. Moreover, in order to verify the applicability of this proposed model, a case study in Turkey is offered. The findings indicate that facilitating conditions play the most determining role in the adoption of the M-banking, followed by self-efficacy, privacy risk, and security risk. Consequently, the proposed model helps to overcome difficulties in M-banking service evaluation process and increases the efficiency of the M-banking service activities. Besides, the case study validates that the proposed model is an effective and efficient decision making tool for the evaluation of M-banking services under fuzzy environments.","[Ecer, Fatih] Afyon Kocatepe Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Business Adm, ANS Campus, TR-03030 Afyon, Turkey",Afyon Kocatepe University,"Ecer, F (通讯作者)，Afyon Kocatepe Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Business Adm, ANS Campus, TR-03030 Afyon, Turkey.",fecer@aku.edu.tr,"Ecer, Fatih/AAE-8455-2020","Ecer, Fatih/0000-0002-6174-3241",,,,,74,47,49,2,21,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

While there are detailed case studies on the evolution of firefighting for some of the largest U.S. cities in the nineteenth century, ours is the first formal econometric diffusion study of the timing of adoption of steam-powered, firefighting engines, whose first adoption was an important initial step in the evolution from independent volunteer fire departments to centralized control at the municipal level. We find evidence that the amount of manufacturing capital at risk of fire loss played a crucial role in influencing the timing of initial adoptions of this technology. This is consistent with the argument that increased industrialization in large cities was conducive to the growth in capital-intensive firefighting and centralized control of fire departments in urban America during this period.","[Falaris, Evangelos M.; Mulligan, James G.; Abrams, Burton A.] Univ Delaware, Dept Econ, Newark, DE 19716 USA",University of Delaware,"Falaris, EM (通讯作者)，Univ Delaware, Dept Econ, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",falaris@udel.edu,,,,,,,32,0,0,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

Different from major stock indices and the commodities of gold and crude oil, the cryptocurrencies exhibit some characteristics of immature market assets, such as auto-correlated and non-stationary return series, higher volatility, and higher tail risks measured by conditional Value at Risk (VaR) and conditional expected shortfall (ES). Using an extreme-value-theory-based method, we evaluate the extreme characteristics of seven representative cryptocurrencies during 08 August 2015-01 August 2017. We find that during the sub-period of 01 August 2016-01 August 2017, there are finite loss boundaries for most of the selected cryptocurrencies, which are similar to the commodities, and different from the stock indices. Meanwhile, we find that left tail correlations are much stronger than right tail correlations among the cryptocurrencies, and tail correlations increased after August 2016, suggesting high and growing systematic extreme risks. We also find that cryptocurrencies to be both left tail independent, and cross tail independent with four selected stock indices, which implies part of the safe-haven function of the cryptocurrencies, indicating their ability to be a great diversifier for the stock market as gold, but not enough to be a tail hedging tool like gold.","[Feng, Wenjun; Wang, Yiming] Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhengjun] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Stat, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Peking University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Wang, YM (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",wangyiming@pku.edu.cn,"Feng, Wenjun/AAB-2842-2020",,China Scholarship Council [201606010147]; Division of Mathematical Sciences [1505367]; Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien [1505367] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Division of Mathematical Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)); Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),This work was supported by the China Scholarship Council [Grant number 201606010147] and Division of Mathematical Sciences [Grant number 1505367].,,40,99,102,3,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Households in the rich North (poor South) are willing to pay high (low) prices for consumer goods; hence, unconstrained monopoly pricing generates arbitrage opportunities for internationally traded products. Export zeros arise because some northern firms abstain from exporting to the South, to avoid international arbitrage. Rich countries benefit from a trade liberalization, while poor countries lose. These results hold also under more general preferences with both extensive and intensive consumption margins. We show that a standard calibrated trade model (that ignores arbitrage) generates predictions on relative prices that violate no-arbitrage constraints in many bilateral trade relations. This suggests that international arbitrage is potentially important.","[Foellmi, Reto] Univ St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland; [Foellmi, Reto; Josef, Zweimuller] CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA; [Hepenstrick, Christian] Swiss Natl Bank, Zurich, Switzerland; [Hepenstrick, Christian; Josef, Zweimuller] Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Josef, Zweimuller] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Josef, Zweimuller] IZA, Munich, Germany",University of St Gallen; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Swiss National Bank (SNB); University of Zurich; Ifo Institut; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Foellmi, R (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland.;Foellmi, R (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA.",Reto.foellmi@unisg.ch,"Foellmi, Reto/A-2727-2008",,"Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [CRSI11_132272, CRSII1_154446]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [CRSI11_132272, CRSII1_154446] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"We thank Sandro Favre, Patrick DeCaes, Stefan Legge, Damian Osterwalder, and Marco Schmid for excellent research assistance.

This evaluation bias affects the compensating variation and the Konus index of cost of living. We show that the equivalent variation is neutral regarding the choice of value units in calibrated models but would be affected as well in uncalibrated CGE models. We illustrate with a simple example and propose an even simpler theoretical solution to overcome these biases; all that is required to have correct welfare estimates is to compensate normalizing with a suitable price index. This type of correction is necessary to overcome the sometimes blind implementation of welfare measures in numerical general equilibrium analysis. We show that the induced quantitative errors may be substantial providing biased welfare estimates and misleading results.","[Guerra, Ana-Isabel] Univ Granada, Dept Int Econ, Granada, Spain; [Sancho, Ferran] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ, Barcelona, Spain; [Sancho, Ferran] Barcelona Grad Sch Econ, Barcelona, Spain",University of Granada; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Sancho, F (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ, Barcelona, Spain.;Sancho, F (通讯作者)，Barcelona Grad Sch Econ, Barcelona, Spain.",ferran.sancho@uab.cat,"Guerra, Ana-Isabel/K-2363-2014; Sancho, Ferran/K-1714-2014","Sancho, Ferran/0000-0002-6200-116X",Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [MICINN-ECO2014-52506R]; FEDER (EU),Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; FEDER (EU)(European Union (EU)),Support from research project MICINN-ECO2014-52506R from the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and FEDER (EU) is gratefully acknowledged.,,24,4,4,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

Building on a theoretical benchmark formalizing the relationship between varying patent breadth and the threat of market entry, our empirical analysis supports the prediction that inventors perceive broad patents as effective market entry barriers.","[Heger, Diana] IHS Econ, Frankfurt, Germany; [Zaby, Alexandra K.] Univ Tubingen, Sch Business & Econ, Mohlstr 36, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Zaby, AK (通讯作者)，Univ Tubingen, Sch Business & Econ, Mohlstr 36, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany.",alexandra.zaby@uni-tuebingen.de,"Zaby, Alexandra/AAB-3530-2019","Zaby, Alexandra/0000-0003-1739-888X","research project 'Strengthening Efficiency and Competitiveness in the European Knowledge Economies' [SEEK 131213]; State of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany","research project 'Strengthening Efficiency and Competitiveness in the European Knowledge Economies'; State of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany","Both authors acknowledge funding from the research project 'Strengthening Efficiency and Competitiveness in the European Knowledge Economies' (SEEK 131213 to DH, AKZ); State of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany.",,34,12,15,4,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

Social learning provides public information, to which players overreact due to the coordination motive. Coordination affects the aggregation of private signals through players' optimal choices. Such endogenous provision of public information results in informational cascades and thus inefficient herds, with positive probability, even if private signals have an unbounded likelihood ratio property. An extension shows that if players can individually learn, there exists an equilibrium in which inefficient herding disappears, and thus, coordination is almost surely successful.","[Huang, Chong] Univ Calif Irvine, Paul Merage Sch Business, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Huang, C (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Paul Merage Sch Business, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",chong.h@uci.edu,,"Huang, Chong/0000-0002-0208-4282",,,,,25,1,1,1,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

We use the whole population of women from the 1980 and 2010 Population Censuses. Results of our RDD estimation using the exact date of birth suggest that the law change was effective in boosting women's education, but it did not have any impact on fertility. This is in stark contrast to most previous studies using only the birth year as the running variable or using it to construct instruments, which find that women's education depresses fertility.

We find that FFAs display limited usefulness in predicting future freights, only slightly superior than simple naive models.

In order to answer this question, we estimate panel data models with interactions between variables for selected profitability measures. The study contributes to the existing literature mainly by exploring the indirect effect of industry and firm size as factors responsible for the variability of the relation between profitability and corporate capital structure. Findings provide evidence that the profitability-leverage relationship is affected both by the firm size and its industrial classification, with the stronger impact of the latter.","[Koralun-Bereznicka, Julia; Ciolek, Dorota] Univ Gdansk, Fac Management, Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; University of Gdansk,"Koralun-Bereznicka, J (通讯作者)，Univ Gdansk, Fac Management, Gdansk, Poland.",jkb@ug.edu.pl; dorota.ciolek@ug.edu.pl,,"Ciolek, Dorota/0000-0001-7042-6638; Koralun-Bereznicka, Julia/0000-0003-4498-0381",National Centre of Science in Poland [DEC-2013/09/B/HS4/01936],National Centre of Science in Poland,The project was funded by the National Centre of Science in Poland on the basis of the decision number DEC-2013/09/B/HS4/01936.,,41,4,5,0,10,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

Yet, the labour market dynamics caused by the internationalization of their production activities are largely unexplored. We use survey-based micro-level data for Germany to explore the employment effects of offshoring of SMEs, relying on propensity score matching and difference-in-difference analysis. We find evidence for a downsizing effect in the immediate aftermath of offshoring whereas, initially, job creation is not spurred. In the medium run, we find evidence for a slowing down of employment dynamics of offshoring firms (that tend to belong to the better performing SMEs in Germany) relative to non-offshoring firms. Even though our results do not point to a net employment loss in the medium run, our evidence suggests that offshoring may lead to less jobs being created.

In order to get more accurate decision results, the order relation of HFSs is particularly important. In this paper, some defects of the existing order relations for HFSs are discussed. In order to solve these problems, by employing a distance measure and the TOPSIS method, we propose a new order relation extraction method based on a new additive consistency fuzzy preference relation for hesitant fuzzy elements (HFEs). Then, the proposed additive consistency fuzzy preference relation is applied to integrate group decision information. In multi-attribute group decision making (MAGDM), it is particularly important to ensure the consensus of the decision-makers (DMs), and the consistency of the decision process is the precondition for DMs to reach consensus. The proposed method can maintain the consistency of the decision process for MAGDM under hesitant fuzzy environments, so as to get the consensus of DMs, besides, it can overcome the limitations of the existing order relations for HFSs. At the end of this paper, a numerical example is used to illustrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the new approach, and some comparative analyses are given. The obtained results confirm the theoretical and numerical analyses and emphasize the advantages, which can ensure the consistency of the whole decision process and avoid the original decision information change and loss of the proposed method, so as to be more in line with the actual situation.","[Lan, Jibin; Yang, Mian; Liu, Fang] Guangxi Univ, Coll Math & Informat Sci, Nanning 530004, Peoples R China; [Hu, Mingming] Guangxi Univ, Business Sch, Nanning 530004, Peoples R China",Guangxi University; Guangxi University,"Hu, MM (通讯作者)，Guangxi Univ, Business Sch, Nanning 530004, Peoples R China.",hmm0112@126.com,,"Hu, Mingming/0000-0003-2981-0616","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71761001, 71761002, 71261001]; Guangxi high school innovation team and outstanding scholars plan",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangxi high school innovation team and outstanding scholars plan,"This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71761001, 71761002, 71261001) and Guangxi high school innovation team and outstanding scholars plan.

We find that the competitive behaviour of foreign and domestic banks differs, with foreign banks having less market power until the recent financial crisis and more market power after this financial turmoil. Despite this difference, banks tend to behave similarly, and their market power converges to a similar level. The tendency towards similar competitive behaviour is observed at the regional and national levels and for both foreign and domestic banks, although foreign institutions that enter these markets through the acquisition of domestic banks have slightly more market power.

However, progress in financial inclusion has been slow in rural areas where poverty is most pronounced. This is often attributed to higher transaction costs, higher risks and a more unfavourable contracting environment which makes it more difficult for financial institutions to achieve and maintain sustainability in rural compared to urban areas. Based on data covering 772 microfinance institutions (MFIs) over the period 2008-2013, we test whether rural financial inclusion, notably lending to rural borrowers, is hampered by stronger sustainability challenges than inclusion in urban markets. Our results suggest that a higher share of rural borrowers has no direct effect on MFI sustainability. However, we find that MFIs with a higher share of rural borrowers are less able to exploit economies of scale and productivity effects. Thus, our results provide support for the view that sustainability challenges make it more difficult to achieve progress in financial inclusion in rural than in urban areas.","[Lopez, Tania; Winkler, Adalbert] Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Ctr Dev Finance, Sonnemannstr 9-11, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany",Frankfurt School Finance & Management,"Winkler, A (通讯作者)，Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Ctr Dev Finance, Sonnemannstr 9-11, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany.",a.winkler@fs.de,,,,,,,91,36,41,8,72,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

To understand this trade-off at the micro level, we investigate the factors determining the program location choice of NGOs using village level survey data from Bangladesh. We document that NGO coverage in a village measured by the percentage of NGO member households, number of NGOs working, and NGO density in the village decreases with distance of the village from marketplaces and increases with the adoption of modern irrigation methods. The results suggest that cost effectiveness and loan repayment concerns serve as barriers to reaching the poor. They also suggest the inability of the microfinance program to mitigate credit market imperfections in the presence of output market imperfections, and this implication can be generalized for the microfinance industry worldwide. The results also shed light on the specific nature of the selection bias previously unknown and can be important for impact evaluation of the microfinance program.","[Mallick, Debdulal; Nabin, Munirul H.] Deakin Univ, Dept Econ, 70 Elgar Rd, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia",Deakin University,"Mallick, D (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Dept Econ, 70 Elgar Rd, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",dmallic@deakin.edu.au; munirul.nabin@deakin.edu.au,,,,,,,33,6,6,0,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

This paper analyzes how migration and other vital economic factors explain international trade. The methodology that is subject of our study consists of a panel data analysis of trade processes measured by export from Spain and import to Spain for 90 countries and covers the period 1998-2015 with respect to immigration and other economic variables. The results show that immigration influences international trade for both sending and receiving countries. On a more detailed level, an increase of the number of immigrants [in Spain] by one per cent results in a growth of Export [from that country] by 0.3 per cent and to a rise of Import [to that country] by 0.303 per cent, respectively. Similarly, the results confirm the measure of the number of annual hours worked as an excellent indicator to depict the role of employment in the most recent economic changes and developments [outlook]. We also find an indirect evidence that labour productivity is relevant for international trade what supports the existence of the Say's Law in terms of Immigration processes. Besides, our paper shows how labour-intensive countries' environment favors export [from Spain], and by contrast, capital-intensive countries' environment facilitates import [to Spain]. Finally, the results add empirical evidence showing how the lack of technological infrastructure plays the role of a non-tariff trade barrier, whereas the membership in an integrated economic area such as EU reduces trade costs, providing incentives for exporters and importers of any particular country.","[Ojeda-Gonzalez, Sara; Mihi-Ramirez, Antonio; Cuenca-Garcia, Eduardo] Univ Granada, Calle Paz 18, Granada 18002, Spain; [Arteaga Ortiz, Jesus] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, C Juan de Quesada 30, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35001, Spain",University of Granada; Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,"Ojeda-Gonzalez, S (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Calle Paz 18, Granada 18002, Spain.",sara.ojeda@ulpgc.es; amihi@ugr.es; jarteaga@ulpgc.es; ecuenca@ugr.es,", Eduardo/HIK-2340-2022; Ojeda-Gonzalez, Sara/AAK-8787-2020; Mihi-Ramirez, Antonio/N-2217-2017","Mihi-Ramirez, Antonio/0000-0003-3801-9906; OJEDA-GONZALEZ, SARA/0000-0002-2624-2791; Cuenca-Garcia, Eduardo/0000-0001-9976-8930",,,,,52,2,2,3,10,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We find that, while men work longer hours, men's additional market work is well compensated by more leisure and less hours in nonmarket work and child care. We also find within-household unequal distribution of time use in nonmarket work, child care, and leisure in favour of men. Consistent with the cases of the US and other advanced economies, high-income earners tend to enjoy less hours of leisure while they spend more money on leisure activities. Secondly, we calculate the household-level consumption equivalent measure that considers consumption, leisure, life expectancy, and uncertainty. We find that taking into account non-separable preference over leisure and consumption and the quality of leisure is important and household-level welfare measures based solely on income or consumption are both incomplete and misleading.","[Park, Ki Young] Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Soohyon] Bank Korea, Seoul, South Korea",Yonsei University; Bank of Korea,"Park, KY (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",kypark@yonsei.ac.kr,"Kim, Soohyon/V-6300-2019","Kim, Soohyon/0000-0002-8379-949X",,,,,38,0,0,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

The randomness in utility is often interpreted as interpersonal preference heterogeneity but it can also be intrapersonal random variation in preferences. We compare utility maximization and regret minimization-based choice models' sensitivity to individual heterogeneity, examine differences between two consecrated models and validate with empirical illustrations. We use frequency of category (public, semi-private, and private) of bed chosen from Swiss cross-sectional datasets (2007-2012) to compare two approaches - utility maximization and regret minimization by applying multinomial logit (MNL) models in regard to the variances in utility (regret) function, goodness-of-fit and predicted marginal effects (pseudo-elasticity) of additional payment. We find parameters with the same sign and estimates with almost same order of magnitude in both the approaches. The statistical significance of attribute effects is consistent in all variants of utility-based MNL models while effects of different attributes are significant only in heteroskedastic extreme value (HEV) variant of regret-based MNL models. This empirical illustration suggests that HEV variant of regret-based models perform better in capturing attribute effects in choice behaviour.","[Paul, Pavitra; Valtonen, Hannu] Univ Eastern Finland, Fac Social Sci & Business Studies, Dept Hlth & Social Management, Kuopio, Finland; [Berlin, Claudia; Maessen, Maud] Univ Bern, Inst Social & Prevent Med, Bern, Switzerland",University of Eastern Finland; University of Bern,"Paul, P (通讯作者)，Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Hlth & Social Management, Kuopio Campus,POB 1627, Kuopio 70211, Finland.",pavitra.paul@uef.fi,"PAUL, Pavitra/K-2761-2015","PAUL, Pavitra/0000-0003-1428-6882; Berlin, Claudia/0000-0003-3505-348X","Yrjo Jahnsson Foundation, Finland","Yrjo Jahnsson Foundation, Finland","Funding for this research was provided by a grant from the Yrjo Jahnsson Foundation, Finland, and travel expenses were covered by the Saastamoinen Foundation, Finland.",,45,11,11,3,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Generally, existing literature on the relationship between income inequality and economic growth has largely overlooked spatial elements. To avoid this exclusion, geographically weighted regression (GWR) estimates were used in this study. Results using GWR showed the magnitude of the inequality-growth relationship varied over a range of 0.70-0.85. The results of this study reinforce the idea that previous studies that have excluded spatial variation have likely overestimated the inequality-growth relationship, particularly in differences between urban and rural provinces.","[Pede, Valerien O.] IRRI, Agrifood Policy Platform, Los Banos, Philippines; [Barboza, Gustavo] Clarion Univ Pennsylvania, Dept Management & Mkt, Adm Sci, Clarion, PA USA; [Sparks, Adam H.] Univ Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Qld, Australia; [Sparks, Adam H.] Univ Southern Queensland, Ctr Crop Hlth, Summer Crop Pathol Res, Toowoomba, Qld, Australia; [McKinley, Justin] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic, Australia",CGIAR; International Rice Research Institute (IRRI); Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE); Clarion University of Pennsylvania; University of Southern Queensland; University of Southern Queensland; Monash University,"Pede, VO (通讯作者)，IRRI, Agrifood Policy Platform, Los Banos, Philippines.",v.pede@iri.org,"Sparks, Adam Henry/D-3607-2011; McKinley, Justin/AAU-1130-2020","Sparks, Adam Henry/0000-0002-0061-8359; McKinley, Justin/0000-0003-3637-2597; Barboza, Gustavo/0000-0001-5327-3430",,,,,45,3,4,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Each-way bets are apparently popular with punters but inconsistent with prominent models of wagering which assume gamblers are everywhere risk-seeking. In this note, we derive the conditions for win and place bets to be optimal in these three models of risky choice. The mathematical conditions for the each-way wager to be optimal, as opposed to a win and place wager with different stakes, are complicated and appear likely to occur rarely in practice. However, bettors obviously see the attraction in giving themselves two ways to bet on the one horse or two ways to win and betting each way. We suggest part of the each-way' betting attraction is that they are quick and easy to compute - a heuristic - to solve an otherwise complex betting strategy.","[Peel, D.

Does corruption shape the relationship between trade and inequality through its impact on redistribution? Our answer to this question builds on the hypothesis that trade raises inequality and that governments may want to intervene through appropriate redistribution schemes that aim at taxing the gains from trade in a way that offsets the negative effects of trade on inequality. Moreover, we argue that this mechanism may be distorted by corruption and bad institutions in general. Quite to the contrary to common wisdom, we find that trade reduces inequality in countries with high institutional standards by means of a low level of corruption but increases inequality in countries with low levels of institutional quality.","[Reinecke, Antonia; Schmerer, Hans-Joerg] Fernuniv, Hagen, Germany; [Schmerer, Hans-Joerg] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Schmerer, Hans-Joerg] IAB, Nurnberg, Germany",Fern University Hagen; Ifo Institut,"Reinecke, A (通讯作者)，Fernuniv, Hagen, Germany.",antonia.reinecke@fernuni-hagen.de,,,,,,,39,0,0,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

As opposed to previous studies, being subject to potential mismeasurement problems when examining search queries along their longitudinal dimension, we apply an alternative investigative approach that exploits the cross-sectional instead of the longitudinal informational content embodied in Googles data. Moreover, while previous studies most often examine a single Google Trends series, our analyses are based on over 60 distinct series, which allow us to assess how informative the data are, not only within each series, but also between series. Finally, our Google Trends indices are based on the recently launched Google Knowledge Graph technology, allowing for a remarkably accurate measurement of relevant search query volumes. We assess the informational value of the data as strong, semi-strong, or weak based on unbiasedness and efficiency considerations in a Mincer-Zarnowitz-type regression model. Here, the context of (Swiss) tourism demand proves particularly useful, and we find that search-based tourism demand predictions are, on average, highly accurate approximations of reality. This indicates that search-based indicators may serve as valuable real-time complements for the guidance of economic policy. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This paper assesses the contribution of inward FDI to Malaysia's economic growth using investment data disaggregated by source over the period, 2008: Q1-2016: Q3. Due to the mixed orders of integration of the series involved, the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) framework is employed to conduct the assessment. The econometric results indicate that the source of the FDI does matter greatly when considering the extent of its spin-off for the local economy. Specifically, FDI flows from North America and Southeast Asia contribute more significantly to Malaysia's economic growth than FDI flows from Central and South America, Northeast Asia and Oceania.","[Tang, Chor Foon] Univ Sains Malaysia, Ctr Policy Res & Int Studies, George Town 11800, Malaysia; [Tan, Eu Chye] Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia; Universiti Malaya,"Tang, CF (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, Ctr Policy Res & Int Studies, George Town 11800, Malaysia.",tcfoon@usm.my,"Tang, Chor Foon/F-9289-2011","Tang, Chor Foon/0000-0003-2242-9222",,,,,17,7,7,3,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

This article examines the dynamic behaviours of incomes for both urban and rural areas with a prefectural data set. The analysis is conducted by using a distribution dynamics approach, which have advantages in examination on persistence, polarization and convergence clubs. The results show that persistence and immobility are the dominant characteristics in the income distribution dynamics. The prefectural urban and rural areas converge into their own steady states differentiated in income levels. This pattern of urban-rural gap also exists in three regional groups, namely the eastern, central and western regions. Examination on the dynamics of the poorest areas shows that geographical poverty traps exist in both urban and rural prefectural areas. Our results indicate that more policy interventions are required to narrow down the urban-rural gap and to eliminate the poverty traps in China.","[Wu, Jian-Xin; He, Ling-Yun] Jinan Univ, Sch Econ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [He, Ling-Yun] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Jinan University; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"He, LY (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Sch Econ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",lyhe@amss.ac.cn,"HE, Ling-Yun/K-2346-2012","He, Ling-Yun/0000-0003-3565-9422","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71273261, 71473105, 71573258]; Humanities and Social Sciences of Ministry of Education Planning Fund [16YJA790050]; China National Social Science Foundation [15ZDA054]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanities and Social Sciences of Ministry of Education Planning Fund; China National Social Science Foundation,"Work of this article was supported by the China National Social Science Foundation (No. 15ZDA054), Humanities and Social Sciences of Ministry of Education Planning Fund (16YJA790050), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71573258, 71273261, and 71473105).",,32,27,28,4,47,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The average delay and maximum efficiency can be measured through the MI model, which can capture accurate information of economic variables, effectively improving the precision of macroeconomic regulation and control.

J,"Zhao, B",,,,"Zhao, Bo",,,Too poor to retire? Housing prices and retirement,REVIEW OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Housing wealth effect; Endogenous retirement; Self-insurance,CONSUMPTION; BEHAVIOR; INEQUALITY; WEALTH; HEALTH,"The near-retirement households among all working-age groups in the United States experienced larger drops in consumption and greater increases in labor force participation during the financial crisis of 2007-2009. Also, the retirement probability for near retirement homeowners (but not for renters) decreases more in those areas where housing prices also decline more. This paper argues that the wealth effect of housing prices on retirement can account for those issues. It creates an incomplete-market life-cycle partial equilibrium model with risky housing assets and endogenous retirement and verifies that the joint response of retirement and non-durable consumption implied by the structural model is consistent with the empirical findings using data from the Health and Retirement Study 1992-2012. It then shows that, after an unexpected 28 percent housing price decline, near-retirement homeowners ages 55-64 will reduce their non-durable consumption by 4.6 percent and increase their labor force participation by 1 percentage point immediately and delay their retirement by 2.8 months in the long run. The model also quantifies endogenous retirement as self-insurance for elderly homeowners against housing price risk. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The estimates are based on rich register data covering more than 100,000 sales over a time period of two and a half years. Because the Swedish property tax is national and thus unrelated to local public goods, our setting is ideal for causal identification of the property tax on house prices. We observe price increases only in a small segment of the market containing properties with very high tax values. We discuss, but can admittedly not empirically discriminate between, several potential explanations for why we find no evidence of capitalization except for the top segment of the market.

The data come from 71 studies using the voluntary contributions paradigm, covering 122 data points, and from 18 studies on decision-making in oligopoly, covering another 50 data points. We find similar effects in the two sets of experimental games. We find that transparency about what everyone in a group earns reduces contributions to the public good, as well as the degree of collusion in oligopoly markets. In contrast, transparency about choices tends to lead to an increase in contributions and collusion, although the size of this effect varies somewhat between the two settings. Our results are potentially useful for policy making, because they provide guidance on the type of information to target in order to stimulate or limit cooperation.","[Fiala, Lenka; Suetens, Sigrid] Tilburg Univ, CentER, TILEC, Tilburg, Netherlands",Tilburg University,"Suetens, S (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, CentER, TILEC, Tilburg, Netherlands.",l.fiala@uvt.nl; s.suetens@uvt.nl,,"Fiala, Lenka/0000-0003-0216-7050; Suetens, Sigrid/0000-0001-6168-6059",Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) through the VIDI program [452-11-012],Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) through the VIDI program(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"Suetens acknowledges financial support from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) through the VIDI program (Project Number 452-11-012).

In this paper, we use a new and unique dataset of urban natives and rural to urban migrants from 15 different cities in China to document this differential treatment. We apply a relatively new non-parametric technique, Nopo decomposition, which takes into account differences in the distribution of observable characteristics to decompose the wage gap that exists between the two groups and estimate the extent of discrimination faced by the migrants. Rural-to-urban migrants are found to be discriminated in the urban labour market, but to a lesser extent than has been argued in the literature. We also find that a large gap exists between the national legislation on the treatment of migrants on one hand and the implementation and enforcement by city governments on the other, and that this differential treatment helps explain part of the level of discrimination.","[Pakrashi, Debayan; Frijters, Paul] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Pakrashi, Debayan] Indian Inst Technol Kanpur, Econ Grp, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India",University of Queensland; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kanpur,"Pakrashi, D (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.;Pakrashi, D (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol Kanpur, Econ Grp, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India.",pakrashi@iitk.ac.in; p.frijters@uq.edu.au,,,National Bureau of Statistics of China; Australian National University; University of Queensland; Australian Research Council; Ford Foundation; World Bank; German Labour Institute,National Bureau of Statistics of China; Australian National University(Australian National University); University of Queensland(University of Queensland); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Ford Foundation; World Bank(The World Bank India); German Labour Institute,"The authors would like to thank the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the Australian National University, the University of Queensland, the Australian Research Council, the Ford Foundation, the World Bank, and the German Labour Institute for funding this project.

The difficulty is not that there are too few theories of sex, the difficulty is that there are too many and none stand out. To distinguish between theories, we ask: Why are there no triparental species with offspring composed of the genetic material of three individuals? A successful theory should confer an advantage to biparental sex over asexual reproduction without conferring an even greater advantage to triparental sex.

Discussing about 100 panel data studies, the results indicate that leftwing and rightwing governments pursued different economic policies until the 1990s: the size and scope of government was larger when leftwing governments were in power. Partisan politics have not disappeared since the 1990s, but have certainly become less pronounced. In particular, government ideology still seems to influence policies such as privatization and market deregulation. I discuss the consequences of declining electoral cohesion and what future research needs to explore. (C) 2016 Association for Comparative Economic Studies. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Concessional bargaining in day-to-day interactions generates goodwill, which helps smoothen future dealings amongst farmers as well as with outside agents. In particular, we model the existence of goodwill amongst farmers as enhancing their ability to collectively bargain with an outside dealer that buys their farm produce. Results suggest that when dealing with each other, farmers offer higher concessions when the risk of loss or reversal in bargaining power is high; however, the level of concession is also influenced by the degree of reciprocity and parameters that affect bargaining surplus. Findings provide further insights over the success of cooperative institutions in rural farm settings where inter-farmer goodwill dynamics determines the cooperative's bargaining outcomes. Specifically, when farmers generously reciprocate each other's goodwill gestures, it leads to better outcomes through increasing their cooperative reservation price. In contrast, when the degree of reciprocity is lower, or when the risk of bargaining power switching is higher, farmers extract more surplus from other farmers, and this also lowers the cooperative's bargaining outcomes and makes the cooperative arrangement unviable in the long term.","[Ranjan, Ram] Macquarie Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Macquarie University,"Ranjan, R (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",ram.ranjan@mq.edu.au,,,,,,,36,1,1,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

The policy of rural land rights confirmation has been implemented since 2010 to enhance land tenure security and the transferability of farmland. However, only a few studies have been conducted on the effect of rural land rights confirmation on farmland transfer. Therefore, we use household-level survey data from 48 villages across Tianjin City and Shandong Province to explore whether rural land rights confirmation promotes the transfer of farmlands. Our empirical results show that rural land rights confirmation has significant and positive effects on the likelihood and amount of transfer-out land at the 5% significance level, but the effect on transfer-in farmland is insignificant. The results of the study have several policy implications. For instance, the agricultural comparative advantage should be improved through various agricultural subsidy policies. Moreover, the intermediary service network for farmland transfer should be established, and strengthening the non-farm employment skills and improving the non-agricultural employment market are necessary for the rural labour force.","[Xu, Hengzhou; Zhao, Yihang; Tan, Ronghui; Yin, Hongchun] Tianjin Univ, Sch Management & Econ, Tianjin, Peoples R China",Tianjin University,"Tan, RH (通讯作者)，Tianjin Univ, Sch Management & Econ, Tianjin, Peoples R China.",xuhengzhou@163.com; yihangzhao@tju.edu.cn; tjtrh@126.com; tjuachun@163.com,,,National Social Science Foundation of China [17BJY090],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grants: 17BJY090).,,52,15,17,1,72,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

We argue that changes in the economic conditions and market composition lead to a time-varying relationship between prices, dividends and the equity premium. Exploiting the information in the rolling window log-log regression of stock prices on dividends, we obtain the Generalized Price-Dividend Ratio (GPDR), that compares the price per share with a time-varying transformation of the dividend per share. The GPDR leads to economic and statistical gains when forecasting the equity premium of the S & P 500 at the 1, 3, 6 and 12 month horizon, as compared to using the classical price-dividend ratio or the prevailing historical average excess market return. Similar improvements are obtained for Generalized Financial Ratios based on the corporate earnings and book value.","[Algaba, Andres; Boudt, Kris] Vrije Univ Brussel, Solvay Business Sch, Brussels, Belgium; [Boudt, Kris] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Algaba, A (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Brussel, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",andres.algaba@vub.be; kris.boudt@vub.be,"Boudt, Kris/N-3646-2019","Boudt, Kris/0000-0002-1000-5142; Algaba, Andres/0000-0002-0532-3066",,,,,50,4,4,1,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

HRP covers a wide range of structural, policy, pricing, and tariff reforms in a wide range of health promotion programs, including reducing the share of payment made by patients hospitalizing in public hospitals, promoting natural childbirth, supporting the retention of physicians in underserved areas, and providing financial protection for incurable or needy patients. Two years after the implementation of RouhaniCare, this study aims to review and analyze the main bottleneck of the plan: Fiscal sustainability. The findings of this study, based on a fiscal simulation model, show that, despite some favorable changes in health indicators, including a considerable decrease in catastrophic health expenditure and a reduction in out-of-pocket health costs for inpatient services, the gap to finance HRP will threaten the continuation of the reform in the coming years. HRP will cost approximately 2% of GDP in the medium-long term. Considering the current path of government revenues, this is fiscally unsustainable, and government will face a menu of options in the near future: reallocating current expenditures in favor of health sector spending; increasing tax revenues, including imposing new health sector linked corrective taxes; and reforming HRP so that it places less of burden on public finance spending.

As the change in the law was foreseen, we argue that check issuance behavior was altered before the new law became official. To capture this, we use the cumulative volume of internet search queries related to the upcoming legal change. We find that, unlike the case during the global financial crisis of 2008-09, the surge in bad checks occurring in 2011-12 cannot be accounted for by the state of the economic environment unless the effects of the February 2012 law change are also controlled for. We also provide evidence that economic agents adjust fairly rapidly to the legal change, which reverses the surge in bad checks within a year. Overall, our findings suggest that sanctions need not be harsh to deter non-violent offenses provided that appropriate institutional structures are in place. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis is based on the input-output model, which provides an appropriate and unique approach for measuring the total CO2 content of the various commodities taking the entire production chain into account. The calculation by products can be the basis for the estimation of product specific CO2 taxes. The model calculations based on the input-output table for the EU-27 for the year 2011 leads to the tax rate of 40.69 euros per tonne of CO2 emissions, which could have generated fiscal revenue in the amount of 1% of EU GDP. In line with the principle of fiscal neutrality, a reduction of the labour costs by -2.03% could compensate the introduction of a CO2 tax by the amount of 40.69 euros per tonne of CO2. The cost push effects lead to change of relative prices in favour of environmentally produced goods and services.","[Luptacik, Mikulas] Univ Econ Bratislava, Dept Econ Policy, Fac Natl Econ, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Luptacik, Peter] Ind Wissensch Inst Wien, Vienna, Austria",University of Economics Bratislava,"Luptácik, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Dept Econ Policy, Fac Natl Econ, Bratislava, Slovakia.",mikulas.luptacik@wu.ac.at; p.luptacik@iwi.ac.at,,,"Agentura Ministerstva skolstva, vedy, vy skumu a sportu SR [VEGA 1/0810/15]","Agentura Ministerstva skolstva, vedy, vy skumu a sportu SR","We thank two anonymous reviewers for their helpful and constructive comments and suggestions while stressing that the remaining errors and omissions are entirely the responsibility of the authors.

Since opportunity costs in transmission and generation capacity are dependent, externalities arise when investment decisions are decentralized. Externalities are market failures which appear when a decision of a particular agent changes another agent's welfare, but not vice versa. When generation and transmission investment decisions are made separately, generation investment introduces negative externalities to transmission planning. A centralized multistage stochastic model is formulated for finding the Pareto optimal solution of investments in transmission and generation capacity. Using the model, we show some examples of externalities in transmission planning for the IEEE 24-bus test system and the Peruvian system. Finally, we found that for the Peruvian system simultaneous optimal planning of generation and transmission capacity gave significant savings, around $585 million, which represents 10% of the total cost.

We find that most individuals are time-inconsistent, and they exhibit varying degrees of present bias and perception of the commitment problem. Introducing a welfare component to the tax system can make individuals worse off by aggravating the commitment problem. Certain dynamic policy interventions carry sizeable commitment-related work incentives; for instance, a dynamic sanction triggered by past employment can be preferred by some individuals as a commitment device.","[Chan, Marc K.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Chan, MK (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",,,"Chan, Marc/0000-0002-1010-7587",,,,,49,8,8,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Network production occurs in that deposits and other funds raised are produced as intermediate products in stage 1 and those intermediate products are used to generate a portfolio of assets in stage 2. The dynamic technology links production periods via nonperforming loans (NPL) and carryover assets, which take the form of excess reserves. Carryover assets expand the future production possibility set while NPL shrink future production possibilities. We extend previous DN methods to measure the performance of three types of Japanese commercial banks: city banks, regional banks and second regional banks. We test for and find differences in the three bank technologies relative to a common technology. Such differences are likely due to different institutional and regulatory structures. Unlike previous DN studies, we also allow for a non-uniform abatement factor between previously-produced NPL and other inputs in stage 1 and between performing loans and NPL in the current period. Measured productivity change is greater when each bank faces their own group technology rather than the pooled technology consisting of all bank types.","[Fukuyama, Hirofumi] Fukuoka Univ, Fukuoka, Japan; [Weber, William L.] Southeast Missouri State Univ, Cape Girardeau, MO 63701 USA",Fukuoka University,"Fukuyama, H (通讯作者)，Fukuoka Univ, Fac Commerce, Jonan Ku, 8-19-1 Nanakuma, Fukuoka 8140180, Japan.",fukuyama@fukuoka-u.ac.jp,"Fukuyama, Hirofumi/J-3294-2012","Fukuyama, Hirofumi/0000-0002-8133-6299",,,,,61,16,17,1,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

Our major finding is that provided its policy is not too aggressive (in a sense detailed in the paper) the Central Bank is successful in achieving its goals. However, the existence of different equilibrium states of the economy, separated by phase boundaries (or dark corners), can cause the monetary policy itself to trigger instabilities and be counter-productive. In other words, the Central Bank must navigate in a narrow window: too little is not enough, too much leads to instabilities and wildly oscillating economies. This conclusion strongly contrasts with the prediction of DSGE models.","[Gualdi, Stanislao] Ecole Cent Paris, Lab Math, Appl Syst, F-92290 Chatenay Malabry, France; [Tarzia, Marco] Univ Pierre & Marie Curie Paris 6, Lab Phys Theor Mat, Condensee, 4 Pl Jussieu,Tour 12, F-75252 Paris 05, France; [Zamponi, Francesco] Ecole Normale Super, Lab Phys Theor, CNRS, UMR 8549, 24 Rue Lhomond, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Bouchaud, Jean-Philippe] CFM, 23 Rue Univ, F-75007 Paris, France; [Bouchaud, Jean-Philippe] Ecole Polytech, F-91120 Palaiseau, France",Universite Paris Saclay; Sorbonne Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut Polytechnique de Paris,"Gualdi, S (通讯作者)，Ecole Cent Paris, Lab Math, Appl Syst, F-92290 Chatenay Malabry, France.",stanislao.gualdi@gmail.com,"Zamponi, Francesco/B-4386-2008","Zamponi, Francesco/0000-0001-9260-1951",CRISIS project,CRISIS project,"This work was partially financed by the CRISIS project.

We find a positive and significant effect of foreign presence in both horizontally and vertically linked industries on domestic firm's investment rate, with larger effects arising from multinational presence in the supplying sectors. Quantitatively, a 2 percentage point increase in the presence of multinational suppliers increases the domestic firm's investment rate by 3.24 percentage points. We also find that this effect is larger for small and medium firms, private firms, nonexporters, firms that are not part of a chaebol, and for firms in external finance dependent industries. A similar 2 percentage point increase in the foreign presence in downstream sectors increases the investment rate of domestic suppliers by 0.55 percentage points. This effect is larger if the domestic firm is part of a chaebol, or is in a less external finance dependent industry.

In simultaneous best-of-three contests, subjects are predicted to make positive bids in all three battles, but we find that subjects often make positive bids in only two battles. In sequential contests, theory predicts sizable bids in the first battle and no bids in the subsequent battles. Contrary to this prediction, subjects significantly underbid in the first battle and overbid in subsequent battles. Consequently, instead of always ending in the second battle, contests often proceed to the third battle.

To this end, we construct a dynamic heterogeneous agent model, calibrate it with Brazilian data, and introduce a policy similar to the Brazilian Bolsa Familia. Our results suggest that this type of policy has a very strong impact on educational outcomes, sharply increasing primary school completion. The conditional transfer is also able to reduce the share of working children from 22% to 17%. We then compute the transition to the new steady state and show that the program actually increases child labor over the short run, because the transfer is not enough to completely cover the schooling costs, so children have to work to be able to comply with the program's schooling eligibility requirement. We also evaluate the impacts on poverty, inequality, and welfare.","[Peruffo, Marcel] Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Ferreira, Pedro Cavalcanti] Fundacao Getulio Vargas, FGV EPGE Escola Brasileira Econ & Financas, BR-1125 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Ferreira, Pedro Cavalcanti] Fundacao Getulio Vargas, FGV Growth & Dev, BR-1125 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",Brown University; Escola de Pos-Graduacao em Economia (EPGE); Getulio Vargas Foundation; Getulio Vargas Foundation; Escola de Pos-Graduacao em Economia (EPGE),"Peruffo, M (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",marcel_peruffo@brown.edu; ferreira@fgv.br,"Ferreira, Pedro/HDO-1346-2022; Ferreira, Pedro/JXY-5442-2024",,CNPq-Brazil; FAPERJ; Capes; INCT,CNPq-Brazil(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); FAPERJ(Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ)); Capes(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); INCT,"The authors would like to thank Cezar Santos, Fernando Veloso, two anonymous referees, and seminar participants at EPGE/FGV, Banco de Portugal, and Cerdi for useful suggestions and comments.

Using the modified bootstrap-rolling window approach, the empirical results reveal a significant directional predictability from oil uncertainty to the CDS spreads of most of those oil-exporting countries during the subperiods 2010-2011 and 2014-2015 (that is, during the periods when oil volatility follows a rising trend). The most significant directional predictability is found for Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Norway, particularly during the 2014-2015 oil price collapse subperiod, whereas there is no directional predictability found in the case of Brazil. For Mexico, the oil market uncertainty predicts CDS spreads mostly during 2014, and for Venezuela, the directional predictability flows are highly impactful and concentrated during 2011-13. To check the robustness of our estimations, we use a novel quantile dependence measure called the crossquantilogram that was developed by Han et al. (2016). The estimation results of this approach confirm our main findings and indicate that the surge in oil volatility predicts the CDS spreads in different quantiles. Overall, the findings highlight that the sovereign credit risk of the GCC and the other oil-exporting countries is at least partially driven or directionally predicted by the oil volatility shocks. This has important implications for investment and policy decisions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, we introduce a new puzzle for the profession: Given the magnitude of the Baby Boom, roughly equal to fertility in 1900 for many of these countries, why did schooling of the Baby Boom cohorts not fall to the 1900 level of their predecessors? In fact, not only did it not fall, but the schooling levels of these cohorts are higher than for previous cohorts. Using a quantitative model, we are able to identify the magnitude of the reduction in costs of education necessary to explain this paradoxical increase in schooling.

Surprisingly, this effect is not driven by electoral competition inflating office-holders' promises. Instead, elected office-holders feel more committed to their promises than their randomly appointed counterparts.

Both descriptive results and regressions controlling for life cycle wealth accumulation show that families of color and less-educated families are falling behind in wealth recovery because their wealth portfolios are concentrated in housing, which has recovered very slowly.

One key contributor to the lack of general success is that the change that has been demonstrated to be beneficial is not adopted to the extent that would be optimal.

For conventional generation technologies, the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is a well-known metric. In the context of electricity storage however, such LCOE-like metrics are only limitedly applicable as the finite energy storage capacity can limit the charge and discharge scheduling decisions of the storage operator. In addition, the fuel, i.e., charged electricity, and generated electricity, i.e., discharged electricity, is one and the same commodity which provides the opportunity to use an adapted levelized cost metric. This work analyzes three different levelized cost metrics and their application to electricity storage units used for electric energy arbitrage. The strengths and shortcomings of these storage cost metrics are analyzed in order to determine how they can be applied correctly. This analysis results in the following recommendations. First, it is recommended to use a levelized cost metric in combination with an analysis of a representative price profile upon which the storage operator will act. This allows a more accurate estimation of the number of charging and discharging hours and the associated charging cost and discharging revenue, given the energy storage capacity constraints of the storage unit. Second, when a number of different representative price profiles, hence with different charging costs, is available, it is recommended to use a cost metric which is independent of the charging cost as this single metric can be compared to each price profile, thereby facilitating the interpretation of the results.

To do so, we model the demographic and fiscal transitions of the Russian Federation under free trade and autarky. Unlike previous studies of sanctions, our paper utilizes a large-scale overlapping generations model with productivity growth, demographic change, region-specific policies, and an energy sector. This model is uniquely suited to understanding the long-term impacts of different trade and fiscal regimes. This paper investigates the most dramatic sanctions possible, forcing Russia into long-term autarky under a variety of scenarios. The scenarios differ with regard to the sanction's effect on the energy sector, labor productivity, and the enactment of Russian capital controls. We find that elderly Russians are hurt the most by sanctions. When Russia seizes foreign assets, this is in part because of lower interest rates on the assets of retirees. When the sanctions also reduce Russian government energy revenues, the elderly are hurt through increased consumption taxation. In all scenarios but the most benign, all existing generations are made worse off.","[Benzell, Seth G.] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Benzell, Seth G.] MIT, Initiat Digital Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Lagarda, Guillermo] Interamer Dev Bank, Washington, DC USA",Boston University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Inter-American Development Bank,"Benzell, SG (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA.;Benzell, SG (通讯作者)，MIT, Initiat Digital Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",sbenzell@mit.edu; glagard@bu.edu,,"Benzell, Seth/0000-0002-8005-5014",,,,,56,3,3,3,34,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

What other factors influence individual perception of this phenomenon? To answer these questions, we must first clarify how scholars define and measure inequality of opportunity. We discuss the possible mechanisms linking objective measures to subjective perception of the phenomenon, then propose a measure of perceived inequality of opportunity, and finally test our hypothesis by merging data from two sources: the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (2011) and the International Social Survey Programme (2009). We suggest that the prevailing perception of the degree of unequal opportunity in a large sample of respondents is only weakly correlated with its objective measure. We estimate a multilevel model considering both individual-and country-level controls to explain individual perception of unequal opportunity. Our estimates suggest that the two most adopted measures of inequality of opportunity have no clear role in explaining its perception. Conversely, other country-level variables and personal experiences of intergenerational social mobility are important determinants of how inequality of opportunity is perceived.","[Brunori, Paolo] Univ Bari, Bari, Italy",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro,"Brunori, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bari, Dept Econ, Largo Abbazia S Scolastica 53, I-70124 Bari, Italy.",paolo.brunori@uniba.it,"brunori, paolo/AAR-3720-2020","brunori, paolo/0000-0002-1624-905X",,,,,51,22,24,4,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

We use the weak axiom of revealed preference (WARP) to test for external consistency relative to pairwise choice, and demand, wealth and impatience monotonicity to test for internal consistency. We find that choices made by subjects in the original Andreoni and Sprenger (Am Econ Rev 102(7):3333-3356, 2012a) paper violate WARP frequently; violations of all three internal measures of monotonicity are concentrated in subjects who take advantage of the novel feature of CTB by making interior choices. Wealth monotonicity violations are more prevalent and pronounced than either demand or impatience monotonicity violations. We substantiate the importance of our desiderata of choice consistency in examining effort allocation choices made in Augenblick et al. (Q J Econ 130(3):1067-1115, 2015), where we find considerably more demand monotonicity violations, as well as many classical monotonicity violations which are associated with time inconsistent behavior. We believe that the frequency and magnitude of WARP and monotonicity violations found in the two studies pose important confounds for interpreting and structurally estimating choice patterns elicited through CTB. We encourage researchers employing CTB in present and future experiments to include consistency tests in their design and pre-estimation analysis.","[Chakraborty, Anujit; Halevy, Yoram] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver Sch Econ, 6000 Iona Dr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1L4, Canada; [Calford, Evan M.] Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, Dept Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Fenig, Guidon] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Econ, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A5, Canada",University of British Columbia; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; University of Saskatchewan,"Halevy, Y (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Vancouver Sch Econ, 6000 Iona Dr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1L4, Canada.",yoram.halevy@ubc.ca,"Halevy, Yoram/A-7001-2010","Fenig, Guidon/0000-0001-8886-4986; Calford, Evan/0000-0002-9059-4847; Halevy, Yoram/0000-0002-0638-5963",SSHRC [435-2012-0577],SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"We are grateful to the Editor, the anonymous referees, Jim Andreoni, Charlie Sprenger, and our colleagues David Freeman and Jonathan Graves for their comments and suggestions.

The analysis includes forward-looking as well as static expectations and allows for different types of structural break. The variable depicting the deviation from strict UIP is stationary when expectations are forward looking, suggesting that it is not possible to reject the UIP hypothesis with a constant risk premium. The deviation from strict UIP is however typically not stationary when expectations are static, even when structural breaks are incorporated, leading to the rejection of the UIP hypothesis with a constant risk premium. The results underscore the central role of expectations for the UIP hypothesis.","[Cuestas, Juan Carlos] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Filipozzi, Fabio; Staehr, Karsten] Tallinn Univ Technol, Eesti Pank, Tallinn, Estonia",University of Sheffield; Tallinn University of Technology; Bank of Estonia (Eesti Pank),"Staehr, K (通讯作者)，Tallinn Univ Technol, Dept Econ & Finance, Akad Tee 3-486, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia.",karsten.staehr@ttu.ee,"Staehr, Karsten/G-4707-2016; Cuestas, Juan Carlos/K-4270-2014","Staehr, Karsten/0000-0002-2128-6672; Cuestas, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-7313-2157","Generalitat Valenciana project [AICO/2016/038]; MINECO (Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Spain) [ECO2014-58991-C3-2-R]","Generalitat Valenciana project(Center for Forestry Research & Experimentation (CIEF)); MINECO (Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Spain)(Spanish Government)","Generalitat Valenciana project Grant/Award Number AICO/2016/038; MINECO (Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Spain) Grant/Award Number ECO2014-58991-C3-2-R",,35,4,4,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

In contrast, this paper illustrates how relationship-based contract governance accommodates new entrants into market exchange using a case study of the cycle-rickshaw rental market in a city in central India. Migrants face a higher penalty for default that introduces a gap between the ex ante risk for out-of-network agents and the ex post risk. As a result, cycle-rickshaw owners are more likely to rent to migrants and migrants are more likely to participate in rental contracts. With primary data on multidimensional measures of migrant status, we confirm that migrant status is a significant predictor of rental contract participation, even controlling for other variables that moderate the rickshaw driver's ability to own a cycle-rickshaw. Our findings thus introduce a new perspective into current understandings of relationship-based contract governance.","[Jain, Tarun] Indian Sch Business, Econ & Publ Policy Area, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Sood, Ashima] NALSAR Univ Law, Ctr Management Studies, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India",Indian School of Business (ISB),"Jain, T (通讯作者)，Indian Sch Business, Econ & Publ Policy Area, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India.",tj9d@virginia.edu; asjsood@gmail.com,"Sood, Ashima/AAL-5829-2021; Sood, Ashima/HCI-3573-2022; Jain, Tarun/E-4377-2015","Sood, Ashima/0000-0003-1036-7589; Jain, Tarun/0000-0002-2634-7614",,,,,45,0,0,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

This positive relationship remains statistically significant at the one percent level after controlling for other characteristics that may independently affect wagering decisions, such as scores, clue categories, time trends, individual Jeopardy! experience, and player-fixed effects. Exploiting within-player variation only, raising the anchoring amount by $100 translates to an increase of $29 in the wager.

The research indicates that the co-movements of business cycles are influenced more through the intra-industry trade channel than by the total volume of trade itself. As trade integration among Asian countries increased, business cycle synchronization among these countries was expected to expand through trade transmission. Inter-industry trade resulting in higher specialization will induce less synchronized business cycles, while intra-industry trade could lead to increased business cycle synchronization. Moreover, I find that increased business cycle synchronization, as one of the optimum currency area criteria, is overemphasized.","[Li, Linyue] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Li, LY (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",linlinyue312@cufe.edu.cn,,", LINYUE/0000-0003-2690-7623",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71503284],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This article was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.71503284).,,26,9,10,3,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

I study this question in a version of the model of Diamond and Dybvig (1983) with limited commitment and a non-trivial portfolio choice. I show that the relationship between these interest rates and financial fragility is often non-monotone. For example, a small increase in the return on illiquid investment (or a small increase in the term premium) may raise banks' susceptibility to a run, while a larger increase would make the banking system more stable. The same is true for changes in short-term rates, holding the longer-term rates fixed. I provide a precise characterization of these comparative statics of financial fragility. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Using male height data drawn from the military enlistment records of the period between 1870 and 2000, this paper explores inequality and regional convergence in both countries. This long period was characterised by economic growth and the increase of human welfare. Regional inequality and convergence are analysed using sigma and beta convergence, a methodology based on panel data to obtain the speed of convergence. The results show that in 1850 height measurements started at low levels, but the two countries recorded a significant increase in the average height over the long term, which became more intense in Italy from the beginning of the twentieth century and in Spain from 1950. Therefore, there was divergence in the first half of the century and strong convergence at the end of the century. Regional inequality was more significant in the Italian case. Processes of regional convergence can be observed in both countries during the second half of the twentieth century, although inequality was lower in Spain than in Italy at the end of the period.","[Miguel Martinez-Carrion, Jose; Maria-Dolores, Ramon] Univ Murcia, Murcia, Spain",University of Murcia,"Martínez-Carrión, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Murcia, Murcia, Spain.",,"Martínez-Carrión, José-Miguel/E-4219-2016","Martínez-Carrión, José-Miguel/0000-0002-8918-8833","MICINN-FEDER-EU [HAR2010-20684-C02-02]; MINECO-FEDER-EU [HAR2013-47182-C2-2-P, HAR2016-76814-C2-2-P]; Seneca Foundation; Science and Technology Agency of the Region of Murcia [P-19512/PI/14]",MICINN-FEDER-EU(European Union (EU)Spanish Government); MINECO-FEDER-EU; Seneca Foundation(Fundacion Seneca); Science and Technology Agency of the Region of Murcia,"Preliminary versions were presented at the International Congress of Economic History (Cuernavaca 2007), and economic history seminars at the universities of Roma Tre, Carlos III (Madrid), Pablo Olavide (Seville), Alicante, Autonoma de Barcelona, Institute of Regional Development (La Laguna), and DEcIDE Doctorate (Murcia).

We circumvent these obstacles via a natural macro experiment in the virtual game World of Warcraft. This simplified environment allows us to model and calculate the band of inaction, and test for PPP across eight replicas of the game. In addition, our data covers a major aggregate shock to the game, called Cataclysm, which lets us observe markets' reactions to the shock, and track price levels of newly created goods. We find that price levels remain Within the band of inaction, and are highly correlated. When price levels diverge, arbitrage opportunities arise, and the price level differentials quickly become mean-reverting. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This question from jurisprudence has recently been tackled using the tools of economics. The field of law and economics has long studied how fines and imprisonment affect behavior. Nobody believes, however, that all compliance is motivated by penalties, and it is questionable whether that is even the typical motivation. Two books published in 2015, Frederick Schauer's The Force of Law and Richard McAdams's The Expressive Powers of Law: Theories and Limits, consider alternative motivations-Schauer skeptically and McAdams more sympathetically. While coercion, either directly or in support of internalized norms, seems to dominate law qua law (and not as a mere expression of morality), a considerable portion of law serves other uses such as coordination, information provision, expression, and reduction of transaction costs.","[Rasmusen, Eric] Indiana Univ, Dept Business Econ & Publ Policy, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; IU Kelley School of Business,"Rasmusen, E (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Dept Business Econ & Publ Policy, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",,,,,,,,58,0,0,0,11,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

Estimating the user cost elasticity raises serious simultaneity problems because of the large fluctuations in investment demand at business cycle frequencies. If shifts in the supply curve (due to technological change and tax reforms) are more persistent than shifts in demand, cointegration techniques, which emphasize long run movements, can reduce the simultaneity problem. If shocks to capital demand are partially idiosyncratic, the use of firm-level panel data should also reduce the simultaneity problem. In this paper, we therefore use cointegration techniques to estimate the user cost elasticity on panel data. Specifically, we employ a newly constructed data set with a long time series of firm-level data on the capital stock and with detailed industry-specific data on the interest rate, the price of investment goods, risk, and taxes.

Although SACCOs form the majority of microfinance providers in many developing countries, the most recent literature on microfinance governance and performance has given little reference to the longstanding body of relevant cooperative literature. SACCO representation in microfinance datasets is biased. Drawing on so-far unexploited datasets of Ugandan SACCOs and savings groups, this paper empirically analyses policy debate regarding SACCO- and savings group regulation. The findings point to the relevance of practically implementing the principle of cooperation between cooperatives' to ensure effective governance at SACCO level. Moreover, the paper introduces two new measures, based on members' savings and shares, which could become useful tools to track the application of cooperative principles in developing countries, and hence improve evidence-based policy-making for SACCOs.","[Schmidt, Oliver] Mt Moon Univ, Ft Portal, Uganda",,"Schmidt, O (通讯作者)，Mt Moon Univ, Ft Portal, Uganda.",oliver.schmidt@mmu.ac.ug,,"Schmidt, Oliver/0000-0003-4746-2221",,,,,59,3,4,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

Although there are several alternative approaches trying to explain business cycles in emerging markets by modeling different shocks and transmission mechanisms, there is little direct evidence about exogenous shocks and their transmission in emerging markets. Using a newly constructed dataset on disaster events, I test how emerging markets respond to actual exogenous shocks in a dynamic panel distributed lag model. This approach allows me to identify the dynamic effects of shocks on macroeconomic variables while controlling for unobserved global shocks, unobserved time invariant characteristics of different countries and the possible serial correlations in macroeconomic aggregates. My results show that political shocks and terrorist attacks can drive business cycles in emerging markets, having a significant and long-lasting negative effect on output and the domestic components of aggregate absorption. I also test whether savings, investments and the current account respond to these shocks as suggested by forward-looking models.","[Wang, Yabin] Williams Coll, Dept Econ, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA",Williams College,"Wang, YB (通讯作者)，Williams Coll, Dept Econ, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA.",elvalife@gmail.com,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Moreover, we investigate whether the (relative) weights of these factors differ by gender. We use data on individuals' expectations regarding future labor market outcomes which we directly elicited from the youths, and two different measures of marriage market returns. First, marriage market returns are proxied by the (net-)supply of potential partners in the youths' local marriage markets. Second, we use data which elicits youths' beliefs about their future spouse's earnings conditional on their own education level. We find that labor market as well as marriage market returns are important determinants of the college enrollment decision. However, boys' and girls' preferences differ in terms of the relative role of the two determinants, in that the relative weight of labor market versus marriage market returns is larger for boys than for girls.

We find that inequality was strongly countercyclical: it increased around the 1993 recession, experienced a substantial decrease during the 1997-2007 expansion and then a sharp increase during the recent recession. This evolution went in parallel with the cyclicality of employment in the lower middle part of the wage distribution. Our findings highlight the importance of the housing boom and bust in this evolution, suggesting that demand shocks in the construction sector had large effects on aggregate labour market outcomes.","[Hospido, Laura] Banco Espana, Alcala 48, Madrid 28014, Spain; Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; IZA, Bonn, Germany",Banco de Espana; University of Chicago; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Hospido, L (通讯作者)，Banco Espana, Alcala 48, Madrid 28014, Spain.",laura.hospido@bde.es,,,European Research Council/ERC [0263107],European Research Council/ERC(European Research Council (ERC)),"We thank Jorge de la Roca for his help with the data in early stages of this project.

In the standard no-competition setup of Coate and Loury (1993), we do not find systematic evidence for statistical discrimination. When we introduce competition between workers of different groups for the same job, the non-discrimination equilibrium ceases to be stable. In line with this theoretical observation, we find systematic discrimination in the experimental treatment with competition. Nevertheless, a substantial minority of the employers refuses to discriminate even when it is in their best interest to do so.","[de Haan, Thomas] Norwegian Sch Econ, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway; Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); University of Amsterdam,"de Haan, T (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Econ, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway.",thomas.dehaan@nhh.no,,"Offerman, Theo/0000-0002-3469-8334",Research Priority Area Behavioral Economics,Research Priority Area Behavioral Economics,"This research was sponsored by the Research Priority Area Behavioral Economics.

As a result, softening migration rules leads to lower net inflows than is generally acknowledged. We show that if government follows rules to shape the optimal migration policy, it will choose more open borders than were its behaviour to be discretionary. However, this requires an appropriate commitment technology. We show that electoral accountability may be a solution to the commitment problem.

The refinery may hedge against the downside risk of unfavorable price movements using crude oil, gasoline, and heating oil futures. This paper examines the use of a vine copula approach to estimate multiproduct hedge ratios that minimize the downside risk of the refinery. The advantage of the vine copula approach is that it allows us to capture important characteristics of petroleum price changes, including skewness and fat-tailedness in the marginal distributions of individual price change series as well as heterogeneous (tail) dependence patterns between different pairs of price changes. The out-of-sample hedging effectiveness of two popular classes of vine copula models - canonical (C-) and drawable (D-) vine copula models - are evaluated and compared with that of the widely used nonparametric method and three standard multivariate copula models. The empirical results reveal that the D-vine copula model is a good and safe choice in managing the downside risk of the refinery. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The survey comprises about 70 empirical papers published during the past 15years. Four main strands are discussed individually and collectively. They comprise the proposed: (i) West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ), (ii) East African Monetary Union (EAMU), (iii) Southern African Monetary Union (SAMU) and (iv) African Monetary Union (AMU). We observe a number of issues with establishing the feasibility and/or desirability of potential monetary unions, inter alia, they are variations in: choice of variables, empirical strategies, sampled countries and considered periodicities. We address this ambiguity by reviewing studies with scenarios that are consistent with Hegelian dialectics and establish selective expansion as the predominant mode of monetary integration. Some proponents make cases for strong pegs and institutions as viable alternatives to currency unions. Using cluster analysis, disaggregating panels into sub-samples and distinguishing shocks from responses in the examination of business cycle synchronisation provide more subtle policy implications. We caution that for inquiries using the same theoretical underpinnings, variables and methods just by modifying the scope/context and periodicity may only contribute to increasing the number of conflicting findings. Authors should place more emphasis on new perspectives and approaches based on caveats of, and lessons from the European Monetary Union (EMU) and CFA zones.","[Asongu, Simplice; Tchamyou, Vanessa] African Governance & Dev Inst, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Nwachukwu, Jacinta] Coventry Univ, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Tchamyou, Vanessa] Univ Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium",African Governance & Development Institute; Coventry University; University of Antwerp,"Asongu, S (通讯作者)，African Governance & Dev Inst, Yaounde, Cameroon.",asongusimplice@yahoo.com,"Simplice, Asongu/K-3436-2014","Simplice, Asongu/0000-0001-5227-5135",,,,,83,19,20,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

This paper revisits four historical refugee shocks to document their labour market impact. Specifically, we examine: The influx of Marielitos into Miami in 1980; the influx of French repatriates and Algerian nationals into France at the end of the Algerian Independence War in 1962; the influx of Jewish emigres into Israel after the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s; and the exodus of refugees from the former Yugoslavia during the long series of Balkan wars between 1991 and 2001. We use a common empirical approach, derived from factor demand theory, and publicly available data to measure the impact of these shocks. Despite the differences in the political forces that motivated the various flows, and in economic conditions across receiving countries, the evidence reveals a common thread that confirms key insights of the canonical model of a competitive labour market: Exogenous supply shocks adversely affect the labour market opportunities of competing natives in the receiving countries, and often have a favorable impact on complementary workers. In short, refugee flows can have large distributional consequences.","[Monras, Joan] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; IZA, Cambridge, MA USA; CEMFI, Cambridge, MA USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Monras, J (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"Monras, Joan/R-4171-2018","Monras, Joan/0000-0002-0764-9094",,,,,37,69,77,5,42,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

We demonstrate this by studying donation-visibility in a charitable-giving environment. Past studies show that donation-visibility increases giving and argue that this is consistent with donations signaling generosity or income and thereby improving donors' status. However, this explanation relies on status being one-dimensional, acquired from only one attribute: generosity or income. The response may differ when instead status is multidimensional, depending on both attributes. Donors who prefer to be perceived as poor and-generous rather than rich-and-stingy may give less when donations are visible. Using an experiment we examine the effect of donation-visibility when donations can signal multiple attributes. Revealing concerns for both income-and generosity-status, we find, in contrast to the one-attribute setting, that donation-visibility does not increase giving when donations signal both attributes.

It then derives conditions that are sufficient for this weaker condition to hold and whose plausibility can easily be assessed in applications.

This paper highlights three that are of critical importance: the challenge of absorbing massive Chinese savings; the incorporation of China into a cohesive global financial safety net; and the organisation of China's participation in funding the demand for international investment projects. The global financial architecture needs to be reformed. But what role should China play? The paper defines the options open to China and the opportunities and barriers it will face. We argue that China can work with the established economic powers in reforming the existing architecture. At the same time, China seeks cooperation in building new institutions and organisations that fill gaps in the existing arrangements. But no matter how international financial diplomacy plays out in the near term, deep financial and economic reform at home will alone deliver China a central role in the international financial architecture. Domestic reform could also attend to some of the challenges that currently plague China's impact on the system. The success or failure of these domestic reforms will be at the crux of the strength or fragility of the international financial architecture in the years ahead.","[Drysdale, Peter; Triggs, Adam; Wang, Jiao] Australian Natl Univ, JG Crawford Bldg,132 Lennox Crossing, Acton, ACT 0200, Australia; [Wang, Jiao] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Australian National University; University of Melbourne,"Triggs, A (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, JG Crawford Bldg,132 Lennox Crossing, Acton, ACT 0200, Australia.",adam.triggs@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,29,8,8,1,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1832-8105,1748-3131,,ASIAN ECON POLICY R,Asian Econ.

To address the problem of sorting into legal status, we propose two alternative identification strategies as exogenous source of variation for current legal status: First, transitory income shocks in the home country, measured as rainfall shocks at the time of emigration. Second, amnesty quotas that grant legal residence status to undocumented immigrants. Both sources of variation create a strong first stage, and-although very different in nature-lead to similar estimates of the effects of illegal status on consumption, with undocumented immigrants consuming about 40% less than documented immigrants, conditional on background characteristics. Roughly one quarter of this decrease is explained by undocumented immigrants having lower incomes than documented immigrants.

This split, however, can appear to be arbitrary. We provide a way of splitting the drivers that takes account of any nonlinearity that may be present in the data, with the aim of removing the arbitrary element in driver selection.

But in general such rewards are just a small part of the design of incentives. Properly designed incentive systems have to take into account the full portfolio of activities that the agent can engage in, the array of instruments, many nonfinancial, that are available to influence individuals and consider the factors that motivate them in different settings. Thinking about incentives as a system of interacting instruments and influences has been a major advance in the economics of incentives in recent years.

As an identification strategy, panel data is used to estimate a structural innovation model that controls for unobserved heterogeneity combined with matching techniques that help ensure comparability between subsidized and non-subsidized firms. The findings reveal that public subsidies reduce firms' economic performance in lower and higher technology industries despite promoting indigenous innovation in the higher technology industries. Policymakers may tolerate lower average efficiency if they expect that some of the state-backed firms will eventually become successful innovators that go on to generate significantly large social welfare payoffs. Although the findings do not support such an expectation, thus bringing into question whether the social payoff from China's so-called picking 'winners' strategy justifies the cost.","[Howell, Anthony] Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Howell, A (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",tonyjhowell@picu.edu.cn,,"Howell, Anthony/0000-0002-4211-0190",School of Economics at Peking University; Natural Science Foundation of China [71603009],School of Economics at Peking University; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The author acknowledges funding support from the School of Economics at Peking University and the Natural Science Foundation of China No. 71603009.,,31,94,98,9,75,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

To establish causality, we create time-varying instrumental variables which rely only on the spatially extended network of Jewish communities in order to predict Jewish presence in a given city.

Depending on the output function various prize structures can be optimal. If the output function depends much more on efforts applied at later stages than on those applied at the earlier ones, the optimal prize structure can be non-monotone, that is, at some stages prizes fall and the agents who are more successful may earn less. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimality of such structures are provided. We also show that for any increasing prize shape there exists an output function such that this prize shape is optimal. Further, we consider the case of limited liability, where the principal is not allowed to use negative prizes but can choose a contest success function (CSF). There is always an efficient equilibrium under which the principal is able to extract the full surplus from the agents and the corresponding optimal prize structure is always increasing. Moreover, under some plausible assumptions, the optimal CSF is necessary convex, which corresponds to the most frequently used prize schemes in practice. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We demonstrate that unemployment exhibits high persistence. It is also closely associated with business cycle fluctuations, albeit mostly in economies under adjustment programmes (Spain, Ireland, Italy and Portugal). Evidence on the association between labour and product market institutions and unemployment remains inconclusive. The effect of large fiscal consolidation episodes on unemployment is consistently positive and significant, especially during the crisis period (2008-13) and in countries with strict employment protection regulation. High growth rates of GDP that reflect economic activity rebound, may partly neutralize the positive and significant impact of fiscal consolidation on unemployment.","[Papapetrou, Evangelia] Univ Athens, Athens, Greece; Bank Greece, Athens, Greece",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; European Central Bank; Bank of Greece,"Papapetrou, E (通讯作者)，Univ Athens, Athens, Greece.",,"Papapetrou, Evangelia/AAL-6616-2021","Papapetrou, Evangelia/0000-0002-0001-3341",,,,,39,4,4,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

Using data from 44 emerging market countries over the period 1995-2008, we investigate the relationship between financial development, CFMs, and the share of debt in external liabilities as the measure of financial stability risks. We find that financial sector development is an important channel for the effectiveness of CFMs, and enhances the impact of different policy measures on the reduction of external debt liabilities. Our results show that CFMs are significantly more effective in curbing debt inflows in a bank-based economy but, to a lesser extent, in a market-based economy.

The results of this research can be summarised as follows: (1) Inflation targeting regime has a weak positive effect on inflation rate performance; (2) There is no significant relationship between inflation targeting regime and growth rate; (3) There is a positive but a weak relationship between inflation targeting regime and exchange rate performance; and (4) Inflation targeting regime has a strong positive effect on nominal interest rate performance. Thus, these results support the argument in the literature that inflation targeting affects macroeconomic performance positively except for growth rate'. Thus, the post-2002 inflation-targeting regime, whether rule-based or occasional, has led to some improvements in other macroeconomic indicators, even though the primary aim of monetary policy instruments is to bring down the rate of inflation. Such stability-assuring policies enable investors to invest in a more trustable environment.","[Eroglu, Ilhan] Gaziosmanpasa Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Econ, Tokat, Turkey; [Cinar, Mehmet] Uludag Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Econometr, Bursa, Turkey; [Eroglu, Nadir] Marmara Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey",Gaziosmanpasa University; Uludag University; Marmara University,"Eroglu, I (通讯作者)，Gaziosmanpasa Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Econ, Tokat, Turkey.",ieroglu71@hotmail.com,"ÇINAR, Mehmet/AEM-7670-2022",,,,,,55,0,1,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We find that Islamic banks are more capitalized, more liquid and more profitable, but have more volatile earnings compared to US and European banks. However, similarities in terms of liquidity and earnings volatility are more noticeable when the sample is limited to banks operating in countries where both systems coexist.

Chung and Ely used a maxmin approach to define robust optimality. Chung and Ely provided conditions under which dominant strategy auctions are robustly optimal in their sense. This comment proposes a refinement of Chung and Ely's criterion and shows that, with this refined criterion, dominant strategy auctions are not optimal if there are at least three bidders. According to the refinement the auctioneer should not choose dominated auctions, that is, auctions for which there exist other mechanisms that never generate lower expected revenue, and sometimes higher expected revenue. We construct such a dominating mechanism for dominant strategy auctions. The construction exploits the possibility of side bets when beliefs are not derived from common priors.

In a recent article, Hodgson (2014) advises economists to return to this pre-Smithian usage of the term. This paper takes up Hodgson's demand and develops a theory of capital that is based upon this business notion of capital. It also argues that the Austrian theory of capital, if interpreted correctly, can serve as a starting point. Despite the conviction of its adherents to the contrary, the Austrian theory of capital is not universal or ahistorical, but dovetails with Hodgson's vision of an approach to capital that analyses historically specific features of capitalism.","[Braun, Eduard] Tech Univ Clausthal, Inst Management & Econ, Julius Albert Str 2, D-38678 Clausthal Zellerfeld, Germany",TU Clausthal,"Braun, E (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Clausthal, Inst Management & Econ, Julius Albert Str 2, D-38678 Clausthal Zellerfeld, Germany.",eduard.braun@tu-clausthal.de,,"Braun, Eduard/0000-0002-1752-4287",,,,,38,14,16,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Using the Statistics Canada National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth, we find that married mothers of children with disabilities are less likely to engage in paid work and/or work fewer paid hours per week. No statistically significant changes in paid work participation or hours are apparent for fathers of the same children. We find, moreover, evidence that the degree of specialization within families increases when there is a child with a disability. These responses are consistent with traditional gender roles within families, and may make sense as a 'household' coping strategy.

The Family Medicine Program (FMP), launched in 2005, assigns each Turkish citizen to a specific state employed family physician who offers a wide range of primary healthcare services that are free-of-charge. Furthermore, these services are provided at family health centers, which operate on a walk-in basis and are located within neighborhoods in close proximity to the patients. To identify the causal impact of the FMP, we exploit the variation in its introduction across provinces and over time. Our estimates indicate that the FMP caused the mortality rate to decrease by 25.6% among infants, 7.7% among the elderly, and 22.9% among children ages 1-4. These estimates translate into 2.6, 129, and 0.13 fewer deaths among infants, the elderly, and children ages 1-4, respectively. Furthermore, the effects appear to strengthen over time. We also show evidence to suggest that the FMP has contributed to an equalization of mortality across provinces. Finally, our calculations indicate that each family physician saves about 0.15, 0.46, and 0.005 lives among infants, the elderly, and children ages 1-4 per province every year. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

SMEs in Slovakia, according to the latest data of the European Commission, represent 99.9 per cent of all enterprises, constitute 70.7 per cent of jobs, and 61.2 per cent of value added in the economy. However, they are often confronted with market imperfections. SMEs frequently have difficulties in obtaining capital or credit, particularly in the early start-up phase. Their restricted resources may also reduce access to new technologies or innovation. Authors often deal with the impact of SME financing on their development. Madrid-Guijarro et al. (2016), Lee et al. (2015) claim that SMEs have difficulty in funding innovation and the worsening in general credit conditions has been more pronounced for non-innovative firms. Purpose of the article: The main objective of the conducted research was to analyze the conditions for the development of small and medium enterprises (the SMEs sector) in Slovak Republic, whereas the specific objectives were: - to determine the terms for gaining external sources of financing for the development of SMEs, - to examine the resources for innovation development in the SMEs sector, - to find out if SMEs are considered to be a competitive advantage. Methods: The research was conducted in the Slovak Republic in 2016. Participants were 193 Slovak companies that were classified as SMEs by the size class of employment.The research tool used for the study was the own questionnaire consisting of 38 questions and the demographics. The structure of the questionnaire allowed the authors to identify the group of questions concerning the most important conditions for the development of the examined sector referring to the business environment. The results were processed by chi-quare method. Findings & Value added: On the basis of the conducted research of the sector of SMEs, it can be concluded that a large group of companies have difficult access to external sources of financing and this refers both to the access to the European Union funds, grants, bank loans and other instruments of the financial market. However, it occurs that: - in Slovakia, the smaller the enterprise, i.e. the fewer employees it hires, the easier the access to external sources of financing, - innovative projects are realized from company profits or a loan, - problems in Slovakia in accessing external funds due to the complexity of the process of approval of applications and documents and strict criteria for the assessment of financial capacity.","[Ivanova, Eva] Alexander Dubcek Univ Trencin, Trencin, Slovakia",Alexander Dubcek University Trencin,"Ivanová, E (通讯作者)，Alexander Dubcek Univ Trencin, Fac Social & Econ Relat, Studentska 2, Trencin 91150, Slovakia.",eva.ivanova@tnuni.sk,,,,,,,22,33,34,4,47,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

We show that introducing ambiguity aversion will lower profits if the action that the principal wants to implement is the most ambiguous one, while they may increase otherwise. Regarding the design of the optimal contract, we show that under ambiguity aversion the optimal incentive scheme may not be monotone even if a natural generalization of the monotone likelihood ratio property is satisfied, and illustrate how this fact could affect the design of contracts in an applied economic context. We also find that the individual rationality constraint need not bind in the presence of ambiguity aversion unless preferences satisfy constant absolute ambiguity aversion.","[Kellner, Christian] Univ Southampton, Univ Rd, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",University of Southampton,"Kellner, C (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Univ Rd, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",c.kellner@soton.ac.uk,,"Kellner, Christian/0000-0003-3855-5418",,,,,23,6,6,0,1,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,1434-4750,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

Less well-known is that conventional price theory conflicts with empirical studies of price-setting in industrial firms. Post-Keynesian theory, which assumes mark-up pricing on normal costs and infrequent price changes, is consistent with observation, and we show in this paper that post-Keynesian pricing, unlike conventional pricing, features stable dynamics. We focus on the short run, because post-Keynesian theory posits complex and historically-contingent long-term price dynamics.

However, the factors driving different levels of resource misallocation still need to be investigated. This paper argues that firm exits through mergers can be an important source of change in the level of resource misallocation. Traditional policy regulations for the key manufacturing sectors are based on either the four-firm concentration ratio (CR4) or the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), which measure the market concentration. This paper takes a different approach. It first deduces the optimal input allocation by measuring aggregate resource misallocation; this approach allows us to identify productivity improving merger events and complements the market concentration indexes, which have traditionally been the focus of attention. We then construct a unique dataset in the TFT-LCD industry to analyze the change in productivity resulting from the merger between two major TFT-LCD producers, Chimei and Innolux, in the first quarter of 2010. The proposed and actual team of Chimei and Innolux record a remarkable efficiency jump by achieving optimal input allocation immediately after this merger. We further interpret this scenario as a firm that is smaller and more efficient pre-merger, acquiring a larger weaker producer in a prominent IT manufacturing sector.

Whereas that bureaucratic indirect tax, the excise, seems a natural part of a centralised and institutional Fiscal-military state, the Assessment appears mired in ancient practice. Yet this new tax was far heavier and more successful than any predecessor. This study attempts to explain that success, which continued as the eighteenth-century Land Tax, and proposes it was founded on well-designed administrative process and routine, engineered to tap rent-flows from an increasingly commercialised real estate sector. It was facilitated by effective and well-established local governors who had appropriate authority, capabilities and experience to operate that process, not always perfectly or fairly, but remarkably effectively for the state's purposes. Members of Parliament bore a significant administrative burden as centre came to locality in a most direct way to ensure national coordination and shared ownership of fiscal success between London and locality.

The results suggest that household carbon emissions are increasing non-monotonically with a non-existent turning point as households accumulate more assets. This is further supported by quintile estimates showing huge disparity in emissions between poor and rich households.

As a case study, this paper examines what happened when an activist investor came to DuPont, illustrating how its board knew that they were expected to make their end investors' best interests, even if that hurt other constituencies. This isn't a story about bad people, but a reminder to those genuinely concerned for non-shareholder constituencies to face reality and support changes in the power dynamics affecting corporate governance that make regard for non-shareholder constituencies an obligation for business.","[Strine, Leo E., Jr.] Delaware Supreme Court, Delaware, OH 43015 USA",,"Strine, LE (通讯作者)，Delaware Supreme Court, Delaware, OH 43015 USA.",Leo.Strine@state.de.us,,,,,,,50,13,13,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

The asymptotic mean of the planner's portfolio minimizes a measure of fiscal risk. We obtain analytic expressions that approximate moments of the invariant distribution and apply them to data on a primary government deficit, aggregate consumption, and returns on traded securities.

In this paper we unify a two-box climate model, which allows for heat and moisture transport from the southern region to the northern region, with an economic model of welfare optimization. Our main contribution is to show that by ignoring spatial heat and moisture transport and the resulting polar amplification, the regulator may overestimate or underestimate the tax on greenhouse gas emissions. The direction of bias depends on the relations between marginal damages from temperature increase in each region. We also determine the welfare cost when a regulator mistakenly ignores polar amplification. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical results, while ballpark estimates indicate that the tax bias could be as high as 20%, while welfare cost could reach 2% of global effective steady-state consumption.

Specifically, the fixed-price listing, the regular auction, and the buy-it-now (BIN) auction are each a solution of the seller's single optimization problem under different values of the rate of intertemporal discount: The perfectly patient seller adopts the regular auction, the sellers with a medium range of time impatience adopt the BIN auction, and the most impatient of sellers adopt the fixed-price listing. Moreover, under mild conditions, the reverse price is inversely related to the value of the seller's discount factor, either within or across formats. This in turn implies that the posted price in the fixed-price sale is greater than the reserve price of the BIN auction, followed by that of the regular auction.

For this, a new electricity module is developed in POLES (Prospective Outlook on Long-term Energy Systems). It now takes into account the impacts of VRES on the European power system. The power system operation relies on EUCAD (European Unit Commitment and Dispatch), which includes daily storage and other inter-temporal constraints. The innovative aspect of our work is the direct coupling between POLES and EUCAD, thus combining a long-term simulation horizon and a short-term approach for the power system operation. The storage technologies represented are pumped-hydro storage, lithium-ion batteries, adiabatic compressed air energy storage (a-CAES) and electric vehicles (charging optimisation and vehicle-to-grid). Demand response and European grid interconnections are also represented in order to include, to some extent, these flexibility options. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Individuals with different managerial talent choose to become entrepreneurs or workers. Entrepreneurs enhance firm productivity by investing in managerial capital. The model generates three income classes: low-income workers facing the prospect of unemployment, middle-income entrepreneurs managing domestic firms and high-income entrepreneurs managing global firms. Trade liberalization policies raise unemployment and improve welfare. A reduction in per-unit trade costs raises top incomes and generates labour-market polarization. A reduction in fixed exporting costs has an ambiguous effect on top incomes and personal income distribution. Policies reducing labour-market frictions or the costs of managerial-capital acquisition create more jobs and improve welfare. The income distributional effects of labour-market policies depend on which policy is implemented.","[Dinopoulos, Elias] Univ Florida, Dept Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Unel, Bulent] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Econ, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Unel, B (通讯作者)，Louisiana State Univ, Dept Econ, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",bunel@lsu.edu,,,,,,,47,12,13,1,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

This study takes a comprehensive view on policy-making by using a modified version of the Fraser Institute's Economic Freedom of the World Index. I focus on the aspects of economic freedom that provoke party polarization and that national governments are capable of influencing. The results suggest that government ideology still matters in the early 21st century: The empirical analysis of 36 OECD or new European Union member states from 2000 to 2012 shows that left-wing governments are associated with significantly lower economic freedom. Economic freedom continues to be the guiding principle that divides left and right in economic policy-making because the left still promotes relatively higher levels of government spending and regulation.","[Jaeger, Kai] Univ Mannheim, Dept Polit Sci, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany; [Jaeger, Kai] Mannheim Ctr European Social Res MZES, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",University of Mannheim,"Jäger, K (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Dept Polit Sci, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.;Jäger, K (通讯作者)，Mannheim Ctr European Social Res MZES, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",kai.jaeger@mzes.uni-mannheim.de,,,,,,,72,17,19,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,MAY,2017,70.0,2,,,,,256,277,,10.1111/kykl.12137,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,ER5LO,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000398843600004,0

Dual-blend ethanol mandates, in which multiple ethanol blends are simultaneously available, are one way policy markers can move forward with more aggressive mandates more quickly. The recent ethanol mandate in the state of New South Wales, Australia offers a unique natural experiment to quantify the potential environmental benefits and costs of a dual blend ethanol policy. This paper estimates the impact on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from road-activity that are attributable to the implementation of the New South Wales ethanol requirements. We find that there was a decrease in emissions due to the policy, but that the decrease is relatively minor given the size of the market and that it comes at a high cost.

We find that the optimal effort level under the principal's authority is at its highest when the agent is the most biased, while under the agent's authority it is also at its highest when the agent has an intermediate bias. Therefore, the principal should keep the authority and communicate with the agent when the agent is relatively biased, and delegate the authority when the agent has an intermediate bias. However, from the team's point of view where both players' payoffs are taken into account, the principal may delegate too much authority to a relatively unbiased agent, and too little authority to a relatively biased agent.

Current evidence on the energy savings that accrue from commercial building energy standards is based on engineering simulations, which do not account for realized behaviour once a standard is actually adopted. This paper uses quasi-experimental variation in commercial building energy standard adoptions to estimate their effect on realized electricity consumption and cost-effectiveness. In states induced by EPAct to adopt an energy standard where all new nonresidential construction was erected under a commercial standard, electricity consumption per service worker is lower by about 12%, and total commercial electricity consumption is lower by 10%. Including early adopters and never-adopters to the analysis leads to a downward bias in the treatment effect. The realized electricity savings in the EPAct states represent three quarters of predicted simulated savings, and electricity saved in 2010 came at a cost of approximately 7.7 cents per kWh.

To address this question, we examine a relationship between two players who periodically face opportunities to undertake randomly generated projects that impose a cost on one player and a benefit on the other, as well as opportunities to make voluntary transfers to one another. We characterize the set of equilibria, with particular emphasis on the efficient frontier. In the absence of transfers, incentives are often created by adjusting the continuation values of the relationship, sometimes increasing player l's continuation payoff (to induce player 1 to accept a particularly costly current project) and sometimes increasing player 2's continuation payoff. In contrast, once transfers enter the picture, continuation payoffs maximize the sum of the two players' payoffs, no matter how asymmetric the point on the Pareto frontier under consideration. However, transfers can also be relatively rare, and in particular can occur less often than the adjustments in continuation values that occur without transfers. Players thus rely on transfers to create incentives, but manage to do so while rarely making transfers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

(1993), where in equilibrium, asymmetrically-informed rational investors buy overvalued assets, hoping to sell them to less informed agents before the crash occurs. With reference dependent preferences, the asset price may not necessarily be observable to agents when there is no trade. However, this is never the case with classical preferences, as shown in the paper. Incorporating the classical model as a special case, we generalize the notion of bubbles to allow for the analysis in the case of a silent market with unobservable prices, and our model is able to generate strong bubbles robust to moderate perturbations in parameters without the need for stronger conditions as suggested in previous literature. Assuming for simplicity that dividends can only take on two values, we construct an example of a robust reference-dependent bubble which is not robust in the classical setting, and we also show that the positive results regarding the limit of the bubble size and bubble frequency in the classical setting are preserved in our framework. Our main results and economic implications remain valid in more general settings. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, the literature shows evidence that such decisions at least partly depend on nonwage benefits encompassed in jobs and occupations. In this paper, I develop and estimate a stochastic dynamic model of occupation and job choice, where nonwage benefits are directly incorporated into the decision alongside wages (a full model). Nested within the full model is a wage model, which represents the common practice in the literature of basing selection solely on wages and disregarding nonwage benefits. I separately estimate the full model and the nested wage model to compare the implications (biases) of omitting nonwage benefits. I compare the two models' estimates of elasticities and an inequality reduction intervention policy. I find that disregarding nonwage benefits generally causes biases. There are cases when the two models predict very similar outcomes and have close estimates, such as in occupation-specific elasticities and job transition elasticities. But these special cases are products of canceling biases. In most cases, ignoring nonwage benefits will bias estimates by overestimating the importance of wage in the selection process and by disregarding changes in relative prices between wage and nonwage benefits.

This paper interprets China's housing boom as a rational bubble emerging naturally from its economic transition. The bubble arises because high capital returns driven by resource reallocation are not sustainable in the long run. Rational expectations of a strong future demand for alternative stores of value can thus induce currently productive agents to speculate in the housing market.

We show that firms in MENA are more likely to export and/or import than their counterparts elsewhere. However, we only find the expected positive and significant productivity premia for exporters outside of MENA. While MENA's larger exporters are indeed more productive than non-exporters, a large share of exporters - the comparatively low-volume ones - are not. We also confirm positive and significant size and productivity premia for manufacturers that import only, with productivity premia in MENA at least double of those in middle-income economies elsewhere. In contrast, we find no size or productivity premia for MENA's manufacturers that export, but do not import. These patterns are consistent with substantial distortions in the relative fixed and variable costs of trading, likely a reflection of selectively applied policies.","[Francis, David C.] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Schweiger, Helena] European Bank Reconstruct & Dev, London, England",The World Bank; European Bank of Reconstructon & Development,"Francis, DC (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",dfrancis@worldbank.org; schweigh@ebrd.com,,,World Bank; European Investment Bank; EBRD,World Bank(The World Bank India); European Investment Bank; EBRD,"This paper builds on the authors' work on the joint report by the EBRD, EIB and WBG on 'What's Holding Back the Private Sector in MENA?

To identify the distinct dimensions of uncertainty in the macroeconomy, we construct a large dataset covering all types of economic uncertainty. We then identify two fundamental factors that account for the common dynamics in this dataset. These factors are interpreted as macroeconomic uncertainty. The first factor captures business cycle uncertainty, while the second factor represents oil and commodity price uncertainty. While both types of uncertainty generate a decline in output, time-varying oil and commodity price uncertainty is more important for fluctuations in real activity.

Evidence from China,CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Land conveyance; Housing price; Career incentives; Local government; Land auction methods,FISCAL INCENTIVES; USE REGULATIONS; FINANCE; CITIES; MARKET; FEDERALISM; CORRUPTION; DEFICIT; PRICES,"This paper examines how political considerations affect local officials' revenue maximization behaviors in the context of urban land conveyance in China. Particularly, we analyze government intervention based on local officials' choice of two land auction types, namely, English auction and two-stage auction. The latter presumably serves as a tool of government intervention. We aim to address the research question: Are local governments maximizing land revenue? The major findings are threefold. First, for cities with higher housing prices, two stage auctions are adopted more frequently than English auctions. In addition, land parcels in these hot cities adopt two-stage auctions more frequently during sensitive political events, suggesting that local officials respond positively to the real estate regulation policy from central government. Second, when city leaders are more incentivized to promote economic performance, they respond less positively to rises in housing prices. Third, such interventionist behavior results in a significantly depressed land price and housing price. Despite its intention of improving public welfare, this interventionism can susceptibly cause problems of misallocation and corruption. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Schmalsensee's argument suggesting that high quality can be signaled by high prices is based on the assumption that higher quality necessarily incurs higher production cost. In this paper, the authors argue that firms producing high-quality products have a stronger incentive to lower the marginal cost of production cost because they can then sell larger quantities than low-quality firms can. If this dynamic effect is large enough, then the Schmalensee effect degenerates and, thus, low prices signal high quality. This result is different from the Nelson effect relying on the assumption that only the high-quality product can generate repeat purchase, because the result is valid even if low-quality products can also be purchased repeatedly. The authors characterize a separating equilibrium in which a highquality monopolist invests more to reduce cost and, as a result, charges a lower price. Separation is possible due to a difference in quantities sold in the second period across qualities.","[Kim, Jeong-Yoo] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Berg, Nathan] Univ Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Berg, Nathan] Univ Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia",Kyung Hee University; University of Otago; University of Newcastle,"Kim, JY (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",jyookim@khu.ac.kr; Nathan.Berg@otago.ac.nz,,,Kyung Hee University [KHU-20160685],Kyung Hee University,This research was begun when Jeong-Yoo Kim was visiting POSTECH in 2015.

In the 1960s and 1970s, an empirical economist's typical mission was to explain economic variables like wages or GDP growth. Applied econometrics has since evolved to prioritize the estimation of specific causal effects and empirical policy analysis over general models of outcome determination. Yet econometric instruction remains mostly abstract, focusing on the search for true models and technical concerns associated with classical regression assumptions. Questions of research design and causality still take a back seat in the classroom, in spite of having risen to the top of the modern empirical agenda.

By doing this, the modeller avoids adding white noise to the data and may gain additional information. This paper proposes a framework to model discrete choices in the presence of indifference alternatives. The approach allows depicting the likelihood function, independent of the number of alternatives in the choice-set and in the subset of indifference alternatives, offering a new approach to existing methods that are only defined for binary choice situations. The method is tested with the help of simulated and real data observing that the proposed framework allows recovering the parameters used in the generation of the synthetic datasets without major difficulties in most cases. Alternative approaches, such as considering the indifference option as an opt-out alternative or ignoring the indifference choices are clearly outperformed by the proposed framework and appear not capable of recovering parameters in the simulated set.","[Bahamonde-Birke, Francisco J.] Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt DLR, Inst Verkehrsforsch, Cologne, Germany; [Bahamonde-Birke, Francisco J.] Deutsch Inst Wirtschaftsforsch, Energy Transportat & Environm Dept, Berlin, Germany; [Bahamonde-Birke, Francisco J.] Tech Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Navarro, Isidora] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Transport Engn & Logist, Santiago, Chile; [Ortuzar, Juan de Dios] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Sustainable Urban Dev CEDEUS, Dept Transport Engn & Logist, Santiago, Chile",Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); Technical University of Berlin; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Bahamonde-Birke, FJ (通讯作者)，Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt DLR, Inst Verkehrsforsch, Cologne, Germany.",bahamondebirke@gmail.com; ilnavarr@puc.cl; jos@ing.puc.cl,"Ortúzar, Juan de Dios/F-8277-2013","Ortúzar, Juan de Dios/0000-0003-3452-3574; Bahamonde-Birke, Francisco/0000-0001-8325-8055","Institute on Complex Engineering Systems [ICM: P-05-004-F]; CONICYT [FB0816]; Centre for Sustainable Urban Development, CEDEUS [Conicyt/Fondap/15110020]; Bus Rapid Transit Centre of Excellence - VREF","Institute on Complex Engineering Systems; CONICYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)); Centre for Sustainable Urban Development, CEDEUS; Bus Rapid Transit Centre of Excellence - VREF","We wish to thank Ricardo Hurtubia for his useful suggestions and for pointing out the convenience of changing the name of the paper, suggesting we should choose a path that's clear, we should choose freewill.

We use recent survey-based microdata for nearly 2000 non-listed companies in Russia. Our results suggest that managerial ownership, which initially evolved as a means of protecting against and resisting dysfunctional institutions, may stimulate decisions to undertake R&D and risky product innovations. Further, managerial ownership and competition are complementary motivations for R&D and innovation. Incentive payment to hired managers is a positive commitment instrument but has no impact on the competition-innovation link. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The Swiss National Bank removed the lower exchange rate bound vis-a-vis the Euro. We believe that uncertainty concerning a vital economic indicator as the exchange rate should influence economic activities. We argue that the unexpected removal of the lower bound induced a temporary uncertainty about future prices in foreign markets and believe that this influenced firm investment in the short term. We exploit the unexpected change in monetary policy as a natural experiment and use the continuous nature of business tendency surveys to determine the role of uncertainty in the immediate aftermath of the event. Changes in firm-level expectations are measured by specially designed survey questions. We use this information to disentangle first and second moment effects. We find that uncertainty negatively affects investment in equipment and machinery through real option effects and believe that uncertainty positively influences expenditures in research and development through growth-option effects. Finally, we argue that focusing on aggregate gross fixed capital formation masks important insights and suggest the use of disaggregated investment data in future research on the relationship between uncertainty and investment.

The demanded occupation is a more comprehensive concept about individuals' human capital as it involves not only educational level, but also other relevant aspects such as their specific work experience, precise skills and tasks, and workers' preferences for working in a precise occupation.

We explore the ability of different models - multinomial logit, random parameters logit, and hybrid latent class - and of different choice paradigms - utility maximization and regret minimization - in explaining people's choices for renewable energy programmes. The pure random regret random parameters logit model explains the choices of our respondents better than other models, indicating that regret is an important choice paradigm, and that choices for renewable energy programmes are mostly driven by regret, rather than by rejoice. In particular, we find that our respondents' choices are driven more by changes in greenhouse gas emissions than by reductions in power outages. Finally, we find that changing the level of information to one attribute has no effect on choices, and that being a member of an environmental organization makes a respondent more likely to be associated with the utility maximization choice framework.

I show that job creation and job destruction rates have fallen and become less cyclical. This has increased the importance of reallocative shocks relative to aggregate shocks in explaining their time-series fluctuations. Despite the increased importance of reallocation, it is a change in the responses of job flows to aggregate shocks, which are now larger and more persistent, that lead to the onset of jobless recoveries. The decline in the cyclicality of temporary layoffs and the rise in the use of employment services cannot account for these altered responses. Published by Elsevier B.V.","[Faberman, R.

The paper provides an assessment of these impacts in a cross-country framework where heterogeneity of corporate taxation across industries and asset types is accounted for. The results show that taxes change the relative prices of capital types, which, in turn, has implications on the estimated capital quality and reallocation effects in the traditional growth accounting framework. Omitting tax parameters is a source of mismeasurement, particularly when the rental price of capital assets is constructed using an external rate of return, leading to biased capital costs and profits rates. It is shown that differential taxation results in a deadweight loss in terms of misallocated capital inputs, predominantly due to composition effects within industries.","[Fatica, Serena] European Commiss, Brussels, Belgium",,"Fatica, S (通讯作者)，European Commiss, CHAR, 12-114,Rue Loi 170, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium.",sfatica@gmail.com,,"fatica, serena/0000-0002-9990-4354",,,,,39,4,4,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

These conditions are based on properties of the consumer's (unobservable) utility function. In this paper we introduce the new idea of a 'Giffen commodity vector' and show how, in terms of it and the derivative of a consumer's inverse demand, a new necessary and sufficient condition for the ULD may be obtained. As both the Giffen vector and a consumer's inverse demand are observable, this allows us to obtain a 'Revealed Preference' style necessary and sufficient condition for the ULD without relying on conditions based on unobservables such as differential or curvature properties of a consumer's utility function.

The sample consists of 31 countries and covers the period from 1981 to 2008. We contribute to the existing literature in two ways. First, we examine whether variations in time series averaging methods, used for a generalized method of moments estimator (GMM), affect the robustness of the effect of financial activities on growth. Second, we explore the long- and short-term effects as well as the nonlinear effect of the finance-growth nexus. The results of the entire sample analyzed using GMM and PMG estimators provide robust evidence that private credit impedes economic growth. However, the effects of life insurance and stock market on growth are not robust for GMM estimator using different time series averaging procedure. Our findings further suggest that the effects of financial activities on growth vary with the time period, income level, and financial development. That is, countries at different levels of development should engage in different financial activities to ensure sustainable growth. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Such companies tend to adopt their own unique approaches to value brands to face increasing competition, which is also reinforced by the fact that brand constitutes the company's most valuable commercial and intangible assets. The paper compares selected internationally recognized brand valuation methods, using the mathematical statistics apparatus (Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients), on the sample of 12 global well-known brands (Apple, Google, Microsoft, Coca-Cola, Facebook, Toyota, IBM, Disney, McDonald's, General Electric, Samsung and Amazon). Purpose of the article: The aim is to analyze the brand values and the methods applied for possible deviations, and identify whether they are statistically significant and/or find any statistical correlation, or eventually recognize them as totally different and independent approaches. Methods: The analysis is carried out by pairwise comparison of selected brand values provided by selected consultative companies (Forbes, Interbrand, Brand Finance and MillwardBrown). The degree of correlation of brand values provided by respective consultative groups is calculated using the following correlation coefficients: Pearson's correlation coefficient and its modified non-parametric version involving ordinals -Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Findings & Value added: The analysis proved the highest correlation of the brand values provided by the Forbes and Interbrand; Subsequently, a trend analysis is carried out to determine the development over time, identifying the most striking development in the brand values provided by Millward Brown (BrandZTM) for the period 2013-2016.","[Janoskova, Katarina; Krizanova, Anna] Univ Zilina, Zilina, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Janoskova, K (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",katarina.janoskova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Krizanova, Anna/P-2710-2015; Janoskova, Katarina/P-3277-2015","Krizanova, Anna/0000-0003-0331-8826; Janoskova, Katarina/0000-0002-7887-7326",project: Integrated Model of Management Support for Building and Managing the Brand Value in the Specific Conditions of the Slovak Republic [APVV-15-0505],project: Integrated Model of Management Support for Building and Managing the Brand Value in the Specific Conditions of the Slovak Republic,The paper is the output of the project APVV-15-0505: Integrated Model of Management Support for Building and Managing the Brand Value in the Specific Conditions of the Slovak Republic.,,22,18,20,4,80,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

We present a majoritarian voting game of common interest where committee members receive not only private information, but also expert information that is more accurate than private information and observed by all members. In theory, there are Bayesian Nash equilibria where the committee members' voting strategy incorporates both types of information and access to expert information enhances the efficiency of the majority decision. However, in the laboratory, expert information had excessive influence on the voting behaviour and prevented efficient aggregation of individual information. We find a large efficiency loss due to the presence of expert information especially when the committee size is large. Using an incentivized questionnaire, we find that many subjects seVerely underestimate the efficiency gain from information aggregation and they follow expert information Much more frequently than efficiency requires. This suggests that those who understand the efficiency gain from information aggregation and perceive the game correctly might nonetheless be stuck in an inefficient outcome. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The results of cointegrating regression indicate that the major portion of the rise in house prices in Korea over the last 15years can be explained by changes in macro variables such as household income, the demographic structure, the user cost of home ownership and the housing stock supply. The results also confirm that house prices are, indeed, closely linked to the steep increase in household debt seen over this period. Estimation of an error correction model shows that the extent of convergence of actual house prices to their long-run equilibrium path has weakened somewhat since the global financial crisis while the speed of convergence has slowed, indicating structural changes in the Korean housing market. Finally, a forecast for house prices over the next several years suggests that they are unlikely to rise as sharply as they did in the 2000s, given the likely changes in the macro-financial environment, and that their future path will be closely associated with that of the household debt-to-income ratio.","[Kim, Hyun Jeong] Bank Korea, Off Branch Affairs, 39 Namdaemun Ro, Seoul 04531, South Korea; [Son, Jong Chil] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Div Econ, 107 Imun Ro, Seoul 02450, South Korea; [Yie, Myung-Soo] Kongju Natl Univ, Div Econ & Trade, 56 Gongjudaehak Ro, Gonju Si 32588, Chuncheongnam D, South Korea",Bank of Korea; Hankuk University Foreign Studies; Kongju National University,"Son, JC (通讯作者)，Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Div Econ, 107 Imun Ro, Seoul 02450, South Korea.",jcson@hufs.ac.kr,,,Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund,Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund,This work was supported by Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund of 2016.

The common assumption is that monetary poverty is its most important cause. This paper investigates this hypothesis with empirical evidence by exploring structural, geographic, monetary, demographic, cultural, seasonal and school-supply factors simultaneously that can influence child labour. It is a first attempt in the literature to combine quantitative with qualitative methods to identify a broader range of potential factors-on the demand-and supply-side and at the micro and macro levels-for why children work in agrarian economies like Ghana. Interviews with the Minister of Education and with children enrich the multivariate regression results. The multiple sources of child labour appear to include, in particular, the structure of the economy, social norms and no returns to rural basic education. Policy responses are outlined especially on the demand side that are needed to help reduce harmful child labour that affects children's education and later opportunities.","[Krauss, Alexander] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Krauss, Alexander] Inst New Econ Thinking, London, England; [Krauss, Alexander] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; University College London,"Krauss, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.;Krauss, A (通讯作者)，Inst New Econ Thinking, London, England.;Krauss, A (通讯作者)，UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England.",a.krauss@ucl.ac.uk,,"Krauss, Alexander/0000-0002-1783-2765",Institute for New Economic Thinking,Institute for New Economic Thinking,He is also grateful for funding for the completion of this paper from the Institute for New Economic Thinking.,,54,11,13,5,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

In a free environment, any news immediately becomes public knowledge through mediums including various electronic media and published materials. However, in an unfree environment, (economic) agents would have more discretionary powers to disclose good news immediately, while hiding bad news or releasing bad news slowly. We argue that this discretion affects stock prices and that stock markets in countries with a free press should be better processors of economic information. Using an equilibrium asset-pricing model in an economy under jump diffusion, we decompose the moments of the returns of international stock markets into a diffusive risk and a jump risk part. Using stock market data for a balanced panel of 50 countries, our results suggest that in countries with a free press, the better processing of bad news leads to more frequent negative jumps in stock prices. As a result, stock markets in those countries are characterized by higher volatility, driven by higher jump risk and more negative return asymmetry. The results are robust to the inclusion of various controls for governance and other country- or market-specific characteristics. We interpret these as good stock market characteristics because a free press improves welfare and increases economic growth. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Face recognition algorithms use a large dataset of photos labeled as having a face or not to estimate a function that predicts the presence y of a face from pixels x. This similarity to econometrics raises questions: How do these new empirical tools fit with what we know? As empirical economists, how can we use them? We present a way of thinking about machine learning that gives it its own place in the econometric toolbox. Machine learning not only provides new tools, it solves a different problem. Specifically, machine learning revolves around the problem of prediction, while many economic applications revolve around parameter estimation. So applying machine learning to economics requires finding relevant tasks. Machine learning algorithms are now technically easy to use: you can download convenient packages in R or Python. This also raises the risk that the algorithms are applied naively or their output is misinterpreted. We hope to make them conceptually easier to use by providing a crisper understanding of how these algorithms work, where they excel, and where they can stumble-and thus where they can be most usefully applied.","[Mullainathan, Sendhil; Spiess, Jann] Harvard Univ, Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Mullainathan, S (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",mullain@fas.harvard.edu; jspiess@fas.harvard.edu,,"Mullainathan, Sendhil/0000-0001-8508-4052",,,,,62,651,789,34,280,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

When the country plans to adopt new market-based instruments to control greenhouse gas emissions, it must consider this effect as it chooses among instruments to avoid larger efficiency loss. In this paper, we find that the lock in effect will cause a kink point to occur on the marginal abatement cost (MAC) curve. This change of shape for the MAC curve reminds us to be cautious in choosing market-based instruments when applying Weitzman's rule. We also introduce this concept into a dynamic multi-regional computable general equilibrium (CGE) model for China and simulate MAC curves for all regions. After applying Weitzman's rule, we propose a timeline for introducing price instruments under different marginal benefit (MB) curve scenarios. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We use the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to examine two health statuses (self-reported overall health and depression) and one health behavior (smoking), estimating both static logit models of point-in-time health and discrete-time hazard models of health transitions. Overall, we find adverse associations between nontraditional family structures and health statuses and behavior. There are long-lasting associations of family structure with outcomes well into adulthood, not all of which are evident in adolescence. Dynamic estimates often inform but also provide new information not seen in the static model. Unpacking the family structure variables by period of childhood provides insight into how the timing of family break-ups affects the life trajectories of health and health behavior. Our findings differ remarkably by gender. Girls' health appears more sensitive to family structure than boys'. In combination with prior findings in the literature, our findings intriguingly suggest that family break-ups and changes affect boys mostly through cognitive, educational, and emotional channels, while girls are most affected in their health and health behaviors. A major methodological contribution of this study is better measurement of family structure. We find that many adverse associations are masked by cruder measures in typical use.","[Slade, Alexander N.; Beller, Andrea H.] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, 1301 W Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Powers, Elizabeth T.] Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, 1007 W Nevada, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Powers, Elizabeth T.] Univ Illinois, Inst Govt & Publ Affairs, 1007 W Nevada, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Slade, AN (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, 1301 W Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",aslade2@gmail.com; a-beller@illinois.edu; epowers@illinois.edu,"Powers, Elizabeth/AAO-1720-2020","Powers, Elizabeth/0000-0003-1785-9471; Slade, Alexander/0000-0002-4617-6082",Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [P01-HD31921],Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"The authors would like to thank Craig Gundersen and Paul McNamara for helpful comments and suggestions.

First, we use a Granger causality test and find that there is a unidirectional relationship from money supply growth to reserve accumulation growth; however, taking structural changes into account, we assess stability of parameters of the estimated vector autoregressive models. We find both the short-run and long-run relationships between money supply growth and reserve accumulation growth estimated using full-sample data are unstable over the sample period. This suggests that full-sample causality tests cannot be relied upon. We turn to propose a time-varying (bootstrap) rolling-window approach to revisit the dynamic causal relationship between the two variables. We find that two variables have causal relationships in some sub-periods. We argue that reserve accumulation growth has put pressure on money supply growth. However, in general, sterilization is effective, but not in few months 2006-2007. And money supply has a positive reserve accumulation from the second half of 2001-2003 because RMB was undervalued under the fixed exchange rate regime. We argue that the improvements of monetary policy and the exchange rate regime are crucial to break the relationship between reserve accumulation growth and the money supply growth.","[Su, Chi-Wei; Lu, Li] Ocean Univ China, Dept Finance, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Chang, Hsu-Ling] Ling Tung Univ, Dept Accounting & Informat, Taichun, Taiwan; [Zhao, Yanping] Ocean Univ China, Dept Int Trade, 238 Songling Rd, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China",Ocean University of China; Ocean University of China,"Zhao, YP (通讯作者)，Ocean Univ China, Dept Int Trade, 238 Songling Rd, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China.",qupipizyp@163.com,"zhao, yan/GWC-9174-2022; Su, Chi Wei/ABE-4976-2021",,National Social Science Foundation [15BJY155]; Ministry of Education's Humanities and Social Science Research Project [14YJA790049]; Chinese Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [201413072],National Social Science Foundation; Ministry of Education's Humanities and Social Science Research Project; Chinese Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities,This research is supported by the National Social Science Foundation [grant number 15BJY155]; Ministry of Education's Humanities and Social Science Research Project [grant number 14YJA790049]; and the Chinese Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [grant number 201413072].,,54,6,6,2,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

We design an experiment where the decision maker draws twice with replacement in the typical Ellsberg two-color urns, but with a different color winning each time. Given this set of mean-preserving prospects, MEU/alpha-MP, KMM, and Savage's subjective expected utility all predict unequivocally that risk-averse decision makers (DMs) will avoid the 50-50 urn that exhibits the highest risk conceivable, while risk-seeking DMs do the opposite. However, we observe a substantial number of violations in the experiments. It appears that the ambiguity premium is partially paid to avoid the ambiguity issue per se, which is distinct from notions of second-order risk.

Such countries also seek to implement market-based options to further control domestic carbon emissions as well as to promote the withdrawal of outdated capacity and upgrade production level. This paper presents a quantitative assessment of the emission trading scheme (ETS) for China's iron and steel industry. The diverse array of normal and outdated capacities was modeled in a two-country, three good partial equilibrium model. Simulation results show that the abatement potential can be underestimated if the energy-saving effects that result from emission abatement are not considered. In the scenario analysis, we demonstrated that the free allocation of allowances can cause a competitiveness distortion among domestic normal and outdated capacities. Given the government's intention to promote outdated capacity withdrawal and production-level upgrading, an output-based allocation approach is strongly suggested for China's iron and steel sector.

We study household savings and expenditure adjustment from an unexpected, large-scale and rapidly evolving political shock that occurred largely in May 1989 in Beijing, China. Using monthly micro panel data, we present evidence that a surge in political uncertainty resulted in significant temporary increases in savings among urban households in China. Households responded mainly by reducing semi-durable expenditure and frequency of major durable adjustment. The uncertainty effect is more pronounced among older, wealthier, and more socially advantaged households. We interpret our findings using existing models of precautionary behavior. By focusing on time variation in uncertainty, our identification strategy avoids many of the potential problems in empirical studies of precautionary savings such as self-selection and life-cycle effects.

Ancient societies have long been thought to follow this pattern. We empirically show that irrigation affects political regimes even in the present. To avoid endogeneity, we use geographical and climatic variation to identify irrigation dependent societies. We find that countries whose agriculture depended on irrigation are about six points less democratic on the 21-point polity2 scale than countries where agriculture has been rainfed. We find qualitatively similar results across regions within countries. We argue that the effect has historical origins: irrigation allowed landed elites in arid areas to monopolize water and arable land. This made elites more powerful and better able to oppose democratization. Consistent with this conjecture, we show that irrigation dependence predicts land inequality both at the country level, and in premodern societies surveyed by ethnographers.","[Bentzen, Jeanet Sinding; Kaarsen, Nicolai; Wingender, Asger Moll] Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Bentzen, JS (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.",jeanet.bentzen@econ.ku.dk; kn@kraka.org; asger.moll.wingender@econ.ku.dk,"Bentzen, Jeanet/JCP-4257-2023","Bentzen, Jeanet Sinding/0000-0003-2099-093X",Carlsberg Foundation; Danish Council for Independent Research,Carlsberg Foundation(Carlsberg Foundation); Danish Council for Independent Research(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)),"We thank Daron Acemoglu, Oana Borcan, Antonio Ciccone, Carl-Johan Dalgaard, Jacob Gerner Hariri, James Robinson, Hans-Joachim Voth, David Weil, seminar participants at Brown University, ISET, Pompeu Fabra, and University of Copenhagen; participants at the Growth and Development Conference at ISI, New Delhi; the Nordic Conference in Development Economics, and the Congress of the European Economic Association; and four anonymous referees for useful comments.

If the government can perfectly commit, it fully insulates the economy against government spending shocks by purchasing short-term assets and issuing long-term debt. These positions are quantitatively very large relative to GDP and do not need to be actively managed by the government. Our main result is that these conclusions are not robust to the introduction of lack of commitment. Under lack of commitment, large and tilted debt positions are very expensive to finance ex ante since they exacerbate the problem of lack of commitment ex post. In contrast, a flat maturity structure minimizes the cost of lack of commitment, though it also limits insurance and increases the volatility of fiscal policy distortions. We show that the optimal time-consistent maturity structure is nearly flat because reducing average borrowing costs is quantitatively more important for welfare than reducing fiscal policy volatility. Thus, under lack of commitment, the government actively manages its debt positions and can approximate optimal policy by confining its debt instruments to consols.","[Debortoli, Davide] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain; Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain; Fed Reserve Bank Boston, Boston, MA 02210 USA; Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Pompeu Fabra University; Barcelona School of Economics; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Boston; Columbia University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Debortoli, D (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.",,"Nunes, Ricardo/IQR-4066-2023; Debortoli, Davide/AAJ-4753-2021","Debortoli, Davide/0000-0001-8012-1790; Praca Cavaco Nunes, Ricardo/0000-0002-3157-0802",Marie Curie FP7-PEOPLE-2013-IIF [628855 - MONFISCPOL]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2014-55555-P],Marie Curie FP7-PEOPLE-2013-IIF(European Union (EU)); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"For helpful comments we are grateful to the editor and three anonymous referees; to Marina Azzimonti, Marco Bassetto, Luigi Bocola, Fernando Broner, Francisco Buera, V.V.

While mitigation of climate change typically raises revenues, adaptation is costly to the taxpayer, and the more so, the more distortionary the tax system. Moreover, the benefits and costs of mitigation and adaptation vary across generations. In an OLG model with majority voting, we show that even in the absence of international pollution spillovers and strategic considerations, neither mitigation nor adaptation can be expected to be set efficiently. The reason is that voters have incentives to use climate policy as an instrument for redistribution. We find that these incentives depend on the underlying tax system. Furthermore, the chosen mitigation or adaptation level may be inefficiently high in a political equilibrium with a distortionary income tax system, although not simultaneously. This finding suggests that a distortionary income tax system favors one policy (mitigation or adaptation) at the expense of the other. The calibration of our model to the German economy reveals that both mitigation and adaptation are lower than their socially optimal levels.","[Habla, Wolfgang; Roeder, Kerstin] Univ Gothenburg, Vasagatan 1, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Roeder, Kerstin] Univ Augsburg, Univ Str 16, DE-86159 Augsburg, Germany",University of Gothenburg; University of Augsburg,"Habla, W (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Vasagatan 1, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",wolfgang.habla@gu.se; kerstin.roeder@wiwi.uni-augsburg.de,"Habla, Wolfgang/AAH-9885-2020","Habla, Wolfgang/0000-0003-1164-0962",Formas through the Human Cooperation to Manage Natural Resources (COMMONS) research program [253-2010-32],Formas through the Human Cooperation to Manage Natural Resources (COMMONS) research program,"We thank Kelly de Bruin, Rob Hart, John Hassler, Mitesh Kataria, Jurate Jaraite-Kazukauski, Thomas Sterner, seminar participants at the University of lima, participants of the Swedish National Conference in Economics in Gothenburg, as well as two anonymous reviewers and the managing editor for their valuable comments and suggestions.

One of the contributions of this paper is that we focus explicitly on the demand for low-wage part-time workers, which we call low skilled workers. Estimating a system of variable factor demands for the period 1980-2011, we find that industries with higher ICT stock shifted demand from middle-low to middle-high and low skilled workers. Offshoring is associated with the increasing demand for high skilled workers but it has insignificant effects on the demand for middle-high, middle-low, and low skilled workers.

The first approach, ubiquitous in economics, is based upon the Rubin-Holland potential outcomes model and relies upon randomized treatment to measure the causal effect of choice. The second approach, widely used in the pattern recognition and machine learning literatures, assumes that choice conditional upon current information is optimal (or at least high quality), and then provides techniques to generalize observed choice to new cases. The human capital approach combines these methods by using observed decisions by experts to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space and allow the categorization of decisions by their propensity score. The fact that the human capital of experts is heterogeneous implies that errors in decision making are inevitable. Moreover, under the appropriate conditions, these decisions are random conditional upon the propensity score. This in turn allows us to identify the conditional average treatment effect for a wider class of situations than would be possible with randomized control trials. This point is illustrated with data from medical decision making in the context of treating depression, heart disease and adverse childbirth events.","[MacLeod, W.

Increasing risk about future payoffs and endowments can lead to riskier loans with larger balances and lower spreads even when lenders are risk averse and borrowers can default. As well, increasing the covariance of either agents' endowments with the asset payoff can have ambiguous consequences for equilibrium. Though the effects are ambiguous, key determinants of how increased risk translates into changes in prices and allocations are the covariance of agents' endowments with the asset payoff, agents' risk aversion, and the location of increased risk in the distribution of future states. Some restricted changes in the borrower's or lender's endowments can have unambiguous but asymmetric effects on equilibrium.","[Phelan, Gregory] Williams Coll, Schapiro Hall,24 Hopkins Hall Dr, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA",Williams College,"Phelan, G (通讯作者)，Williams Coll, Schapiro Hall,24 Hopkins Hall Dr, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA.",gp4@williams.edu,,,,,,,26,4,4,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

We focus on the impact of efficiency differences on social welfare and the evolution of export-only activities from autarky to trade. We show that exposure to trade brings a country of larger size and with higher efficiency more welfare gains, including higher industry productivity and greater variety of products. We also find that firms that face lower fixed export costs enjoy greater export tax rebates and firms that are located in more efficient countries have a greater chance of becoming export-only firms. Further internationalization promotes the prosperity of export-only activities.","[Qiu, Bin] Southeast Univ, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Yan, Zhijun] Nanjing Univ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University,"Yan, ZJ (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ, Sch Econ, 22 Hankou Rd, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",yanzhijun_seu@126.com,,,"National Social Science Foundation [15AJY001]; National Natural Science Foundation [71203099, 71173116]; Jiangsu Provincial Social Science Foundation [14EYA002]",National Social Science Foundation; National Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Jiangsu Provincial Social Science Foundation,"The authors would like to express our gratitude to the Associate Editor and two anonymous referees for their valuable comments.

They proposed a closed skew-normal distribution for maximum likelihood estimation but they did not apply the model to data and their technique depends on multiple evaluations of multivariate normal integrals for each observation which can be very costly. In this paper we extend their approach to the profit function and we propose both input- and output oriented non-radial measures of technical inefficiencies. Although the extension to the translog profit function is trivial many observations, in practice, may contain negative profits. For this reason we provide a nontrivial extension to the Symmetric Generalized McFadden (SGM) profit function. We propose and apply (to a large sample of US banks) Bayesian analysis of the SGM model (augmented with latent technical inefficiencies resulting in a highly nonlinear mixed effects model) using the integrated nested Laplace approximation.

We reported simulations of several changes in energy prices as a result of partial or total energy subsidy removal, including carbon tax. In order to examine whether the subsidy mechanism and carbon tax tend to be progressive or regressive, we evaluated the households' burden in different income levels. These simulations respond to the need for an assessment of economic and environmental impacts of energy subsidies in Mexico. This is of great importance for Mexico because of effort that has been taken in the development of energy policies, and the rising interest of the Mexican government in mitigating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their concomitant environmental damage.

We estimate a panel binary response model over the period 1970-2012 for 110 countries, of which 58 opted to adopt such a rule. Our results suggest that the probability such a rule will be adopted is greater if a country has a high level of public debt, a relatively inflexible exchange rate regime, has already adopted inflation targeting, has deep credit markets and if other countries already have adopted a debt rule. There are some differences in decision factors between high-income and lower income countries, with the level of economic development and the openness of the economy playing opposite roles in each country group, and the impact of monetary unions on debt rule adoption being much stronger in the former group. The results are robust to testing for reverse causality, including using different econometric techniques.","[Altunbas, Yener; Thornton, John] Bangor Univ, Sch Business, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales",Bangor University,"Altunbas, Y (通讯作者)，Bangor Univ, Sch Business, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales.",,,,,,,,61,11,11,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

Our results show that the EMH does not hold for all the markets we have surveyed. Moreover, the seasonal effects are also present in the volatility equations.

When costs decline, the opportunity of profitable storing in anticipation of higher future costs allows competitive firms to coordinate on prices above current marginal costs. The initial price response is only partial and profitable storing relaxes competition. Conversely, when costs rise, storing is not beneficial in anticipation of lower future costs and firms immediately adjust their prices to current marginal costs, which entails the standard Bertrand outcome.

We set up a stylized model of consumption smoothing involving universal banks that undertake both investment and commercial banking activities. Banks have private information about the outcome of a project that it funds. In the wake of bad news about the project, the banker has an incentive to sell lemon shares in a secondary market with the pretence of a liquidity crunch. Our model shows that such an incentive results in (i) a sharp discounting of stock prices, (ii) greater loan demand (iii) higher fraction of bank ownership of the borrowing firms, and (iv) heightened consumption risk resulting in precautionary savings by households. The magnitude of these effects depends on the market's perception about the preponderance of lemons in the stock market. A credible punishment scheme implemented by the government in the form of fines may moderate the stock market decline and consumption volatility due to information friction. However, it imposes a deadweight loss on private citizens because of a fall in all banks' expected profit. On the other hand, a ring-fenced banking arrangement along the way suggested by the Vickers Commission may entail a first order welfare loss due to the lack of diversification opportunities.","[Banerji, Sanjay] Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Finance Grp, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England; [Basu, Parantap] Univ Durham, Sch Business, Dept Econ & Finance, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England",University of Nottingham; Durham University,"Basu, P (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Sch Business, Dept Econ & Finance, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England.",sanjay.banerji@nottingham.ac.uk; parantap.basu@durham.ac.uk,,,Durham University Business School,Durham University Business School,"Without implicating, we acknowledge the constructive comments of four referees, the participants of Durham brown bag workshop, the European Monetary Forum at the Bank of Greece, Loughborough Macroprudential Conference and Glasgow University workshop.

The aim of the article is to identify the costs associated with transparent lobbing. Modern dynamic indicators which analyse costs (input) of a project and are related to its utilities (output) are reflected from the viewpoint of public project evaluation. The used CBA (Cost Benefit Analysis) method was specified on the basis of the delimitation of characteristics and attributes of transparent lobbying. The evaluation of the project is performed on the basis of the creation of a specific model of a social-economic analysis in a non-reduced form. The model works with the delimitation of quantifiable and non-quantifiable costs and benefits of the project. The basic variants of the final states were determined, namely: 1) the existence of the current legislation and 2) the project variant of lobbying transparency increase, which was further divided into 2.1) a project variant of lobbying transparency increase by means of legislation changes and 2.2) a project variant of lobbying transparency increase on the basis of self-regulation principles. From the viewpoint of costs, the second option is financially more demanding and mainly the option of implemented legislation changes. The variant by means of self-regulation can, but does not have to, be accompanied by additional costs. The first variant is not connected with any immediate financial costs. The selection of the most suitable variant will be done in relation with the presupposed acquired quantifiable and non-quantifiable benefits.","[Bednarova, Pavla] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Bednárová, P (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic.",pavla.bednarova@tul.cz,"Bednářová, Pavla/HLP-4977-2023",,Czech Science Foundation [16-08786S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"This paper has been elaborated as one of the outcomes of research project supported by the Czech Science Foundation, project No. 16-08786S Impact of Transparency of Lobbying on Democratization and Its Consequences.",,11,0,0,0,5,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-349-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,411,419,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6CS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426486500046,0

Because insurance coverage is typically determined by the treatment date, individuals may have incentives to strategically delay treatments to minimize out-of-pocket costs. The strategic delay of treatment-a particular form of moral hazard-can be an important source of subsequent adverse selection, in which ex ante identical individuals select insurance coverage based on their differing accumulation of previously delayed treatments. This article investigates these forces empirically in the context of the missing market for dental insurance. Using rich claim-level data, my analysis reveals that approximately 40% of individuals strategically delay dental treatments when incentivized to do so, and this flexibility in delaying treatment can explain why the market for dental insurance has largely unraveled. More generally, the counterfactual analysis suggests features such as open enrolment periods and contracting on pre-existing conditions may be helpful tools in overcoming adverse selection in insurance contexts where the timing of uncertainty is not contractible.","[Cabral, Marika] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Cabral, Marika] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Cabral, M (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA.;Cabral, M (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,"National Institute on Aging (Disease, Disability and Death in an Aging Workforce, NIH/NIA) [1 R01 AG026291]","National Institute on Aging (Disease, Disability and Death in an Aging Workforce, NIH/NIA)","For their useful comments and feedback, I thank Jerome Adda, three anonymous referees, Michael Boskin, Tim Bresnahan, Liran Einav, Gopi Shah Goda, Matthew Harding, Caroline Hoxby, Amanda Kowalski, Jonathan Levin, Neale Mahoney, Isabelle Sin, William Gui Woolston, and Ali Yurukoglu.

These charges, which are depreciations in name only, enable the FM to artificially inflate expenses, thus increasing the deficit or reducing the surplus. Our panel data set of the 26 cantons over the period 1980-2012 includes a new data set of creative accounting and of 116 cantonal FMs. Our results indicate that the FMs cook the books irrespective of their personal or ideological background with the exception that trained economists tend to apply creative accounting more. Additionally, stringent fiscal rules urge FMs towards more surplus-hiding accounting.","[Clemenceau, Maxime; Soguel, Nils] Univ Lausanne, Swiss Grad Sch Publ Adm IDHEAP, Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Lausanne,"Soguel, N (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, IDHEAP, Inst Hautes Etud Adm Publ, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",nils.soguel@unil.ch,,"Soguel, Nils/0000-0002-6683-4206",Swiss National Science Foundation [100018_137554]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [100018_137554] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF),Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),The financial support from the Swiss National Science Foundation [grant 100018_137554] is gratefully acknowledged.,,46,8,8,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

These segments can be also grouped respectively in worker and job clusters, which finally can be combined among them attending to their matching. Those joint clusters (or biclusters) with the highest propensity to match can be considered specific job Creation markets, whose structure can be studied in detail for example, analyzing the employment duration.

We present the new IndoLab, a collaborative research platform for Indonesia, enabling input-output modelling of economic, social, and environmental issues in a cloud-computing environment. Within the IndoLab researchers are for the first time able to generate a time series of regionally and sectorally detailed and comprehensive, sub-national multi-region input-output (MRIO) tables for Indonesia. By integrating a multitude of economic, social, and environmental data into a single standardised processing pipeline and harmonised data repository, the IndoLab is able to generate MRIO tables capturing up to 1148 sectors, and 495 cities and regencies. Researchers can freely choose from this detail to construct tables with customised classifications that suit their own research questions. First results from the IndoLab clearly demonstrate the unique characteristics of regions in terms of their sectors' employment intensity.

By exploiting a natural experiment hinging on the interaction between the probable onset of efforts to suppress MBD and the potential benefit to local communities' average health, this research finds that suppressing MBD explains at least 1.5% of the increase in global population growth since 1900. In Africa, estimates suggest 14% of growth is due to controlling MBD. Globally, the treatment effect is relatively uniform across the 20th century, while in Africa, population grew relatively faster after the widespread DDT spraying of the 1960s. Additionally, this research finds that different indices of historical malaria prevalence reveal complementary insights into the reduction of MBD and subsequent population growth. Robustness of the measured impacts are explored further using regional characteristics, such as topographic boundaries on the extent of Anopheles mosquitoes, as well as by controlling for other factors that could influence population growth.","[Gooch, Elizabeth] USDA, Econ Res Serv, 1400 Independence Ave,SW Mailstop 1800, Washington, DC 20250 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Gooch, E (通讯作者)，USDA, Econ Res Serv, 1400 Independence Ave,SW Mailstop 1800, Washington, DC 20250 USA.",elizabeth.gooch@ers.usda.gov,,,,,,,44,4,4,1,27,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

The results show that, in both Bertrand and Cournot equilibria, each owner offers a profit-oriented incentive scheme to his or her managers by penalizing sales maximization, irrespective of the strength of the network externalities. In the presence of weak network externalities and low product differentiation, firms can obtain higher profits in the equilibrium under Cournot-type quantity competition compared with that under Bertrand-type price competition. Furthermore, the wage chosen by the union is higher in the Cournot than in the Bertrand equilibrium. In the Cournot equilibrium, the wage increases with the strength of the network externalities. However, in the Bertrand equilibrium, there exists a threshold level of the degree of product differentiation.","[Hou, Haiyang; Hong, Shihuang] Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, Sch Sci, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Chunyu] China Jiliang Univ, Inst Higher Educ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Hangzhou Dianzi University; China Jiliang University,"Hou, HY (通讯作者)，Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, Sch Sci, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",haiyanghou@126.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71471051],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),I thank David Peel (editor) and anonymous referees for their insights and comments.

This study examines the macroeconomic context and related legal and institutional issues of the IFRS implementation as rooted in the Central European institutional background. Based on a questionnaire survey conducted periodically four times over six years, we attempt to identify the effects of IFRS adoption connected with the SMEs context. The paper finds that, even though the pressure to use the IFRS is rising, important institutional factors and constraints on the side of the users, in terms of a lack of perceived benefits complicate the way of IFRS usage for the majority of Czech SMEs. Also, the preparedness of accounting professionals is quite low, as well as the benefits attributed to the IFRS adoption by SMEs' executives. Furthermore, the Ministry of Finance only gradually adapts to special features of the Czech environment and only recently makes the transition to IFRS less strictly regulated.","[Jindrichovska, Irena] Angloamer Univ, Letenska 5, Prague 11800 1, Czech Republic; [Kubickova, Dana] Univ Finance & Adm, Estonska 500, Prague 10000 10, Czech Republic",Anglo-American University; University of Finance & Administration - Czech Republic,"Jindrichovska, I (通讯作者)，Angloamer Univ, Letenska 5, Prague 11800 1, Czech Republic.",irena.jindrichovska@seznam.cz; dana.kubickova@centrum.cz,"Kubickova, Dana/F-5098-2013",,project IGA VSFS [7767]; [STF-AAU-2016-1],project IGA VSFS;,"This paper was prepared with the support of the Research Project STF-AAU-2016-1 The authors also acknowledge the support of Research project IGA VSFS No. 7767, funded by the institutional support for long-term strategic development of research organization University of Finance and Administration, Prague.",,8,0,0,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,615,624,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455325300061,0

Models created in different conditions do not achieve the accuracy claimed by their authors. The aim of this article is to present the results of research associated with the development of a bankruptcy model designed for construction companies. Due to the properties of financial data, the quality of the model, i.e. its discrimination ability, is strongly influenced by the choice of the method used to derive the model. The model was developed for the years 2011-2014 based on 29 financial indicators of companies operating in the construction industry, which were calculated on the basis of accounting data of the companies contained in the AMADEUS database. A non-parametric method of Classification and Regression Trees ( CART) was used to derive this model. The discrimination ability of the model was evaluated based on the percentage of correctly differentiated companies and the percentage of Type I and Type II errors. To test the discrimination accuracy of models, the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC curve) and the Area Under Curve (AUC) were also used. Based on these tests, it is possible to graphically and numerically measure the discrimination ability of the models. The discrimination accuracy of the model created on the basis of the data of construction companies was compared with other selected models, which were not created using the data of construction companies. The comparison clearly showed that the model created especially for the construction companies achieves the highest discrimination ability.","[Karas, Michal; Reznakova, Maria] Brno Univ Technol, Kolejni 4, Brno 61200, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,"Karas, M (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Kolejni 4, Brno 61200, Czech Republic.",karas@fbm.vutb.cz; reznakova@fbm.vutbr.cz,"Karas, Michal/C-1261-2018; Karas, Michal/HDN-2653-2022; Reznakova, Maria/AAQ-6282-2020","Karas, Michal/0000-0001-8824-1594; Karas, Michal/0000-0001-8824-1594; Reznakova, Maria/0000-0002-7261-607X",,,,,49,15,15,3,23,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Traditional video stores competed in availability, with consumer search costs determining the optimal probability of stock-outs. We find evidence that Redbox, the only major renter of physical discs in today's market, competes in either availability (depth) or variety (breadth) depending on the mix of moratorium versus day-and-date titles released each week. Moratorium titles are those for which Redbox has agreed to wait a month or more beyond the street release date before adding them to kiosks, whereas day-and-date titles can be added to kiosks as soon as they are released on DVD. When there are relatively more day-and-date titles, Redbox competes against on-demand services by focusing on providing depth of hit movies at a much lower cost. As the mix of releases turns towards more moratorium releases, Redbox can no longer win over customers willing to pay the higher cost of on-demand streaming to avoid the moratorium. In this situation, Redbox competes with subscription-based services like Netflix which are also subject to studio moratoriums by offering a greater breadth of titles.","[King, Amanda S.; King, John T.] Georgia Southern Univ, Statesboro, GA 30458 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Southern University,"King, JT (通讯作者)，Georgia Southern Univ, Statesboro, GA 30458 USA.",jking@georgiasouthern.edu,,"King, John/0000-0001-6692-8176",,,,,4,3,3,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

In benchmark post Kaleckian open economy models, currency devaluations have two effects. First, they change international price competitiveness and thus affect net exports. Second, devaluations change income distribution and thereby affect consumption and investment demand. The overall effect on aggregate demand and investment is ambiguous and depends on parameter values. Existing models, however, disregard balance sheet effects that arise from foreign currency-denominated external debt. The article develops a novel post Kaleckian open economy model that introduces foreign currency-denominated external debt and balance sheet effects to examine the demand-effects of devaluations. Furthermore, the article models the dynamics of external and domestic corporate debt. It discusses how an economy may end up in a vicious cycle of foreign-currency indebtedness and derives the conditions under which indebtedness becomes stable or unstable. It shows that the existence of foreign currency-denominated debt means that contractionary devaluations are more likely, and that foreign interest rate hikes, and high illiquidity and risk premia compromise debt sustainability. Devaluations only stabilize debt ratios if they succeed in boosting domestic capital accumulation.","[Kohler, Karsten] Kingston Univ London, Dept Econ, Kingston Upon Thames, Surrey, England",Kingston University,"Kohler, K (通讯作者)，Kingston Univ London, Dept Econ, Kingston Upon Thames, Surrey, England.",,,"Kohler, Karsten/0000-0002-6876-0538",,,,,55,5,6,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

This theory has recently been extended to model global supply chains by Bogataj and Grubbstrm, both scientists from the MEDIFAS faculty. Every production cycle is followed by distribution, consumption and recycling activities. In broad supply chains, transportation costs between pairs of activity cells have a significant impact on the overall net present value of the system. Possible flows inside or between subsystems can all be described with input-output matrices H and G. Recently published papers of the above mentioned authors describe the presentation of supply chains in a generalized form. Generalized input and output matrices H(s) . and G(s). hold technical coefficients and lead times. Lead times are split into 2 parts: production and transportation. As presented in the publication of R. W. Grubbstrm, L. Bogataj and M. Bogataj, and further research of these authors, the results of recycling activities in the extended MRP model are the recovered and the waste items, but in their model the recycling of the items is not repeated. Recovered items could be reused several times in future production cycles, reducing the need to purchase new items on the market as considered here. The waste items must be disposed of, requiring environmental taxes which vary among regions, depending on local environmental policy. If recovered, items must be delivered from the recycling facility back to production, and waste items must be sent to landfills. This process requires an expenditure of human resources, and energy at each activity cell plays an important role. In this article we show how the location of recycling facilities, the prices and quantity of energy needed and the environmental taxes can drastically influence the net present value for the entire system. We also present the method for evaluating cases where energy can be recovered during recycling or decomposition processes at landfills. It is also assumed that energy recovery can be stimulated with subsidized purchase prices, but generally, lower quality energy can be expected as an output of these processes. This paper introduces generalized input and output energy matrices, which describe these energy flows and their impact on environmental sustainability through the net present value of the system, which is the novelty in the extended MRP theory.","[Kovacic, Danijel] DK Informacijsko Svetovanje, Gric 4, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Bogataj, Marija] MEDIFAS, Mednarodni Prehod 6, SI-5290 Vrtojba, Sempeter Pri Go, Slovenia",,"Bogataj, M (通讯作者)，MEDIFAS, Mednarodni Prehod 6, SI-5290 Vrtojba, Sempeter Pri Go, Slovenia.",marija.bogataj@guest.arnes.si,"Bogataj, Marija/ABD-1627-2020",,University of Ljubljana; MEDIFAS [J5-4279],University of Ljubljana; MEDIFAS,The paper is the research result of the joint project of University of Ljubljana and MEDIFAS J5-4279 and Doctoral study at University of Ljubljana.,,28,23,23,2,17,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

To quantify incentives to manipulate stable mechanisms, we consider markets with random cardinal utilities, which induce ordinal preferences over match partners. We show that most agents in large matching markets are close to being indifferent of overall stable matchings. In one-to-one matching, the utility gain by manipulating a stable mechanism does not exceed the gap between utilities from the best and worst stable partners. Thus, most agents in a large market would not have significant incentives to manipulate stable mechanisms. The incentive compatibility extends to many-to-one matching when agents employ truncation strategies and capacity manipulations in a Gale-Shapley mechanism.","[Lee, Sangmok] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Lee, S (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",,,,,,,,44,32,38,0,38,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Data was collected via in-person consumer surveys across in three major U.S. cities with two different information treatments. A dichotomous-choice contingent valuation methodology is utilized to estimate consumers' willingness to pay for this product and analyze factors that affect consumer choice. The results suggest that the average respondent was willing to pay an 11% premium for second-generation nature inspired bioethanol compared to conventional fuel. The willingness to pay was the highest in Portland, Oregon (17%), followed by Minneapolis (9%) and then Boston (8%). Driving distance was found to have a negative effect on consumer willingness to pay. Consumers who purchase more organic foods were more willing to pay a premium for the product Risk attitude had heterogeneous effects in different locations.

The study is the first to propose a simple sequential method to attempt to identify the form of missingness.

The empirical conclusions are as follows: the direction and the extent of the risk contagion effect of return volatility between China's offshore and onshore foreign exchange market. is quite different as time varys. The transmission channels of financial risks between the offshore and onshore markets vary in the different stages. Among all three stages, offshore foreign market has a significant contagion effect to the onshore foreign exchange market.

In economics, the law of demand indicates that price increases (tuition) cause quantity demanded (enrolments) to decrease. The impacts of tuition increases on revenue depend on the magnitude of these two changes. The contribution of this article is the methodology used to control for competitor pricing in enrolment elasticity models. For resident enrolment, we included other in-state, 4-year public universities. For non-resident enrolment, we used weighting schemes based on enrolment patterns by school and by state to incorporate competitors' tuition rates and relevant economic and demographic information. We applied these methodologies to universities in the south-eastern U.S. from 2003 to 2010. We found that tuition elasticities of both resident and non-resident enrolments at 4-year public universities varied from inelastic resident enrolments to elastic non-resident enrolments at the state level. In some cases, competitor pricing significantly impacted enrolments; in other cases, it did not. Across the full sample, 1% increase in resident tuition rates decreased enrolments by 0.3%. The techniques developed in this article can be used by individual universities or university systems to inform their strategies in setting tuition rates.","[Millea, Meghan; Orozco-Aleman, Sandra] Mississippi State Univ, Finance & Econ Dept, Starkville, MS 39762 USA",Mississippi State University,"Millea, M (通讯作者)，Mississippi State Univ, Finance & Econ Dept, Starkville, MS 39762 USA.",mmillea@business.msstate.edu,,,,,,,17,0,3,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We propose a theoretical framework to test conspicuous consumption of specialty food products. We test the hypothesis empirically by categorizing individuals into unobserved latent classes according to their general prestige-seeking behaviour. We find evidence of food consumption driven by prestige to the point of becoming a symbol of social status. The prestige-seeking behaviour seems to be motivated by invidious comparison or higher-class individuals seeking to differentiate themselves from lower-class individuals; and pecuniary emulation, or lower-class individuals buying prestigious goods in order to be perceived as members of a higher class. Findings from this study revealed that the effects of differentiating labelling attributes had a higher impact for individuals classified into classes with prestige-seeking behaviour to attain an elevated social status.","[Palma, Marco A.; Anderson, David P.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 2124 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Ness, Meghan L.] COFCO Agri, Sugar Land, TX USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Palma, MA (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 2124 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",mapalma@tamu.edu,,,,,,,35,21,22,0,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We associate Markov switching regime 1 with economic upturn and regime 2 with economic downturn. We find clear evidence of cyclical variations in the three premiums, most notable being that in the size premium, which changes from positive in expansions to negative in recessions. Macroeconomic indicators prompting such cyclicality the most are variables that proxy credit market conditions, namely the interest rates, term structure and credit spread. Overall, macro factors tend to have more significant impact on the three premiums during economic downturns. The results are robust to the choice of information variable used in modelling transition probabilities of the two-stage Markov switching model. We show that exploiting cyclicality in premiums proves particularly profitable for portfolios featuring small cap stocks in recessions at a feasible level of transaction costs.","[Sarwar, Golam; Mateus, Cesario] Univ Greenwich, London, England; [Todorovic, Natasa] City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, Ctr Asset Management Res, London, England",University of Greenwich; City University London,"Todorovic, N (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, Ctr Asset Management Res, London, England.",n.todorovic@city.ac.uk,"Mateus, Cesario/Q-3608-2019","Mateus, Cesario/0000-0003-0336-5219; Sarwar, Sohan/0000-0003-3060-887X",,,,,56,1,1,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Based on Statistics of Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) and IMF data for 12 European countries, we find that more severe adjustments to the cyclically adjusted primary balance (i.e., more austerity) are associated with a more unequal distribution of income driven by rising inequality at the top. The data also weakly suggests a decrease in inequality at the bottom. The distributional impact of austerity measures reflects the reliance on regressive policies and likely produces increased incentives for rent-seeking while reducing incentives for workers to increase productivity.","[Schneider, Markus P.

The aim of the article is to analyse these factors, and to discuss their relationship to cost efficiency and effectiveness with a focus on the impact of municipality size. Waste management expenditure in municipalities is most influenced by the achievement of economies of scale. Additionally, it was found that of a waste collection company is under public ownership, this has a similarly strong impact on expenditure. Another two important factors associated with cost savings and the management of waste collection companies are inter municipal cooperation and hybrid organization, which are of equal importance.","[Soukopova, Jana] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Publ Econ, Lipova 507-41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic; [Klimovsky, Daniel] Comenius Univ, Fac Arts, Dept Polit Sci, Gondova 2, Bratislava 81499, Slovakia; [Ochrana, Frantisek] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Sociol Studies, U Krize 8, Prague 15800 5, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno; Comenius University Bratislava; Charles University Prague,"Soukopová, J (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Publ Econ, Lipova 507-41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",soukopova@econ.muni.ez; daniel.klimovsky@gmail.com; ochrana@fsv.cuni.cz,"Klimovský, Daniel/AAU-8129-2021; Ochrana, Frantisek/E-9765-2018; Klimovsky, Daniel/Y-8546-2019; Soukopová, Jana/H-9432-2013; Soukopová, Jana/JCO-2082-2023","Klimovský, Daniel/0000-0002-0312-2842; Soukopová, Jana/0000-0002-9423-3301;",Czech Science Foundation [GA15-08032S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"The paper has been prepared as one of the outcomes of the research project Unfair competition and other economic factors influencing the efficiency of the provision of public services funded by the Czech Science Foundation, Reg.

Regulation of network industries must meet two basic conditions. on one hand, to reduce the social costs of monopoly and protect consumers, on the other hand, to create a sufficiently transparent and predictable business environment. Only in such environment, businesses are able to formulate and long-term and strategic decisions. The current state of regulation in network industries in the Czech Republic is described in the further section of the contribution. The main attention is devoted to price regulation and pricing in network industries. Characteristics of the regulation are based on the basic form of pricing which is based on the allowed revenues defined as the sum of allowed costs, depreciation and allowed a profit, all variables are adjusted for parameter market factor. At present, even in sectors which in the past were characterized by natural monopoly, the situation has changed so that businesses often meet competition in some of their activities. Regulation should contribute to a competitive environment in those market segments and business areas if it is possible.","[Soukupova, Jana] Univ Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Soukupová, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",jasoukup@vse.cz,,,Faculty of Business Administration [IP 300040],Faculty of Business Administration,This article is provided as one of the outputs of the research project IP 300040 Competitiveness of the Faculty of Business Administration.,,11,0,0,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,1502,1510,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455325300150,0

Large gaps in major content exist: men are more likely to study math-, science-, and business-intensive fields, while women are more likely to study humanities-, social science-, and education-intensive fields. Previous research has found that gender differences in college preparation, typically measured by SAT scores, can account for only a small portion of these differences. Using a broader array of pre-college test scores (the ASVAB), I show that differences in college preparation can actually account for a large portion of most gender gaps in college major content, including 62% of the gap in science, 66% of the gap in humanities, and 47% of the gap in engineering. SAT scores explain less than half as much as the ASVAB scores, while noncognitive skill measures appear to explain none of the gaps in major. The gender gaps in test scores, particularly in science and mechanical fields, exist by the mid-teenage years and grow with age.","[Speer, Jamin D.] Univ Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152 USA",University of Memphis,"Speer, JD (通讯作者)，Univ Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152 USA.",jspeer@memphis.edu,,,Fogelman College of Business and Economics at the University of Memphis,Fogelman College of Business and Economics at the University of Memphis,"This work was supported in part by a grant from the Fogelman College of Business and Economics at the University of Memphis.

This problem is then illustrated on selected countries and their public expenditures on pensions. The next part introduces the social contract theory. The unwillingness of younger generation to contribute to the pension systems is explained as well as the implicit nature of contract which therefore will not be authorised by the population. The last part offers some indicators and possible solutions to the issue. These proposals are meant to mitigate the current negative situation of pension systems. Moreover, it is shown that some of the indicators have rather universal validity and they can be used to retrospectively compare generations of different era as well as improve the future outlook of pension systems if introduced.","[Stejskal, Jakub; Bartosova, Jitka] Univ Econ, Fac Management Jindrichuv Hradec, Jarosovska 1177-2, Jindrichuv Hradec 37701, Czech Republic",,"Stejskal, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Management Jindrichuv Hradec, Jarosovska 1177-2, Jindrichuv Hradec 37701, Czech Republic.",jakubstejskal@seznam.cz; bartosov@fm.vse.cz,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,1547,1555,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455325300154,0

A conventional theoretical rationale for the presence of an outside blockholder is mitigation of the agency problem via monitoring. Our model provides a novel insight: outside blockholders may be attracted by entrepreneurs with low, rather than high, agency problems in order to signal their low propensity to extract private benefits. Our result yields a new interpretation of an often documented positive relationship between outside ownership concentration in a firm and its market valuation: it may be driven by sorting rather than by the direct effect of monitoring. We show that the positive correlation may arise even if the blockholder derives private benefits and has no positive impact on the value of small shares. Our analysis also helps to explain why the market reacts more favorably to private placements of equity as opposed to public issues. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Employing the course of events during the recent economic conflict between the two countries, the article models the stages of a trade game wherein players exhibit non-cooperative behaviour. It finds that Turkey reporting Russia to the DSB depends on the cost of the dispute, which represents both economic losses and losses that can be considered disadvantages in a broader sense. The results show that in trade relations where asymmetric interdependence is observed, if both parties mutually commit to an international organisation, binding regulations may provide strategy options that are otherwise infeasible for the disadvantaged player.","[Tasbasi, Asli] Isik Univ, Dept Econ, Sile, Turkey; [Tasbasi, Asli] Isik Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey",Isik University; Isik University,"Tasbasi, A (通讯作者)，Isik Univ, Dept Econ, Sile, Turkey.;Tasbasi, A (通讯作者)，Isik Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey.",asli.sen@isikun.edu.tr,,,,,,,12,5,5,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Additionally, we investigate asymmetries in the causality issue by examining the direction across trading partners.Our empirical results show that there is a two-way causality between the two variables when we look at the sample as a whole. A causal link running from the real exchange rate to export diversification is consistent with the standard literature but it is not systematic at all. The reverse causation is very appealing and challenges the standard argument on exchange rate determination. When the causality issue is investigated by treating export markets differently, our findings at the aggregate level are confirmed in exports destined for the advanced countries. The analysis for South-South' trade only shows a unidirectional link from the real exchange rate to changes in export diversification. The same tests performed at the individual countries level reveal a heterogeneous causality across trading partners.","[Thi Anh-Dao Tran; Minh Hong Phi] Univ Rouen, Dept Econ, Rouen, France; [Diaw, Diadie] Univ Rennes 2, Fac Social Sci, Rennes, France",Universite de Rouen Normandie; Universite de Rennes; Universite Rennes 2,"Tran, TAD (通讯作者)，Univ Rouen, Dept Econ, Rouen, France.",thianh-dao.tran@univ-rouen.fr,"TRAN, Thi Anh-Dao/IUN-0688-2023","TRAN, Thi Anh-Dao/0000-0002-9221-2654",,,,,51,10,10,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

This paper proposes a maximum entropy model that allows for the simultaneous estimation of unobserved commodity flows as well as corresponding prices such that data constraints in various units of measurement, levels of aggregation and possibly mismatching classifications are simultaneously satisfied. Its capability is assessed through a Monte-Carlo analysis and its performance compared with a simple step-wise approach.

Therefore, this study is to examine the effect of eWOM (electronic word-of-mouth) and social influence on product adoption intention in the mobile phone context. A conceptual framework has been proposed, in which four parts of the extended version of Information Adoption Model (IAM) and social influence affect information adoption intention and the willingness of consumers to adoption a high tech device. The samples were gathered from mobile phone users in Vietnam and put into data analysis with Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The results indicate that although eWOM which is the information sharing on online context does not have a direct impact on customer's intention to adopt new products, it still has an indirect effect on consumer behavioral intention through mediate variables namely information usefulness and information adoption in this context. Moreover, social influence has been confirmed for its strong effect on adoption intention of users.

Such investments are characterized by a high degree of exogenous and endogenous uncertainty combined with complex feedbacks, making conventional capital budgeting techniques inadequate. It introduces a comprehensive valuation model developed for the Shyman (Sustainable Hydrothermal Manufacturing of Nanomaterials) project, which researched and implemented new technologies in nanomaterial production and application. This represents a highly innovative and complex industry in all life cycle stages, making it a perfect candidate for research. The model combines various analytical methods, including a recursive form of life cycle costing (LCC), as well as statistical simulation (Monte Carlo) and real options, and addresses valuation from the perspective of a new end-product, as well as that of the production facility investor. A high Net Advantage to Innovating (NAI) has been identified in the industry. This result is strongly biased in favour of end-product innovators. Nevertheless, the hydrothermal synthesis-based nanomaterial production process benefits from its high degree of flexibility, i.e. option to switch, with a significant value premium arising due to outsize dynamics and uncertainty in the nanoindustry. Experience gained through this research can be extended to other cases of value-based analysis related to innovation.","[Vlachy, Jan] Czech Tech Univ, Kolejni 2637-2a, Prague 16000 6, Czech Republic",Czech Technical University Prague,"Vlachy, J (通讯作者)，Czech Tech Univ, Kolejni 2637-2a, Prague 16000 6, Czech Republic.",jan.vlachy@cvut.cz,,"Vlachy, Jan/0000-0002-2270-3247",,,,,48,3,3,0,7,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The weights determined by our method have two advantages: the evaluation value has a large weight if it is close to the positive ideal evaluation value and far from negative ideal evaluation values at the same time, otherwise it is assigned a small weight; experts have different weights for different attributes, which are more appropriate for real decision making problems since each expert has his/her own knowledge and expertise. The multiple attribute intuitionistic fuzzy group decision making algorithm has been proposed which is suitable for different situations about the attribute weight information, including the attribute weights are known exactly, partly known and unknown completely.

Market interventions backed by huge foreign exchange reserves and capital controls are not sufficient to eliminate the expectations of devaluation. Creating a market-based and flexible RMB exchange rate regime holds the key to the elimination of devaluation expectations. The present paper compares the pros and cons of several policy options, and proposes to introduce, as a transition to free floating, a new exchange rate regime pegged to a currency basket with a wide band. The new regime should be able to give the RMB exchange rate enough flexibility to eliminate devaluation expectations as well as prevent excessive overshooting. To ensure a smooth transition, the new regime needs to be supported by controlling cross-border capital flows.","[Yu, Yongding; Zhang, Bin; Zhang, Ming] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Yu, YD (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yuyongding@126.com; zbiwep@126.com; zhangmingcass@vip.126.com,,,,,,,5,9,9,1,24,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JAN-FEB,2017,25.0,1,,,,,58,70,,10.1111/cwe.12186,0.0,,,13,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EK3QC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000393839900004,0

Among these macro factors, a strong correlation emerges with the lower opportunity cost of holding cash, as measured by the interest rate decline. We also assess the role of cash determinants at the firm level, relating them to different motives for holding cash, such as precautionary reasons, transaction costs, and the effects of information asymmetries in financial markets.

The results regarding CSR firms are in sharp contrast to the conventional wisdom regarding profit-seeking firms. In fact, profits can be larger under Cournot (resp. Bertrand) competition also when products are complements (resp. substitutes). Moreover, if the goods are substitutes, then the dominant strategy for each firm may be the choice of the price contract in the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. Also, the dominant Bertrand strategy equilibrium when the goods are complements may be Paretoinferior from the firms' perspective.

Global banking network has been analysed extensively in prior or post-crisis periods, but the literature on regionalization is scarce, especially with regard to the banking sector in the EU. Moreover, in previous empirical research evaluation of banking sector regionalization using network analysis methodology has not been yet applied. Purpose of the article: The aim of the article is to map the EU banking network and to assess its regionalization during post-crisis period. Methods: the paper employs comparative literature analysis and synthesis; BIS bilateral interbank cross-border claim yearly flows matrix data and network analysis method (including network mapping, structural and comparative analysis and the data of intraregional and interregional banking network matrices) to assess the changes in regionalization of the EU banking system. Findings & Value added: The results of the research show that during post-crisis period both, EU 12 and EU 28, banking networks became more clustered and more decentralized; also the level of regionalization within the EU banking network increased. Such results prove that the EU banking network has undergone structural changes with respect to bilateral interbank cross-border claims. This research adds to the knowledge of regionalization processes within the EU banking network during the post-crisis period and intends to be beneficial for market participants, EU level governmental bodies and financial policy makers.","[Gaigaliene, Asta; Jurakovaite, Otilija; Legenzova, Renata] Vytautas Magnus Univ, Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Legenzova, R (通讯作者)，Vytautas Magnus Univ, Fac Econ & Management, S Daukanto 28, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania.",renata.legenzova@vdu.lt,"Legenzova, Renata/X-5448-2019","Legenzova, Renata/0000-0002-5987-033X",,,,,26,5,5,1,5,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

But what do we know about how MFIs reach and combine these two goals? We carry out a systematic review of close to 170 papers discussing the determinants of the financial and social performance of MFIs. The review shows that the most important determinants addressed in the literature are MFI characteristics (size, age and type of organization), their funding sources, the quality of organizational governance and the MFIs' external context such as macro-economic, institutional and political conditions. The evidence on these issues is rather mixed. Moreover, the direction of the relationship between these drivers and MFI performance depends on the context, particularly the country-specific context. Finally, there is a lack of consensus in the literature on the measurement of financial and social performance. Due to the complexity of the concept, we argue that social performance should only be assessed by using a multidimensional perspective. This can be done either by applying recent and holistic social performance measures such as the SPI4, or at least by using a combination of proxies, such as outreach, gender and rural measures.","[Hermes, Niels] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; [Hudon, Marek] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium",University of Groningen; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Hudon, M (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.",mhudon@ulb.ac.be,,,"ESRC [ES/N013344/2, ES/N013344/1] Funding Source: UKRI",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,207,74,78,2,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

Our model reveals that a stable IEA depends on the magnitude of the relationship between the benefit-cost ratios of the two types of countries, not on their compositions. That is, the number of punishing countries for a weakly renegotiation-proof equilibrium depends on the benefit-cost ratios of the two types of countries. Our results show that a global cooperation on abatement among the two types of countries can be achieved by addressing deviation through flexibly selecting punishing countries based on benefit-cost ratios.","[Takashima, Nobuyuki] Kyushu Univ, Platform Inter Transdisciplinary Energy Res Q PIT, Nishi Ku, 744 Motooka, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan",Kyushu University,"Takashima, N (通讯作者)，Kyushu Univ, Platform Inter Transdisciplinary Energy Res Q PIT, Nishi Ku, 744 Motooka, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan.",ntakashima@econ.kyushu-u.ac.jp,,"Takashima, Nobuyuki/0000-0002-1384-9025",,,,,24,5,5,1,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0922-1425,1879-2006,,JPN WORLD ECON,Jpn.

Controlling for country and time fixed effects and using an exogenous source of variation to instrument remittances, the baseline results show that remittances start having a positive effect on democratic institutions when remittances reach 22% of GDP. This evidence suggests that remittances can influence the relationship between recipients and political elites, providing incentives for recipient households to hold their political representatives more accountable.","[Williams, Kevin] Univ West Indies, Dept Econ, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago",University West Indies Mona Jamaica; University West Indies Saint Augustine,"Williams, K (通讯作者)，Univ West Indies, Dept Econ, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago.",Kevin.Williams@sta.uwi.edu,,,,,,,43,3,3,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Several key institutional changes, including the reform and opening-up that began in the late 1970s and China's entry into the WTO in 2001, accelerated this process. We build a two-country dual economic model to explain how labor shares decline in labor-intensive and capital-intensive countries simultaneously. Our empirical results show that the integration of Chinese labor significantly affects the global labor share, mainly through the channel of international trade and especially processing trade business.","[Xu, Xiang] CUFE, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xu, Xiang] Stanford Univ, Hoover Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Li, David Daokui] Tsinghua Univ, CCWE, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Mofei] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Int Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",Stanford University; Tsinghua University; Capital University of Economics & Business,"Zhao, MF (通讯作者)，Capital Univ Econ & Business, Int Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",mofeizhao@ucla.edu,,,,,,,44,7,9,2,25,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

The MAIRCA method is based on the comparison of theoretical and empirical alternative ratings. Relying on theoretical and empirical ratings the gap (distance) between the empirical and ideal alternative is defined. To determine the weight coefficients of the criteria, the DEMATEL method was applied. In this paper, through a sensitivity analysis, the results of MAIRCA and other MCDM methods - MOORA, TOPSIS, ELECTRE, COPRAS and PROMETHEE - were compared. The analysis showed that a smaller or bigger instability in altemative rankings appears in MOORA, TOPSIS, ELECTRE and COPRAS. On the other hand, the analysis showed that MAIRCA and PROMETHEE offer consistent solutions and have a stable and well-structured analytical framework for ranking the alternatives. By presenting a new method MCDM expands the theoretical framework of expertise in the field of MCDM. This enables the analysis of practical problems with new methodology and creates a basis for further theoretical and practical upgrade.","[Pamucar, Dragan S.] Univ Def Belgrade, Dept Logist, Belgrade, Serbia; [Tarle, Snezana Pejcic; Parezanovic, Tanja] Univ Belgrade, Fac Transport & Traff Engn, Belgrade, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Pamucar, DS (通讯作者)，Univ Def Belgrade, Dept Logist, Belgrade, Serbia.",dpamucar@gmail.com,"Pamucar, Dragan/AAG-8288-2019; Živojinović, Tanja/AAA-9614-2020","Pamucar, Dragan/0000-0001-8522-1942; Živojinović, Tanja/0000-0003-0015-1637",,,,,35,56,58,8,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The contribution to the literature is twofold. First, the use of the Kejriwal and Perron (2010) algorithm allows us to detect any number of structural breaks in the level and in the trend without prior knowledge of the integration order. This is a significant improvement over the algorithms previously used in the literature which limits the number of possible structural breaks to two. In fact, we find that some countries show more than two breaks. Second, we use the longest data series in the literature. That enables us to tell a much richer story about the catching up process in Western Europe. We find that events like the World Wars, the creation of the European Economic Community and the information technology revolution, among others, were likely to cause such breaks.

Yet, little is known about the mechanisms through which foreign aid might affect migration decisions. To this end, we run gravity-type regressions for the aid categories proposed by Clemens et al. (2012): (i) short-impact aid that may generate income growth in the short to medium term, and (ii) late-impact aid that affects non-monetary dimensions of well-being such as the quality of public services but may lead to higher incomes only in the long run. We find a strongly negative impact of late-impact aid, which suggests that donors may be able to dampen migrant inflows by focusing on improved public services. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This depends crucially on the costs of inflation. An important concern is that high inflation will lead to inefficient price dispersion. Workhorse New Keynesian models imply that this cost of inflation is very large. An increase in steady-state inflation from 0% to 10% yields a welfare loss that is an order of magnitude greater than the welfare loss from business cycle fluctuations in output in these models. We assess this prediction empirically using a new data set on price behavior during the Great Inflation of the late 1970s and early 1980s in the United States. If price dispersion increases rapidly with inflation, we should see the absolute size of price changes increasing with inflation: price changes should become larger as prices drift further from their optimal level at higher inflation rates. We find no evidence that the absolute size of price changes rose during the Great Inflation. This suggests that the standard New Keynesian analysis of the welfare costs of inflation is wrong and its implications for the optimal inflation rate need to be reassessed. We also find that (nonsale) prices have not become more flexible over the past 40 years.","[Nakamura, Emi] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Fed Commun Commiss, Fed Reserve Board, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Nakamura, E (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,"Sun, Patrick/0009-0005-6003-3538","National Science Foundation [SES-0922011, SES-1056107]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We owe an enormous debt of gratitude to Daniel Ginsberg, John Greenlees, Michael Horrigan, Robert McClelland, John Molino, Ted To, and numerous others at the Bureau of Labor Statistics for their help in the decade-long project of constructing the data set used in this article.

Results show that strengthening patent protection can raise the economic growth rate and social welfare through an endogenous survival investment. Additionally, this study examines the effects of increasing subsidies for R&D. We find that increasing R&D subsidy rate can negatively affect economic growth and social welfare because of the investment for survival activities. This result shows the novel role of a blocking patent in determining innovation effects of R&D subsidies. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of patent breadth which is another patent instrument in this model on innovation and economic growth. Results show that the growth and welfare effects of the profit-division rule and the subsidy rate for R&D may vary with the size of patent breadth.","[Niwa, Sumiko] Japan Soc Promot Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Niwa, Sumiko] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Osaka University,"Niwa, S (通讯作者)，Japan Soc Promot Sci, Tokyo, Japan.;Niwa, S (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan.",niwa.sumiko.44z@gmail.com,,,[15J09530]; [18J00533],;,"I am especially grateful to Giacomo Corneo (the Editor) and two anonymous referees for their valuable comments and suggestions.

The incorporation of heterogeneity into a monopolistic competition setting is achieved by assuming a nested Cobb-Douglas and CES utility function exhibiting both country and sector-specific consumer tastes and expenditure shares on manufacturing and traditional goods. The key question analyzed in the paper is how consumer heterogeneity affects the home bias of trade in different countries. The key finding here is that the heterogeneity in tastes and incomes of consumers can provide a substantial influence on degree of home bias in trade but only in combination with high transportation costs.,"[Osharin, Alexander; Verbus, Valery] Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Nizhnii Novgorod 603155, Russia; [Verbus, Valery] RAS, Inst Phys Microstruct, Nizhnii Novgorod 603950, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); Russian Academy of Sciences,"Osharin, A (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Nizhnii Novgorod 603155, Russia.",aosharin@hse.ru; vverbus@hse.ru,"Osharin, Alexander/H-6192-2015",,RFBR fund [17-06-00572],RFBR fund(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)),The authors acknowledge the financial support from RFBR fund Grant No. 17-06-00572.,,43,2,2,2,17,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

The DM's payoff equals the benefit minus the cost, the agent's payoff equals the benefit. The interpretation is that the agent is a tactician whereas the DM is a strategist, in the sense that they have a common component in their preferences (the benefit) but the strategist further has big picture considerations (the costs), which are absent from the tactician's world view. If there are two alternatives, the agent recommends a maximum-benefit alternative in any non-trivial equilibrium.

We examine the long-term impact of Mexico's 16th-century demographic collapse on landholding patterns through the present day. We show that the collapse, which reduced the indigenous population by between 70 and 90 percent and differed in severity across space, facilitated land concentration and the rise of a landowner class that dominated Mexican political economy for centuries. To identify the impact of the population collapse on land arrangements we use an instrumental variables identification strategy exploiting climatic shocks associated with an epidemic in the 1570s that roughly halved the indigenous population. Though landholding patterns were transformed following the Revolution of 1910, we also show that disease-impacted areas now have more land in common-property institutions with limited property rights. The population collapse thus had a persistent impact on Mexican political economy, but the nature of this impact has changed radically over time.","[Sellars, Emily A.] Yale Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 115 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Alix-Garcia, Jennifer] Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, 213 Ballard Extens Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Yale University; Oregon State University,"Alix-Garcia, J (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, 213 Ballard Extens Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",emily.sellars@yale.edu; jennifer.alix-garcia@oregonstate.edu,"Alix-Garcia, Jennifer/W-1762-2019","Alix-Garcia, Jennifer/0000-0003-0200-0496",,,,,94,21,26,4,15,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

In hindsight, all of these factors worked when they were present. Critics warned of too sharp an output fall, which did not come to pass, lagging institutional development, and neglect of social reforms.

Consistent with the view of measures of stress as proxies for Lagrangean multipliers in models of household production, we show that births increase time stress, especially among mothers, and that the effects last at least several years. Births also slightly raise both parents' financial stress.

The method assumes a collective model of household consumption with the public and private nature of goods specified by the empirical analyst. A main distinguishing feature of our approach is that it builds on a revealed preference characterization of the collective model that is intrinsically nonparametric. We show how to identify individual money metric welfare indices from observed household demand, along with the intrahousehold sharing rule and the individuals' willingness-to-pay for public consumption (i.e. Lindahl prices). The method is easy to use in practice and yields informative empirical results, which we demonstrate through both a simulation exercise and an empirical application to labor supply data drawn from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics.

First, we analyze the roles of culture, legal origin, democracy, and geographic openness as determinants of regulation of foreign entry. Strong evidence illustrates that more individualist cultures and geographically open countries regulate foreign entry less. Our findings also show that cultural values matter more in countries with common law traditions. In contrast, the association between democracy and the regulation of foreign entry is fragile. Next, we examine the consequences from foreign entry regulation. Evidence suggests a strong, negative, and economically significant association between the regulation of foreign entry and inward foreign direct investment (FDI). The regulation of domestic entry, however, is positively associated with FDI inflows. This result is robust to controlling for a variety of economic, cultural, and institutional variables.","[Davis, Lewis] Union Coll, Dept Econ, 807 Union St, Schenectady, NY 12308 USA; [Williamson, Claudia R.] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, 312F McCool Hall,POB 9580, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA",Union College; Mississippi State University,"Davis, L (通讯作者)，Union Coll, Dept Econ, 807 Union St, Schenectady, NY 12308 USA.",davisl@union.edu; claudia.williamson@msstate.edu,,,,,,,91,6,6,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Using a sample of 2,650 firm-years of Turkish firms for the period 1996 to 2013, we find that an increase in the short-term cash flows is associated with an increase in cash balances, irrespective of whether or not firms are financially constrained. However, unconstrained firms hold a larger cash balance than constrained firms. Dividends are positively related to the short-term cash flows of both types of firms. Investments are not sensitive to cash flow for either type of firms. An increase in their short-term cash flow induces the financially constrained firms to reduce debt financing, but makes the unconstrained firms increase their debt financing and reduce equity financing. Although firms in general prefer to use part of the saved cash in the long term, they do not deplete their cash savings. Constrained firms resort to debt financing in response to an increase in their long-term cash flow.","[Erdogan, Aysa Ipek] Bogazici Univ, Dept Tourism Adm, Istanbul, Turkey",Bogazici University,"Erdogan, AI (通讯作者)，Bogazici Univ, Dept Tourism Adm, Istanbul, Turkey.",aysa.erdogan@boun.edu.tr,"Erdogan, Aysa/AAQ-3371-2020",,,,,,36,0,0,0,7,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Using a regression discontinuity design, we estimate the effect of a four-year university education on earnings, and we explore the pathways through which the effect operates. Our estimation exploits the centralized, score-based college/university admission system in China, where the minimum scores required for university admission are externally determined by the provincial governments. Our findings suggest that being eligible for four-year university admission implies a sizable increase in earnings. The payoff can be attributed to the prolonged length of education and improvements in education quality, although the quality effects cannot be precisely estimated.","[Fan, Elliott] Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei 100, Taiwan; [Meng, Xin] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Wei, Zhichao] Guotai Junan Secur Co Ltd, Shanghai 601211, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Guochang] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Chengdu 610074, Sichuan, Peoples R China",National Taiwan University; Australian National University; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Fan, E (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei 100, Taiwan.",elliottfan@ntu.edu.tw; Xin.Meng@anu.edu.au; zhichaowei@gmail.com; guochangzhao@swufe.edu.cn,"wei, zhichao/KBU-7946-2024; Fan, Elliott/AAO-6499-2020","Fan, Elliott/0000-0002-2511-2581; Zhao, Guochang/0000-0001-8808-6803",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71603215]; Australian Research Council [DP 180102875],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),We gratefully acknowledge comments and suggestions by seminar and conference participants.

By exploiting unique data, I isolate the endogenous part of current German skills and instrument current command by German proficiency measured retrospectively at the point in time of migration. This approach tackles the problem that labor market effects from current language skills are at risk to reflect merely the sum of a successful residence in Germany and only display growth effects. I find that a good command of German increases labor market income by 47.0% for males, while no significant language effects are detected for females. Further analyses illustrate that differences in language effects by gender can be attributed to selection into different occupations and part-time employments and that language operates complementary and enables cross-border transferability of human capital.","[Schuss, Eric] Univ Duisburg Essen, Fac Business Adm & Econ, Chair Publ Econ, Weststadtturme Berliner Pl 6-8, D-45127 Essen, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen,"Schuss, E (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Fac Business Adm & Econ, Chair Publ Econ, Weststadtturme Berliner Pl 6-8, D-45127 Essen, Germany.",Eric.Schuss@uni-due.de,,,,,,,35,4,4,1,20,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

We devise an endogenous growth model that encompasses long-run economic change building on the concept of entropy as a time varying state-dependent complexity effect. We show that the empirical evidence supports entropy as an 'operator' of the complexity effect. It also suggests that part of the modern innovations have a stabilizing role in the complexity of the economies, as the 'operator' levels off despite the continuous increase in the measure of technological varieties. The model features endogenous growth, with null or small scale effects, or stagnation, in the long run. The model can replicate well the take-off after the industrial revolution and the productivity slowdown in the second half of the XXth century. Long-run scenarios based on in-sample calibration are discussed, and may help explain (part of) the growth crises affecting the current generation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We apply a learning reinforcement model to analyse the conditions needed to have a stable cooperative equilibrium when people take part in a common project and could take advantages of free-riding. Our results show that a stable equilibrium can be reached thank to mechanisms of punishment, but the final result strongly depends on the risk-taking individuals' preferences. In particular, we find that the penalties will be effective only with people having high exploration rates,namely with people able to adapt their strategies and learn to cooperate. Otherwise, it is possible to have an unstable equilibrium with cooperation until individuals have a very high intrinsic motivation to cooperate, whatever the others do.","[Solferino, Nazaria; Taurino, Serena F.] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Econ Dept, Rome, Italy; [Solferino, Viviana] Univ Calabria, Math & Comp Sci Dept, Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata; University of Calabria,"Solferino, N (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Econ Dept, Rome, Italy.",nazaria.solferino@uniroma2.it,"Solferino, Viviana/AAU-7510-2020",,,,,,41,0,0,0,21,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

In particular, I examine how a prior belief arising from the Great Depression may have influenced the macroeconomy during the last 75 years. In the model, households hold twisted beliefs concerning the likelihood and persistence of recession and boom states that are affected by the Great Depression. These initial beliefs are substantially different from the true data generating process and are only gradually unwound during subsequent years. Even though the driving stochastic process for technology is unchanged over the entire period, the nature of macroeconomic performance is altered considerably for many decades before eventually converging to the rational expectations equilibrium. This provides some evidence of the lingering effects of beliefs-twisting events on the behavior of macroeconomic variables.","[Suda, Jacek] Narodowy Bank Polski, Swietokrzyska 11-21, PL-00919 Warsaw, Poland; [Suda, Jacek] Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland",Narodowy Bank Polski; Warsaw School of Economics,"Suda, J (通讯作者)，Narodowy Bank Polski, Swietokrzyska 11-21, PL-00919 Warsaw, Poland.",jacek.suda@nbp.pl,,"Suda, Jacek/0000-0002-8259-533X",,,,,16,2,1,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Using a modified strategy-method approach we identify individual punishment patterns and link them with individual cooperation patterns. Classifying N = 628 subjects along these two dimensions documents that cooperation and punishment patterns are aligned for most individuals. However, the data also reveal a sizable share of free riders that punish pro-socially and conditional cooperators that do not engage in punishment. Analyzing the interplay between types in an additional experiment, we show that pro-social punishers are important for achieving cooperation. Incorporating information on punishment types explains large amounts of the between- and within-group variation in cooperation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We analyze the relationship between the personal and the functional income distribution in our sample, before disentangling their effects on the current account. A consistent finding is that rising (top-end) personal inequality leads to a decrease of the current account, controlling for standard current account determinants. By contrast, a fall in the share of wages in national income leads to an increase in the current account. We further analyze how different measures of income distribution affect the financial balances of the household, corporate and government sectors and discuss potential theoretical explanations of our findings. We conclude that changes in personal and functional income distribution have contributed considerably to the widening of current account balances, and hence to the instability of the international economic system, prior to the global financial crisis starting in 2007.

Focusing on the second of these failures, this paper makes two contributions. First, I review research since the crisis on the role of credit factors in the decisions of households, firms, and financial intermediaries and in macroeconomic modeling. This research provides broad support for the view that credit market developments deserve greater attention from macroeconomists, not only for analyzing the economic effects of financial crises but in the study of ordinary business cycles as well. Second, I provide new evidence on the channels by which the recent financial crisis depressed economic activity in the United States. Although the deterioration of household balance sheets and the associated deleveraging likely exacerbated the initial economic downturn and the slowness of the recovery, I find that the unusual severity of the Great Recession was due primarily to the panic in funding and securitization markets, which disrupted the supply of credit. This finding helps to justify the government's extraordinary efforts to stem the panic in order to avoid greater damage to the real economy.","[Bernanke, Ben S.] Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Brookings Institution,"Bernanke, BS (通讯作者)，Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",,,,,,,,177,40,42,1,19,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

Typically, a feasible measure of capital is calculated by accumulating investment flows from an initial value of the capital stock. As the time dimension of most disaggregated data is rather short, the choice of this initial value can have significant effects on the resulting capital estimates. Most empirical studies impute the initial value using a single arbitrary proxy. In this paper, we propose a panel data framework that assigns weighting coefficients to multiple proxy variables. We conduct a series of Monte Carlo experiments to test the performance of the proposed method and apply the method to a U.S. manufacturing dataset. The results suggest that our method improves the approximation of the capital stock and thus in turn reduces the bias in the production function estimation.","[Chen, Xi; Plotnikova, Tatiana] ANEC STATEC, BP 304, L-2013 Luxembourg, Luxembourg",,"Chen, X (通讯作者)，ANEC STATEC, BP 304, L-2013 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",xi.chen@statec.etat.lu,,,Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR); European Commission,Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR)(Luxembourg National Research Fund); European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"We would like to thank Bertrand Koebel, Jacques Mairesse, Eric Bartelsman, and two anonymous referees for very helpful comments.

Although there is empirical evidence that both EMS adoption and certification can effectively improve firms' environmental performance, the impact on their business performance is far from clear. Drawing upon an OECD survey including more than 4000 manufacturing facilities, this paper fills this void by estimating the impact of both EMS adoption and certification on facilities' business performance using statistical matching techniques. While providing for a didactic summary of matching methods, our results indicate that the pure adoption of EMS without any certification does not enhance facilities' business performance, the financial performance of certified facilities turns out to be significantly higher.

These models are dominated by a substitution effect of money holdings for capital holdings, as an increase in the inflation rate due to money growth raises the cost of holding money and depresses the real money holdings. Using a monetary endogenous growth model, the effects of wealth-induced social status on long-run growth is reconsidered. The analysis is enhanced through the addition of a competitive banking sector that intermediates the available capital in the economy, subject to a mandatory cash reserve requirement. The cash reserve requirement creates a wedge between the deposit rate and the loan rate. While the real loan rate is tied with the constant marginal product of capital, the real deposit rate is negatively related to the rate of inflation. This leads to another, opposing substitution effect of deposit holdings for real money holdings and hence, increases the cost of holding deposits as inflation increases. The consolidated theoretical model described herein supports a diverse range of theoretical findings, contingent on the presence of wealth effects or the spirit of capitalism, using a simpler and more tractable framework that accounts for the role of the banking system in monetary policy decision outcomes. Significantly, as long as the mandatory reserve requirement imposed on the banking system by the monetary authority exceeds a (small) critical value, an increase in the money growth rate will lead to a decrease in the long-run growth rate of the economy.","[Gupta, Rangan; Stander, Lardo] Univ Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Gupta, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa.",,,"Stander, Lardo/0000-0002-8099-8063",,,,,49,1,1,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

Using a local projections approach, we estimate impulse responses of three margins of sectoral labour market adjustment - employment, hours worked and real wages. Consistent with recent results in the literature, we find contractionary financing shocks to depress all three indicators of the labour market. Furthermore, responses are asymmetric depending on the sign of the shock, different in magnitude depending on the sectoral composition, and sensitive to labour market institutions such as employment protection legislation and union density. Finally, labour market institutions seem to mainly affect the relative strength of the adjustment margins and not so much the overall response of the wage bill.","[Hantzsche, Arno] Natl Inst Econ & Social Res, London, England; [Savsek, Simon] European Investment Bank, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Weber, Sebastian] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Weber, S (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",sweber@imf.org,,,,,,,23,3,3,0,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

In this paper, tail-dependence clustering was applied to divide candidate assets into different groups according to their tail dependence during the crisis period and the ARMA-GARCH vine copula-opinion pooling approach was applied to select the minimum Conditional Value-at-Risk portfolio according to the clustering results. The daily closed prices of the components of DAX 20 from 3 January 2006 to 20 December 2014 were studied to illustrate the methodology. The results reveal that more than 90% of 450 possible portfolios are modelled by D-vine structure and Student's t-copula dominates almost all the cases for pair copula selection. As Student's t-copula captures the symmetric tail dependence, the 450 possible portfolios do not show stronger lower tail dependence than upper tail dependence. This study contributes by combining cluster analysis with portfolios selection. It uses vine copula to capture the dependence structure among assets. Finally, it offers a flexible method to describe market and offers a strategy to construct diversified portfolios by adding the investors' information into portfolio selection procedure at the 1-day forecast horizon.","[Ji, Hao] Northwest A&F Univ, Xianyang, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hao] Jilin Univ, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Liseo, Brunero] Sapienza Univ Rome, Rome, Italy",Northwest A&F University - China; Jilin University; Sapienza University Rome,"Wang, H (通讯作者)，Jilin Univ, Sch Econ, Changchun 130012, Jilin, Peoples R China.",haowang@jlu.edu.cn,,"Wang, Hao/0000-0001-7387-3636",National Nature Science Foundation of China [71703123]; Youth Foundation of Northwest AF University [2452016160]; National Social Science Foundation of China [2015ZDA017]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2016M601366]; Major Program of Key Research institute of Philosophy and Social Science in Jilin University [2017XXJD11]; Italian Ministry of Instruction and University (MIUR) [2013-C26A13BBCB],"National Nature Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Youth Foundation of Northwest AF University; National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Major Program of Key Research institute of Philosophy and Social Science in Jilin University; Italian Ministry of Instruction and University (MIUR)(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","The first author acknowledges the support of the National Nature Science Foundation of China (Grant No.: 71703123) and the Youth Foundation of Northwest A&F University (Grant No.: 2452016160).

Several vehicles, such as the Honda Civic, are available in both hybrid and gasoline versions. Such vehicles share many of the same attributes, with the main difference being fuel efficiency, and provide a unique setting to examine these issues. We emphasize methodological and data issues that typically have not been a focus in prior studies, such as partial observability, endogeneity, and measurement error. Estimates of the rebound effect and consumer valuation of fuel economy remain imprecise despite the use of the detailed household level data and sound methodology to handle limitations with these data. The inability to precisely estimate these important policy questions suggests it is useful to obtain reliable, detailed data on household vehicles, paired with rich household-and person-level survey data.","[Lloro, Alicia] Fed Deposit Insurance Corp, 550 17th St,NW Room F-7036, Washington, DC 20429 USA; [Brownstone, David] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC); University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Brownstone, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",alloro@fdic.gov; dbrownst@uci.edu,,,"UC Center for Energy and Environmental Economics; UC Multi-Campus Research Program in Sustainable Transport: Technology, Mobility, and Infrastructure; Center for Economics and Public Policy; UCI School of Social Sciences","UC Center for Energy and Environmental Economics; UC Multi-Campus Research Program in Sustainable Transport: Technology, Mobility, and Infrastructure; Center for Economics and Public Policy; UCI School of Social Sciences","We would like to thank Kenneth Small, Ivan Jeliazkov, Jinwon Kim, and Phillip Li for helpful comments on earlier drafts.

SOME EVIDENCE FROM HIGH-FREQUENCY INTRA-DAY SOUTH AFRICAN DATA,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Exchange rate; expectations; monetary policy surprises; repo rate; returns; volatility,IMPACT; MARKET; NEWS; PRICES; EXPECTATIONS,"This paper examines the temporal effect of domestic monetary policy surprises on both returns and volatility of returns of the South African rand/U.S. dollar exchange rate. The analysis in this event study proceeds using intra-day minute-by-minute exchange rate data, repo rate data from the South African Reserve Bank's scheduled monetary policy announcements, and market consensus repo rate forecasts. A carefully selected sample over the period August 2003 to November 2017 ensures that the change in monetary policy is exogenous to the exchange rate. We find statistically and economically significant responses in intra-day high-frequency South African rand/U.S. dollar exchange rate returns and volatility of exchange rate returns to domestic interest rate surprises, but anticipated changes have no bearing on exchange rate returns and their volatility. The empirical results also indicate that there is an instantaneous response of the rand/dollar exchange rate to monetary policy surprises and that monetary policy news is an important determinant of the exchange rate until at least 42 minutes after the pronouncement - suggesting a high degree of market efficiency in its mechanical sense (although not necessarily in the deeper economic-informational sense) in processing this information. Essentially, the asymmetric GARCH results exhibit no leverage effects - positive and negative information shocks have symmetric effects on conditional variance.","[May, Cyril; Farrell, Greg; Rossouw, Jannie] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Farrell, Greg] South African Reserve Bank, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"May, C (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa.",cyril.may@wits.ac.za,,"May, Cyril/0000-0002-3555-8309; Rossouw, Jannie/0000-0001-6200-1621; Farrell, Greg/0000-0001-7678-5519",,,,,64,3,3,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

However, little is known about how taxes affect the labor supply decisions of this population. This paper provides an initial investigation, studying the impact of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) expansions of the early 1990s on the labor supply of adult dependents living with their relatives. I find that dependent individuals who were not a part of the nuclear family responded to the EITC expansions, increasing labor force participation by about 5 percentage points. For adult children, I show that the absence of a net response is likely due to an unexpected consequence of the EITC: expanded family credits led to a decrease in their labor force participation.","[McKeehan, Margaret Katherine] Rice Univ, Dept Econ, MS-22, Houston, TX 77005 USA",Rice University,"McKeehan, MK (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, Dept Econ, MS-22, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",mkm1@rice.edu,,,,,,,28,5,5,2,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Private hospitals treat patients with fewer comorbidities and past hospitalisations. Controlling for observed patient characteristics and treatment type, private hospitals have fewer emergency readmissions. But patients' choice of hospital may influenced by their unobserved morbidity. After instrumenting the choice of hospital type by the difference in distances from the patient to the nearest public and the nearest private hospital, the effect of private ownership changes sign and is statistically insignificant. Similar results are obtained with coarsened exact matching. We also find no quality differences between hospitals specialising in planned treatments and other hospitals, nor between for-profit and not-for-profit private hospitals.

We first find that a reform that forced newspaper exits (reduced competition) affected media bias by increasing product specialization, with some papers focusing on propaganda and others on commercial content. Second, lower-level governments produce less-biased content and launch commercial newspapers earlier, eroding higher-level governments' political goals.

MWS data cover large unionized firms in Canada, while SLID is a rich rotating panel representative of the employed population in Canada. Combining both sources of information allows for an extensive analysis of DNWR in the Canadian labour market. We find large shares of wage freezes and smaller shares of wage cuts in both MWS and SLID. Shares of freezes are higher at lower CPI inflation rates, based on provincial data. These observations are consistent with the presence of DNWR. DNWR in Canada appears to be larger than in other countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom and European countries. The incidence of DNWR is heterogeneous across firms' and workers' characteristics. Wages report less DNWR over longer horizons.

Les donnees de PRS couvrent les grandes firmes syndiquees du Canada alors que les donnees de EDTR representent un riche panel rotatif de la population au travail au Canada. En combinant ces deux sources de donnees, on peut faire une analyse extensive de la RBSN dans le marche du travail canadien. On decouvre de grandes fractions de gels de salaires et de petites fractions de coupures de salaires dans a la fois PRS et EDTR. On repere que les fractions de gels de salaires sont plus grandes a des taux d'inflation (CPI) plus bas, sur la base de donnees provinciales. Ces observations sont consistantes avec la presence de RBSN. La RBSN au Canada semble plus grande que dans d'autres pays comme les Etats-Unis, le Royaume-Uni et les pays europeens.

Existing country studies suggest that female entrepreneurship can have favorable development outcomes through the channels of employment, innovation and welfare, but this paper undertakes a holistic cross-country analysis on the determinants of female entrepreneurship, exploring the role of fertility rates in affecting female entrepreneurial outcomes. We find that the impact of fertility rate is negative and significant in influencing entrepreneurship. But factors like greater tertiary enrollment of females and higher ratios of female to male labor force participation rates can offset the negative impact of fertility rate and in fact can make the impact positive. Additionally, greater access to informal finance makes female enrollment more effective in mitigating the negative impact of fertility rate.","[Dutta, Nabamita] Univ Wisconsin La Crosse, Coll Business Adm, Dept Econ, La Crosse, WI 54601 USA; [Mallick, Sushanta] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin La Crosse; University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Dutta, N (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin La Crosse, Coll Business Adm, Dept Econ, La Crosse, WI 54601 USA.",ndutta@uwlax.edu; s.k.mallick@qmul.ac.uk,"Dutta, Nabamita/K-3728-2019","Dutta, Nabamita/0000-0002-0943-5217",,,,,57,23,24,0,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,AUG,2018,71.0,3,,,,,402,432,,10.1111/kykl.12175,0.0,,,31,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GO4RL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440000700003,0

One common approach is to emphasize a credible research design; we review results from two randomized experiments, as well as some quasi-experimental studies. This work has produced compelling evidence that moral hazard in health insurance exists-that is, individuals, on average, consume less healthcare when they are required to pay more for it out of pocket-as well as qualitative evidence about its nature. These studies alone, however, provide little guidance for forecasting healthcare spending under contracts not directly observed in the data. Therefore, a second and complementary approach is to develop an economic model that can be used out of sample. We note that modeling choices can be consequential: different economic models may fit the reduced form but deliver different counterfactual predictions. An additional role of the more descriptive analyses is therefore to provide guidance regarding model choice.

The growth process is endogenized by allowing productive government expenditure on infrastructure, complementing the lagged private capital input. In the presence of these monetary policies, we show that multiple equilibria emerge along different growth paths, with the low-growth (high-growth) equilibrium being unstable (stable) and locally determinate (locally indeterminate). In addition, we highlight the possibility of convergent or divergent endogenous fluctuations and even topological chaos around the high-growth equilibrium in the growth path where the monetary authority follows a high inflation targeting regime. Conversely, when the monetary authority follows a low inflation targeting regime, oscillations do not occur around either the low-growth or high-growth equilibrium. Moreover, a strictly non-negative cash reserve requirement is a necessary and sufficient condition to initiate the growth process. (C) 2018 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.

Individual time discounting is associated with a number of lifetime outcomes and behavior patterns such as educational attainment, personal income, savings, smoking, alcohol consumption, and obesity. Regarding the intergenerational transmission of economic preferences, previous findings suggest a positive correlation between parental and offspring time preference. However, there is still limited empirical evidence about the role of genetics in the process of preference formation. The classical twin methodology is applied to estimate the genetic variation in individual time preference. Information on monozygotic and dizygotic twins allows us to disentangle the influences of genetic and environmental factors on time preference. Novel data on roughly 3,000 twins from the German TwinLife project are used. We rely on an experimentally validated survey measure of time discounting, namely, self-assessed patience. According to our best-fitting polygenic model, we find that differences in genetics explain about 23 percent of the total variation in patience across individuals. The results suggest that genes are a considerable source of individual variation in time preference.","[Huebler, Philipp M.

Two alternative models are estimated, one using an alternative Skew Student's t-distribution and the other using a symmetric Student's t-distribution. The results suggest the presence of leverage effects in all markets except for Peru where the evidence is unclear. In addition, there is evidence of asymmetries and heavy tails in the Argentina and S&P500 markets while in the other countries there is no robust evidence of such characteristics. Using the Bayes factor, the results indicate that the SVGHSkewt model dominates the other two models for the cases of Peru, Argentina, Brazil and S&P500 whereas the simple SVt model is preferred for the markets of Mexico and Chile. Similar findings are obtained after performing a robustness analysis regarding the priors of the parameters associated with the skewness and the tails of the distribution.

Many scholars have conducted in-depth investigation into the main driving forces of the new energy industry. However, they often adhere to an assumption that the effect of the driving forces on new energy industry is constant across areas, ignoring the spatial heterogeneity in economic phenomena. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) model and the use of local sample data to implement parameter estimation can make up for the inadequacies of existing research. Therefore, this paper uses the GWR model to carefully investigate the new energy industry. The results show that the impact of economic growth on the new energy industry in the eastern region is higher than in the central and western regions owing to the differences in economic structure and fixed asset investment. The impact of foreign energy dependence continuously declines from the eastern region to the central and western regions. This is attributable to the differences in natural gas and oil imports. Technological progress has a similar effect on account of the differences in R&D funding and R&D personnel investments. However, the impact of the agriculture industry in the central region is higher than in the eastern and western regions due to the differences in crop acreage and agricultural output.

The results show clear evidence that attachment orientations not only predict an adult's tendency to become an entrepreneur but also the type of entrepreneur he will become. Specifically, the results show that attachment anxiety is the dimension that is the most responsible for the variability of becoming an entrepreneur, while anxiety and avoidant dimensions predict his characteristics and attitudes as an entrepreneur. This paper makes five important contributions to the research of both attachment theory and entrepreneurship. First, it adds to the theoretical understanding of the psychology of entrepreneurs. Second, the attachment theory enables us to extend our understanding beyond the predictions of personality traits regarding entrepreneurial intentions in order to further predict the type of entrepreneur he will turn out to be. Third, it stresses the role of early childhood events regarding the prediction of future entrepreneurial orientation. Fourth, it uses a unique data set of real young entrepreneurs in a single industry homogenous design in Israel, which is known worldwide as a startup nation. Fifth, it focuses on the opportunity validation stage (rather than the opportunity identification of the resource allocation stages), which is often neglected in entrepreneur personality research.","[Zelekha, Yaron; Yaakobi, Erez; Avnimelech, Gil] Ono Acad Coll, 104 Zahal St, Kiryat Ono, Israel",,"Zelekha, Y (通讯作者)，Ono Acad Coll, 104 Zahal St, Kiryat Ono, Israel.",yaronzl@013.net.il,"Avnimelech, Gil/J-7063-2016","Avnimelech, Gil/0000-0002-7102-809X",,,,,133,5,6,3,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

We use quarterly data which covers 1998:1 and 2015:1. Our analysis is based on 15 art price indices: Contemporary, Drawings, France, Global index (Euro), Global index (USD), Modern art, Nineteenth century, Old Masters, Paintings, Photographies, Postwar, Prints, Sculptures, UK and US. We find evidence of structural shifts and nonlinearity in the art indices. We cannot reject the null of unit root and/or stationarity in the art series based on the conventional linear unit root tests and quantile-based test that did not account for structural breaks. However, when we use the same methods but accounting for sharp shifts and smooth breaks, we are able to reject the unit root null for each of the art indices. Further we find evidence of asymmetric behaviour in some of the indices: two global indices, Paintings, Prints, Sculptures, Modern art and Postwar, where unit root exist at some quantiles but not at others. Overall, our result suggest that the art market is inefficient. We provide some practical and policy implications of our findings.","[Aye, Goodness C.; Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa; [Chang, Tsang Yao] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung, Taiwan; [Chen, Wen-Yi] Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Senior Citizen Serv Management, Taichung, Taiwan; [Wohar, Mark] Univ Nebraska Omaha, Dept Econ, Omaha, NE USA; [Wohar, Mark] Loughborough Univ Technol, Loughborough, Leics, England",University of Pretoria; Feng Chia University; National Taichung University of Science & Technology; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Omaha; Loughborough University,"Aye, GC (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa.",,,"Wohar, Mark/0000-0002-4967-0609",,,,,45,5,5,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

One is the individually-rationalcore (IR-core) whereby blocking is only allowed via allocations where the non-blocking agents receive their endowments. We show that if there exists an allocation rule satisfying individual rationality, efficiency, and strategy-proofness, then for any problem for which the IR-core is non-empty, the allocation rule must choose an IR-core allocation and all agents are indifferent between all allocations in the IR-core. We further show that the result cannot be generalized to supersets of the IR-core. We apply our result to housing markets, coalition formation and networks. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

It abstains, however, from the simple and immediately stabilizing interest rate inverse IS curve. Instead, more indirect effects are examined, which realistically will take time to work out. In particular, (a) the trend rate of growth governing the investment decisions additionally responds to the difference between the profit rate and the real rate of interest; and (b) the real interest rate may enter dynamic adjustments of the price markup. The main finding is that the Harrodian forces could still be overcome and stability of the steady state position is re-established provided that the profitability motive in (a) and the responsiveness in the Taylor policy rule are both sufficiently strong. By contrast, the indirect feedback effects produced by (b) broaden the scope for instability.

We explore whether the divorce convergence is due to the liberalization of the divorce laws.

In the setting of home deliveries, midwives strictly followed hygiene instructions and monitored the health of the mothers and newborns for 3 weeks after birth, and the study observes these individual-level treatments. The results from empirical strategies controlling for observables, using instrumental variables and mother fixed effects are consistent. This paper first finds that treatment by qualified midwives at birth reduced neonatal mortality. It further concludes that individuals treated by qualified midwives at birth had substantially lower mortality from cardiovascular diseases and diabetes at ages 40-80 and that males had lower morbidity and better skills at ages 19-21 than those treated by traditional birth attendants.","[Lazuka, Volha] Lund Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Econ Hist, Box 7080, S-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Lazuka, Volha] Lund Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Ctr Econ Demog, Box 7080, S-22007 Lund, Sweden",Lund University; Lund University,"Lazuka, V (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Econ Hist, Box 7080, S-22007 Lund, Sweden.;Lazuka, V (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Ctr Econ Demog, Box 7080, S-22007 Lund, Sweden.",volha.lazuka@ekh.lu.se,"Lazuka, Volha/JNK-1271-2023","Lazuka, Volha/0000-0003-4506-3964","Crafoord Foundation (Sweden) [20150669]; Ebbe Kock Foundation (Lund University, Sweden) [EK2015-0037]","Crafoord Foundation (Sweden); Ebbe Kock Foundation (Lund University, Sweden)","The author is grateful to the Editor and two anonymous referees for valuable comments.

We find that the difference between the two banking types was initially not significant during the GFC. However, when the financial shock spread to the real economy during the later phases of the crisis, Islamic banks suffered a significantly higher level of financial instability than conventional banks. This result holds true for large banks but not for small Islamic banks. Small Islamic banks demonstrated a relatively better handling of the economic downturn than large Islamic banks, supporting the argument that Islamic banks are more stable when they operate at a small scale but lose this stability when they increase their scale of operations. Hence, while Islamic banks may have escaped the consequences of highly volatile financial instruments, they were not spared from a major shock in the real economic sectors.","[Alqahtani, Faisal] Taibah Univ, Al Madinah, Saudi Arabia; [Mayes, David G.] Univ Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand",Taibah University; University of Auckland,"Alqahtani, F (通讯作者)，Taibah Univ, Al Madinah, Saudi Arabia.",fqahtani@Taibahu.edu.sa; d.mayes@auckland.ac.nz,,"alqahtani, faisal/0000-0003-2034-8015",,,,,66,60,63,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0939-3625,1878-5433,,ECON SYST,Econ.

Contrary to strategies and actions, narratives cannot be swiftly changed to better fit different situations and to achieve higher payoffs.

Has this rise in the wealth-income ratio led to a corresponding increase in the wealth being passed on from one generation to the next? Are we returning to the levels of inheritance found in the 19th century? The aim of this paper is to construct UK evidence on the extent of the transmission of wealth in the form of estates and gifts inter vivos. It takes a long-run view of inheritance, starting from 1896, when the modern Estate Duty was introduced, and exploits the extensive estate data published over the years. Construction of a long-run time series for more than a century is challenging, and there are important limitations. The resulting time-series demonstrates the major importance of inheritance in the UK before the First World War, when the total transmitted wealth represented some 20 per cent of net national income. In the inter-war period, the total was around 15 per cent, falling to some 10 per cent after the Second World War, and then falling further to below 5 per cent in the late 1970s. Since then, there has indeed been an upturn: a rise from 4.8 per cent in 1977 to 8.2 per cent in 2006. This increase was more or less in line with the increase in personal wealth, and has to be interpreted in the light of the changing net worth of the corporate and public sectors of the economy.","[Atkinson, Anthony B.] Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford, England; [Atkinson, Anthony B.] Oxford Martin Sch, Inst New Econ Thinking, Oxford, England; [Atkinson, Anthony B.] London Sch Econ, London, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Atkinson, AB (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford, England.;Atkinson, AB (通讯作者)，Oxford Martin Sch, Inst New Econ Thinking, Oxford, England.;Atkinson, AB (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",richard.t.atkinson@icloud.com,,,ESRC/DFID [ES/I033114/1]; Institute for New Economic Thinking [INO14-00023],ESRC/DFID; Institute for New Economic Thinking,This research was stimulated by the work of Thomas Piketty on France (2011).

Recent research indicates that a high geographic proximity to a regulatory supervisor might increase the monitoring intensity and therefore harm the shareholder wealth of monitored institutions. The announced relocation of the European Banking Authority (EBA) from London to Paris offers a natural experiment to test the effect of geographically close regulation on the market value of financial institutions. Our results show that the EBA relocation indeed induced negative abnormal stock returns for French banks. Additionally, we document that this is a bank specific effect. The parallel relocation decision of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to Amsterdam does not result in abnormal returns of Dutch pharmaceutical corporations.

This paper addresses this issue by examining how additional resources allocated to active labour-market policies relate to output-growth rates. It also examines the sensitivity of the growth-ALMP relationship to the business cycle. Based on a structural model, we find that whether or not additional resources allocated to ALMPs contribute to raising output growth is a priori unclear. However, using data from OECD countries during 1991-2011 and GMM estimation to account for potential endogeneities, we find evidence suggesting a net positive output-growth differential due to implementing active labour-market policies in normal times of between 0.004 and 0.006 percentage point.

Because of confounding factors, it is difficult to research leading by example using field data. Here, we investigate the effects of leading by example and the effect of rewards or punishments on contributions in controlled lab experiments. We find that both rewards and punishments are more effective in fostering contributions than leading by example as such.

Second, the model allows for endogenous regime switching to describe the short-run relationship. The empirical application on the S&P 500 Index and dividend shows that our model fits the data significantly better than existing models and provides estimates with meaningful interpretations. In addition, the linear cointegration is unsuitable to describe the long-run relationship, and the ECM with endogenous regime switching better explains the data than that with conventional Markov switching.

Polish case study,OECONOMIA COPERNICANA,,,English,Article,,,,,,innovation; innovation strategies; SMEs; institutional support system,REGIONS,"Research background: Many contemporary empirical studies and most economic growth theories recognize the importance of innovation as one of the most progressive determinants of socio-economic growth, both in the regional and local perspective. However, much of the empirical literature has discussed the issue of innovativeness and institutional environment without the significant results for small enterprises, especially in peripheral regions. Purpose of the article: The aim of this paper is to evaluate the institutional support system and its impact on SME innovativeness in Podkarpackie region. In analyzing this case, we raise the following two questions: (1) what are the types of innovation strategies of SMEs in Podkarpackie? (2) what are the factors affecting innovation and potential barriers to further use of institutional support systems aimed at the implementation of innovation in enterprises? Methods: Based on the empirical research, we have analyzed the data (individual in-depth interviews) and found out how the entrepreneurs, R&D, business environment institutions, regional and local authorities assess the use of programs and projects dedicated to innovation in the scope of the institutional support system and what are the barriers encountered by entrepreneurs that limit the implementation of innovation. Findings & Value added: The results of our research show that institutional support systems mitigate negative consequences of peripheral localization of the enterprises, where specific innovation strategy has no influence on SME assessment of innovation effectiveness. Innovation is too costly, and SMEs are too weak in peripheral regions, therefore there is great need for reasonable and flexible institutional support systems. However, the peripheral situation influences this institutional system itself, strengthening the mechanisms of self-censorship.","[Lewandowska, Anna] Univ Informat Technol & Management, Ul Sucharskiego 2, PL-35225 Rzeszow, Poland",University of Information Technology & Management Rzeszow,"Lewandowska, A (通讯作者)，Univ Informat Technol & Management, Ul Sucharskiego 2, PL-35225 Rzeszow, Poland.",alewandowska@wsiz.rzeszow.pl,"Lewandowska, Anna/T-9678-2019","Lewandowska, Anna/0000-0002-5351-8490; Stopa, Mateusz/0000-0002-9286-5073",,,,,30,23,23,0,21,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

We find that education was a major contributor to increased wage inequality between 1995 and 2013. The returns to education remained high after 2007 despite a large inflow of college-educated workers. Although regional wage inequality declined from 2007-13, regional wage inequality among educated workers did not. Residual wage inequality increased, and the within inequality of educated workers increased faster than that of the less educated. We argue that China's education expansion seems insufficient to narrow the educational wage gap, and a lack of labor mobility for educated workers prevents the decline in returns to education in specific regions.","[Li, Shi; Wu, Shanshan; Xing, Chunbing] Beijing Normal Univ, China Inst Income Distribut, 19 Xinjiekouwai Dajie, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University,"Li, S (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, China Inst Income Distribut, 19 Xinjiekouwai Dajie, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",lishi@bnu.edu.cn; wushanshan_bnu@163.com; xingchb@bnu.edu.cn,,,Interdisciplinary Project of Beijing Normal University Income Distribution and Labor Market,Interdisciplinary Project of Beijing Normal University Income Distribution and Labor Market,The authors thank the editor Wing Thye Woo and discussants Kozo Kiyota and Sunghyun Henry Kim at the Asian Economic Panel Meeting in Tokyo 2017 for helpful comments.

An introduction of RST accompanied by a decrease in VAT increases capital accumulation and welfare in the steady state.

Recent contributions have to a large extent resorted to simulation-based methods mostly using some form of simulated method of moments estimation (SMM). There is, however, an entire branch of statistical methods that should appear promising, but has to our knowledge never been applied so far to estimate agent-based models in economics and finance: Markov chain Monte Carlo methods designed for state space models or models with latent variables. This latter class of models seems particularly relevant as agent-based models typically consist of some latent and some observable variables since not all the characteristics of agents would mostly be observable. Indeed, one might often not only be interested in estimating the parameters of a model, but also to infer the time development of some latent variable. However, agent-based models when interpreted as latent variable models would be typically characterized by non-linear dynamics and non-Gaussian fluctuations and, thus, would require a computational approach to statistical inference. Here we resort to Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) estimation based on a particle filter. This approach is used here to numerically approximate the conditional densities that enter into the likelihood function of the problem. With this approximation we simultaneously obtain parameter estimates and filtered state probabilities for the unobservable variable(s) that drive(s) the dynamics of the observable time series. In our examples, the observable series will be asset returns (or prices) while the unobservable variables will be some measure of agents' aggregate sentiment. We apply SMC to two selected agent-based models of speculative dynamics with somewhat different flavor. The empirical application to a selection of financial data includes an explicit comparison of the goodness-of-fit of both models. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Each trader's intermediation power reflects the competition among intermediation chains as measured by the number of layers separating the trader from buyers. Trade does not maximize welfare or minimize intermediation. The interplay between competition and hold-ups determines the level of inefficiency.

In this paper, we study the effect of risk shocks in a small open economy with tradable and non-tradable sectors of production. In each sector, firms are subject to uncertainty when converting raw capital into effective capital. Due to financial frictions, when risk is high firms pay higher borrowing costs. This leads to a decline in investment and output. We conduct Bayesian estimation and draw implications on the sources of the Canadian business cycle. Our findings suggest that a significant fraction of the fluctuations in output, investment, risk premium and firms' net worth in the Canadian economy can be accounted for by sectorial level risk shocks. We further construct volatility measures based on firm-level stock returns in Canada and find that our model's out-of-sample performance is reasonably well.","[Mendicino, Caterina] European Cent Bank, Monetary Policy Res, Directorate Gen Res, Frankfurt, Germany; [Zhang, Yahong] Univ Windsor, Dept Econ, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada",European Central Bank; University of Windsor,"Zhang, YH (通讯作者)，Univ Windsor, Dept Econ, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada.",caterina.mendicino1@ecb.int; yzhang@uwindsor.ca,"Zhang, Yahong/B-9922-2014",,,,,,31,3,3,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Hodges. We exploit panel variation across states prior to the Supreme Court decision to investigate the effect of marriage laws on demand for mortgage credit. Identification relies on the fact that states permitted same-sex marriage at different points in time, often through court order whereby the outcome and timing of ruling was unknown. We estimate that states permitting same-sex marriage experienced a 6-16% increase in same-sex mortgage applications after the policy was implemented. Federal recognition of marriage is associated with a stronger effect than state same-sex marriage prior to the repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act, but the effect of state-recognized marriage is also stronger than anti-discrimination policies in housing. Our findings provide important insight not only to the housing choices of same-sex households but the impact of marriage on all households.","[Miller, Joshua J.; Park, Kevin A.] US Dept Housing & Urban Dev, 451 Seventh St SW, Washington, DC 20410 USA",,"Miller, JJ (通讯作者)，US Dept Housing & Urban Dev, 451 Seventh St SW, Washington, DC 20410 USA.",Joshua.j.miller@hud.gov,,,,,,,34,12,14,2,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

We apply the generalized sup Augmented Dickey-Fuller test method proposed by Phillips et al. (2013). The results show that there have been four explosive bubbles in China and the U.S. market, primarily occurring during the periods of huge surges in Bitcoin prices. This is consistent with the bubble model improved by Gurkaynak (2008), in which asset price is decomposed into fundamental and bubble components. In particular, exogenous shocks, including foreign or domestic economic events, lead to the origination of bubbles. A serious financial crisis may trigger long-term and large-scale bubbles, whereas relatively short-term bubbles are caused by domestic components. It can be inferred that Bitcoin can be used as a hedge against market-specific risk. Finally, Bitcoin bubbles collapse due to administrative intervention by economic authorities. Therefore, the government should manage public expectations to maintain confidence in authority and reduce speculation behavior to stabilize the asset price and financial market.

This paper asks whether oil price volatility can be used as a predictor of stock return volatility. In contrast with previous research, we focus on the out-of-sample predictive power of oil price volatility rather than on in-sample inference. Formal tests of out-of-sample predictive ability find no evidence supporting the use of oil price volatility as a predictor of future stock return volatility. Further analysis using rolling window estimation and structural break tests shows that the coefficients of this relationship are very unstable. The coefficients can be positive, negative, or close to zero depending on the sample that is chosen. We discuss the implications of this finding for monetary policy.

Low mobility implies that human capital, skills and talent can be misallocated. As a consequence, the workers' efforts, their motivation and productivity could be negatively affected, causing adverse effects on economy growth and competitiveness. This paper attempts to study the evolution of intergenerational social mobility before and during the recent economic crisis in Spain. The methodology applied consists in analysing the movements along the occupational scale of children with respect to their parents. This involves associating the National Classification of Occupations with the New International Socio-economic Index of Occupational Status. Statistic and econometric methods are used to assess these occupational transitions and to analyse the covariates' effects on them.

The magnitudes of the own-sector and cross-sector hours elasticities fall in the range of 0.16-0.51. The labour supply response varies by gender, doctor's age and medical specialty.

A worker's skills follow a Gaussian process with an endogenous component reflecting human-capital accumulation. Effort and skills are substitutes both in the output process (as in Holmstrom 1999) and in the skills technology. The focus is on deterministic equilibria by virtue of Gaussian learning. When effort and skills are direct inputs to production and skills are exogenous, effort can be inefficiently high in the beginning of a career. In contrast, when skills are the only input to production but accumulate through past effort choices, the worker always underinvests in skill acquisition. At the center of the discrepancy are two types of ex post errors that arise at interpreting output due to an identification problem faced by the market. Finally, the robustness of the underinvestment result is explored via variations in the skill-accumulation technology and in the information structure, and policy implications are discussed.","[Cisternas, Ionlalo] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, 100 Main St, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Cisternas, I (通讯作者)，MIT, Sloan Sch Management, 100 Main St, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",gcistern@mit.edu,,,,,,,39,14,15,1,8,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7669,1945-7685,,AM ECON J-MICROECON,Am.

Car prices in Europe converged until the year 2003, but not thereafter. Even then the price range of the median model across EU15 countries was close to 20%. This cross-country price differentiation is systematically linked to common product features, varies significantly across models and increases systematically with the market segment. Identical cars are positioned individually by country, for example via tailored feature bundles. Both the convergence of prices in anticipation of a future reduction of barriers to arbitrage and the systematic price differentials point to active pricing-to-market strategies that treat countries as marketing regions.

The present study examines the determinants of trust in banks in China. Using the most recent wave of the World Values Survey, which included information on trust in banks from the survey in China in 2012, we perform ordered logit estimations to investigate the potential influence of a large set of individual and provincial indicators on trust in banks. We observe the influence of certain sociodemographic indicators. Membership in the Communist Party and living in a rural area are negatively associated with trust in banks. Age and satisfaction with financial situation contribute to higher trust in banks, while being married and having a higher level of education tend to lower trust in banks. Access to information regardless of the type of media disseminating the information (newspapers, television or Internet) seem to have no impact on trust in banks. Economic values influence trust in banks. In particular, individuals who favour inequality as an incentive for individual effort or support an expanded government ownership role in the economy tend to trust banks more.","[Fungacova, Zuzana] Bank Finland, Helsinki, Finland; [Weill, Laurent] Univ Strasbourg, EM Strasbourg Business Sch, Strasbourg, France",Bank of Finland; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg,"Weill, L (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, Inst Etud Polit, 47 Ave Foret Noire, F-67082 Strasbourg, France.",laurent.weill@unistra.fr,,,,,,,18,7,7,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

But rational partisan theory argues that, because actors in the economy anticipate ruling party behavior, partisan differences only matter when election outcomes are uncertain. We argue that policy risk from ruling parties extends beyond elections, leading to important variation in growth volatility that occurs during a ruling party's tenure. Building on theories of policy risk and learning, we argue that after elections, economic actors still face uncertainty about the policies of new ruling parties. With time in power, new ruling parties build policy track records, reducing policy risk and, thus, volatility. We estimate a learning curve model of ruling party duration's effect on the variation in quarterly GDP growth rates. Using data from 44 democracies between 1981 and 2009, we find that learning processes extend beyond the conclusion of uncertain elections.","[Hall, Steven; Nishikawa, Misa] Ball State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Muncie, IN 47306 USA",Ball State University,"Hall, S (通讯作者)，Ball State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Muncie, IN 47306 USA.",srhall@bsu.edu,,"Hall, Steven/0000-0003-2071-7415",,,,,73,1,1,0,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,1435-8131,,ECON GOV,Econ.

We find that sukuk and conventional investment-grade bonds have a lower reaction of conditional volatility to market shocks and higher persistence; we also find that sukuk returns are much less volatile than U.S. and EU investment-grade bonds. Further, we find a time-varying, positive, conditional correlation between sukuk returns and leading bond markets, which is driven by changing macroeconomic and market conditions. We observe that during recessions, the dynamic correlation between sukuk and bond markets tends to increase. Moreover, we unveil structural breakpoints in paths of dynamic correlations corresponding to external shocks, such as the sovereign debt crisis and the Federal Reserve's tapering announcements. Finally, we examine how market-wide factors affect correlations. We find significant behavioral shifts in the sukuk-bonds relationship, which are explained by market liquidity, crude oil prices, U.S. credit information, and stock market uncertainty. Our results have useful implications for sukuk issuers, portfolio managers, and risk managers in both emerging and developed markets. (C) 2017 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.

This paper incorporates the transport sector into a standard model of international trade and studies the effects of trade and industrial policies. Transport firms need to commit to a shipping capacity sufficient for a round trip, with a possible imbalance of shipping volumes in two directions. This imbalance is known as the backhaul problem. As transport firms attempt to avoid this problem, a tariff in one sector may affect other independent import and/or export sectors. In particular, domestic tariffs may backfire: domestic exports may also decrease, harming domestic export sectors and the domestic economy. This finding contributes to the literature on how import liberalization may generate a positive effect on the liberalizing country's exports by identifying a new channel through endogenous changes in transport costs given the backhaul problem.

Analyzing the introduction of universal highly-subsidized child care in Quebec, we first demonstrate that there are no statistically significant gender differences in the average effect of access to universal child care on child outcomes. However, we find substantial heterogeneity in policy impacts on the variance of developmental and behavioural scores across genders. Additionally, our analysis reveals significant evidence of differential parenting practices by gender in response to the introduction of the policy. The analysis is suggestive that the availability of subsidized child care changed home environments disproportionately and may be responsible for the growing gender gaps in behavioural outcomes observed after child care is subsidized.","[Kottelenberg, Michael J.] Huron Univ Coll, London, ON, Canada; [Lehrer, Steven F.] Queens Univ, Kingston, ON, Canada; [Lehrer, Steven F.] NYU Shanghai, NBER, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Queens University - Canada; NYU Shanghai,"Lehrer, SF (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Kingston, ON, Canada.;Lehrer, SF (通讯作者)，NYU Shanghai, NBER, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",lehrers@queensu.ca,,,SSHRC,SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"We would like to thank two anonymous reviewers, one of the co-editors (Baker), Habiba Djebbai, Jessica Pan, Aloysius Siow, Eugenia Toma and seminar participants at the University of Toronto, Chinese University of Hong Kong, 2011 CLSRN-SOLE meeting, 2010 CEA annual meeting, John Deutsch Institute's Conference on Economic Relations Between Children and Parents, 2012 RES annual meetings, 2011 IEB Workshop on Economics of Education and the CEPS/INSTEAD's Conference on the Theory and Practice of Program Evaluation for helpful comments and suggestions.

Featuring non-homothetic preferences and income disparities in an otherwise standard quality-ladder model, it shows that the resulting differences in the willingness to pay for quality among consumers generate both positive investments in R&D by industry leaders and positive market shares for more than one quality, hence allowing for the emergence of multi-product firms within a vertical innovation framework. This positive investment in R&D by incumbents is obtained with complete equal treatment in the R&D field between the incumbent patent holder and the challengers: in this framework, the incentive for a leader to invest in R&D stems from a surplus appropriation effect specific to vertically-differentiated markets, i.e. the perspective of more efficient price discrimination when expanding the product portfolio. Such a framework makes it possible to analyse the impact of income distribution, as well as that of several possible R&D policies, both on long-term growth and on the allocation of R&D activities between challengers and incumbents.

The demand for compensation in a platform market,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Smart energy services; Preference heterogeneity; Platform markets; Consumer choice; Posterior analysis; Willingness-to-pay,CHOICE; COMPETITION; UTILITY,"This paper analyses the heterogeneity of household consumer preferences for electricity service contracts in a smart grid context. Platform pricing strategies that could incentivise consumers to participate in a two-sided electricity platform market are discussed. The research is based on original data from a discrete choice experiment on electricity service contracts that was conducted with 1,892 electricity consumers in Great Britain in 2015. We estimate a flexible mixed logit model in willingness to pay space and exploit the results in posterior analysis. The findings suggest that while consumers are willing to pay for technical support services, they are likely to demand significant compensation to share their usage and personally identifying data and to participate in automated demand response programs involving remote monitoring and control of electricity usage. Cross-subsidisation of consumers combining appropriate participation payments with sharing of bill savings could incentivise participation of the number of consumers required to provide the optimal level of demand response. We also examine the preference heterogeneity to suggest how, by targeting customers with specific characteristics, smart electricity service providers could significantly reduce their customer acquisition costs.

The second part reconstructs Polanyi's endeavors to show how the visual presentation of social matters could foster these engagement practices and the construction of economic knowledge. The third part points out that top-down and bottom-up approaches were both present in Polanyi's economic thought and explains why the latter is evolutionary in a sense that it is based on changing knowledge in cognitive, behavioral, social and technical domains. The fourth part discusses how public understanding of economic ideas connected interactional expertise and boundary work in Polanyi's account, and how he was engaged in developing both as part of his social agenda.

What has been missing is the distinction between tariff and non-tariff changes under PTAs. Tariff reduction is a quintessential feature of PTAs. But member countries of a PTA often pursue deeper integration through agreements on non-tariff matters as well. Some member countries, however, may want to use non-tariff barriers to compensate for tariff cuts. The current study isolates the effects of tariff and non-tariff changes under PTAs. It involves the construction of a new dataset of bilateral tariff rates for 90 importing and 149 exporting countries over 1996-2010, covering the Harmonized System 2-digit level of product varieties. Given the complexity of non-tariff arrangements, we allow for heterogeneity across three different types of PTAs, namely custom unions (CUs), free trade agreements (FTAs), and partial scope agreements (PSAs). We further consider heterogeneity within each of these three PTAs regarding responding time, partner type, and product type. The key findings are: (i) non-tariff changes under PTAs on average increase both the intensive and extensive margins of trade; (ii) PSAs do not have discernible trade impacts unlike FTAs and CUs; (iii) CUs have a stronger trade impact than FTAs; (iv) the impact of CUs comes mostly from non-tariff changes, while that of FTAs comes from both tariff and non-tariff changes; (v) non-tariff changes associated with CUs have a stronger trade effect than those associated with FTAs, which in turn are stronger than those associated with PSAs; (vi) non-tariff changes take a longer time than tariff changes to impact on the intensive margin; (vii) non-tariff changes under FTAs and CUs between industrial and developing countries increase the exports from the former to the latter more than the other way around; and (viii) there is substantial heterogeneity across sectors in their response to trade liberalization.","[Cheong, Juyoung] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Kwak, Do Won] Korea Univ, Asiat Res Inst, Seoul, South Korea; [Tang, Kam Ki] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",Kyung Hee University; Korea University; University of Queensland,"Cheong, J (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",jcheong@khu.ac.kr; dwkwak@korea.ac.kr; kk.tang@uq.edu.au,"Cheong, Juyoung/AAJ-9607-2020","Kwak, Do Won/0000-0001-5443-1576; Tang, Kam/0000-0001-7282-8112",Kyung Hee University [KHU-20161391]; National Research Foundation of Korea Grant from the Korean Government [NRF-2008-362-A00001],Kyung Hee University; National Research Foundation of Korea Grant from the Korean Government(National Research Foundation of Korea),This work was funded by a grant from Kyung Hee University in 2016 (KHU-20161391) and the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant from the Korean Government (NRF-2008-362-A00001).,,33,10,12,2,37,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

This paper contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence on the transitional dynamics of industrial output by employing a new framework of distribution dynamics analysis, namely, the mobility probability plot (MPP), and a county level database made up of counties and county-level cities. The new framework can address several inadequacies of the traditional display tools used in the distribution dynamics literature. Stochastic kernel analyses are performed for the nation, the economic zones, and the provinces individually so as to provide an in-depth understanding of the evolution and convergence of industrial output.

Over the last decade, residential prices increased every year on average by double digits in Beijing or Shanghai. However many observers and researchers argue that fundamentals of the housing sector, both sector-specific and macroeconomic, may have been the driving force behind housing price volatility. While existing empirical work exclusively relies on the government housing prices which may suffer from the well-documented downward bias, this paper uses original high frequency unit price as well as transaction series for the residential resale housing markets of Beijing and Shanghai between January 2005 and December 2010 to test alternative hypotheses about housing prices volatility. We propose a sequential strategy in five steps integrating several techniques previously developed in a piecemeal and scattered way. First, we construct daily hedonic prices. Second, in order to search for the possible presence of bubbles on such high-frequency data, we propose using recently developed tests of an explosive root as an alternative to the unit root hypothesis. The third step is generated by the necessity of handling microstructure noise present at a daily frequency, thus filtering the raw data to extract a random walk component. The fourth step extracts a slowly changing monthly volatility component from the filtered daily hedonic real estate data. Finally, in so far as the presence of bubbles does not seem to characterize the residential housing market in major Chinese cities, such as Beijing and Shanghai, in a fifth step we show that fundamentals are able to explain slowly changing volatility, as well as transaction volumes in these first-tier cities.

We develop an agency model in which employees have both a personal and a social ideal of effort. The firm does not observe the personal ideals, but can make its workforce more sensitive to the social ideal by fostering social interaction in the workplace. We show that there are two reasons why the firm invests in social bonding. First, it reinforces the effectiveness of monetary incentives and increases average effort. Second, strengthening the social ideal reduces the adverse selection problem and the need for distorted compensation schemes. We further show that the firm allocates more time to social interaction when personal ideals of effort are low or heterogeneous. How work norms make people more similar (and predictable) and how this affects optimal incentive schemes has not yet received much attention in the literature. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We argue that the demand for the currency component of the monetary base has been remarkably stable during this period. We use the model to make projections of the nominal quantity of cash in circulation under alternative future paths for the federal funds rate. Our calculations suggest that if the federal funds rate is lifted up as suggested by the survey of economic projections made by the members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the fall in total currency demanded in the next two years ranges between 50 and 200 billion. Our discussion suggests that specific measures by the Federal Reserve to absorb that cash could be worth considering to make the future path of the price level consistent with the price stability mandate.

The identification strategy is based on an external instrument built on the assumption that movements in the euro nominal effective exchange rate are largely exogenous for individual EA countries once we control for EA aggregates. We find that a real appreciation creates a trade-off between expenditure switching (contractionary) and terms of trade (expansionary) effects, with the latter prevailing in most countries.

We use a two-sector general equilibrium model of a small open economy that produces a normal and an innovation good. We show that in the presence of cross-border differences in IPRs and consequent mobility of skilled labour, the impact of IPRs on skilled-unskilled wage inequality can be broken down into a revenue effect and an output effect. We find that a stronger IPRs regime in the source country reduces its skilled-unskilled wage inequality. However, if the output effect is stronger than the revenue effect, an increase in the recipient country's IPRs protection can contribute to an increase in wage inequality in the source country. Our results confirm the importance of institutional factors, such as the IPRs protection, in addressing the skilled-unskilled wage inequality.","[Zhang, Jingjing] Nanjing Audit Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Leoncini, Riccardo] Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy; [Tsai, Yingyi] Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Appl Econ, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Leoncini, Riccardo] Univ Freiburg, Freitag Inst Adv Studies FRIAS, Freiburg, Germany; [Leoncini, Riccardo] IRCrES CNR, Milan, Italy",Nanjing Audit University; University of Bologna; National University Kaohsiung; University of Freiburg; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Ricerca sulla Crescita Economica Sostenibile (IRCRES-CNR),"Tsai, YY (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Appl Econ, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",njustzjj@gmail.com; riccardo.leoncini@unibo.it; yytsai@nuk.edu.tw,"Zhang, Jing/HII-4294-2022","Tsai, Yingyi/0000-0002-8011-9946; Leoncini, Riccardo/0000-0002-6409-6748","Government Audit Research Foundation of Nanjing Audit University, China; Agreement CNR/NSC, Two Year Programme; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 103-2923-H-390-001-MY2]","Government Audit Research Foundation of Nanjing Audit University, China; Agreement CNR/NSC, Two Year Programme; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","The authors thank Professor Sushanta Mallick for encouragement and three referees for comments and suggestions.

More specifically, this article will propose a return to old debates on colonisation, with a special focus on French 19th century political economy. Three main institutionalist lessons can be drawn from a careful analysis of French colonial economics of the 19th century. First, by institutions, the authors referred not only to the modes of colonisation - liberalism or collectivism? - but also to the actors: What should be the respective role of states and of private actors (entrepreneurs, banks, settlers) in the colonisation of Africa? Second, the colonial debates involved a discussion of property, whether in the sense of land ownership (individual vs. collective) or under the prism of property rights. Third, the analysis of the colonisation of Africa by French economists reveals an understanding of institutions as cultural values, norms or even racial attributes.","[Zouache, Abdallah] Sci Po Lille, 9 Rue Angelier, F-59000 Lille, France",,"Zouache, A (通讯作者)，Sci Po Lille, 9 Rue Angelier, F-59000 Lille, France.",abdallah.zouache@sciencespo-lille.eu,,,,,,,51,8,8,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

By categorizing depositors into groups based on the amount of their deposited funds, we estimate the responses of these groups to interest rate changes. We take the findings of conventional banks as a comparative baseline and investigate the extent to which the changes in different Islamic depositor groups differ from conventional depositor groups. The findings show that depositors in both Islamic and conventional banks respond to interest rate changes. The analysis indicates that Islamic bank depositors are more responsive when their deposit sizes are larger. When Islamic bank depositors' opportunity costs rise due to a rise in the interest rate, they do not hesitate to withdraw deposits. The relation between interest rate changes and deposits is more robust in Islamic banks than in conventional banks.

But methodological and data concerns have thus far raised doubts about whether EPU contains marginal and exogenous information about other economic phenomena. Our work analyzes the impact on EPU of several possibly endogenous variables, such as inflation and unemployment rates in western countries where EPU is measured. We also consider longer-term technological factors, such as media fragmentation, which, by undermining political consensus, may indirectly elevate EPU. We find that about 40 percent of EPU movements can be explained by long and short-run movements in these determinants, which is consistent with limited evidence that de-trended movements in EPU may contain marginal information about GDP growth and other macro variables.

Procyclical hours can always be explained in a market clearing model with a residual tax wedge, the labor wedge. Convincing progress has been made in reducing the cyclical volatility in the labor wedge and therefore explaining movements in hours worked by amplifying technology shocks with endogenously rigid wages [Hall, R. E., 2005. Employment Fluctuations with Equilibrium Wage Stickiness. American Economic Review 95 (1), 50-65.],[Shimer, R., 2010. labor Markets and Business Cycles. Number 9217 in Economics Books, Princeton University Press.], and rigid wages in general. This paper demonstrates that the cyclical component of labor hours for the self-employed, who are not vulnerable to such frictions, is of comparable cyclicality and volatility as the cyclical component of labor hours for wage and salary workers, even conditioning on wages, consumption, and occupation-industry composition. This finding suggests that explaining the labor hours of the self-employed presents a new test for amplification mechanisms.","[Gallen, Trevor S.] Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Business, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Gallen, TS (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Business, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA.",tgallen@purdue.edu,,,,,,,44,5,6,2,4,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0164-0704,1873-152X,,J MACROECON,J.

In a field experiment in rural Malawi, we hired casual day laborers at piece rates and collected detailed data on the quantity and quality of their output. Specifically, we use a simplified Becker-DeGroot-Marschak mechanism, which provides random variation in piece rates conditional on revealed reservation rates, to separately identify the effects of worker selection and incentives on output. We find a positive relationship between output quantity and the piece rate, and show that this is solely the result of the incentive effect, not selection. In addition, we randomized whether workers were subject to stringent quality monitoring. Monitoring led to higher quality output, at some cost to the quantity produced. However, workers do not demand higher compensation when monitored, and monitoring has no measurable effect on the quality of workers willing to work under a given piece rate. Together, the set of worker responses that we document lead the employer to prefer a contract that offers little surplus to the worker, consistent with an equilibrium in which workers have little bargaining power.","[Guiteras, Raymond P.] North Carolina State Univ, 4326 Nelson Hall,Campus Box 8109, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Jack, B.

We consider four treatments: one without forecast elicitation and three with forecast elicitation. In two of the treatments with forecast elicitation, subjects are paid based on their performance in both forecasting and trading, while in the other treatment with forecast elicitations, they are paid based on only one of those factors, which is chosen randomly at the end of the experiment. We found no significant effect of forecast elicitation on market outcomes in the latter case. Thus, to avoid influencing the behavior of subjects and market outcomes by eliciting price forecasts, paying subjects based on either forecasting or trading performance chosen randomly at the end of the experiment is better than paying them based on both. In addition, we consider forecast-only experiments: one in which subjects are rewarded based on the number of accurate forecasts and the other in which they are rewarded based on a quadratic scoring rule. We found no significant difference in terms of forecasting performance between the two. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We develop a model to show that under these circumstances countries implement too few or too many policy reforms. From a social perspective, too many reforms follow if the spillover effects of reforms become sufficiently uncertain. Since centralization of policies to correct inefficient policies is often not possible, we look for alternative instruments that can restore the efficient level of reforms. We compare subsidizing reform efforts with insuring against bad outcomes, and argue that subsidies are advantageous in terms of requiring less information for implementation.

I evaluate the economic impact of (i) a countercyclical non-risk-adjusted bank capital (BC) requirement ratio, (ii) a countercyclical loan-to-value ratio (LTV), and (iii) both rules during economic and financial downturns. The model simulations show two main results. First, the LTV-rule mitigates the volatility of credit more effectively than the BC regulation because the relaxed collateral limit on the LTV ratio stimulates credit demand. The inverse relation of leverage definitions accounts for the stronger de-amplification stemming from countercyclical leverage constraints of borrowers. Second, if the financial shock affects the macroeconomy exclusively over the private mortgage market, neither of both rules attenuates the negative output effect, since borrowers and savers consumption effects cancel out. These results reveal that countercyclical regulation of borrowers represents an important complement to BC-regulation for safeguarding financial stability.

Given its quantitative success in matching the U.S. home-ownership curve, my model represents a reasonable benchmark for assessing the efficiency of mortgage default prevention policies. I find that both income and geographical mobility are the main trigger factors for default decisions. In fact, households with a higher mobility (i.e. young households) rate are more likely to default. According to the welfare analysis, I suggest that policymakers include a minimum downpayment requirement of 9.5% in the new definition of the Qualified Residential Mortgage (QRM). This number should, however, be viewed with some caution, since I focus on a steady-state economy, in which house prices are constant. In fact, house prices represent an important factor influencing the default rate. Potentially, the optimal minimum downpayment requirement should be set at a higher value than 9.5%.","[Mnasri, Ayman] Qatar Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, Coll Business & Econ, Doha 2713, Qatar",Qatar University,"Mnasri, A (通讯作者)，Qatar Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, Coll Business & Econ, Doha 2713, Qatar.",amnasri@qu.edu.qa,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0164-0704,1873-152X,,J MACROECON,J.

Mainstream literature, however, falls short in depicting what the resource curse entails: the claim that institutions matter usually has a narrow meaning that largely overlooks the significance of place. A review of the paved road in research reveals a need to critically integrate approaches to studying the curse, as well as more insightful research on which institutions matter, how, and where. Expounding six governance challenges and thirteen development traps, I set out a simple yet crucial lesson: resource-based development presents both blessings and curses for any given resource-rich country in any given time period, and institutions are likely to be part of the explanation.

As shown in earlier work, this information-gathering process may be destabilising by creating multiple equilibria. This paper studies the role played by the microstructure of the asset market in the emergence of multiple equilibria driven by information aggregation. To do so, we study the outcome of a two-stage global game wherein an asset price determined at the trading stage of the game provides an endogenous public signal about the fundamental that affects traders' decision to attack in the coordination stage of the game. In the trading stage, placing a full demand schedule (i.e., a continuum of limit orders) is costly, but traders may use riskier (and cheaper) market orders, i.e., order to sell or buy a fixed quantity of assets unconditional on the execution price. Price execution risk reduces traders aggressiveness and hence slows down information aggregation, which ultimately makes multiple equilibria in the coordination stage less likely. In this sense, microstructure frictions that lead to greater individual exposure (to price execution risk) may reduce aggregate uncertainty (by pinning down a unique equilibrium outcome).

Although the payment method is likely to be correlated with risk preferences, it may also be influenced by ego-defensive concerns. Analysis of the self-selected Random Lottery Incentives scheme (RLI) and the Cumulative Scheme (CS) shows both individual and social effects: sellers who prefer CS over RLI receive a larger share of the surplus, and (female) buyers choosing RLI play with a lower degree of trust with the aim of closing better deals.","[Galliera, Arianna] Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn DIG, Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Galliera, A (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn DIG, Milan, Italy.",arianna.galliera@polimi.it,,"Galliera, Arianna/0000-0002-7320-0770",Max Planck Institute of Economics Strategic Interaction Group of Jena (Germany); European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme / ERC [336155],Max Planck Institute of Economics Strategic Interaction Group of Jena (Germany); European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme / ERC(European Research Council (ERC)),"I would like to thank Andrej Angelvski, Jordi Brandts, Marco Casari, Daniela Di Cagno, Werner Guth, John Hey, Noemi Pace, Giovanni Ponti for their helpful comments and suggestions.

First, can a single cultural event impact the stock prices of a wide range of companies and sectors? Second, was the positive stock market response in the information technology (IT) sector as well as performing arts sector significant? To answer these questions, we examine whether a hit pop single, Gangnam Style by Park Jae-Sang in 2012, affected related sectors of the Korean stock market and whether market reactions went beyond the stock price of the singer's agency to affect those of other firms. We use an event study approach. The results show two notable empirical findings. First, although the findings indicating abnormal returns and cumulative abnormal returns appear mixed, the overall results imply that the unprecedented worldwide hit single by the South Korean singer positively affected the Recreation & Culture and Digital Content sectors. In other words, the market interpreted the event as good news, with shareholders expecting positive effects on the related sectors.

This estimation approach cannot be easily used in the vast majority of European countries where several industry groups do not have sufficient yearly observations. Using data from France, Germany, Italy and the UK, we artificially induce earnings manipulations to investigate how the ability to detect those manipulations through accruals models is affected by the use of different industry classifications. Moreover, we propose an alternative estimation approach based on a data-driven statistical procedure that provides an optimal choice of estimation samples. Our analyses show that enlarging the industry classification and/or pooling observations across years reduces the probability of discovering earnings manipulations but allows for the estimation of abnormal accruals (AA) for more firms. The data-driven approach, however, in most cases outperforms the industry-based estimation approaches without sample attrition. This result suggests that there is still ample room for improving the accruals model estimation process for capital markets of European countries. Furthermore, the analysis documents which accruals model outperforms the others in each of the four countries and the probabilities to detect earning management in a high variety of circumstances.","[Di Narzo, Antonio F.] Antonio Di Narzo Consulting, Krakow, Poland; [Freo, Marzia] Univ Bologna, Dept Stat, Bologna, Italy; [Mattei, Marco Maria] Univ Bologna, Dept Management, Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna; University of Bologna,"Mattei, MM (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Management, Bologna, Italy.",marcomaria.mattei@unibo.it,,"Freo, Marzia/0000-0003-4541-5288; Di Narzo, Antonio/0000-0002-4033-5038",PricewaterhouseCoopers S.p.A.,PricewaterhouseCoopers S.p.A.,"An earlier version of this paper was circulated under the title 'Improving the power of accrual models in Europe: The mixture approach'.

Evolutionary competition in the model implies that innovation can overshoot the absorptive capacity of demand, leading to a slowdown in sectorial dynamism and even to structural collapse. Closed-form analytical results prove the existence of a unique stationary state in the dynamic model that is (globally) asymptotically stable. We show how the dynamic paths and the stationary rest-point depend on the trade-off between innovation and demand absorptive capacity parameters. To illustrate the plausibility and relevance of our results, we examine the Australian windsurfing industry in which diminished demand absorptive capacity (in the terms of the model) was a factor underlying sectoral collapse. We discuss how development of absorptive capacity of demand presents a collective action problem for an industry sector, and the role of demand-side factors as constraints in industry and innovation policy.","[Almudi, Isabel] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Econ Anal, Zaragoza, Spain; [Almudi, Isabel; Potts, Jason; Thomas, Stuart] RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Fatas-Villafranca, Francisco] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Business, Zaragoza, Spain",University of Zaragoza; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); University of Zaragoza,"Potts, J (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",jason.potts@rmit.edu.au,"; potts, jason/L-6530-2015","Almudi Higueras, Isabel/0000-0003-3766-9157; potts, jason/0000-0003-1468-870X; Fatas Villafranca, Francisco/0000-0002-1246-6751",,,,,19,5,5,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

But is really possible to simplify economic behavior that much? Is an aggregate consumption demand just a simple sum of individual household demands? Although many studies still obey the old habit that was started by Keynes, the answer to the aforementioned questions is obvious. Not only that behavior of individual units is significantly different from the aggregate one, there are also some aspects at the micro-level that for its nature can't be visible using macro-data and vice versa. That's why it is always necessary to take into account the nature of the data used before making any general conclusion. In the same sense, many studies have been done in terms of aggregate consumption function in Czech Republic, but we can say just a very little about consumption behavior of individual households based on them. The aim of this work is to make a little contribution in this field by defining and describing the basic determinants of average propensity to consume of Czech households. Our cross-sectional analysis shows up that one of the most influential factors of this consumption behaviour is relative income. That is a factor that can't be observed at a macro-level.","[Badura, Ondrej] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70200, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Badura, O (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70200, Czech Republic.",ondrej.badura@vsb.cz,,,VSB-Technical University SGS [SP2018/138],VSB-Technical University SGS,This paper was financially supported within the VSB-Technical University SGS grant project No. SP2018/138 (Implications for Fiscal and Monetary Policy of Advanced Countries: an Econometric Approach).,,14,0,0,0,3,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-289-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,9,15,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BN6JE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000485363200002,0

We find that women remain significantly more cooperative (choosing more often the responsible good) when the redistribution mechanism is interrupted and are significantly less satisfied about the behaviour of the other players in that treatment.","[Becchetti, Leonardo; Salustri, Francesco] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Econ & Finance, Rome, Italy; [Becchetti, Leonardo] Univ London, SOAS, Sch Finance & Management, London, England; [Pelligra, Vittorio; Vasquez, Alejandra] Univ Cagliari, Dept Econ & Business, Cagliari, Italy; [Vasquez, Alejandra] Univ Andres Bello, Inclus Educ, Ave Republ 252, Santiago, Chile",University of Rome Tor Vergata; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); University of Cagliari; Universidad Andres Bello,"Becchetti, L (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Econ & Finance, Rome, Italy.;Becchetti, L (通讯作者)，Univ London, SOAS, Sch Finance & Management, London, England.",Becchetti@economia.uniroma2.it,"Salustri, Francesco/U-8429-2017","Salustri, Francesco/0000-0002-5754-3079; Pelligra, Vittorio/0000-0002-8012-4243; BECCHETTI, LEONARDO/0000-0002-7629-0716; Vasquez, Alejandra/0000-0001-7941-6225",Smartlab Cagliari,Smartlab Cagliari,This work was supported by the Smartlab Cagliari [no number].,,37,5,5,12,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The analysis is based on panel data techniques, with the latest data from both Eurostat and the OECD Health Statistics. Furthermore, data from the World Bank is also applied. Besides, we have tested the sensitivity of the estimates in our empirical analysis using three clusters of countries. Our results suggest that income inequality does not significantly reduce health in developed societies, like the European ones. Notwithstanding, as income inequality can be sometimes harmful for population health, these issues must be taken into account in order to improve health care policies.","[Blazquez-Fernandez, Carla; Cantarero-Prieto, David; Pascual-Saez, Marta] Univ Cantabria, Dept Econ, Ave Los Castros S-N, E-39005 Santander, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria,"Blázquez-Fernández, C (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, Dept Econ, Ave Los Castros S-N, E-39005 Santander, Spain.",carla.blazquez@unican.es,,"Blazquez-Fernandez, Carla/0000-0002-0204-7174; Cantarero-Prieto, David/0000-0001-8082-0639",,,,,34,6,6,2,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

Hence, we are analyzing whether the EMU should stop accepting new entrants in order to stop deteriorating mutual business cycle correlation. Results based on correlations of shocks between the EMU and individual countries and their sizes show that correlation of supply shocks would remain relatively high if all members introduced the euro, but low correlation of demand shocks, different sizes of shocks and transmission of shocks still remain as significant problems.","[Broz, Tanja] Inst Econ, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb; Institute of Economics Zagreb (EIZ),"Broz, T (通讯作者)，Inst Econ, Zagreb, Croatia.",tbroz@eizg.hr,"Broz, Tanja/R-6554-2019",,,,,,43,0,1,0,4,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2018,65.0,4,,,,,459,477,,10.2298/PAN151028005B,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GV3EI,,gold,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445976700006,0

And while it is typical that widespread private ownership provides a basis for a well-functioning housing market, in Romania this has not been the case. Indeed, rather than creating a market that spontaneously allocates resources efficiently, housing privatization in Romania has created exclusion rights, thus creating an Anti-commons problem. This problem can have effects similar to those of the tragedy of the Commons in which those who share a common good overuse it. In the Anti-commons, in contrast, if too many owners have the right to exclude others from use of a resource, the resource is underused.

Shadow economy exists in any country and it is fostering economic development. That is why not only academics but also researchers try to identify the factors affecting the shadow economy level. In literature and research studies relatively insignificant attention is paid to the relation between national culture and shadow economy. In order to identify the relation, the correlation analysis and Hofstede's categorized national culture dimensions were used. Shadow Economy (as a percentage of the official GDP) was calculated based on the DYMIMIC and the Currency Demand Method. The Pearson's coefficient index, and t-student test were used, as well. The correlation analysis revealed the correlation between the shadow economy and the following: the dimensions of national cultural power distance, uncertainty avoidance, and individualism vs. collectivism. There is a slight correlation between the shadow economy and masculinity vs. femininity. This is a novel empirical analysis of the shadow economy existing among the dimensions of national culture. Based on the achieved results there is a requirement to shape national culture. Thanks to that the level of shadow economy might be reduced. The unexpected findings of high correlation between some national cultural dimensions suggest the need for more research in this area.","[Buszko, Andrzej Tomasz] Univ Warmia & Mazury, Oczapowskiego 2 Str, PL-10900 Olsztyn, Poland",University of Warmia & Mazury,"Buszko, AT (通讯作者)，Univ Warmia & Mazury, Oczapowskiego 2 Str, PL-10900 Olsztyn, Poland.",buszko@uwm.edu.pl,,,,,,,44,4,4,0,14,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Our findings suggest that the beneficial effects of knowledge flows strengthen when knowledge stocks accumulated by employees' education and firm age are low. When knowledge stocks are limited, knowledge flows can act as a bridge for product innovation.

The analysis focuses on aggregate electricity demand and three categories of consumers: residential, commercial, and industrial. The findings suggest that residential and industrial consumers are most responsive to price changes, with long-run price elasticities of demand of 0.82 and 0.25, respectively.

A decomposition analysis based on log-mean divisia index method (LMDI I) was conducted. Six decomposition factors were considered: Carbon Intensity effect (Cl), RES penetration effect (RES), Energy Intensity effect (El), Economy Structure effect (ES), Income effect (Yp) and Population effect (P). To know how these factors could influence each other in the future, the Innovative Accounting Approach (IAA) was used, including forecast error variance decomposition and Impulse Response Functions (IRFs). These two methodologies allow us to identify the drivers of CO2 emission changes in the past (1991-2013), test policy measures and learn how these drivers could influence each other in the future, to evaluate whether the current measures meet the Paris commitments. The LMDI analysis results show that the Energy Intensity Factor is the main compensating factor of Chile's CO2 emissions and the only effect with a clear trend to aid the economy's decoupling. IAA and IFRs results react similarly and confirm that carbon intensity reacts to shocks more significantly in the short term. The reaction to RES has the same and opposite behavior to shocks in ES and Yp, to disappear in the long term. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

On the one hand, the number of strikes increased, reaching its peak in 2011. On the other hand, there were much stronger signs that both the management and the workers were not satisfied with their factory regime, as a stable and predictable process to resolve labor disputes was yet to emerge. In addition to the previous economic and political explanations focused on macroeconomic conditions and political institutional arrangements at the national level, this article attempts to ethnographically explore and describe the political-economic conditions of both the workers and the managements on a micro level to answer the following questions: Why do some workers have to resort to uncomfortable and troublesome means such as wildcat strikes despite their better working conditions compared to those of workers in other factories? In contrast, what are the reasons that some factories do not offer their workers particularly favorable working conditions and wages and can still avoid strikes? While answering these questions, this article attempts to address the necessity of recognizing the distinctive political structure and processes in the multinational factory regime and to suggest ways of establishing more stable and productive industrial relations more suitable to the particularity of the factory regime.","[Chae, Suhong] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Anthropol, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Chae, S (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",chae4811@snu.ac.kr,,,,,,,27,3,4,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

The two-stage managerial performance structure is applied, incorporating the service production and service operation stages, as a reduced form to introduce the relatively complex business environment of modern enterprise. However, we have need to be considerable of dimensionality curse problem in NDEA performance model. A modified NDEA-based evaluation model, therefore, is proposed to integrate the network slacks-based measure (NSBM) with a dimensional reduction technique, the independent component analysis (ICA). The results indicate that the performance of the profit dimension significantly hampers operational performance, and that both regulators and managers must adjust their market orientation business strategy. Moreover, compared with the NSBM model, this modified ICA-NSBM performance model has a high discriminatory ability to measure the relative performance of the selected hotels.","[Chiu, Sheng-Hsiung; Lin, Tzu-Yu] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Nanfang Coll, Accounting Sch, 882 Wenquan Rd, Guangzhou 510970, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Sun Yat Sen University; Nanfang College, Guangzhou","Lin, TY (通讯作者)，Sun Yat Sen Univ, Nanfang Coll, Accounting Sch, 882 Wenquan Rd, Guangzhou 510970, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",blackmallows@gmail.com,,,,,,,46,11,11,0,19,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

In particular, we address three research questions: (i) Do the firms that export indirectly display the same characteristics as those that directly export their products?; (ii) Is the role of innovation, research and development (R&D) and human capital in export performance the same for firms that export directly and indirectly? and (iii) Is there geographical differentiation between C.E.E. and M.E.N.A. countries at the firm-level determinants of export performance? The analysis is based on a firm-level database (B.E.E.P.S.V) and covers the period between 2011 and 2014. We estimate the probability of exports, controlling for country and sector-specific effects using the probit model. We find that product innovations are more important than process innovations in determining direct export performance for the whole sample of countries. In addition, we find that the level of firm productivity, spending on R&D, human capital, foreign licences and foreign ownership are important in determining the export performance of the firms that export directly but not in the case of indirect exporters.","[Cieslik, Andrzej; Michalek, Jan Jakub] Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Michalek, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland.",michalek@wne.uw.edu.pl,"Cieslik, Andrzej/AAJ-7497-2020; Michalek, Jan/AAO-5211-2020","Cieslik, Andrzej/0000-0002-7834-7384; Michalek, Jan/0000-0002-2663-5974",National Science Centre of Poland (N.C.N.)

In the ensuing fiscal adjustment process, public investments were severely reduced in many countries. How harmful is this for growth perspectives? Our main objective is to find out whether the importance of public capital for long run output growth has changed in recent years. To this end, we expand time series on public capital stocks for 20 OECD countries and estimate country-specific recursive vector autoregressive (VAR) models. Results show that the effect of public capital shocks on economic growth has not increased in general, although results differ widely between countries. This suggests that the current level of public investments generally does not pose an immediate threat to potential output. Of course, this could change if low investment levels are sustained for a long time.","[De Jong, J. F.

Measures of bank shareholder value efficiency as well as profit and cost efficiency are used as indicators of intermediation quality. We also employ measures of liquidity creation (fat and nonfat) as a proxy for the quantity of bank intermediation. Our main finding is that the quality of bank intermediation (enhanced credit allocation) is a driver of economic growth in developed Asia-Pacific economies, whereas it is the quantity of bank intermediation (capital accumulation) that positively influences growth in developing nations. From a policy perspective, our findings suggest that policymakers in developed nations should concentrate their efforts on reforms that enhance bank efficiency. Second, reforms that stimulate capital accumulation should be encouraged in developing economies because this is the main channel that spurs economic growth.","[Fu, Xiaoqing (Maggie)] Univ Macau, Fac Business Adm, Taipa, Macao, Peoples R China; [Lin, Yongjia (Rebecca)] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Taipa, Macao, Peoples R China; [Molyneux, Philip] Univ Sharjah, Coll Business Adm, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates",University of Macau; Macau University of Science & Technology; University of Sharjah,"Lin, YJ (通讯作者)，Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Taipa, Macao, Peoples R China.",yjlin@must.edu.mo,"Fu, Xiaoqing/GPK-7573-2022","Fu, Xiaoqing/0000-0002-3694-122X; Molyneux, Philip/0000-0001-6210-7418",University of Macau [MYRG085]; Macau University of Science and Technology Faculty Research Grant [FRG-17-035-MSB],University of Macau; Macau University of Science and Technology Faculty Research Grant,The authors are grateful for funding from the University of Macau (Grant reference no.: MYRG085) and Macau University of Science and Technology Faculty Research Grant (Grant reference no.: FRG-17-035-MSB).

We hypothesize that fiscal competition to attract firms results in lower business tax revenues and higher public infrastructure spending which crowds out education and health spending leading to an increase in obesity rates. We empirically test this hypothesis. We find that there is significant fiscal competition to attract firms. Next, we show that when business tax revenues are lowered and public infrastructure spending favouring businesses increased, public health and education spending declines and obesity rates significantly increase. Thus, fiscal competition significantly contributes to obesity rates through the education and health spending channel.","[Galinato, Gregmar I.; Zhou, You] Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",Washington State University,"Galinato, GI (通讯作者)，Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",ggalinato@wsu.edu,,"Zhou, You/0000-0002-1687-4365",,,,,44,0,0,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

From many aspects, literature suggests these assets to behave more like stocks than bonds. Given the significant similarities between the high-yield bond and stock markets, it is expected for these markets to be similarly affected by certain outside factors. Some shocks, including the ones from energy markets, are known to impact the entire stock market and not just related company shares. Since high-yield bond portfolios include some amount of energy company debt, the recent volatility in energy prices has been particularly concerning to market participants. However, the question of whether price and volatility shocks only impact energy company bonds or the entire high-yield bond market - as they do with the stock market - still remains unanswered. This study attempts to address that question by exploring the dynamic relationships between the high-yield bond and energy markets. Price transmission tests, which account for gradual structural shifts, suggest oil and ethanol markets significantly impacting the high-yield bond market.

In-sample results demonstrate mutiplicate relationships between investor attention and currency returns. (1) Lagged investor attention significantly influences currency returns at present, and this effect is short-lived (usually at first lag). (2) The sign of past currency return matters for the magnitude of effects of investor attention on current return. Typically, the influence of past returns on the attention-return relationship alleviates market inefficiency and thus returns are less predictable merely based on past attention. (3) There exists a nonlinear relationship between investor attention and exchange rate returns. Consistent with in-sample results, investor attention provides a statistically significant out-of-sample forecast.

While this industry accounts for a relatively small share of total employment, the majority of private sector research and development (R&D) expenditures in the US is concentrated within seven sub-sectors. However, little attention has been paid as to whether high-tech productivity exhibits Hicksian capital or labour 'savings' bias or tendency to displace either factor input over time. Biased technical change can occur as economies transition between growth regimes. An augmented production function is employed to analyse the additional impact of R&D activity on firm-level labour productivity. A panel data set comprised of high-tech firms located across the advanced economies, China and India from 1990 to 2013 is used in the analysis. Labour-saving technical change was present across the advanced technology sectors and most countries. The expanded models of labour productivity that used fixed effects with lagged regressors confirmed the prior results as well as finding that R&D per employee, relative R&D intensity and firm market share contribute to firm-level labour productivity growth across countries and sectors. Additional support was found for diminishing returns to scale but not for R&D spillover effects.","[Hecht, Jason] Ramapo Coll, Anisfield Sch Business, Mahwah, NJ 07430 USA",Ramapo College New Jersey (RCNJ),"Hecht, J (通讯作者)，Ramapo Coll, Anisfield Sch Business, Mahwah, NJ 07430 USA.",jhecht@ramapo.edu,,,Ramapo College of New Jersey,Ramapo College of New Jersey,This work was supported by the Ramapo College of New Jersey [Faculty Development Funding Award].,,48,11,12,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Several researchers have attempted to address this question by analysing subjective health measures in the two countries, thus assuming a common definition of good' health. Using data from the Joint Canada/US Survey of Health, which provides rich and comparable health information for the two countries, I generate two quasi-objective health indices and show that Canadians and Americans define good' health differently. After controlling for cross-country reporting heterogeneity, health differences between Americans and Canadians are eliminated for intermediate health statuses, while health differences at the tails of the health distribution lead to slightly better average population health in Canada. With respect to health inequality, my results show that income and education gradients increase steeply with poor health in both countries. Hence, considering differences along the health distribution is crucial when assessing population health or health inequality.","[Heger, Doerte] RWI Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany",RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Heger, D (通讯作者)，RWI Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany.",doerte.heger@rwi-essen.de,,,,,,,42,1,1,2,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In this study, we argue that such a puzzling relationship can be understood by extending the traditional theoretical framework in a way that captures the reference dependence characteristics of prospect theory. We postulate that a firm's leverage position relative to its reference point (i.e. target leverage) combined with market conditions places firms in either a gain or a loss domain, thereby resulting in different leverage-return relationships. Leverage and expected equity returns generally exhibit positive and negative relationships in gain and loss domains, respectively. Three hypotheses are derived and tested using 1998-2013 empirical data from the US stock market. This article contributes to the existing literature by confirming the applicability of prospect theory in explaining expected returns in the stock market.","[Hu, Ting] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Dept Finance, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Gong, Cynthia M.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, 19 Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England",Huazhong University of Science & Technology; University of Cambridge,"Gong, CM (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, 19 Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England.",cynthia.gong1208@gmail.com,,"Gong, Cynthia (Miao)/0000-0001-7932-8655","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71231005, 71671076]",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC Project numbers 71231005 and 71671076).,,38,0,0,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The assignation formula used until 2013, distributed the Fund according to the relative poverty of each state in relation to the national poverty. This design did not generate the appropriate incentives to reduce poverty. Methods: Based on a principal agent model, and explicitly acknowledging the informational asymmetry between the federal and sub national levels of government, in this paper we propose a formula to assign the Fund, which has two fundamental characteristics: the FATS is distributed using the relative poverty of states / municipalities; and includes a component to avoid the perverse incentive of the formula used until 2013. Results: A mechanism is designed and used as the theoretical basis to construct a formula to assign the transfer. Conclusions: In order to achieve the proposed impact of the governmental programs financed with federal transfers, it is important to design and implement the mechanisms to align the incentives of the different governmental levels.","[Ibarra Salazar, Jorge] Escuela Ciencias Sociales & Gobierno Tecnol Monte, Dept Econ, Monterrey, Mexico; [Ibarra Salazar, Jorge] Southern Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, Dallas, TX 75275 USA",Tecnologico de Monterrey; Southern Methodist University,"Salazar, JI (通讯作者)，Escuela Ciencias Sociales & Gobierno Tecnol Monte, Dept Econ, Monterrey, Mexico.;Salazar, JI (通讯作者)，Southern Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, Dallas, TX 75275 USA.",jaibarra@itesm.mx,,,,,,,49,0,0,0,8,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

These groups form social networks that enable individuals to conduct non-formal contract enforcement mechanisms. I analyze the effects of religions on societies, focusing mainly on the institutional aspects that affect the capabilities of creating social capital via networks which enhance cooperation and decrease transaction costs. Since the interaction between institutions and organizations is expected to shape the institutional evolution and economic performance of an economy, religions that have a communal form of organization rather than a vertical (hierarchical) structure, thus allowing many different denominational sub-communities within a society, can be more beneficiary for development and growth. Such institutions may not only provide allocative and production efficiency, but also adaptive efficiency that is a key to long-run growth. However, these effects may turn negative depending on these institutions' role in causing group hostility and exclusion.","[Karacuka, Mehmet] Ege Univ, Dept Econ, Izmir, Turkey",Ege University,"Karaçuka, M (通讯作者)，Ege Univ, Dept Econ, Izmir, Turkey.",,,,,,,,89,5,5,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Rather surprisingly, the answer is that worker flows in South Africa are relatively large. In this paper, worker and job flows are estimated using anonymised IRP5 tax certificate data from the South African Revenue Service. The data used in this paper is from the 2011-2014 tax years and contains information on more than 12 million individuals and nearly 300,000 firms. The main finding of the paper is that worker flows are substantial, around 53% per year, or 58% when employers classified as engaged in public administration are excluded. One interpretation of this finding, as well as the patterns of separations and hires by firm growth rates, is that the labour market is not as rigid as had previously been thought. Worker flows are declining in firm size and in median earnings in the firm, they vary substantially by industry and are very low in the public sector. There is heterogeneity in worker experiences - while flows are high on average there are many workers that have very stable employment but those workers in the bottom quintile have worker flows more than three times those in the top quintile. Heterogeneity and persistence in worker flows and churning in firms are important - some firms have high levels of churning whilst others have much lower levels. Measurement error in the data about period employed from the IRP5 tax certificates is a concern but as far as can be ascertained this does not seem to be responsible for creating higher worker and job flows.","[Kerr, Andrew] 3rd Floor,Sch Econ Bldg,Middle Campus, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa; [Kerr, Andrew] Univ Cape Town, DataFirst, Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Kerr, A (通讯作者)，3rd Floor,Sch Econ Bldg,Middle Campus, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa.;Kerr, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, DataFirst, Rondebosch, South Africa.",andrew.kerr@uct.ac.za,,,South African Revenue Service (SARS); UNU-WIDER; South African National Treasury,South African Revenue Service (SARS); UNU-WIDER; South African National Treasury,"I thank the South African Revenue Service (SARS), UNU-WIDER, and the South African National Treasury for support.

Moreover, spatial factor mobility is significant for the HME to arise, while intersectoral mobility does not play a crucial role. Furthermore, a decrease in the traditional sector trade costs makes the HME weaker and increases the likelihood of full agglomeration in the larger region. Finally, the paper shows that a small departure from Cobb-Douglas upper-tier utility towards gross substitutability of manufacturing and traditional goods reinforces the HME, while the opposite holds for gross complementarity of goods.","[Kichko, Sergey] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, St Petersburg, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Kichko, S (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, St Petersburg, Russia.",skichko@hse.ru,"Kichko, Sergey/G-8741-2015","Kichko, Sergey/0000-0001-9191-8332",Russian Academic Excellence Project '5-100',"Russian Academic Excellence Project '5-100'(Ministry of Education and Science, Russian FederationProject 5-100, Ministry of Education and Science, Russian Federation)",The study was funded by the Russian Academic Excellence Project '5-100'.,,16,3,3,2,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

The model is based on the neoclassical production function enhanced with human capital. The authors draw on the Penn World Tables 9.0 and UNESCO databases. The key benefit of this article is that human capital is characterized according to the returns to education from average number of years of formal schooling at the primary, secondary and tertiary level. Based on the panel data analysis, the contributions of capital and of the three levels of education to the growth of labour productivity are estimated. At the same time, the model allows to estimate the contribution of total factor productivity. The results of the analysis show that tertiary education has the strongest impact on labour productivity across the considered economies. At the same time, the breakdown of aggregate human capital by level of education leads to better clarification of the effects of human capital and physical capital on labour productivity. The conclusions also indicate a tendency towards rising returns to scale induced by the secondary and tertiary education.","[Kocourek, Ales; Nedomlelova, Iva] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Liberec, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Kocourek, A (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec Ales Kocourek, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic.",ales.kocourek@tul.cz,"Nedomlelova, Iva/HLP-5065-2023; Kocourek, Ales/HKW-2602-2023; Nedomlelová, Iva/AAD-1593-2022","Kocourek, Ales/0000-0002-5880-7515; Nedomlelová, Iva/0000-0001-9038-6610","Technicka Univerzita v Liberci, Faculty of Economics [Excellent Research Teams - Regional Development]","Technicka Univerzita v Liberci, Faculty of Economics [Excellent Research Teams - Regional Development]","This work was supported by the Technicka Univerzita v Liberci, Faculty of Economics [Excellent Research Teams - Regional Development].",,81,10,14,7,44,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Hence, we analyse the ability of the Black-Scholes, Practitioner Black-Scholes, Heston-Nandi and Heston models to Delta-hedge a set of call options on the S&P500 index and Apple stock. We extend earlier studies in that we consider the impact of asset dynamics, apply a stringent payoff replication strategy, look at the impact of moneyness at maturity and test for the robustness to the parameters' calibration frequency and Delta-Vega hedging. The study shows that adding risk factors to a model, as stochastic volatility, should only be considered in light of the data dynamics. Even then, however, more complicated models generally fare poorly for hedging purposes. Hence, a better fit of a model to option prices is not a good indicator of its hedging performance, and so of its ability to describe the underlying dynamics. This can be understood for reasons of over-fitting. Those findings hint to a potentially appealing hedging-based calibration of models' parameters, rather than the standard pricing-based one.","[Lassance, Nathan] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; Catholic Univ Louvain, Louvain Finance Ctr LFIN, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Lassance, N (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",nathan.lassance@uclouvain.be,"Lassance, Nathan/JFA-6468-2023","Vrins, Frederic/0000-0003-1941-0416",Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique (F.R.S.-FNRS) under grant ASP [FC 17775],Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique (F.R.S.-FNRS) under grant ASP(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS),This work was supported by the Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique (F.R.S.-FNRS) under grant ASP [grant number FC 17775].,,20,3,3,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The choice of Indian SEOs as a sample allowed for constructing six benchmarks and comparing the results with the main market index. The study confirmed three-year underperformance for all of the benchmarks. However, the level of abnormal long-term returns appeared to be very sensitive to the benchmark. Interesting conclusions also emerged from differentiating the sample according to the level of the short-term underpricing, company and issue size, market sentiment, and mean volatility of prior returns. While the conventional view was that SEOs underperform in the long run, the research showed that average abnormal returns, differentiated according to firm and issue characteristics, were very sensitive to the reference portfolio.","[Lizinska, Joanna] Poznan Univ Econ, Corp Finance Dept, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Lizinska, J (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ, Corp Finance Dept, Poznan, Poland.",,,"Lizinska, Joanna/0000-0002-0738-4639",,,,,34,2,2,1,2,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

It involves several ontological presuppositions, with wide-ranging implications. Our purpose is to discuss one of these presuppositions. We want to scrutinise the conception, implicit in the 'market socialist' arguments, that things have economic roles or functions independently of the social environment in which they exist. Primary factors and techniques of production are taken to exist independently of social arrangements; jointly with consumer preferences, they are supposed to define the economic problem of a community. In criticising this conception, we borrow from F. A. Hayek, complementing his reflections with those of Donald Davidson, Tony Lawson and others. We also discuss a second problem, which follows directly from the first: if, in contrast with the market socialists' conception, the economic roles of things depend holistically on complex social processes, how can we compare alternative forms of economic organisation?.","Univ Porto, Fac Econ FEP UP, Oporto, Portugal; CIPES, Matosinhos, Portugal",Universidade do Porto,"Lourenço, D (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Fac Econ, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal.",dlourenco@fep.up.pt,"Lourenço, Diogo/AAE-3488-2020; da Graça Moura, Mário A B/R-2866-2018","Lourenço, Diogo/0000-0003-2486-1131; da Graça Moura, Mário A B/0000-0002-5738-7950",European Regional Development Fund through COMPETE 2020-Programa Operacional Competitividade e Internacionalizacao (POCI); Portuguese public funds through FCT (Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia) [POCI-01-0145-FEDER-006890]; FCT (Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia) [SFRH / BD / 71701 / 2010]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BD/71701/2010] Funding Source: FCT,European Regional Development Fund through COMPETE 2020-Programa Operacional Competitividade e Internacionalizacao (POCI); Portuguese public funds through FCT (Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia); FCT (Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"Universidade do Porto, Faculdade de Economia (FEP-UP) and CIPES; Universidade do Porto, Faculdade de Economia (FEP-UP) and Cef.up, respectively.

While evidence on the relationship between local market power and asymmetries in the speed of price adjustment is mixed, our findings regarding asymmetries in price thresholds are clear: in regions where competition from neighbouring rivals is weak and/or consumers' price elasticity of demand is low (stations located on the highway), positive thresholds significantly exceed negative ones, which corresponds to the rockets and feathers phenomenon'.

However, is this hegemonic situation sustainable in the medium to long term? This study seeks to answer that question using a prospective approach based on the Complex Adaptive Systems (CASs) underlying Complexity Economics. The greatest danger facing the current IMS as a CAS lies in its endogenous evolution. The modern Triffin dilemma and a tendency towards multipolarity in the economic system-as opposed to the continued unipolarity of the monetary system-make it essential to adapt the system. However, no such adaptation is currently taking place. Thus, with no need for any external shock, the very nature of the IMS leads to an eroding of confidence in the dollar in the medium/long term. In order for the IMS to adapt and reconstruct itself, co-operation between interactive agents participating in the system is essential.","[Marcos, Aitor] IDOM, Bilbao, Spain; [Urionabarrenetxea, Sara] Univ Basque Country, Bilbao, Spain",University of Basque Country,"Urionabarrenetxea, S (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country, Bilbao, Spain.",sara.urionabarrenetxea@ehu.eus,,,,,,,58,0,0,2,8,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,2340-4264,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

Less well understood are the implicit costs of having a child, and how they have changed over time. In this article, we are the first to examine the evolution of the implicit costs of motherhood over the lifecycle and across generations using high quality administrative data. We estimate that the lifetime labor market income gap between mothers and women who never have children (never-mothers) decreases from around $350,000 to $280,000 between women born in the late 1940s and late 1960s. Gaps tend to increase monotonically over the lifecycle, and decrease monotonically between cohorts. Our evidence suggests that changes in the gaps are caused by changing labor force participation rates.","[Neumeier, Christian] Univ Konstanz, Grad Sch Decis Sci, D-78457 Constance, Germany; [Sorensen, Todd] Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Sorensen, Todd] IZA, GLO, Bonn, Germany; [Webber, Douglas] Temple Univ, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Webber, Douglas] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Konstanz; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Sorensen, T (通讯作者)，Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, Reno, NV 89557 USA.;Sorensen, T (通讯作者)，IZA, GLO, Bonn, Germany.",christian.neumeier@uni-konstanz.de; tsorensen@unr.edu; douglas.webber@temple.edu,,,"NSF [SES-1042181, BCS-0941226]; Alfred P.

By the early 1990s, socialism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe decayed from within leaving in its wake economic misery and intellectual emptiness. Yet, socialism is raising its head once again. This new variant of socialism, which I call liberal socialism', has one critical difference that sets it apart from its predecessors. Unlike all three types of socialism in the last century - Fascism, National Socialism and Communism - liberal socialism is not imposed from the top down; it is emerging from the bottom up. The incentive effects of increasing redistributional governmental programmes map a road to liberal socialism by influencing the median voter and weakening private property rights. However, election results in many European countries, and at state and local levels in the United States, suggest that the median voter has not moved to the left. At the same time, economic analysis and empirical evidence have established the economic efficiency of credible and stable private property rights relative to all other property rights arrangements. Thus, liberal socialism is a real threat to the rule of law but its success is far from certain.","[Pejovich, Svetozar (Steve)] Texas A&M Univ, Dallas, TX 75201 USA",Texas A&M University System,"Pejovich, S (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dallas, TX 75201 USA.",pejovic1@sbcglobal.net,,,,,,,25,2,2,3,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2018,30.0,1,,,,,117,129,,10.1080/14631377.2017.1398527,0.0,,,13,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FS6KV,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000419907200007,0

This bound is tighter than the bound proposed by Ross (2005) because it takes into account not only the volatility of the pricing kernel but also the correlation between the pricing kernel and trading strategies that exploit predictability. It is also at least as tight as the bound proposed by Huang and Zhou (2017). We apply our bound to study the predictability of returns on currencies of emerging and developed economies from 1994 to 2016. We find evidence of return predictability in excess of the bound, especially for emerging markets currencies. This implies either market inefficiency or, alternatively, that investors either can become very risk-averse or price currencies using a model radically different from the CAPM. In contrast, the evidence of excess-predictability is much weaker under the wider bound proposed by Ross (2005). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The model shows in an easily accessible manner that macroeconomic effects of changes in personal and functional income distribution can potentially reinforce or dampen each other. The resulting variety of demand and growth regimes is due to different distributional effects on consumption demand. Therefore, the second part of the paper investigates the empirical relevance of the additional demand regimes by estimating aggregate consumption functions with variables for personal and functional income distribution for the United States and Germany. We find similar effects of functional income distribution for both countries. However, for the US, we find positive long-run effects of personal income inequality on consumption. The effect is strongest for the top 10% income share and the Gini index and less strong for the top 5% and 1% income shares. While this is evidence for relative consumption patterns, it also supports the view that the super rich are a relatively distant class for most people- questioning the notion of expenditure cascades from the very top to the very bottom. In contrast, for Germany we fail to find compelling evidence for effects of personal income distribution.","[Prante, Franz J.] Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Inst Int Polit Econ, Berlin, Germany",Berlin School of Economics & Law,"Prante, FJ (通讯作者)，Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Inst Int Polit Econ, Berlin, Germany.",franz.prante@hwr-berlin.de,,,,,,,47,2,2,2,12,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2018,65.0,3,,,SI,,289,318,,10.2298/PAN1803289P,0.0,,,30,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,GP3RB,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440769800003,0

With the data from Tianjin in China, hedonic models are calibrated to quantify the impacts of asymmetric information on housing search outcomes. The results show that the less-informed homebuyers need to pay around 1 similar to 2.3% more than those better-informed homebuyers after controlling the heterogeneity of housing units, which are consistent with the theoretical predictions.

As credit guarantee corporations cannot distinguish low risk from risky borrowers, credit guarantee schemes typically attract a larger proportion of risky borrowers, which results in inefficient resource allocation. Using bank-level data, we analyse whether the default rate is positively associated with the ratio of guaranteed loans to total loans, and find that the data are consistent with an adverse selection and/or moral hazard hypothesis. Further analysis shows that the relationship is stronger for 100% coverage than for 80% coverage, indicating that the 20% self-payment' requirement somewhat mitigates the problem, but not enough to eliminate it altogether.","[Saito, Kuniyoshi] Meiji Gakuin Univ, Dept Econ, Tokyo, Japan; [Tsuruta, Daisuke] Nihon Univ, Coll Econ, Tokyo, Japan",Nihon University,"Tsuruta, D (通讯作者)，Nihon Univ, Coll Econ, Tokyo, Japan.",tsuruta.daisuke@nihon-u.ac.jp,"Saito, Kuniyoshi/AAM-7800-2020","Saito, Kuniyoshi/0000-0002-2787-9540","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [24530366, 16K03753, 24730275]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24730275, 24530366, 16K03753] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) # 24530366; 16K03753, Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) # 24730275];",,34,19,22,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Ranson argued that capital should be defined as intangible ideas and technology that are not subject to supply and demand constraints. Thorstein Veblen (1908, 518) described his conception of capital as being found in possession of something in the way of a body of technological knowledge, - knowledge serviceable and requisite to the quest of a livelihood. John R. Commons (1934, 662) wrote in a similar vein that capital is not an accumulation of past products of stored-up labor - these are transitory and aimless - capital is a going plant of industrial knowledge and experience. More recently, Cesar Hidalgo (2015) and Paul Romer (1990, 1994) have also written about the idea of capital as ideas and the key to economic growth. Hidalgo (2015, 179) states that the growth of information in the economy, which is ultimately the essence of economic growth, results from the coevolution of our species' collective computation capacity. The first section of this article explores the linkages between the older generation and more recent thinkers on the intersection of capital as technology and ideas. The second section explores the policy ramifications of this conceptualization of capital. Romer argues that temporary monopolies are needed to encourage investment in innovation. According to both Veblen and Ranson, these rules do not allow for the full social value of ideas to be utilized. The second part of this article also explores these differences using A. Allan Schmid's situation-structure-performance (SSP) model.","[Scorsone, Eric; Schulz, Mary; Schweikhardt, David] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Scorsone, E (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Qualitatively diverse patterns, including the Wicksellian (normal) market, the Minsky financial bubbles and the Fisherian debt-deflation, were discerned by appropriate combinations of rates of return, spreads and leverage. The Kolmogorov-Fokker-Plank equation was used to find out the stationary gamma distribution of leverage that was instrumental for the evaluation of appropriate failure and survival functions. Two patterns corresponding to different forms of a stationary gamma distribution were recognized in the long run leverage dynamics and were simulated as scenarios of a possible system evolution. In particular, empirically parameterized asymptotical distribution indicated excessive leverage and unsustainable global debt accumulation. It underlined the necessity of comprehensive reforms aiming to decrease uncertainty, debt and leverage. Assuming these reforms were successfully implemented, global leverage distributions would have converged in the long run to a peaked gamma distribution with the mode identical to the anchor leverage. The latter corresponded to a balanced long run debt demand and supply, hence to fairly evaluated financial assets fully collateralized by real resources. A particular case of macrofinancial Tobin's q-coefficients following the Ornstein-Ulenbeck process was studied to evaluate a reasonable range of squeezing the bloated world finance. The model was verified on data published by the IMF in Global Financial Stability Reports for the period 2003-2013.","[Smirnov, Alexander D.] Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Dept Appl Macroecon, Moscow, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Smirnov, AD (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Dept Appl Macroecon, Moscow, Russia.",adsmir@hse.ru,,"Smirnov, Alexander D./0000-0003-3274-8841",,,,,40,1,1,0,15,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-6124,1935-1704,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

The empirical results suggest a positive impact of renewable energy consumption on economic growth, and emphasize bidirectional or unidirectional Granger causalities between the two macroeconomic indicators, for each country in the panel. These results justify the political decisions of EU concerning the necessity of increasing the renewable energy consumption, and prove that this type of energy consumption has a strong positive impact on economic growth. Thus, the inclusion of such policies in future EU and national strategies is further motivated.

The public insurer can set the reimbursement level for medical providers and the copayment for the insured for medical care provided under the policy coverage, but cannot directly control providers' spot sales (outside of insurance) price. In this setup, the price offered by the public insurer to medical providers must maintain their reservation profit from selling on the spot market directly to consumers. We show that the public insurer can manipulate this reservation profit by setting the copayment rate, and thereby promote market welfare while increasing consumers' surplus due to lower medical prices and lower market entry.

Unlike alternative reduced-form approaches, our model explicitly incorporates key features of the demand for network services: a bell-shaped distribution of heterogeneous consumers and presence of network effects. Our empirical analysis of European countries reveals that although the demand for broadband services exhibits strong network effects they are not 'strong enough' to archive critical mass in these markets. Furthermore, the systems equilibrium dynamics show that even though the technology is introduced at very high prices initially, the expansion of suppliers' infrastructure investment reduces the equilibrium prices rapidly in the first few years. This price reduction, combined with strong network effects, stimulates expansion of the subscription base until consumers at the peak of the distribution enter the market. Convergence to the steady state happens at around 8 years for service price and 15 years for subscription. Comparative static analysis illustrates that steady state equilibrium subscription relates positively to national population density, inter-platform concentration, and the share of unbundled local loop, while the equilibrium price relates inversely to these factors. Other supply and demand factors (viz. intra-platform concentration, income and education) have minimal impact on the steady state equilibrium.","[Suenaga, Hiroaki; Madden, Gary] Curtin Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Perth, WA, Australia",Curtin University,"Suenaga, H (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Perth, WA, Australia.",hiroaki.suenaga@cbs.curtin.edu.au,,"Suenaga, Hiroaki/0000-0002-0208-2586",,,,,20,1,1,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Using the Johansen Cointegration test, we identified one cointegrating equation for the model with deterministic trend in data. Therefore, in order to estimate the long run relationship between the variables, we used a VECM model. The FDI, GDP and the openness have a negative effect on unemployment. In what regards the unemployment rate, we found a unidirectional causal relationship only from GDP towards unemployment rate and from openness towards the unemployment rate. No bidirectional relationship has been identified between the selected variables in Romania. The impulse response functions show that a shock in the GDP produces a positive effect on the unemployment rate during the first 2 years and a negative one from year 3 to 10. In what concerns the other two variables, a shock in the FDI respectively in the openness, produces a negative effect on the unemployment rate for all 10 years in Romania.","[Teodora, Mester Ioana; Ramona, Simut] Univ Oradea, Fac Econ Sci, Univ St 1, Oradea 410087, Bihor, Romania",University of Oradea,"Teodora, MI (通讯作者)，Univ Oradea, Fac Econ Sci, Univ St 1, Oradea 410087, Bihor, Romania.",imester@uoradea.ro; simut.ramona@yahoo.com,"Mester, Ioana Teodora/IUN-3402-2023; Simut, Ramona/AAN-4689-2020; Mester, Ioana/AAL-1915-2021","Mester, Ioana Teodora/0000-0001-5133-6979;",,,,,15,0,0,0,0,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-289-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,217,223,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BN6JE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000485363200024,0

The model is formed by two functions, one for the formation of the network and another for the creation of knowledge, that suffice to reproduce the three coevolution scenarios described in the empirical literature. Due to the feedback mechanisms between the two functions, changes in one of the parameters deeply affect the outcome of the model, both in the amount of knowledge produced and the structure of the resulting network, as well as in the relation between them.

However, from the 1980s with the rise of neoliberal ideas, debates on development and the international cooperation system and its strategies took different directions. Currently, the definition and monitoring of the Agenda has become the centre of debate, with the consequent abandonment of the theoretical and historical perspectives as well as the traditional perception of development as a process of transformation of reality. This disconnection between ideas on development and cooperation has led to a long-standing confusion over cooperation, with its role becoming increasingly unclear. This paper highlights the need to return to the relationship between theoretical reflection on development and cooperation strategies, through a process of identifying problems, studying their causes and consequently designing strategies.

We run separate models for women and men, and stratify by type of occupation and by area obesity prevalence. Our results indicate that weight-related discrimination in work settings in Spain is concentrated among women with morbid obesity, particularly among those working in customer-facing jobs and living in areas with low-obesity prevalence. These findings emphasize the persistence of the gendered nature of obesity-related discrimination, and provide evidence of a form of induced statistical discrimination. Employers' expectations of lower returns from obese workers in customer facing jobs might be driven by customers' preferences caused by social stigma.

Unlike western countries, we have a low tax rate on the income of natural persons and a high burden on work through social security contributions, the lion share of which is paid by the employers. The prerequisite for the effective solution of the problem of the overall taxation of self-employed includes clarification of the concept for financing social security, from which the expediency of combining the current taxation of personal incomes with the social security contributions paid by employees becomes apparent under Czech conditions. At the same time, this will also involve a necessary increase in the tax rates for self-employed and single directors. The rate of the social security contributions paid by employers and self-employed may be differentiated on the grounds of the lower scope of social security provision for self-employed, but this is not necessary under Czech conditions. The allowance for employee benefits (in particular paid leave) provides justification for the reduction of the assessment base for self-employed social security contributions to below the level corresponding to the share of an employee gross wage in the total labour costs.","[Vostatek, Jaroslav] Univ Finance & Adm Prague, Estonska 500, Prague 10100 10, Czech Republic",University of Finance & Administration - Czech Republic,"Vostatek, J (通讯作者)，Univ Finance & Adm Prague, Estonska 500, Prague 10100 10, Czech Republic.",jaroslav.vostatek@vsfs.cz,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,4,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-289-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,404,413,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BN6JE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000485363200044,0

Evidence from Poland,APPLIED ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Term premium; business cycle; small open economy,BUSINESS CYCLES; MONETARY-POLICY; MODELS,"This article investigates the impact of long-term interest rates on macroeconomic variables in a small open economy. It shows that the time-varying term premium stabilizes GDP without affecting significantly inflation volatility in Poland - a typical open economy with flexible exchange rate. This conclusion is drawn from an estimated dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model in which segmented asset markets and imperfect asset substitutability give rise to the time-varying term premium in the long-term interest rate. Furthermore, the impulse response analysis of the model reveals that the term premium stabilizes GDP when the small economy is hit by shocks that are absent in closed economy models (country risk premium and export preference) which points to the different impact of the term premium on relatively close (large) and open (small) economies.","[Wesolowski, Grzegorz] Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland; [Wesolowski, Grzegorz] Narodowy Bank Polski, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics; Narodowy Bank Polski,"Wesolowski, G (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland.;Wesolowski, G (通讯作者)，Narodowy Bank Polski, Warsaw, Poland.",grzegorz.wesolowski@nbp.pl,"Wesołowski, Grzegorz/AAZ-9119-2021; Wesołowski, Grzegorz/HHN-1511-2022","Wesołowski, Grzegorz/0000-0002-1873-6521;",Polish National Science Centre [DEC-2013/09/N/HS4/03853],Polish National Science Centre,This research project has been financially supported by the Polish National Science Centre [decision number DEC-2013/09/N/HS4/03853].,,40,6,6,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Traditional single-period approaches used to predict financial distress are based on unrealistically restrictive assumptions and cannot dynamically account for changes in financial indicators and macroeconomic conditions. Therefore discrete-time hazard models (using logit and cloglog) are applied; these indicate that the probability of distress is strongly influenced by both firm-specific and macroeconomic variables. Although firm-specific variables play an essential role, the results show that macroeconomic variables are important for understanding the fluctuations in the probability of distress over time. Furthermore, the findings provide evidence that both the legal criteria and a firm's financial health should be considered when identifying firms in emerging economies that are in distress because existing bankruptcy laws are not applied.","[Zikovic, Ivana Tomas] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Zikovic, IT (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",ivana.tomas.zikovic@efri.hr,"Tomas Žiković, Ivana/AAJ-8542-2020","Tomas Žiković, Ivana/0000-0002-9156-3479",Croatian Science Foundation [6558],Croatian Science Foundation,"This work is supported by the Croatian Science Foundation under Project 6558, Business and Personal Insolvency-the Ways to Overcome Excessive Indebtedness.",,51,10,10,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

(1992), and the exponential GARCH (or EGARCH) model of Nelson (1990, 1991). For purposes of deriving the mathematical regularity properties, including invertibility that relates the standardized residuals to the returns shocks, to determine the likelihood function for estimation, and the statistical conditions to establish asymptotic properties, it is essential to understand the stochastic properties underlying the three univariate models. The random coefficient autoregressive process was used to obtain GARCH by Tsay (1987), an extension of which was used by McAleer (2014) to obtain GJR. A random coefficient complex nonlinear moving average process was used by McAleer and Hafner (2014) to obtain EGARCH. These models can be used to capture asymmetry, which denotes the different impacts on conditional volatility of positive and negative shocks of equal magnitude, and possibly also leverage, which is the negative correlation between returns shocks and subsequent shocks to volatility (see Black 1976). McAleer (2014) showed that asymmetry was possible for GJR, but not leverage. McAleer and Hafner (2014) showed that leverage was not possible for EGARCH. Surprisingly, the condition for asymmetry in EGARCH seem to have been ignored in the literature, or has concentrated on the incorrect parametric condition, with no clear explanation, and hence with associated unclear and misleading interpretations. The purpose of the paper is to derive the regularity condition for asymmetry in EGARCH, and to provide the correct interpretation. It is shown that, in practice, EGARCH always displays asymmetry, though not leverage. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

When looking at aggregate regional inflation, we find that the mean, volatility and persistence fell in all cities in the wake of the monetary policy regime change, consistent with other evidence in the literature. Delving more deeply into the disaggregate data reveals additional insights however. For most of the changes we observe in the dynamics of regional inflation, we find that the aggregate effects are being driven primarily by sectors that fall into the Services' category. We posit that the impact of better anchored inflationary expectations is primarily on the less-traded services sectors of the economy, where the domestic monetary policy framework has a relatively larger influence. When it comes to the increased co-movement observed across regions under an IT regime, however, it is the Commodities' sectors rather than Services' that are responsible, probably because services inflation becomes relatively more influenced by local factors once it has stabilized within the target range. Therefore, adoption of IT may not necessarily increase all measures of regional synchronization even when the goal of better-anchored inflationary expectations is achieved.","[Choi, Chi-Young] Univ Texas Arlington, Arlington, TX 76019 USA; [Lee, Joo Yong] Bank Korea, Seoul, South Korea; [O'Sullivan, Roisin] Smith Coll, Northampton, MA 01063 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington; Bank of Korea; Smith College,"Choi, CY (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Arlington, UTA Econ, 701 S West St, Arlington, TX 76019 USA.",cychoi@uta.edu,,,,,,,29,1,1,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

New Zealand targets five deprivation measures: low income, lack of education, low skill employment, crowding, and receiving welfare. Using school fixed effects, we do not find evidence that government funds raise graduation rates for schools, including those serving the most disadvantaged students. We also find no robust evidence that targeting some disadvantage measures is more effective than others.

Unlike the case for North-South exchanges, academic work on South-South economic relations has been historically limited given their marginal importance in the global economy. After the 1990s, the literature has changed in two main ways. First, South-South trade and finance since then has increased dramatically, leading to a bourgeoning literature on the topic. Second, the rise of the Emerging South has opened up new lines of inquiry to include not just the traditional topics of trade and preferential trading agreements, but also cover technology transfer, capital flows, labor migration, institutions, and environment. We discuss how this literature has evolved to take into account the greater complexity of South-South relations with a focus on China in Africa as well as the blurring of the lines between heterodox and mainstream analysis of South-South relations. We end the review by showing how the empirical and theoretical literature is exploring the increasing divergence within the global South between what we refer to as the Emerging South and the Rest of South.","[Dahi, Omar S.] Hampshire Coll, Amherst, MA 01002 USA; [Demir, Firat] Univ Oklahoma, Norman, OK 73019 USA",University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Dahi, OS (通讯作者)，Hampshire Coll, Amherst, MA 01002 USA.",odahi@hampshire.edu,,"Demir, Firat/0000-0002-5063-7670",Faculty Office at Hampshire College; School of Critical Social Inquiry at Hampshire College,Faculty Office at Hampshire College; School of Critical Social Inquiry at Hampshire College,"We thank Mustafa Caglayan, Amitava K.

The paper spans the traditional focus in forest economics by considering also the negative effects caused by forest fires in coastal areas, highlighting this way how the externalities go beyond the terrestrial area and can also affect marine ecosystems. Results from a willingness to pay in space modelling approach show that people are sensitive to the biodiversity losses produced by forest fires and are willing to pay (work on a voluntary basis) to undertake activities that reduce their impact. The main negative externalities are concerned to the terrestrial wildlife (animals and vegetation), following by the erosion and marine biodiversity losses and the pests and diseases prevention.","[Duran-Medrana, Roi; Garza-Gil, Dolores; Prada, Albino; Vazquez, Maria X.] Univ Vigo, Environm & Resource Econ Res Grp ERENEA, Dept AppliCed Econ, Lagoas Marcosende S-N, Vigo 36310, Spain; [Varela, Elsa] Ctr Agrofood Econ & Dev CREDA UPC IRTA, Mediterranean Technol Pk,ESAB Bldg, Castelldefels 08860, Spain; [Solino, Mario] Natl Inst Agr & Food Res & Technol INIA, Forest Res Ctr CIFOR, Ctra Coruna,Km 7-5, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Solino, Mario] iuFOR, Sustainable Forest Management Res Inst, Palencia, Spain",Universidade de Vigo; IRTA; Instituto Nacional Investigacion Tecnologia Agraria Alimentaria (INIA),"Soliño, M (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Agr & Food Res & Technol INIA, Forest Res Ctr CIFOR, Ctra Coruna,Km 7-5, Madrid 28040, Spain.",solino.mario@inia.es,"Varela, Elsa/GQH-7805-2022; Varela, Elsa/B-3928-2017; Vázquez-Rodríguez, María X./L-3972-2014; Solino, Mario/A-5648-2012","Varela, Elsa/0000-0001-9312-6187; Varela, Elsa/0000-0001-9312-6187; Vázquez-Rodríguez, María X./0000-0002-0004-2249; Solino, Mario/0000-0001-7065-7348",,,,,93,17,18,0,56,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

Oil prices experienced in early life predict differential adult outcomes across Nigerian ethnic groups. Our difference-in-difference approach compares members of southern ethnicities to other Nigerians from the same birth cohort. This North-South distinction mirrors several economic, political, and religious cleavages in the country. Greater prices in a southern individual's birth year predict several relative outcomes, including reduced fertility, delayed marriage, higher probabilities of working and having a skilled occupation, greater schooling, lower height, and greater BMI. These microeconomic impacts are explained by macroeconomic responses to oil prices; relatively, urban incomes increase, food production declines, and maternal labor intensifies in the South.","[Fenske, James] Univ Warwick, Coventry, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Fenske, J (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",j.fenske@warwick.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,86,15,20,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

However, news sources might have their own agendas and prefer that some information is hidden from the public. In this paper, we model the relationship between news sources and media firms as informal contracts based on trust and punishment The interactions between these two types of agents may have a significant impact on the completeness of news coverage in the media. Profit maximizing media firms may deliberately hide information from their audiences in order to maintain a long-term relationship with a source. We find that this cunning behavior might become more intensified the tougher the competitive pressure in the media market, since a newspaper risks to lose the source to a rival if it does not withhold information to please the source.

We adopt an Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (EGARCH) model to analyze daily data for the five year duration of QMEP. The purpose of QMEP was to reduce short-term interest rate expectations with the goal of bringing down long term interest rates to stimulate the economy. Under QMEP, the operational target of monetary policy was taken as the current account balances (CABs) of financial institutions held at the BoJ. In support of QMEP effectiveness, we find that the policy to raise CABs was indeed associated with a decrease in yield spreads across all maturities. At the same time, the policy may have increased the volatility of yield spreads at short and medium time horizons, perhaps due to unevern demand for government security issues that nevertheless left confidence in the future of low interest rates intact. Preserving liquidity at or above the CABs target range was found to decrease yield spreads. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

A few countries, notably Belgium, have introduced an allowance for corporate equity (ACE) to achieve tax neutrality. We study the effects of adopting an ACE on debt financing, passive investment, and active investment of multinational firms, using high quality administrative data on virtually all German-based multinationals. We use two main identification strategies, based on (1) synthetic control methods and (2) variations across affiliates within the multinational group. Our results suggest that an ACE reduces the corporate debt ratio of multinational affiliates. Additionally, an ACE increases intra-group lending and other forms of passive investment but has no effects on production investment of multinational affiliates. The findings indicate that a unilateral implementation of an ACE system generates a tax planning opportunity using a structure combining the benefits from the ACE with interest deductions.

We speculate that various candidate processing strategies (CPS) are possible, but in practice the analyst is likely to choose one CPS and to assume that it is adopted by the respondents in modelling best-worst data. This decision is usually based on model goodness-of-fit measures and/or the order of the best worst questions under a certain behavioural choice rule, typically utility maximisation. This paper proposes the use of the irrelevance of state-wise dominated alternative (ISDA) axiom as a theoretical benchmark to identify the CPS and the behavioural choice rule respondents are most likely to adopt (at least up to a probability). An empirical assessment using a road pricing reform dataset collected in Sydney suggests that a test based on an incidence of compliance with ISDA produces more convincing evidence than a test that is based on goodness of fit measures. The results suggest that respondents seem to process the information and respond to the worst question first, even though it is structured after the best question. Individual heterogeneity in the way they process the information is also examined and a way to capture this through a latent class model is promoted.","[Ho, Chinh Q.; Hensher, David A.] Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Inst Transport & Logist Studies H73, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Ho, CQ (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Inst Transport & Logist Studies H73, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",Chinh.Ho@sydney.edu.au; David.Hensher@sydney.edu.au,,"Hensher, David/0000-0003-0058-2242",Australian Research Council [DP140100909],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"We appreciated the constructive and insightful comments from the two reviewers, which has materially improved the paper.

We address this question, and account for a number of stylized facts and apparent anomalies regarding vote buying, using a model in which parties cannot fully commit to campaign promises. We find that high vote buying is associated with frequent reneging on campaign promises, strong electoral competition, and high policy rents. Frequent reneging and low party competence reduce campaign promises. If vote buying can be financed out of public resources, incumbents buy more votes and enjoy an electoral advantage, but they also promise more public goods. Vote buying has distributional consequences: voters targeted with vote buying pre-election may receive no government benefits post-election. The results point to obstacles to the democratic transition from clientelist to programmatic forms of electoral competition: parties may not benefit electorally from institutions that increase commitment.

By redesigning both the rules that guide market transactions and the infrastructure that enables those transactions to take place, market designers can address a broad range of market failures. In this paper, we illustrate the process and power of market design through three examples: the design of medical residency matching programmes; a scrip system to allocate food donations to food banks; and the recent 'Incentive Auction' that reallocated wireless spectrum from television broadcasters to telecoms. Our lead examples show how effective market design can encourage participation, reduce gaming, and aggregate information, in order to improve liquidity, efficiency, and equity in markets. We also discuss a number of fruitful applications of market design in other areas of economic and public policy.","[Kominers, Scott Duke] Harvard Sch Business, Entrepreneurial Management Unit, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kominers, Scott Duke] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, CMSA, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kominers, Scott Duke] Harvard Univ, Ctr Res Computat & Soc, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kominers, Scott Duke] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Teytelboym, Alexander; Crawford, Vincent P.] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford, England; [Teytelboym, Alexander] Univ Oxford, St Catherines Coll, Oxford, England; [Teytelboym, Alexander] Oxford Martin Sch, INET, Oxford, England; [Crawford, Vincent P.] Univ Oxford, All Souls Coll, Oxford, England; [Crawford, Vincent P.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92103 USA",Harvard University; Harvard University; Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Kominers, SD (通讯作者)，Harvard Sch Business, Entrepreneurial Management Unit, Boston, MA 02115 USA.;Kominers, SD (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, CMSA, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Kominers, SD (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Ctr Res Computat & Soc, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Kominers, SD (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",kominers@fas.harvard.edu; alexander.teytelboym@economics.ox.ac.uk; vincent.crawford@economics.ox.ac.uk,"Crawford, Vincent P./F-9306-2011","Crawford, Vincent P./0000-0003-0532-0305; Kominers, Scott/0000-0002-7608-6619","Oxford Martin School; National Science Foundation [CCF-1216095, SciSIP-1535813, SES-1459912]; Harvard Milton Fund; Ng Fund of the CMSA; Human Capital and Economic Opportunity Working Group (HCEO) - INET; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union [339179]; University of Oxford, All Souls College; University of California, San Diego; European Research Council (ERC) [339179] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)","Oxford Martin School; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Harvard Milton Fund; Ng Fund of the CMSA; Human Capital and Economic Opportunity Working Group (HCEO) - INET; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); University of Oxford, All Souls College; University of California, San Diego(University of California System); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government)","This project was launched while Kominers was a Visiting Fellow at the Oxford Martin School.

We find that when UHC is expanded, UHC premium rate for workers is raised to finance the increased budget, which distorts the households' incentive to work and leads to a decrease in aggregate labor. Moreover, the reduced volatility of disposable income weakens the households' savings motive, thereby resulting in a decrease in aggregate capital. While the decreases in production factors lead to a significant drop in aggregate output, the binary voting simulation shows that the expansion of UHC is approved with near unanimous support.","[Lim, Taejun] Korea Insurance Res Inst, Seoul 150606, South Korea",,"Lim, T (通讯作者)，Korea Insurance Res Inst, Seoul 150606, South Korea.",limtaejun@gmail.com,,,,,,,25,1,1,0,3,HITOTSUBASHI UNIV,TOKYO,"HITOTSUBASHI ACADEMY KUNITACHI, TOKYO, JAPAN",0018-280X,,,HITOTSUB J ECON,Hitotsubashi J.

We use wavelet coherence and phase difference methodology as a very suitable tool that observes simultaneously the strength of business cycles' co-movement in the aspect of time as well as in the aspect of frequency. The results indicate that the business cycles of CEECs are generally synchronised with the EU-15 business cycles, whereas distinct differences existed before, during, and after the financial crisis (2008-2009) and during the European sovereign debt crisis (2010-2011). In other words, we demonstrate that very strong business cycles synchronisation occurred in almost all CEECs during crisis periods and at higher wavelet scales, while only moderate synchronisation is recorded in relatively tranquil periods at higher frequencies. The results suggest that smaller CEECs, but also larger countries such as the Czech Republic, Hungary, and to some extent Slovakia as well have a higher level of business cycles synchronisation with the EU-15, particularly in the crisis period at short-run as well as at long-run fluctuations. However, we do not find strong business cycles co-movement in cases of Poland and Latvia via HP and BP filters at higher frequencies during the crisis, which might indicate a higher resistance of these countries to external systemic shocks.","[Njegic, Jovan; Zivkov, Dejan; Damnjanovic, Jelena] Univ Novi Sad, Novi Sad Sch Business, Novi Sad, Serbia",University of Novi Sad,"Zivkov, D (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Novi Sad Sch Business, Novi Sad, Serbia.",jovan.nj@gmail.com; dejanzivkov@gmail.com; jdamnjanovic5@gmail.com,"Njegic, Jovan/K-9087-2019",,,,,,44,9,9,0,8,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

A logistic regression provides evidence that probability of top management turnover is significantly correlated with the company's size (positive correlation) and the ownership concentration (negative correlation). The influence of the company's financial performance, applied bankruptcy proceedings and debt monitoring of top management turnover was deemed to be statistically insignificant (at 5% and 10% significance level).

The indicator provides a useful complement to traditional economic indicators that are frequently used to compare countries, such as gross domestic product (GDP) in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms. Our indicator may be seen as representing the influence of social wealth on economic behavior-that is, of effects left out of a standard economic analysis. We use a theoretical approach to integrate the expectations measure with the International Comparison Program's (ICP) PPP GDP statistics which produces a measure we term effective GDP. Compared to the ICP's PPP figures, the measure of effective GDP differs from the ICP's PPP estimates by as much as four to five percent in the positive direction for apparently optimistic countries and as much as two percent downwards for pessimists.","[Rehman, Fahd] Lahore Univ Management Sci, Suleman Dawood Sch Business, Lahore, Pakistan; [Cooper, Russel J.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Business, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Lahore University of Management Sciences; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Rehman, F (通讯作者)，Lahore Univ Management Sci, Suleman Dawood Sch Business, Lahore, Pakistan.",Fahd.Rehman@lums.edu.pk,,,,,,,13,1,2,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Furthermore, we embed this analysis into a flexible AK' model. Greater present bias increases the consumption-capital ratio, decreases the steady-state growth rate, while it increases the interest rate-growth rate wedge. Dynamically, as the interest rate fluctuates over the business cycle, a greater present bias causes the consumption-output ratio to be more procyclical and volatile, thus helping to resolve the consumption-output puzzle'. In the transitional dynamics, greater present bias causes a lower steady state capital stock.

For example, Alesina and Giuliano (2014) highlight that the strength of family ties is strongly correlated with lower GDP and lower quality of institutions. However, the forces shaping family ties remain relatively unexplored in the literature. This paper proposes and tests the hypothesis that the agricultural legacy of a country matters for shaping the strength of its family ties. Using data from the World Values Survey and the European Values Study, the results show that societies with a legacy of cultivating wheat tend to have weaker family ties. Analysis at the sub-national level (US data) and the country level corroborate these findings. The estimations allow for alternative hypotheses which propose that pathogen stress and climatic variation can potentially also give rise to the formation of family ties. The results suggest that the suitability of land for wheat production is the most influential factor in explaining the variation in the strength of family ties across societies and countries.

Poor households spend relatively more on tradeable product categories and consume lower-priced varieties within categories. Changes in the relative price of tradeables and of lower-priced varieties affect the cost of living of low-income relative to high-income households. We quantify these effects following the 1994 Mexican devaluation and show that they can have large distributional consequences.

We find that the location of the presentation is at least as important for the number of academics attending a talk as the combined effect of the person presenting and the paper presented. Being a presenter in a late morning session on the second day of a conference, close to the place where coffee is served, significantly increases the size of the audience. When it comes to asking questions, location becomes less important, but smaller rooms lead to more questions being asked. Younger researchers and very senior researchers attract more questions and comments. There are also interesting gender effects. Women attend research sessions more diligently than men, but seem to ask fewer questions than men. Men are less likely to attend presentations on health, education, welfare and development economics than women. Our findings suggest that strategic scheduling of sessions could ensure better participation at conferences. Moreover, different behaviors of men and women at conferences might also contribute to the lack of women in senior scientist positions.","[Gunther, Isabel] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Grosse, Melanie; Klasen, Stephan] Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Gottingen,"Günther, I (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Dev & Cooperat NADEL, Clausiusstr 37, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",isabel.guenther@nadel.ethz.ch,,,,,,,11,4,4,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

Findings indicate that Sweden would have borne non-negligible costs from currency union membership, exemplified by around 10% lower productivity, exports, investment, and consumption, and 8% greater government expenditure and imports on a yearly basis since the introduction of the euro, leading to significant cumulative reductions in potential economic activity.

Much of the economic research in this area has sought to quantify aggregate trade costs and the potential welfare impacts of reducing such costs, including through regional integration. This is important, but we argue that more focus is needed on the 'micro' dimensions of regional integration. These centre on the trade-restricting effects of nontariff measures and regulatory policies and their political economy underpinnings. Of particular importance is research on mechanisms to support market integration initiatives that recognise the multidimensional nature of the sources of trade costs in Africa, and the associated political economy forces within and between countries and regional economic communities.","[Hoekman, Bernard] EUI, Robert Schuman Ctr Adv Studies, Florence, Italy; [Hoekman, Bernard] CEPR, Florence, Italy; [Njinkeu, Dominique] African Trade & Sustainable Dev AFTSD, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Njinkeu, Dominique] EUI, Global Governance Programme, Florence, Italy",European University Institute; European University Institute,"Hoekman, B (通讯作者)，EUI, Robert Schuman Ctr Adv Studies, Florence, Italy.;Hoekman, B (通讯作者)，CEPR, Florence, Italy.",Bernard.Hoekman@EUI.eu,,,African Economic Research Consortium,African Economic Research Consortium,"An initial draft of this paper was presented at the African Economic Research Consortium (AERC) research workshop on 'Integrating African Markets: The Way Forward', May 29-June 2, 2016 Nairobi, Kenya.

We develop a random coefficient discrete choice model with Bayesian learning process to capture consumers' learning of health information and changes in their beverage choices over time. Consumers are assumed to have initial prior beliefs ab out the health effect of different beverages and to update their beliefs using health information received from different media types. Empirical results show that consumers' perceived quality of bottled water kept increasing during our sample period, and this learning process accounted for 24.44% of the industry's revenue, which is about 4.8 billion dollars per year. Comparing the effectiveness of different media outlets, we find that the sales impact of traditional media (TV and radio) is greater than online sources.

This paper exploits exogenous variation in program participation and panel data from Kenya to compare the causal impacts of a cash transfer program (HSNP) and an index-based insurance product (IBLI), which were implemented contemporaneously among the same population. We find that both programs benefit clients. HSNP improves child health, as measured by mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), and helps households maintain their mobility dependent livestock production strategies. Households with IBLI coverage make productivity increasing investments, reduce distress sales of livestock during droughts, and see a marked increase in income per adult equivalent. Estimating the impacts per total program costs reveals that the two programs perform comparably on average, while IBLI's impacts per unit marginal cost are considerably larger than HSNP's.","[Jensen, Nathaniel D.; Mude, Andrew G.] Int Livestock Res Inst, Nairobi, Kenya; [Barrett, Christopher B.] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY USA",CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); Cornell University,"Jensen, ND (通讯作者)，Int Livestock Res Inst, Nairobi, Kenya.",N.Jensen@cgiar.org; cbb2@cornell.edu; A.MUDE@cgiar.org,"mahsum, masot/ABC-4546-2020; Barrett, Christopher B./A-9750-2009","Barrett, Christopher B./0000-0001-9139-2721; Jensen, Nathaniel/0000-0002-2946-5771","UK Department for International Development (DfID); Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; Agriculture and Rural Development Sector of the European Union through DfID [202619-101, EDH-A-00-06-0003-00]; World Bank [7156906]; CGIAR",UK Department for International Development (DfID); Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade(Australian Government); Agriculture and Rural Development Sector of the European Union through DfID; World Bank(The World Bank India); CGIAR(CGIAR),"The survey data described in this research were collected by a collaborative project of the International Livestock Research Institute, Cornell University, the BASIS Research Program at the University of California at Davis, and Syracuse University.

This paper confronts these economists insofar as they trace the socialized view to Smith's theory of sympathy in The Theory of Moral Sentiments (TMS). TMS rather advances a view that anticipates rational choice theory. These economists misinterpret TMS because they fail to realize that Smith's sympathy actually involves two functions of sympathy: one that determines the optimal decision and another that determines the command of that decision. The dual function of sympathy parallels the two senses of rational choice: rationality as making the optimal decision and rationality as commanding that decision. Thus Smith's sympathy does not support the socialized view of man. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The relative wage and number of domestic varieties are endogenously determined. We show that even unilateral trade liberalization can raise the balanced growth rate. Although growth-enhancing trade liberalization is always welfare-enhancing in the symmetric country case, it does not generally ensure higher long-run welfare for at most one country because of asymmetric real wage effects caused by a change in the relative number of varieties.

At any given trial, the decision maker deliberately randomizes over mental categories and chooses the best item according to her utility function Within the realized consideration set formed by the intersection of the mental category and the menu of alternatives. If no alternative is present both within the considered mental category and within the menu the decision maker picks the default option. We provide the necessary and sufficient conditions that characterize this model in a complete stochastic choice dataset in the form of an acyclicity restriction on a stochastic choice revealed preference and other regularity conditions. We recover the utility function uniquely up to a monotone transformation and the probability distribution over mental categories uniquely.

We build and solve a dynamic model of sequential double auctions in which traders trade strategically with demand schedules. Trading needs are generated by time-varying private information about the asset value and private values for owning the asset, as well as quadratic inventory costs. We characterize a linear equilibrium with stationary strategies and its efficiency properties in closed form. Frequent trading (more double auctions per unit of time) allows more immediate asset reallocation after new information arrives, at the cost of a lower volume of beneficial trades in each double auction. Under stated conditions, the trading frequency that maximizes allocative efficiency coincides with the information arrival frequency for scheduled information releases, but can far exceed the information arrival frequency if new information arrives stochastically. A simple calibration of the model suggests that a moderate market slowdown to the level of seconds or minutes per double auction can improve allocative efficiency for assets with relatively narrow investor participation and relatively infrequent news, such as small- and micro-cap stocks.","[Du, Songzi] Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC, Canada; [Zhu, Haoxiang] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Zhu, Haoxiang] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Zhu, Haoxiang] CFTC, Washington, DC USA",Simon Fraser University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research,"Du, SZ (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC, Canada.",,,,,,,,23,43,52,1,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

We evaluate two concepts that may affect usage of a product: screening (related to valuation of a product) and sunk cost effects (based on the price the potential user paid for the product). A standard Tobit and IV-Tobit methods of estimations are used for testing sunk cost and screening effects, respectively. Results based on the baseline survey and follow up data shows that there is no difference in the length of waiting time to start using the energy efficient technology between those who got the stove for free and those that paid money for it; in other words, the sunk cost effect is absent. However, we find a difference in the waiting time between those with high valuation for the stove and those with lower valuation for it; in other words, we find an evidence of the screening effect.

The proposed model evaluates the minimum level of recovery investments required to restore production levels so that total economic impacts are acceptable over a stipulated post-disruption duration. It is assumed that disruptions are uncertain and can occur at different sectors and possibly simultaneously. The optimization model is then solved using a cutting plane method which involves computing a small sequence of mixed integer programming problems of moderate dimensions. A case study using China 2012 Input-Output data is performed, and we demonstrate the model's ability to uncover critical inter-sectoral dependencies at different disruption levels.

Less productive firms are more likely to exit and release their former resources to the remaining, more productive firms. The present study investigates two recessions in Korea: the Asian financial crisis and the global financial crisis. The main objective of the present study is to analyse the process of creative destruction in a recession, specifically the cleansing effect. We measured total factor productivity using micro-level manufacturing plant data from 1993 to 2013. We decomposed the source of the changes in total factor productivity to measure the cleansing effect in two large recessions. During the first recession in the 1990s, there was no evidence to support a cleansing effect hypothesis. In contrast, during the second recession in the 2000s, there was evidence of a cleansing effect. In addition, we found differences in market selection criteria in the two recessions; by the second crisis, the market selection criteria had changed to enable a more conducive environment for the creative destruction process.","[Lee, Hun Jun; Lee, Jeong-Dong] Seoul Natl Univ, 1 Gwanak Ro,37-312, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Baek, Chulwoo] Duksung Womens Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Duksung Women's University,"Lee, HJ (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, 1 Gwanak Ro,37-312, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",hunjunlee@snu.ac.kr,,,,,,,35,3,3,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

We exploit exogenous variation in players' exposure to air pollution due to match scheduling rules that are beyond the control of teams and players. The results of our analysis reveal statistically significant negative effects of air pollution on players' productivity, measured by the total number of passes per match. Allowing for a non-linear dose-response relationship further reveals that our findings are not driven by extreme levels of air pollution. Rather, negative effects already emerge at moderate levels.

Households face unemployment risks, but their members adjust their labour supplies to insure against unemployment. We use the model to explain the cyclical properties of aggregate employment and participation. As in the U.S. data, the model predicts that the participation rate (the fraction of individuals that want jobs) is not strongly correlated with aggregate economic activity. This property is in sharp contrast to the strongly procyclical participation predicted by both neoclassical models and models with search frictions, when we assume bachelor households or households with infinitely many members (complete markets). In the two-member household model and in the data, primary earners are always in the labour force, secondary earners have a mildly countercyclical participation rate, and a mildly procyclical employment rate. Their behaviour insures the household against unemployment risks.","[Mankart, Jochen] Deutsch Bundesbank, Res Ctr, Frankfurt, Germany; [Oikonomou, Rigas] UC Louvain, Dept Econ, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",Deutsche Bank; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Mankart, J (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank, Res Ctr, Frankfurt, Germany.",,,,,,,,76,13,20,0,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

We consider six categories of factors (supply, demand, financial market, commodities market, speculative, and geopolitical) and test their significance in the context of estimating various forecasting models. We find that the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression method provides significant improvements in the forecasting accuracy of prices compared to alternative benchmarks. Relative to the no-change and futures-based models, LASSO forecasts at the 8-step ahead horizon yield significant reductions in Mean Squared Prediction Error (MSPE), with MSPE ratios of 0.873 and 0.898, respectively. We also document substantial improvements in forecasting performance of the factor-based model that employs only a subset of variables chosen by LASSO. Finally, the time-varying nature of the relationship between factors and oil prices is used to explain recent movements in crude oil prices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We analyse economic costs and impacts of a negative oil price shock following the 2014-2015 decrease in oil prices on the provincial economy of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. We use a Dynamic Computable General Equilibrium model to estimate a drop in oil prices by inputting the estimated effect as a direct impact to royalties, which are the land input in the oil and gas sector of the provincial economy. We provide sensitivity to account for the duration and magnitude of the shock, as well as the timing of recovery. Our results suggest that a shock in the price of oil will have its most significant impact on GDP in the initial years. Over the first five years, the reduction in GDP due to this shock would be roughly 2.1% of GDP in our most realistic shock scenario, but could be much higher in other scenarios considered. A sharp drop in GDP over the first five years will be mitigated somewhat in the long run as the growth in oil prices rises; however, negative long run impacts to GDP persist due to the oil price shock in 2014-2015, and will worsen if there is a prolonged shock.

We introduce two new axioms, Strict Suppes-Sen Proofness and Restricted Equity. Strict Suppes-Sen Proofness, which is analogous to Mariotti's (1999) Suppes-Sen Proofness, represents impartiality in the use of the strong Pareto optimality. Restricted Equity represents the ethical notion that the more equitable distribution of utility gains relative to the disagreement point should be preferred if the total gain is fixed.

In each one of multiple rounds, subjects are shown two cue values, Cue A and Cue B, and asked to predict the value of a third variable X, which is a noisy function of the two cue values. The subjects' aim is to predict the value of X as accurately as possible. Our metric of performance is the absolute error, i.e., the absolute distance between the actual and predicted values of X. We implement four treatments which are based on two different payment schemes: (1) piece rates, where subjects are paid linearly on the basis of their own absolute errors and (2) a two-person winner-take-all-tournament, where subjects are paired and the one with a smaller absolute error earns a fixed payoff, while the other earns nothing. We find that it is only in the tournament payment scheme, and particularly in a more complex version of the task, that subjects show significant evidence of learning over time, in that their predictions get closer to the actual value of X. This learning process is driven by the all-or-nothing nature of the payoff structure in tournaments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Conversely, residential electricity demand peaks in the evening, when production from solar sources is impossible. Based on a randomized control trial, we assess the effectiveness of alternative demand response measures aimed at mitigating these imbalances. More precisely, through information feedback and financial rewards, we encourage households to shift electricity consumption toward the middle of the day. Using a difference in-differences approach, we find that financial incentives induce a significant increase of the relative consumption during the period of the day when most solar radiation takes place.

In this study, we assess the debt tax benefits of Spanish listed firms throughout the period 2007-2013. Specifically, using a simulation approach, we found the capitalized value of gross interest deductions amounts to approximately 6.4% of firms market value, while the net debt benefit (of personal taxes) is estimated at 2.1%, in contrast to the traditional 11.4% (i.e. marginal tax rate times debt). Conversely, the panel data regression approach reveals a 13.6% (34.2%) debt tax shield in terms of firm (debt) value. This evidence supports the view that taxes influence corporate decision-making and that debt makes a reasonable contribution to firm value.","[Clemente-Almendros, Jose A.] Univ Politecn Valencia, Valencia, Spain; [Sogorb-Mira, Francisco] Univ CEU Cardenal Herrera, Valencia, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; Universidad CEU Cardenal Herrera,"Clemente-Almendros, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Valencia, Valencia, Spain.",,"Clemente-Almendros, José Antonio/E-6403-2019; Sogorb Mira, Francisco/F-1604-2017","Clemente-Almendros, José Antonio/0000-0002-8934-471X; Sogorb Mira, Francisco/0000-0002-8467-9270",Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2015-67035-P],Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness,"Francisco Sogorb-Mira acknowledges financial support from Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness research grant ECO2015-67035-P.

Agents face peer effects with distance-one neighbors, and strategic substitution with distance-two neighbors (local congestion). For this class of games, we show that an interior equilibrium exists both in the high and in the low regions of the largest eigenvalue, but may not exist in the intermediate region. In the low region, equilibrium is proportional to a weighted version of Bonacich centrality, where weights are themselves centrality measures for the network. Local congestion has the effect of decreasing equilibrium behavior, potentially affecting the ranking of equilibrium actions. When strategic interaction extends beyond distance-two, equilibrium is characterized by a nested Bonacich centrality measure, and existence properties depend on the sign of strategic interaction at the furthest distance. We support the assumption of local congestion by presenting empirical evidence from a secondary school Dutch dataset. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We develop a theory-based measure of occupational similarity between industries and show how geographic proximity to industries using similar occupations raises the ability of an industry to respond to aggregate shocks. Using data on the employment growth of region-industry pairs in the U.S., we confirm empirically that an industry's employment responds more to nationwide changes in regions where industries have access to a relatively large pool of the occupations they need. Imputing U.S. data to our model, we show that the short-run gains from trade resulting from terms of trade movements are significantly lower than in a model where workers move freely between occupations and regions. We also find that the sensitivity of employment to economic shocks differs widely across U.S. industries, from a low sensitivity in agriculture to a high sensitivity in wholesale trade.

The insiders can use communication, peer monitoring and sanctions to coordinate their decisions. In addition, they can sanction any outsiders they observe. We vary the insiders' ability to observe and sanction the outsiders from no observability to partial and full observability. We find a striking non-monotonicity between observability of the outsiders and levels of poaching. Poaching was higher under partial monitoring than zero monitoring, and was lower and more stable under full monitoring. Although full observability allowed the insiders to better coordinate their own harvests, they were unable to fully deter poaching because their sanctions were far too low and they were unwilling to punish low levels of poaching.

For example, the label of a government transfer can induce individuals to make expenditure decisions that are skewed towards the label. In this paper, I show that child benefits are disproportionately used for savings assignable to children. I exploit a policy reform in a difference-in-differences approach to estimate the effect of child benefits on savings. The results suggest a significant positive effect on long-term savings and weak evidence for effects on child-assignable consumption. I conclude that labeling effects should be considered carefully by policy makers, if not for nudging individuals, then to avoid affecting decisions unintentionally.","[Hener, Timo] Ifo Inst, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany",Ifo Institut,"Hener, T (通讯作者)，Ifo Inst, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany.",hener@ifo.de,,"Hener, Timo/0000-0002-9424-7893",,,,,24,5,7,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

It has a negative impact in India, where the bride's side has to pay substantial dowries to the groom's side at marriage, but a positive impact in Korea, where, as in China, the groom's side has to bear a disproportionate share of marriage-related expenses including purchasing a house or condominium for the newlywed couple.","[Horioka, Charles Yuji] Asian Growth Res Inst, Kokurakita Ku, 11-4 Ohtemachi, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 8130814, Japan; [Horioka, Charles Yuji] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Horioka, Charles Yuji] Osaka Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res, Osaka, Japan; [Terada-Hagiwara, Akiko] Asian Dev Bank, Econ Res & Reg Cooperat Dept, 6 ADB Ave, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila, Philippines",National Bureau of Economic Research; Osaka University; Asian Development Bank,"Terada-Hagiwara, A (通讯作者)，Asian Dev Bank, Econ Res & Reg Cooperat Dept, 6 ADB Ave, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila, Philippines.",ahagiwara@adb.org,"Horioka, Charles Yuji/AFE-9181-2022",,"JSPS KAKENHI Grant [15H01950]; Asian Growth Research Institute; Joint Usage/Research Center at the Institute of Social and Economic Research, Osaka University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H01950] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI Grant(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Asian Growth Research Institute; Joint Usage/Research Center at the Institute of Social and Economic Research, Osaka University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors would like to thank Jiro Akita, Chetan Ghate, Pedro Gomis-Porqueras, Shikha Jha, Shoshana Grossbard, Tatsuo Hatta, Aziz Hayat, Yoshihiko Kadoya, Takamitsu Kurita, Jaewoo Lee, Seunghwan Leem, Debdulal Mallick, Keunkwan Ryu, Kwanho Shin, Xueli Tang, Hideki Toya, Shinsuke Uchida, Midori Wakabayashi, Junmin Wan, Shang-Jin Wei, Tansel Yilmazer, seminar participants at the Asian Growth Research Institute, Deakin University, Fukuoka University, the International Monetary Fund/Bank of Korea Conference on Asia: Challenges of Stability and Growth, Korea University, Nagoya City University, Seoul National University, Tohoku University, and the University of the Philippines, Diliman, two anonymous referees, and especially Yoko Niimi for their very helpful comments, Elenita Pura and Shiela Camingue-Romance for superb research assistance, and JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 15H01950, the Asian Growth Research Institute, and the Joint Usage/Research Center at the Institute of Social and Economic Research, Osaka University, for their financial support.

First, we build a simple theoretical model to predict the overall beneficial effects of FDI, and also find that a stronger sense of environmental citizenship by the FDI firm is associated with lower pollution and lower emission intensity in the host region. For empirical analysis, we use Spatial Durbin Model (SDM) to address the regional spillovers of FDI and pollution in China, and confirm the beneficial impacts of FDI both environmentally and economically. We also find that FDI from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan (HMT) that is assumed to exhibit a stronger sense of environmental citizenship due to its closer ties with mainland China, significantly improves the host region's environmental outcome but has no measurable effects on its economic growth; in contrast, FDI from other origins significantly promotes the economic growth of the host economy although it has no measurable impacts on the environmental outcome.

In this article, we construct a general model of a card platform that unifies the literature on interchange fees. We enrich the existing frameworks by analyzing the choice of the interchange fee when consumer demand is elastic to retail prices. We show that the difference between the privately set structure of payment card fees and the socially optimal one depends both on banks' and merchants' pass-through of their costs to consumers. We argue that the maturity of the payment card market impacts the redistributive effects of interchange fees (i.e. between consumers and merchants, card and cash users) and therefore, their optimal regulation.","[Verdier, Marianne] Univ Paris II Pantheon Assas, CRED TEPP, Paris, France; [Verdier, Marianne] PSL Res Univ, MINES ParisTech, CERNA Ctr Ind Econ, I3,CNRS, Paris, France; [Mariotto, Carlotta] European Commiss DG COMP, Chief Economist Team, B-1210 Sint Joost Ten Noode, Belgium",Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas; Universite PSL; MINES ParisTech; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Verdier, M (通讯作者)，Univ Paris II Pantheon Assas, CRED TEPP, Paris, France.;Verdier, M (通讯作者)，PSL Res Univ, MINES ParisTech, CERNA Ctr Ind Econ, I3,CNRS, Paris, France.",marianne.verdier@u-paris2.fr,"Verdier, Marianne/HGB-7785-2022","Verdier, Marianne/0000-0002-9974-0708",,,,,38,5,5,0,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

The purpose of this paper is to show the potentialities of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in investigating whether healthcare providers belonging to the same jurisdiction show similarities in their health care expenditure determinants. Similarities are reproduced in terms of fuzzy dependencies between health budgetary data of the healthcare providers belonging to five Italian regions. The analysis carried out sees the application of Auto Contractive Maps (AutoCM) model. The methodology is effective in illustrating regional patterns of expenditure and similarities across Local Health Units (Aziende Sanitarie Locali-ASLs).

Our approach introduces a new dimension to the interaction between markets and social norms beyond the interplay of monetary and non-monetary incentives: the innovation of material goods as a catalyst of norm evolution. We analyze how the dissemination of a social norm may be affected by product innovation, which adds to the variation of products with respect to their level of norm compliance. The market is linked to the process of norm adoption via psychological forces, endogenizing the rates of adoption and abandonment. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for a) a positive impact of the innovation on the level of norm adoption and b) for multiplicity of norm equilibria.

Results show that English-language proficiency, education qualifications and work experience are important positive determinants of both individual wage and of the likelihood of having a paid job. By comparison to many previous studies that find either a negative or no wage gap for migrants, we find that male migrants from OECD and English-speaking countries earn a higher hourly wage than male native-born Australians and female migrants from these countries earn a similar wage as female native-born Australians. Without controlling for the education level, migrants from non-OECD and non-English speaking countries earn a similar wage compared to native born Australians. Controlling for their education level, migrants from non-OECD and non-English speaking countries earn less than native-born Australian workers, but this wage gap diminishes with their length of residency in Australia. We also find that there is no difference between male migrants and male nativeborn Australians in terms of the likelihood of being employed, but we do find that female migrants are more likely to be unemployed compared to female native-born Australians.

The key feature of China's engagement with CESEE is the devising of an experimental and innovative approach, demonstrated in the establishment of an institutional mechanism for cooperation with a particular group of 16 CESEE countries (16+1). The case of China-CESEE relations offers an insight into how, in the era of the BRI, China is complementing its economic approach with institution-building and policy coordination.

Despite the policy relevance and plausible mechanisms through which child disability and severe early life health conditions can impact subsequent maternal reproductive behavior, there has been limited investigation of this question particularly in the US. Child disability or severe early life health problems such as very preterm birth (VPTB) and very low birth weight (VLBW) can constrain household resources to have another child but may also increase parental demand for healthy children and modify allocation of resources between children. Empirical assessment of this question is complicated by unobservables such as maternal health and preferences. We examine whether giving birth to a child with disabilities or severe adverse birth outcomes including VPTB and VLBW impacts subsequent maternal fertility. We employ a mother fixed-effect duration model for maternal fertility over time as a function of the proportion of previously born children with disabilities/health conditions in order to account for time-invariant unobservables, using merged data from the 1993 National Health Interview Survey and 1995 National Survey of Family Growth. We find no evidence that having disabled children reduces subsequent live births when using the mother fixed-effect model, in contrast to the classical model using within and between mother variation which suggests a fertility decline. Similarly, we find no evidence that having VPTB or VLBW children reduces fertility. Overall, our findings indicate no impact of child disability or health conditions on subsequent maternal fertility. Additional analyses excluding women who may qualify for AFDC show overall a similar pattern of results, suggesting that the findings may be generalizable post the AFDC. Time-varying unobservables may still be at work, but they likely result in an opposite (negative) bias toward reduction in fertility.","[Wehby, George L.; Hockenberry, Jason M.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Wehby, George L.] Univ Iowa, Dept Hlth Management & Policy, 145 N Riverside Dr,100 Coll Publ Hlth Bldg, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Wehby, George L.] Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Hockenberry, Jason M.] Emory Univ, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Iowa; University of Iowa; Emory University; Rollins School Public Health,"Wehby, GL (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Wehby, GL (通讯作者)，Univ Iowa, Dept Hlth Management & Policy, 145 N Riverside Dr,100 Coll Publ Hlth Bldg, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.;Wehby, GL (通讯作者)，Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",george-wehby@uiowa.edu; jason.hockenberry@emory.edu,,,,,,,37,4,4,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

This paper revisits this problem considering that the two vote share maximizing candidates are differentiated. That is, candidates strategically decide positions only in some of the n dimensions while in the rest of them their positions are assumed to be fixed. These fixed dimensions may be viewed as candidates' immutable characteristics (race, religion, culture, etc.). We find that for any distribution of voters' bliss points, a unique Nash equilibrium in pure strategies is guaranteed to exist if candidates are sufficiently differentiated -if in the fixed dimensions their positions are sufficiently different. This is true even if there exists a unique fixed dimension and candidates are flexible in all other n - 1 dimensions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

High job destruction characterized the economic environment. JCSs were heavily used in order to cushion this development. Using data from 1990-1999 and building upon the timing-of-events approach, we estimate multivariate discrete time duration models taking selection based on both observed and unobserved heterogeneity into account. Our results indicate that after initial negative effects during the typical program duration of twelve months, probably driven by reduced job search effort during participation resulting in a rearrangement of the job queue, the impact on the job finding probability becomes insignificantly positive. Additional results, however, suggest that female and highly skilled participants leave unemployment quicker than other groups, which results in highly skilled women benefiting from participation. In general, we find no significant impact on post-unemployment employment stability. Our results are robust to allowing for random treatment effects. Also taking into account endogenous participation in training programs, endogenous censoring, or multiple treatment effects do not change the results.","[Bergemann, Annette] Univ Bristol, IFAU, IZA, Bristol, Avon, England; [Pohlan, Laura] Univ Mannheim, ZEW, Mannheim, Germany; [Uhlendorff, Arne] Unversite Paris Saclay, CNRS, CREST, LAB,IZA,DIW, Paris, France; [Bergemann, Annette] Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, Priory Rd, Bristol, Avon, England; [Pohlan, Laura] Dept Labour Markets, Ctr European Econ Res, Human Resources & Social Policy, L7,1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany; [Uhlendorff, Arne] CREST, 15 Blvd Gabriel Peri, F-92245 Malakoff, France",University of Bristol; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); University of Mannheim; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Bristol; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Bergemann, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, IFAU, IZA, Bristol, Avon, England.;Bergemann, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, Priory Rd, Bristol, Avon, England.",annette.bergemann@bristol.ac.uk; pohlan@zew.de; arne.uhlendorff@ensae.fr,"Uhlendorff, Arne/AAS-6187-2020","Pohlan, Laura/0000-0001-8143-764X; Uhlendorff, Arne/0000-0002-2823-4445",,,,,72,2,2,0,7,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5371,1879-1034,,LABOUR ECON,Labour Econ.,AUG,2017,47.0,,,,SI,,182,201,,10.1016/j.labeco.2017.05.007,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FI3HU,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000411849400013,0

This paper evaluates the effect of demographic changes between 2010 and 2030 on labor force participation and government budgets in the EU-27. Our analysis involves the incorporation of population projections, and an explicit modeling of the supply and demand side of the labor market. Our approach overcomes key shortcomings of most existing studies that focus only on labor supply when assessing the effects of policy reforms. Ignoring wage reactions greatly understates the increase in fiscal revenues, suggesting that fiscal strain from demographic change might be less severe than currently perceived. Beyond, our micro-based approach captures the impact on fiscal revenues more accurately than previous studies. Finally, as a policy response to demographic change and worsening fiscal budgets, we simulate the increase in the statutory retirement age. Our policy simulations confirm that raising the statutory retirement age can balance fiscal budgets in the long run.","[Dolls, Mathias] ZEW, Mannheim, Germany; [Doorley, Karina] ESRI, Dublin, Ireland; [Paulus, Alari] Univ Essex, ISER, Colchester, Essex, England; [Schneider, Hilmar; Sommer, Eric] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Siegloch, Sebastian] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); University of Essex; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Mannheim,"Sommer, E (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.",dolls@zew.de; Karina.Doorley@esri.ie; apaulus@essex.ac.uk; schneider@iza.org; siegloch@uni-mannheim.de; sommer@iza.org,"Paulus, Alari/AAC-2678-2020","Paulus, Alari/0000-0001-7921-0462; Doorley, Karina/0000-0002-6535-0648",EU FP7 project NEUJOBS [266833]; European Commission [VS/2011/0445]; Eurostat [EU-SILC/2011/55]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L009153/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/L009153/1] Funding Source: UKRI,EU FP7 project NEUJOBS(European Union (EU)); European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Eurostat; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We thank Alfons Weichenrieder and one anonymous referee, as well as seminar and conference participants in Segovia (APPAM International Conference), Esch-sur-Alzette (IMA Congress) and Lake Tahoe (IIPF Congress) for valuable comments and suggestions.

We describe such robust (to spurious correlation) relationship with the quantile cointegrating regression approach. Such approach handles extreme quantiles/CDS values and their behavior with respect to the equity market's influence. Heteroskedastic patterns such as time-varying variance, but also autocorrelation, skewness and leptokurtosis are captured. Thus, the sensitivity of aggregate CDS spreads to equity market price and volatility channels is accurately measured across quantiles and spreads. Such quantile-dependent sensitivity exhibits asymmetric responses to equity market shocks. A sub-period analysis investigates potential regime shifts in estimated quantile cointegrating regressions. Quantile cointegrating coefficients vary over time and quantiles, and exhibit different magnitudes across sub-periods and spreads. Therefore, the relationship is unstable over time. We also propose a scenario analysis and risk signaling application for credit risk management prospects. Under specific risk levels, credit risky situations are described conditional on the equity market's information over time, and related expected aggregate CDS spreads are computed. Estimated conditional quantiles/CDS spreads act as credit alert triggers.","[Gatfaoui, Hayette] IESEG Sch Management, LEM CNRS 9221, Finance Audit & Control Dept, 1 Parvis Def, F-92044 Paris, France; [Gatfaoui, Hayette] Univ Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne, CES, Paris, France",IESEG School of Management,"Gatfaoui, H (通讯作者)，IESEG Sch Management, LEM CNRS 9221, Finance Audit & Control Dept, 1 Parvis Def, F-92044 Paris, France.;Gatfaoui, H (通讯作者)，Univ Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne, CES, Paris, France.",h.gatfaoui@ieseg.fr,"Gatfaoui, Hayette/P-8744-2014","Gatfaoui, Hayette/0000-0001-7491-6650","European Union's Seventh Framework Program for research, technological development and demonstration [320270]; PRES heSam [ANR-10-LABX-0095]","European Union's Seventh Framework Program for research, technological development and demonstration(European Union (EU)); PRES heSam","This project has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Program for research, technological development and demonstration under grant agreement no. 320270.

This inefficiency translates into a higher rate of emissions relative to output. In this paper we focus on Italian power installations between 2005 and 2014. Using panel econometrics, we show that a 10% increase in photovoltaics and wind infeed has reduced yearly CO2 emissions of the average thermal installation by about 2% while the average plants emissions relative to its output have increased by about 0.3%.

While a standard approach relies on the parametric estimation of labour elasticity coefficients, we employ a novel approach based on structural decomposition analysis. This allows us to identify several determinants which mitigate the effects of economic growth on employment. We decompose the overall change in employment into the contribution of six factors: changes in labour productivity, changes in the import of intermediate products, changes in the structure of production, changes in the final demand structure by industries and by sectors, and a change in final demand volume. We show that besides the generally accepted influence of labour productivity growth on employment, other factors such as structural changes and changes in final demand played an important role in employment changes. These results shed some light on low labour elasticity in V4 countries and go beyond the simple labour productivity growth argument.","[Hudcovsky, Martin; Labaj, Martin; Morvay, Karol] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dept Econ Policy, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Hudcovsky, Martin; Labaj, Martin; Morvay, Karol] Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Econ Res, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava; Slovak Academy of Sciences,"Hudcovsky, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dept Econ Policy, Bratislava, Slovakia.;Hudcovsky, M (通讯作者)，Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Econ Res, Bratislava, Slovakia.",martin.hudcovsky@euba.sk; martin.labaj@euba.sk; karol.morvay@euba.sk,"Lábaj, Martin/ADP-5704-2022","Lábaj, Martin/0000-0003-0000-8048; Morvay, Karol/0000-0001-5790-9694",,,,,17,9,9,2,9,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Our hypothesis is that institutions and policies of economic freedom may have different effects on long-run income and growth, both in terms of their size and working mechanisms. To test our hypothesis, we apply both Acemoglu et al.'s (Am Econ Rev 91(5): 1369-401, 2001) and Mankiw et al.'s (Q J Econ 107(2): 407-437, 1992) modeling strategies in our cross-country regression analyses. The major finding is that the institutions of economic freedom are of primary importance in economic development: they matter both in the long run and during the catching up period, and have both direct and indirect effects. On the other hand, the effects of economic freedom policies (monetary and fiscal) matter only during the catching up period, with the fiscal policy having a more straightforward effect. Furthermore, the estimates from the two modeling strategies are in line with each other, which can be seen as a further corroboration of our results.","[Kapas, Judit; Czegledi, Pal] Univ Debrecen, Inst Econ, Fac Econ & Business, 138 Boszormenyi St, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary",University of Debrecen,"Kapás, J (通讯作者)，Univ Debrecen, Inst Econ, Fac Econ & Business, 138 Boszormenyi St, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary.",judit.kapas@econ.unideb.hu; pal.czegledi@econ.unideb.hu,"Czeglédi, Pál/JXW-6671-2024","Czeglédi, Pál/0000-0001-6666-0923; Kapas, Judit/0000-0002-0694-3101",,,,,76,2,2,1,13,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

Following the permanent income hypothesis, these drops can be rationalized by the idea that consumers have pessimistic views about their long run income. Using a standard signal-extraction model, we show that this pessimism can be due either to a persistent fall of aggregate productivity before and during the recession (signaling a future decline of income), or to other negative information unrelated to contemporaneous fundamentals, which we label bad news. We classify U.S. recessions (from 1919 to 2015) according to a (bad) news index reflecting this negative information. We find that both the Great Depression and the Great Recession score highest in this index. The index is such that we can rule out that this is due merely to the length or the depth of these recessions.

Setting rational targets is thus, a key aspect of successful implementation of the scheme.

Indeed, in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the majority of the population resides in rural areas and the majority of farmers (up to 80%) are smallholders. However, productivity of these smallholder farmers is low compared to other developing regions, and this has perpetuated poverty in rural Africa. Agriculture has the greatest potential to reduce poverty in rural Africa. This special issue looks at efforts to transform agriculture in rural SSA to not only raise incomes of farmers, but to also foster broader structural transformation of African economies. The focus is on what needs to be done from a policy and practical point of view to kick-start, and in some cases, entrench structural transformation of the agricultural sector, taking cognizance of the need to transform across the value chain. Commitment by African governments, through initiatives such as the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme, is a starting point. Over and above this, there is need to better understand why smallholder farmers are reluctant to invest in modern agricultural technologies, including use of modern seeds and fertilisers. Further, there are several constraints to be overcome for structural transformation of African agriculture to be a reality. These include: investing in development and diffusion of new and appropriate agricultural technologies; investing in infrastructure, including irrigation; addressing post-harvest challenges that small holder farmers face, etc. To better entrench the impacts, structural transformation in agriculture should happen concurrently with structural transformation of the rest of the economy, thus allowing for better allocation of scarce resources throughout the economy.","[Senbet, Lemma W.; Simbanegavi, Witness] African Econ Res Consortium, Nairobi, Kenya",African Economic Research Consortium (AERC),"Simbanegavi, W (通讯作者)，African Econ Res Consortium, Nairobi, Kenya.",Witness.Simbanegavi@aercafrica.org,,"Simbanegavi, Witness/0000-0003-3109-9528","Economic and Social Research Council [ES/N013344/1, ES/N013344/2] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/N013344/2, ES/N013344/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,12,11,12,2,42,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Using monthly data covering the period January 1999 to November 2016, we find strong evidence supporting non-linear reactions of the Islamic investment rates to conventional rates in the long run and/or short-run for all matched maturities. More precisely, the Islamic investment rates exhibit faster upward movement (slower downward movement) in responses to conventional deposit rate increases (decreases). The asymmetric pricing behaviour of Islamic banks however tends to weaken as maturity lengthens. Accordingly, we infer that Islamic banks do not rigidly peg their investment deposit rates to conventional deposit rates as some have claimed in questioning the Islamicity of Islamic banks.","[Sukmana, Raditya] Univ Airlangga, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Islamic Econ, Surabaya, Indonesia; [Ibrahim, Mansor H.] Int Ctr Educ Islamic Finance INCEIF, Sch Grad Studies, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Airlangga University; INCEIF,"Ibrahim, MH (通讯作者)，Int Ctr Educ Islamic Finance INCEIF, Sch Grad Studies, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",momyadit@gmail.com; mansorhi@hotmail.com,"Ibrahim, Mansor/AAU-6887-2020; Sukmana, Raditya/AER-6387-2022","Ibrahim, Mansor/0000-0003-0413-0075",,,,,32,26,31,1,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

We develop a model of redesign decisions in a dynamic oligopoly model and use it to analyze redesign activity in the U.S. automobile market. We find automobile model redesigns are frequent despite an estimated average cost around $1 billion. Our estimates also suggest that redesigns lead to large increases in profits and welfare due to the strong preferences consumers have for redesigns. We show that welfare would be improved if redesign competition were reduced, allowing redesign activity to be more responsive to the planned obsolescence channel. The net effect of these changes would reduce total redesigns by roughly 10%, increasing total welfare by roughly 3%. The high valuation that consumers put on newly-designed models drives frequent redesigns and gives automobile manufacturers fairly substantial market power, with a 2-to-1 ratio of firm profits to consumer surplus.

We focus on the European experience over the crisis, comparing European households' incomes in 2007, 2012 and 2014. Throughout the period, most households earned income from more than one source, and a positive relation exists between both the capital and labour shares of incomes and total household incomes. We find that functional distribution, i.e. what kind of income a household earns, significantly affects both its position in the income distribution and its chances of mobility within it, and such impact is magnified by the crisis. However, the geography of European households' incomes is much more complex than frequently suggested. In general, the more households depend on labour incomes the more likely they were to move downwards in the income distribution.

In addition, a negative shock in China has (marginal) positive effects for net commodity importers while negative for net commodity exporters.","[Furceri, Davide; Jalles, Joao Tovar; Zdzienicka, Aleksandra] Int Monetary Fund, Fiscal Affairs Dept, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Furceri, Davide] Univ Palermo, Palermo, Italy; [Jalles, Joao Tovar] Nova Sch Business & Econ, Ctr Globalizat & Governance, Campus Campolide, P-1099032 Lisbon, Portugal; [Jalles, Joao Tovar] UECE Res Unit Complex & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal",International Monetary Fund; University of Palermo; Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Furceri, D (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Fiscal Affairs Dept, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.;Furceri, D (通讯作者)，Univ Palermo, Palermo, Italy.",dfurceri@imf.org; jjalles@imf.org; azdzienicka@imf.org,"Jalles, Joao Tovar/AAA-9923-2019","Jalles, Joao Tovar/0000-0002-7171-5076",,,,,21,6,6,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Regarding the fundamental differences in foundations of these two economic paradigms, policymakers have been forced to select and to follow one of the two seemingly competing views. However, in developing countries, due to various market and government coordination failures, complying with one of the schools has not been successful in practice. From the past, there has been some controversy between neoclassical and evolutionary schools on the subject of science, technology and innovation policy. Using a survey questionnaire and statistical analyses of the results, this paper shows that, due to the institutional setting and structural conditions in developing countries, despite the fundamentally different foundations of the competing schools of thought, the policy implications of the schools have converged. Drawing on Theme Analysis Method, the rationales are first conceptualized and then the fuzzy method is applied to reveal the respondents' tendency to the extracted rationales and implications of the two competing schools. In conclusion, the statistical results validate the proposed hypothesis.","[Ghazinoory, Sepehr; Narimani, Meysam; Tatina, Shiva] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Informat Technol, Tehran, Iran",Tarbiat Modares University,"Tatina, S (通讯作者)，Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Informat Technol, Tehran, Iran.",shiva.tatina@modares.ac.ir,"Ghazinoory, Sepehr/D-6543-2011; Ghazinoory, Sepehr/AGA-3874-2022; Ghazinoory, Sepehr/M-3915-2019","Ghazinoory, Sepehr/0000-0002-6761-4694;",,,,,51,5,7,1,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

The outcome has been a wide range of results and conclusions. The aim of this work is to provide a review of this recent research in the port industry that uses strategic interaction approaches from industrial organization and game theory. The paper concentrates on five topics: ownership, relationship between ports and their hinterlands, port authorities and port operators' relations, capacity investment decisions, and port specialization. We present the objectives, methodologies and results of the papers reviewed, with special emphasis on how models are developed. The results are not always consistent between the works analyzed. On the one hand, this could be due to the complexity of the port industry and the high number of agents that intervene. Researchers need to simplify reality to build their models by imposing restrictive assumptions. On the other hand, results could be very sensitive to the techniques used or to the differences on the port environment of the countries of study. However, some conclusions can be extracted and they present a good starting point to develop more sophisticated models. Finally, we also propose avenues for future research.","[Hidalgo-Gallego, Soraya; Nunez-Sanchez, Ramon; Coto-Millan, Pablo] Univ Cantabria, Santander, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria,"Núñez-Sánchez, R (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, Santander, Spain.",nunezr@unican.es,"Coto-Millán, Pablo/S-3272-2018; Nunez-Sanchez, Ramon/H-9973-2015","Coto-Millán, Pablo/0000-0002-6320-4647; Hidalgo-Gallego, Soraya/0000-0003-4228-4569; Nunez-Sanchez, Ramon/0000-0002-0426-9379",,,,,47,8,10,7,54,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

We find that a combination of stricter contribution limits and full transparency is most successful at limiting donors' influence on policy choice.

The present paper unravels this paradox by drawing on Niklas Luhmann's ground-breaking insight that the complexity-reducing function of social systems leads them to neglect their critical environmental dependencies, thereby compromising their own sustainability. If the firm is conceived as a social system, Luhmann's theory implies that the neglect of social behaviour by the predominant theories of the firm can be explained as reflecting the neglect of society by actual firms. This argument promises to not only furnish the theory of the firm with a concern for sustainability, but also render it more amenable to unconventional institutions, such as cooperatives and non-profit organisations, that help compensate for the damage inflicted by conventional firms on the social environment.","[Thompson, Spencer] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England; [Valentinov, Vladislav] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, Halle, Germany; [Valentinov, Vladislav] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Halle, Germany",University of Cambridge; Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO); Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Thompson, S (通讯作者)，Ctr Dev Studies, Alison Richard Bldg,7 West Rd, Cambridge CB3 9DT, England.",spencer.thompson@cantab.net,"Change, Structural/W-8306-2019; Valentinov, Vladislav/V-2932-2019; , IAMO/G-2328-2012","Change, Structural/0000-0002-2459-4646;",Volkswagen Foundation,Volkswagen Foundation(Volkswagen),"University of Cambridge (S.T.); Leibniz Institute for Agricultural Development in Transition Economies (IAMO) and Martin Luther University (V.V.), respectively.

A series of favorable polices has been adopted to support large-scale farming. Using a multivariate probit model and 2015 and 2016 rural household survey data, the present paper examines the factors that influence small farmers' decision to become large-scale farmers. The empirical regression results suggest that the decision to become a large-scale farmer is significantly influenced by household human capital, cooperative membership, marketing channels, land-transfer contracts and government policies. However, the influence of these factors differs with respect to becoming large-scale grain and non-grain farmers. These results imply that policy tools should target these factors and the appropriate group of small-scale farmers. Generally, both central and local governments should promote large-scale farming by enhancing rural households' human capital, improving marketing channels and providing agricultural social services, as well as encouraging returning migrant workers to engage in large-scale farming.","[Xia, Xing; Xin, Xian; Ma, Ling] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xia, Xing; Xin, Xian; Ma, Ling] China Agr Univ, Natl Agr & Rural Dev Res Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University; China Agricultural University,"Ma, L (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Ma, L (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Natl Agr & Rural Dev Res Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China.",summerahxx@163.com; xinxian@cau.edu.cn; xbml@cau.edu.cn,,,,,,,31,10,10,5,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JUL-AUG,2017,25.0,4,,,,,93,108,,10.1111/cwe.12208,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FC7UC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000407046800006,0

Compensation schemes can drive a wedge between how investors and traders value the asset. Limited liability makes traders value the asset more than investors. To limit losses, investors should thus restrict liquidity provision to force traders to trade at a lower price. By contrast, bonus caps make traders value the asset less than investors. This should encourage liquidity provision and increase prices. In contrast to these predictions, we find that under limited liability investors increase liquidity provision and asset price bubbles are larger. Bonus caps have no clear effect on liquidity provision and they fail to tame bubbles. Overall, giving traders skin in the game fosters financial stability.","[Baghestanian, Sascha; Gortner, Paul; Massenot, Baptiste] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Massenot, B (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.",baghestanian@econ.uni-frankfurt.de; paulgortner@gmx.de; baptistemassenot@gmail.com,,,Research Center SAFE - State of Hessen initiative for research LOEWE,Research Center SAFE - State of Hessen initiative for research LOEWE,"We gratefully acknowledge research support from the Research Center SAFE, funded by the State of Hessen initiative for research LOEWE.",,21,3,3,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

Yet, the social economy gathers very distinct organizational models which may be associated with different types and levels of social capital. Accordingly, the objective of this article is to explore whether, and if so how, the type and level of social capital differ between mutual benefit organizations - which essentially seek to meet their members' needs - and public benefit organizations - which seek to enhance the well-being of a broader community or the society as a whole. The study draws on an econometric analysis of different forms of social capital in two renewable energy cooperatives which are located in Flanders but have clearly divergent orientations toward mutual versus public benefit. The results show that, as compared with an orientation toward public benefit, an orientation toward mutual benefit is associated with lower social identification with the cooperative and weaker ties between members. Our study explores the underlying explanatory mechanisms behind these relationships. Its findings contribute to understanding the potential roles played by cooperatives in sustainability transitions.","[Bauwens, Thomas; Defourny, Jacques] Univ Liege, Liege, Belgium; [Bauwens, Thomas] Ecole Polytech Federale Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Liege,"Bauwens, T (通讯作者)，Univ Liege, Liege, Belgium.;Bauwens, T (通讯作者)，Ecole Polytech Federale Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.",Thomas.Bauwens@epfl.ch,,"Bauwens, Thomas/0000-0003-3462-4631; Nedanov, Aleksandar/0000-0002-4238-9275",,,,,94,31,33,1,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

Meanwhile, many people experience competitive contexts as stressful. We use two laboratory experiments to investigate whether factors related to stress can help explain individual differences in tournament entry. Experiment 1 studies whether stress responses (measured as salivary cortisol) to taking part in a mandatory tournament predict individual willingness to participate in a voluntary tournament. We find that competing increases stress levels. This cortisol response does not predict tournament entry for men but is positively and significantly correlated with choosing to enter the tournament for women. In Experiment 2, we exogenously induce physiological stress using the cold-pressor task. We find a positive causal effect of stress on tournament entry for women but no effect for men. Finally, we show that although the effect of stress on tournament entry differs between the genders, stress reactions cannot explain the well-documented gender difference in willingness to compete.","[Buser, Thomas] Univ Amsterdam, Sch Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Buser, Thomas] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Dreber, Anna] Stockholm Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Mollerstrom, Johanna] George Mason Univ, Res Inst Ind Econ, ICES, Dept Econ, Stockholm, Sweden",University of Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; Stockholm School of Economics; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Dreber, A (通讯作者)，Stockholm Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Stockholm, Sweden.",t.buser@uva.nl; anna.dreber@hhs.se; jmollers@gmu.com,,,Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation (Handelsbankens Forskningsstiftelser); Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO); Speerpunt Behavioural Economics of the University of Amsterdam,Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation (Handelsbankens Forskningsstiftelser); Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation(Knut & Alice Wallenberg Foundation); Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); Speerpunt Behavioural Economics of the University of Amsterdam,"We are grateful to comments from Johannes Haushofer, Magnus Johannesson, Pranjal Mehta and participants at seminars at the ASSA 2016 Meetings, the ESA North America Meetings 2014, University of Amsterdam, University of Toulouse, and the Interdisciplinary Center for Economic Science at George Mason University.

With respect to this vision, this study investigates the effects of economic growth, energy consumption, trade openness, urbanization and financial development on environmental degradation by using the Markov Switching Equilibrium Correction Model with shifts in both the intercept and income per capita slope for the period 1970-2015. Unlike existing studies and in addition to the CO2 emissions pollutant, this paper uses the total Ecological Footprint and Ecological Carbon Footprint as new proxies of environmental degradation. Empirical results show strong evidence for cointegration with Markov shifts. In particular, our results show that the non-control for breaks can hide the true relationship among variables. The results show also that when controlling for breaks the Environment Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis holds for the CO2 emissions and Ecological carbon Footprint pollutants and the U-shaped behavior holds for the total Ecological Footprint. Moreover, the results show that these two behaviors (EKC and U-shaped) are regime dependent. Regarding the other explanatory variables, the results show that trade openness and urbanization worsen Ecological Footprint. However, the electricity consumption and financial development are positively related to the Ecological Footprint and negatively related to Ecological Carbon Footprint and CO2 emissions. Finally, we found evidence for the growth hypothesis for both pollutants. Based on these results, a detailed economic, energy and environmental policy is proposed and discussed for the case of Qatar.

However, the overall effects on government fiscal balance and welfare can be ambiguous, depending on the dynamic responses of macroeconomic variables to changes in tax rates. This paper aims to provide quantitative forecasts of Japanese tax reform on welfare and fiscal balance using a small open two-sector dynamic general equilibrium model calibrated to the Japanese economy. The simulation results show that under conditions of unrestricted international borrowing and no consumption habit, a corporate income tax cut of 5% financed by an increase in consumption tax improves welfare by 0.53%. However, the positive effects of corporate income tax cuts decrease when international borrowing becomes limited or consumers show habit formation. In addition, we show that a corporate income tax cut in the tradable sector generates better welfare and fiscal consequences than a tax cut in the nontradable sector. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The present paper outlines a laboratory experiment aimed to study the groundwater extraction decisions of stakeholders under alternative subsidy structures. We propose a model and a methodology for testing the implications of the model and the modifications of energy subsidies for irrigation. We analyze the performance of two traditional policy interventions elimination and reduction of subsidy-and then analyze a novel policy: decoupling the subsidy from the electricity rate by replacing it with a lump sum transfer. Our results suggest that the rate of water extraction and the level of water in the aquifer may significantly be improved by altering the subsidy structure. An important finding for policy makers is that the decoupling leads to outcomes similar to those of eliminating the subsidy, however, with fewer political economy conflicts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This index verifies a set of reasonable axioms that other available measures do not: increases in three relevant employment deprivation elements-incidence, intensity and inequality. Incidence captures how many households in a population are touched by a lack of employment, while employment deprivation intensity reflects how far households are, on average, from being non-deprived of employment. Finally, employment deprivation inequality increases with the concentration of unemployment among few households. Based on this index, we analyze employment deprivation across the European Union using information from Labor Force Surveys during the current Great Recession. Our results provide evidence on the relevance of incorporating the household dimension to identify unemployment profiles, with a variety of implications, in terms of household wellbeing. Specifically, we show that countries with similar (intermediate) unemployment rates differ in their patterns of employment deprivation once the structure of employment across households is incorporated.","[Gradin, Carlos; del Rio, Coral] Univ Vigo, Fac CC Econ, Campus Lagoas Marcosende S-N, Vigo 36310, Galicia, Spain; [Gradin, Carlos; del Rio, Coral] EQUALITAS, Campus Lagoas Marcosende S-N, Vigo 36310, Galicia, Spain; [Canto, Olga] Univ Alcala, Fac CC Econ Empresariales & Turismo, Plaza Victoria S-N, Madrid 28802, Spain; [Canto, Olga] EQUALITAS, Plaza Victoria S-N, Madrid 28802, Spain",Universidade de Vigo; Universidad de Alcala,"Gradín, C (通讯作者)，Univ Vigo, Fac CC Econ, Campus Lagoas Marcosende S-N, Vigo 36310, Galicia, Spain.;Gradín, C (通讯作者)，EQUALITAS, Campus Lagoas Marcosende S-N, Vigo 36310, Galicia, Spain.",cgradin@uvigo.es,"del Rio, Coral/M-5560-2019; Cantó, Olga/E-7883-2016; GRADIN, CARLOS/AAH-9326-2019","del Rio, Coral/0000-0002-3173-3624; Cantó, Olga/0000-0003-0780-3212; GRADIN, CARLOS/0000-0001-7744-0707","Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [ECO2010-21668-C03-03/ECON]; Xunta de Galicia [CN2012/178, 10SEC300023PR]",Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); Xunta de Galicia(Xunta de Galicia),"We acknowledge financial support from the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (Grant ECO2010-21668-C03-03/ECON) and Xunta de Galicia (CN2012/178, and Grant 10SEC300023PR).",,47,8,8,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Using these estimated returns and historical price and weather data, we simulate the expected profitability of fertiliser application over space and time. We find that the fertiliser bundles distributed under Malawi's subsidy programme are almost always profitable for improved hybrid seeds at retail and farmer-reported maize and fertiliser prices. Our results on the profitability of fertiliser under Malawi's subsidy programme are robust to a tripling of fertiliser prices, to a 50% decrease in the maize price and to drought conditions. We also correlate the estimated expected returns to fertiliser use with geographically disaggre-gated estimates of headcount poverty rates. We find a very weak positive correlation between poverty and the expected returns to fertiliser, which calls into question whether fertiliser subsidies are spatially distributionally progressive in helping to reduce poverty among Malawian farmers.","[Harou, Aurelie P.] McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, Agr Econ, 21,111 Lakeshore Dr, Montreal, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada; [Liu, Yanyan; You, Liangzhi] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Liu, Yanyan; Barrett, Christopher B.] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Barrett, Christopher B.] Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Barrett, Christopher B.] Cornell Univ, David R Atkinson Ctr Sustainable Future, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",McGill University; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Cornell University; Cornell University; Cornell University,"Harou, AP (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, Agr Econ, 21,111 Lakeshore Dr, Montreal, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada.",aurelie.harou@mcgill.ca,"Barrett, Christopher B./A-9750-2009; wang, xiaoqiang/JMT-2783-2023; WANG, YANG/JFA-8821-2023","Barrett, Christopher B./0000-0001-9139-2721; You, Liangzhi/0000-0001-7930-8814",,,,,52,21,24,2,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

This solicitation effect may soften competition and impede information aggregation. Under certain conditions, there is an equilibrium in which the seller solicits many bidders, yet the resulting price is not competitive and fails to aggregate any information.

A financial accelerator effect is found to have amplified the macroeconomic responses to shifts in bank credit supply. Results from a counterfactual experiment that links capital requirements to house prices and mortgage spreads indicate that tighter macroprudential policy would have had a moderating effect on house price and mortgage lending growth in the early 2000s, with easier monetary policy acting to offset its contractionary effects on output.

It has sustained itself as an employee-owned enterprise for nearly a century, and it makes explicit claims to conduct itself in a 'responsible manner' which differs markedly from the notions of responsibility maintained by many conventional businesses. But what do these commitments mean in practice and what compromises, if any, do they entail or require, and crucially how are these tensions managed?

J,"Buiter, WH",,,,"Buiter, Willem H.",,,Exchange rate implications of Border Tax Adjustment Neutrality,ECONOMICS-THE OPEN ACCESS OPEN-ASSESSMENT E-JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Border tax adjustment; neutrality; equivalence; exchange rate appreciation; nominal price and wage rigidities,PASS-THROUGH; PRICES; SYMMETRY; TARIFFS; IMPORT; MONEY,"This paper investigates the implications for the nominal exchange rate of a Border Tax Adjustment (BTA) when there is BTA neutrality. A border tax adjustment is a change from an origin-based system of taxation, that taxes exports but exempts imports to a destination-based system that taxes imports but exempts exports. Both indirect taxes (e.g. a VAT) and direct taxes (e.g. a cash-flow corporate profit tax) can be subject to a BTA. In the US, a BTA for the corporate profit tax is under discussion. There is BTA neutrality when the real equilibrium, including measures of profitability and competitiveness, of an open economy is unchanged when it moves from an origin-based to a destination-based tax. The conventional wisdom on the exchange rate implications of a neutral BTA is that the currency of the country implementing the BTA will strengthen (appreciate) by a percentage equal to the VAT or CPT tax rate. The main insight of this note is that this 'appreciation presumption' is not robust, even when all conditions for full BTA neutrality are satisfied. Indeed, plausible alternative assumptions about constancy (or stickiness) of nominal prices support a weakening (depreciation) of the currency by the same percentage as the tax rate. On the basis on the very patchy available empirical information, it is not possible to take a view with any degree of confidence on the implications of a BTA for the nominal exchange rate, even if full BTA neutrality prevailed. Whether BTA neutrality itself is a feature of the real world is also a disputed empirical issue. Therefore, buyer (or seller) beware.","[Buiter, Willem H.] Citigrp Global Markets Inc, 388 Greenwich St, New York, NY 10013 USA",,"Buiter, WH (通讯作者)，Citigrp Global Markets Inc, 388 Greenwich St, New York, NY 10013 USA.",willem.buiter@citi.com,,,,,,,61,1,1,0,8,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAY 15,2017,11.0,,,,,,1,41,201712.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2017-12,0.0,,,41,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EW1TL,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402276600001,0

Using a sample of online Indian workers who earn bonuses based on six simultaneous coin flips, we show that the relationship between dishonesty and financial rewards depends on the incentive range. We find two novel effects as incentives exceed those used in most prior research. First, dishonesty increases and reaches its maximum as rewards increase from $0.50 to $3 per reported head and as earnings reach $15, indicating that rewards can indeed motivate more cheating when large enough. More importantly, we show that dishonesty declines at the highest reward levels (up to $5 per head) as individuals appear to engage in lower magnitudes of dishonesty. We detail how our results could be explained by a reference dependent utility with internal costs of dishonesty that are convex in the magnitude of the lie, and show survey and simulation-based evidence that support this explanation.

Early studies investigated the optimality of piecemeal first-best policy in controlled sectors when distortions exist elsewhere. The applied welfare economics approach of Arnold Harberger and its embodiment in cost-benefit analysis incorporated second-best analysis into the evaluation of public programs. Modern second-best analysis emphasizes policy-making in a distorted economy where distortions reflect either constraints on government policy instruments or features of the economic environment such as limited government information. This is illustrated using optimal commodity and income taxation and its refinements to intertemporal and uncertain settings. Second-best analysis is a defining feature of modern normative public economics.,"[Boadway, Robin] Queens Univ, Kingston, ON, Canada",Queens University - Canada,"Boadway, R (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",boadwayr@econ.queensu.ca,,,,,,,75,3,3,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

In the field of self-employment, an emerging trend towards one-person enterprises can be observed, which already represent more than 50 % of all Austrian companies. Based on a representative sample of 626 one-person enterprises in Carinthia, one of the federal countries in Austria, we found out that these micro enterprises are mainly driven by motives like self-realization or working without hierarchies. However, their emergence is also partly due to a lack of opportunities in the (dependent) labour market. Additionally, we found evidence for the phenomenon of hybrid self-employment, meaning that a significant part of the one-person enterprises (nearly 20 %) is additionally engaged in dependent work. The primary aim of this paper was to identify factors influencing these hybrid forms of employment status between dependent work and self-employment. Based on a binary Logit model, we found evidence that the hybrid employment status is mainly determined by age, the educational level, the situation in which the one-person enterprise was founded, the duration of the enterprise as well as the motives for being self-employed.","[Boegenhold, Dieter] Alpen Adria Univ Klagenfurt, Dept Sociol, Univ Str 65-67, A-9020 Klagenfurt Am Worthersee, Austria; [Klinglmair, Andrea] Inst Adv Studies Carinthia, Alter Pl 10, A-9020 Klagenfurt Am Worthersee, Austria",,"Klinglmair, A (通讯作者)，Inst Adv Studies Carinthia, Alter Pl 10, A-9020 Klagenfurt Am Worthersee, Austria.",Dieter.Boegenhold@aau.at; a.klinglmair@ihsk.at,"Bögenhold, Dieter/J-7750-2012","Bögenhold, Dieter/0000-0003-2893-3534",University of Klagenfurt,University of Klagenfurt,Open access funding provided by University of Klagenfurt.,,62,15,18,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,MAY,2017,44.0,2,,,,,383,404,,10.1007/s10663-016-9332-8,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,ES6WW,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000399692300008,0

Two influential growth paradigms, the semi-endogenous and the second generation fully endogenous, eliminated this strong scale effect. Both solutions have useful aspects and insights, but very different policy implications. This paper combines both approaches into a single hybrid model class, and shows that no matter the weight assigned to each paradigm, the long-run predictions of the semi-endogenous policy dominate with high enough population growth rates, while the long-run predictions of the fully endogenous policy dominate at low population growth rates.

We conduct experiments to show how the appointment procedures for such third parties influence the trust of investors and the actual distributions of returns on investment. We find that when the third party is randomly assigned, investments significantly increase in response to positive returns on investment. Investments are similarly high when insiders select anonymous third parties. However, a simple one-sided reputation mechanism between the third party and the insider (but not the investor) diminishes trust and eliminates the benefits of a supposedly independent third party. In a second experiment we show that the trust of investors, evidenced by their investment level, surprisingly does not depend on whether the decision to delegate to an independent third party or not is taken by insiders themselves or exogenously imposed by a random device.

However, numerous molecular genetic studies have shown that novelty-seeking bearing individuals are prone to certain psychological disadvantages such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), leading to occupational and educational difficulties in modern societies. Using a recent compilation of DRD4 exon III allele frequencies a particular gene variant that population geneticists have found to be sometimes associated with the human phenotype of novelty-seeking behavior-this paper advances a new country-level measure on the prevalence of novelty-seeking traits for a large number of countries worldwide. The results suggest a stable non monotonic inverted U-shaped relationship between the country-level DRD4 exon III allele frequency measure and economic development. This finding is suggestive of the potential benefits and costs of novelty-seeking traits for the aggregate economy.","[Goeren, Erkan] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Fac 2, Sch Comp Sci Business Adm Econ & Law, Inst Econ, Bldg A5, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Gören, E (通讯作者)，Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Fac 2, Sch Comp Sci Business Adm Econ & Law, Inst Econ, Bldg A5, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany.",erkan.goeren@uni-oldenburg.de,,,,,,,81,7,8,1,16,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.
