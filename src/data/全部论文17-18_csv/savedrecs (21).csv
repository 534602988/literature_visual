To address these problems, many creative regulatory solutions and well-designed risk techniques have been utilized in the hope of reducing non-performing loans to an acceptable level. The purpose of this study is to apply a newly developed data envelopment analysis model to suggest the most efficient plan (called Plan 4) to reduce non-performing loans that can maximize the efficiency of the entire banking industry's control over the bad debts. For comparison purpose, three other reduction plans are also represented. The four plans are presented using data from Taiwan's banking industry. The empirical results show that among the plans presented, Plan 4 shows the most effective allocation of the industry-wide reduction target. The plan focuses on a finite number of banks, helping identify the key units to improve industry-wide efficiency. The findings implicitly suggest that the regulator should devise more incentive measures to encourage target banks to perform the non-performing loan reduction task. Our results also suggest that for the regulator, forcing banks to cut their non-performing loans by the same ratio will not help improve the relative efficiency of the industry.","[Yang, Chih-Ching] Cent Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mkt Management, 666 Putzu Rd, Taichung 406, Taiwan",Central Taiwan University Science & Technology,"Yang, CC (通讯作者)，Cent Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mkt Management, 666 Putzu Rd, Taichung 406, Taiwan.",107103@ctust.edu.tw,,,Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [MOST 105-2410-H-166-001],"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",The author would like to thank three anonymous reviewers and Managing Editor of this journal for their constructive comments and suggestions.

The purpose of this article is to investigate how changes in the corporate income tax affect unemployment. We employ system general method of moments (GMM) due to peculiarities of the data set and the endogeneity issues present in the research problem. We find that a rise in the effective average corporate tax rate significantly increases unemployment levels, which directly contradicts past findings of some seminal authors. In addition, the present research supports findings of past studies on capital tax elasticity that obtained similar insights using differing methodologies. This research lays the groundwork for future studies, which may take the same methodology and apply it to even larger international panels. This research implies that international tax competition is affecting unemployment, presumably through its effects on international capital investment. These results provide support for policy makers who may be wary of raising corporate tax rates in countries where capital is especially mobile because of the negative effects which may accumulate to the voting public in the form of unemployment.","[Zirgulis, Aras; Sarapovas, Tadas] ISM Univ Management & Econ, Econ Fac, Arkliu G 18, LT-01305 Vilnius, Lithuania",ISM University of Management & Economics,"Zirgulis, A (通讯作者)，ISM Univ Management & Econ, Econ Fac, Arkliu G 18, LT-01305 Vilnius, Lithuania.",arazir@ism.lt; tadsar@ism.lt,"Zirgulis, Aras/JVO-4903-2024","Zirgulis, Aras/0000-0002-8340-219X",,,,,26,9,9,1,14,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

This paper discusses an analysis of the bandwidth of freight transport forecasts for The Netherlands with the strategic freight transport model 'BasGoed'. This model was developed over the past years as a basic model, satisfying the needs of policy making, based on proven knowledge and available transport data. Starting point for the analysis are the long-term scenarios for The Netherlands developed recently by CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis and PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (WLO scenarios : Future outlook on welfare, prosperity and the human environment). The scenarios describe two base cases : The High and Low scenario. Both scenarios include a consistent set of assumptions on economic development (domestic growth by industry sector and international trade), infrastructure development, fuel prices, and logistic efficiency. The bandwidth of freight forecasts is further explored in five distinctive sensitivity analyses : different development in fuel prices, energy markets, CO2-pricing, dematerialization and modal shift in the port of Rotterdam. The sensitivity analysis provides more insight in the level of importance of each scenario assumption and it can be useful in estimating a bandwidth for freight transport demand. This is valuable in providing insight in the robustness of the freight transport forecasts for policy studies.","[de Bok, Michiel; Wesseling, Bart] Significance, The Hague, Netherlands; [de Bok, Michiel] Delft Univ Technol, Delft, Netherlands; [Kiel, Jan] Panteia, Zoetermeer, Netherlands; [Miete, Onno] Minist Transport & Water Management, Zoetermeer, Netherlands; [Francke, Jan] Netherlands Inst Transport Policy Anal, The Hague, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology,"de Bok, M (通讯作者)，Significance, The Hague, Netherlands.;de Bok, M (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, Delft, Netherlands.",debok@significance.nl; Wesseling@significance.nl; j.kiel@panteia.nl; onno.miete@rws.nl; jan.francke@minienm.nl,,,,,,,22,2,2,1,16,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

We found that the number of countries and connections have increased in a very short time, and that most of the newcomers have come from Africa, Asia and South America. We show that a country's network position affects the creation and intensity of R&D linkages with other countries in the network. This suggests that the evolution of the ICT GIN is driven by, among other things, the preferential attachment mechanism, i.e. countries tend to connect to those countries which have more links. A country's position in the network also moderates the effect of standard determinants of innovation i, such as geographic distance. Hence, network position explains the creation of R&D linkages between such distant countries as the US, China or India.","[Nepelski, Daniel; De Prato, Giuditta] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Directorate Growth & Innovat, Digital Econ Unit, Edificio Expo, Seville, Spain",,"Nepelski, D (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Directorate Growth & Innovat, Digital Econ Unit, Edificio Expo, Seville, Spain.",daniel.nepelski@ec.europa.eu,"nep, daniel/AAQ-7413-2021","Nepelski, Daniel/0000-0001-5893-4779",,,,,57,20,25,16,142,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Drawing on the evolutionary economic geography and the international business literatures, our conceptual framework emphasises key micro-level factors influencing cross-border takeovers, such as the global search of MNEs for novel firm-specific knowledge, their cost-reduction behaviour and the heterogeneity of routines among potential target firms. The mediating role of the technological and the regional institutional contexts of target firms is also considered. Using data on a large sample of European target firms for 1997-2013, our results support a process of selection whereby MNEs acquire underperforming firms that developed valuable organisational and cognitive routines, as a strategy to access novel knowledge bases while reducing the cost of purchasing foreign assets.","[Ascani, Andrea] Univ Utrecht, Dept Econ Geog, URU, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Ascani, Andrea] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",Utrecht University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Ascani, A (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Dept Econ Geog, URU, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.;Ascani, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",a.ascani@lse.ac.uk,"Ascani, Andrea/T-7092-2019","Ascani, Andrea/0000-0003-4738-3144",Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Doctoral Studentship [1096607],Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Doctoral Studentship,This work was supported by Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Doctoral Studentship 2011-2014 [grant number 1096607].

In Philadelphia, defendants randomly receive bail magistrates who differ widely in their propensity to set bail at affordable levels. Using magistrate leniency as an instrument, I find that pretrial detention leads to a 13% increase in the likelihood of being convicted, an effect largely explained by an increase in guilty pleas among defendants who otherwise would have been acquitted or had their charges dropped. I find also that pretrial detention leads to a 42% increase in the length of the incarceration sentence and a 41% increase in the amount of nonbail court fees owed. This latter finding contributes to a growing literature on fines-and-fees in criminal justice, and suggests that the use of money bail contributes to a poverty-trap: those who are unable to pay bail wind up accruing more court debt.","[Stevenson, Megan T.] George Mason Univ, Antonin Scalia Law Sch, Arlington, VA 22201 USA",George Mason University,"Stevenson, MT (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Antonin Scalia Law Sch, Arlington, VA 22201 USA.",msteven@gmu.edu,,"Stevenson, Megan/0000-0002-3518-8985",,,,,42,63,92,1,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

The paper defends a functional definition of the capitalist relations of production, in terms of what Marx calls the 'subsumption of labour by capital'. I argue that there are at least four modes of subsumption, one transitional to and one transitional from the capitalist mode of production. Unlike the capitalist mode of production, capitalist relations of production are compatible with the absence of a labour market, and even with the absence of workplace authority relations. The ambit of capitalist domination is therefore broader than typically thought.","[Vrousalis, Nicholas] Leiden Univ, Inst Polit Sci, Wassenaarseweg 52, NL-2333 AK Leiden, Netherlands",Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University,"Vrousalis, N (通讯作者)，Leiden Univ, Inst Polit Sci, Wassenaarseweg 52, NL-2333 AK Leiden, Netherlands.",n.vrousalis@fsw.leidenuniv.nl,,"Vrousalis, Nicholas/0000-0002-9819-3423",,,,,48,12,12,1,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

In this study, a practical framework is developed to model departure time choice of metro passengers during peak hours. First, various attributes that influence departure time choice of metro passengers are investigated and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solutions (TOPSIS) is used to identify these main attributes. Then, a mixed logit (ML) model of departure time choice that accounts for price endogeneity is developed. To calibrate the model, a stated preference (SP) survey based on D-efficient design is conducted in the Beijing metro system. It is proved that the corrected ML model outperforms the uncorrected ML model according to the collected 1152 sample data. An elasticity analysis of these main attributes is further conducted, which indicates that metro fare and departure time change influence passenger departure time choice more than crowdedness in Beijing metro. Knowledge of these preferences assists traffic managers in balancing passenger departure time to mitigate overcrowding during peak hours. Heterogeneity of passenger socioeconomic and trip characteristics is also concerned taking advantage of ML model. Finally, a ML based fare discount strategy to ease the crowdedness in Batong Line of Beijing metro is presented and evaluated via an existing simulation tool.","[Li, Haiying; Li, Xian; Xu, Xinyue] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, State Key Lab Rail Traff Control & Safety, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jun] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Traff & Transportat, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Ran, Bin] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Beijing Jiaotong University; Beijing Jiaotong University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Xu, XY (通讯作者)，Beijing Jiaotong Univ, State Key Lab Rail Traff Control & Safety, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.",hyli@bjtu.edu.cn; 10114213@bjtu.edu.cn; xxy-1983@163.com; jliu@bjtu.edu.cn; bran@engr.wisc.edu,"zhao, lin/JPK-8436-2023; xu, xinyue/W-5973-2019","Xu, Xinyue/0009-0007-8154-2336; LIU, Jun/0000-0003-3242-3182; Xu, Xinyue/0000-0002-6878-4759","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71601018, 71701010]; State Key Lab of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, China [RCS2018ZT006]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China [2017JBM075]; Social Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [14EYD010]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); State Key Lab of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Social Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.71601018 and 71701010), the State Key Lab of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, China (No. RCS2018ZT006), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China (2017JBM075), and the Social Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (Grant no. 14EYD010).

For intermodal transport, shipments follow a chain with more than one mode. Generally, this requires aggregation of travel time distributions that are not additive. We propose an approach that estimates the change in transport time reliability of an intermodal transport chain based on the changes for links of that chain. We demonstrate the framework of reliability assessment for a case study of network improvement for rail-truck intermodal transport in China. Also, we demonstrate the application in a cost-benefit analysis context with user valuations of transport reliabilities from the case at hand. The application leads to the result that projects for the renovation and expansion of the transshipment terminal perform better compared with project that improve rail haulage speed. Another fording is that the effect of reliability improvement projects can be super-additive at network level. In comparison with traditional methods, we conclude that the proposed method can better estimate transport time reliability benefits when the distribution of link travel times is highly skewed. Also, it opens new possibilities for further research for measuring correlated reliability measures within networks and for performing network resilience analysis.","[Zhang, Rong; Jian, Wenliang] Tongji Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Rd & Traff Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Jian, Wenliang; Tavasszy, Lorant] Delft Univ Technol, Transport & Planning Dept, Delft, Netherlands",Tongji University; Delft University of Technology,"Jian, WL (通讯作者)，4800 Caoan Rd, Shanghai 201804, Peoples R China.",zhangrong@tongji.edu.cn; 1410737@tongji.edu.cn; L.A.Tavasszy@tudelft.nl,,"Tavasszy, Lorant/0000-0002-5164-2164",National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFB1201401]; Academic Ability Improvement Plan of Tongji University,National Key R&D Program of China; Academic Ability Improvement Plan of Tongji University,We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the National Key R&D Program of China (item number: 2018YFB1201401) and Academic Ability Improvement Plan of Tongji University.

Our paper wants to contribute to closing this research gap. We conducted a representative survey for Germany in spring 2014 to collect data on actual and potential users of intercity bus services. Our paper presents the most relevant results of this survey and investigates the passenger acceptance of long distance bus services by potential and effective users. We want to show how users evaluate bus services in comparison to alternative modes (rail services, aircraft or use of passenger cars). The analysis distinguishes between different travel purposes and distance. In particular, we examine travel purposes (business trips, holiday and leisure trips), distance, and modal characteristics (e.g. price, quality, speed) as key determinants of modal choice to assess the potential for modal shift from rail, plane, and private car towards intercity bus services. In addition, we also consider habituated behaviour as another determinant of modal choice.","[Eisenkopf, Alexander] Zeppelin Univ, Seemooser Horn 20, D-88045 Friedrichshafen, Germany; [Burgdorf, Christian] KWC GmbH, Bernburger Str 27, D-10963 Berlin, Germany; [Knorr, Andreas] German Univ Adm Sci Speyer, Freiherr vom Str 2, D-67346 Speyer, Germany",Zeppelin University,"Eisenkopf, A (通讯作者)，Zeppelin Univ, Seemooser Horn 20, D-88045 Friedrichshafen, Germany.;Knorr, A (通讯作者)，German Univ Adm Sci Speyer, Freiherr vom Str 2, D-67346 Speyer, Germany.",Burgdorf@kcw-online.de; alexander.eisenkopf@zu.de; knorr@uni-speyer.de,,,,,,,24,8,8,1,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

With an empirical study of survey data from U.S. farmer cooperatives, a strong general complementarity is found between the pursuit of investor-oriented objectives and the delegation of control to decision specialists with specific knowledge. The novel result indicates many farmer cooperatives make sacrifices in user ownership and user control, which in theory improves competitiveness but also further complicates the conceptualization of cooperative performance, survival, and longevity.","[Grashuis, Jasper] Univ Missouri, Div Appl Social Sci, 135C Mumford Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Grashuis, J (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Div Appl Social Sci, 135C Mumford Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",grashuisj@missouri.edu,,"Grashuis, Jasper/0000-0002-5075-4439",,,,,56,3,6,3,19,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,CHICHESTER,"THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0143-6570,1099-1468,,MANAG DECIS ECON,Manag.

Traditionally, the benefits of an urban rail line are calculated on the basis of user benefits such as savings in travel time, vehicle operating costs, accident costs and environmental costs, and more recently wider economic benefits. An alternative approach that is sometimes used is to consider the appreciation of property prices along a rail corridor, and the intensification of land development surrounding a rail station. Using the development of new rail lines in Singapore as a case study, this paper will first apply the hedonic regression method to obtain estimates of elasticity between property price and transport accessibility. Secondly, using historical land use masterplans, the paper will discuss how the density of land use adjacent to rail stations has intensified over the past 15 years, through a comparative analysis of the land use density with respect to the distance to a rail station. Finally, with the North East Line as an example, the alternative approach comprising the land value enhancement of existing properties and the land intensification due to proximity to the line will be compared against the conventional user benefits.","[Le, Henry] AECOM Australia, Collins Sq,Level 10,Tower Two,727 Collins St, Melbourne, Vic 3008, Australia; [Lim, Wee Liang; Leong, Wai Yan] Land Transport Author, 1 Hampshire Rd, Singapore 219428, Singapore",,"Le, H (通讯作者)，AECOM Australia, Collins Sq,Level 10,Tower Two,727 Collins St, Melbourne, Vic 3008, Australia.",henry.le@aecom.com; LIM_Wee_Liang@lta.gov.sg; LEONG_WaiYan@lta.gov.sg,,"leong, wai yie/0000-0002-5389-1121",,,,,19,2,2,1,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

We address the potential endogeneity of the 'legalization treatment' by instrumenting the actual number of legalized immigrants with alternative predicted measures based on past amnesty applications patterns and residential choices of documented and undocumented immigrants. We find that, in the year following an amnesty, regions in which a higher share of immigrants obtained legal status experienced a greater decline in non-EU immigrant crime rates, relative to other regions. The effect is statistically significant but relatively small and not persistent. In further results, we fail to find any evidence of substitution in the criminal market from other population groups-namely, EU immigrants and Italian citizens-and we observe a small and not persistent reduction in total offenses.","[Fasani, Francesco] Queen Mary Univ London, CEPR, CReAM, Sch Econ & Finance, London, England; [Fasani, Francesco] IZA, London, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Fasani, F (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, CEPR, CReAM, Sch Econ & Finance, London, England.;Fasani, F (通讯作者)，IZA, London, England.",f.fasani@qmul.ac.uk,,"Fasani, Francesco/0000-0003-4053-4341",Fondazione Debenedetti,Fondazione Debenedetti,"I wish to thank the editor and three anonymous referees for very constructive feedback on an earlier version of this paper.

We argue that an appropriate analytical segmentation stage should integrate and trade off different available information sources. In particular, it should consider the actual time series patterns, in addition to the variables that characterize the drivers behind the patterns observed. The simultaneous consideration of both information sources, without prior assumptions regarding the relative importance of each, leads to a multicriteria formulation of the segmentation stage. Here, we demonstrate the impact of such an adjustment to segmentation on the final forecasting accuracy of the cross-sectional multi-state Kalman filter. In particular, we study the relative merits of single and multicriteria segmentation stages for a simulated data set with a range of noise levels.

This paper provides evidence on the use of this concept in European Commission merger decisions. We find that it has been relatively rarely used. However, where it has, maverick behaviour has been considered in a diverse range of industries and the candidate firms have been both insiders and outsiders to the merger. We then examine in detail the few cases where the existence of a maverick was eventually established by the Commission. All of these cases occurred after the 2004 change in the Merger Regulation and predominantly when analyzing the likelihood that unilateral effects would result from the merger. We suggest that this may be reconciled with economic theory by a more general need to take into account post-merger product repositioning.","[Bromfield, Joseph] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Econ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Olczak, Matthew] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Econ, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham; Aston University,"Bromfield, J (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Econ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",j.p.bromfield@bham.ac.uk; m.olczak@aston.ac.uk,,"Olczak, Matthew/0000-0001-6808-3832",,,,,18,4,5,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

In this paper we analyze the potential impact of a CO2 aviation tax on the inbound tourism demand from the United States, Canada and Europe to Mexico. The methodology consists of a panel cointegration estimation of the demand for international tourism to Mexico. Unlike previous studies we analyze the potential effect of the tax on both tourism expenditure and the number of airplane arrivals. The results indicate an income elasticity of 1.9 for tourism expenditure and 2.9 for the number of airplane tourist. The price elasticities of airplane tourism expenditure and the number of airplane tourists are -0.94 and -0.39, respectively. The difference in price elasticity between tourism expenditure and number of tourists suggest that a CO2 aviation tax in Mexico would lead to a larger adjustment in total expenditure rather than in trip decisions. The implementation of such tax is therefore consistent with a continuous growth of the demand for tourism. Furthermore, the tax has the potential to generate additional fiscal revenue for 163 - 480 million dollars. The price elasticity of the competitive destination highlights the importance of considering a regional agreement for the implementation of an international CO2 aviation tax.","[Miguel Galindo, Luis] Comis Econ Amer Latina & Carib, Sustainable Dev & Urban Settlements Div, Santiago, Chile; [Miguel Galindo, Luis; Caballero, Karina] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Miguel Galindo, Luis] CIDE, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Beltran, Allan] London Sch Econ, Environm Econ, London, England; [Beltran, Allan] Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

Under asymmetric learning about workers' productivity, the market takes job assignments (or promotions) as a signal of quality and bids up the wages of a promoted worker, leading to inefficiently few promotions (Waldman, M. 1984. Job Assignments, Signalling, and Efficiency 15 RAND Journal of Economics 255-67). Breakup fees can mitigate such inefficiencies by shielding the firm from labor-market competition, but they reduce turnover efficiency when there are firm-specific matching gains. We show that it is optimal to use breakup fees if and only if the difference between the worker's expected productivity in the pre- and post-promotion jobs is small. Also, the relationship between the optimality of breakup fees and the importance of firm-specific human capital is more nuanced than what the extant literature may suggest.","[Mukherjee, Arijit] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Vasconcelos, Luis] Univ Essex, Colchester, Essex, England; [Vasconcelos, Luis] Nova Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal",Michigan State University; University of Essex; Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Mukherjee, A (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",arijit@msu.edu,"Mukherjee, Arijit/B-2165-2012","Vasconcelos, Luis/0000-0002-2952-5674",,,,,53,10,10,1,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

In theory, therefore, public transport provision which increases accessibility should in turn increase land values. The objective of this paper is to identify if land values in the neighbourhood of a light rail have sustained long run price increases due to the presence of the light rail. The motivation for the paper is whether public transport infrastructure creates sufficient uplift to land values that if it were captured it would make a significant contribution to the investment plans of government. This is especially important in contemporary Sydney as plans are being rolled out to implement new light rail systems by the NSW Government which, in common with many other governments, is subject to budgetary constraints which limits the implementation of all the transport infrastructure evaluated as good value for money. The case study of this paper is Sydney's Inner West Light Rail line which was built along the right of way of a former goods line. This line is 7.2 km light long with 14 stops and takes 28 min to travel from end to end. Using transaction house prices from 2011 as the dependent variable, this paper uses Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to identify the uplift attributable to the presence of the light rail. The attributes of the residential property (e.g. number of bedrooms, bathrooms etc) and neighbourhood effects, as measured by census data, are used as controlling independent variables to expose the value of the underlying unimproved land through its accessibility to public transport. The GWR methodology provides a global model as a first stage with the second stage of GWR providing a local model to examine the spatial distribution of the uplift to residential properties. The results show the expected and significant spatial variation in the value of accessibility. Overall, the light rail has had more impact outside the areas of the city centre. The analysis and discussion includes the different valuation of accessibility to bus services vis a vis accessibility to light rail services. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: Publications on strategy and competitive intelligence were reviewed through thematic content analysis based on an extended literature review to determine their respective contents and how strategy as practice related to the crystallised competitive intelligence themes. Results: The research demonstrated that strategy and competitive intelligence are inextricably interwoven. Competitive intelligence was shown to be not merely an activity or sequence of activities within the broader strategic management process, but a significant strategic practice. Conclusion: We argued, based on a comprehensive literature review, that competitive intelligence is an integral practice within strategy that should be explored further for its contribution to emergent and deliberate strategies and the linkage between intra-organisational and extra-organisational activities. We proposed a framework to position competitive intelligence within strategy as practice and in relation to the process view of strategy. The conceptualised framework contributes to the corpus of strategy research as it formalised competitive intelligence as a critical part in the thinking about and the practice of strategy. It moved competitive intelligence from a position on the periphery of strategic management literature, where it was regarded as a mere activity, to an integral practice of strategy to be recognised by strategy scholars and worthy of further research.","[Maritz, Rachel; du Toit, Adeline] Univ Pretoria, Fac Econ & Management Sci, Dept Business Management, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Maritz, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Fac Econ & Management Sci, Dept Business Management, Pretoria, South Africa.",maritz@up.ac.za,,"Maritz, Rachel/0000-0003-4094-835X",,,,,98,7,12,10,86,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Aim and setting: The objectives were achieved by using cross-sectional data obtained from a random sample of 230 households from Mahikeng in the North West province of South Africa. Households' perceptions were measured using numeric responses to several questions, which covered various issues related to vegetable marketing and consumption. Principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to draw dominant perceptions from the set of responses. Method: The probit model was used to determine factors influencing households' decisions of whether or not to participate in informal vegetable markets. Explanatory variables included demographic and socio-economic factors as well as perception-related factors, which were proxied by the dominant principal components (PCs) obtained from the PCA results. Results: Two PCs were found dominant, representing safety and quality perceptions as well as the convenience and bargaining opportunities provided by informal traders. The probit regression results indicated that households' preference for the informal vegetable market were positively influenced by age of household head, low level of education of adult household members, and convenience provided by informal markets. However, households' wealth status and the perceptions on safety and quality of vegetables were found to have a significant negative influence on participation in the informal market. Conclusion: Given that informal vegetable trade forms an integral part of the urban economy by offering easy access to food in public spaces and connecting with the formal economy where informal traders source their supplies, the study concludes by highlighting policy interventions aimed at improving the quality of food traded in the informal sector.","[Marumo, Olebogeng; Mabuza, Majola L.] North West Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Potchefstroom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"Mabuza, ML (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",lmabuza@yahoo.co.uk,,,NWU Food Security and Safety Niche Area; FAST Research Committee,NWU Food Security and Safety Niche Area; FAST Research Committee,"The authors are grateful to the NWU Food Security and Safety Niche Area as well as the FAST Research Committee for funding different aspects of the study.

D.",,,Assessing the financial implications of quality management system accreditation on small training providers in KwaZulu-Natal,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,IMPLEMENTATION; CERTIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; ISO; COMPANIES; IMPACT,"Background: A quality management system (QMS) in education and training is designed in accordance with industry quality models of ISO 9001. Its techniques ensure quality in skills development. However, training providers incur significant costs to obtain QMS accreditation. Therefore, the discourse on the economic effect of QMS accreditation in small training providers is crucial. Aim: This paper investigates the influence of QMS accreditation on the financial performance of small training providers in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). Setting: The South African Qualification Authority (SAQA) is a statutory body, regulated in terms of the National Qualification Framework (NQF) Act No. 67 of 2008 to oversee the development and implementation of the NQF. They are responsible for accrediting 21 sector-based Education and Training Quality Authorities (ETQAs) for the purpose of monitoring and auditing training achievements in terms of the national standards and qualifications. Methods: For this study to achieve its objectives, the ETQAs belonging to 12 different Sector Education and Training Authorities (SETAs) provided the sample frame of accredited training providers in KZN. The SETAs are responsible for administering education and training within their industrial sectors. Of the 89 small training providers, 81 participated in the study. Descriptive and correlation analysis were used to test the two objectives. That is, to examine whether the management and marketing practices of QMS accredited small training providers improve their financial performance. Results: The study indicates that there is no statistical significant relationship between the management and marketing practices of QMS accredited small training providers and their financial performances. This shows that small training providers do not incorporate financial measures during QMS implementation. The accounting departments are not covered in the QMS strategy. Conclusion: Small training providers should take advantage of QMS accreditation for their business's financial performance. They should incorporate financial indicators during QMS implementation and measure QMS's economic effects on an ongoing basis. The original value of this paper is in its approach in uncovering the strengths and weaknesses of QMS accreditation in the financial performances of accredited small training providers in KZN.","[Zondo, Robert W.

The mean Brier score was used to rank the algorithms on approximately 130 questions concerning categorical geopolitical events each year. An algorithm would return aggregate probabilities for each question based on the probabilities provided per question by thousands of individuals, who had been recruited by the Good Judgment Team. This paper summarizes the theorized basis and implementation of one of the two most accurate algorithms at the conclusion of the Good Judgment Project. The algorithm incorporated a number of pre- and postprocessing steps, and relied upon a minimum distance robust regression method called L2E. The algorithm was just edged out by a variation of logistic regression, which has been described elsewhere.

The recent judgements of the UK High Court of Justice in MasterCard and of the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in American Express are particularly relevant because they are the first to concretely apply the economic theory of multisided markets to the payment card industry. In particular, given the nature of multisided markets, the coexistence of different business models, and the dualistic competitive interpretation of the conduct, courts have emphasised the need to articulate a judgement around counterfactual hypotheses. This is a way to measure the actual impact on competition, testing the realistic scenario that would occur if the investigated conduct was absent, so as to give appropriate consideration to the business model of the single platform. The same reasoning that makes us consider advantageous a flexible antitrust approach forces us to be critical of the current US and EU regulation of payment systems.","[Colangelo, Giuseppe] EU Innovat Policy, Brussels, Belgium; [Colangelo, Giuseppe] Univ Basilicata, Law & Econ, Potenza, Italy; [Colangelo, Giuseppe] Bocconi Univ, Legal Issues Mkt, Milan, Italy; [Colangelo, Giuseppe] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Colangelo, Giuseppe] Univ Vienna, Vienna, Austria; [Maggiolino, Mariateresa] Bocconi Univ, Business Law, Milan, Italy",University of Basilicata; Bocconi University; Stanford University; University of Vienna; Bocconi University,"Colangelo, G (通讯作者)，EU Innovat Policy, Brussels, Belgium.;Colangelo, G (通讯作者)，Univ Basilicata, Law & Econ, Potenza, Italy.;Colangelo, G (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Legal Issues Mkt, Milan, Italy.;Colangelo, G (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Colangelo, G (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, Vienna, Austria.",giuseppe.colangelo1975@gmail.com; mariateresa.maggiolino@unibocconi.it,,,,,,,43,2,2,1,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

The analysis finds that universal GP care would add between 2 and 3.5 per cent to overall public healthcare expenditure and up to 1.2 per cent to total healthcare expenditure. While the introduction of universal GP care in Ireland would go some way to addressing limitations of the current system, other reforms may be required before universality can be achieved.","[Connolly, Sheelah; Nolan, Anne; Walsh, Brendan; Wren, Maev-Ann] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI),"Connolly, S (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland.",sheelah.connolly@esri.ie,,"Connolly, Sheelah/0000-0002-8539-6424; Nolan, Anne/0000-0002-4597-180X","Department of Health, Ireland","Department of Health, Ireland","Financial support for the research presented in this paper was provided by the Department of Health, Ireland.

This study of the coal mafia in Dhanbad, India shows that power often derives from socially hierarchical relationships involving debt and/or caste. It also demonstrates how state policies that are thoughtlessly implemented may solidify existing hierarchies. By analogy, modern corporations gain some of their power by behaving as if they were semi-sovereign institutions that draw their strength informally from social networks and other extralegal relationships. The mafia in the Dhanbad coalfields emerged through a series of institutional changes. Labor shortages were initially resolved by labor intermediaries, who eventually controlled the labor through linkages associated with debt, caste, and social obligations. These intermediaries eventually assumed official positions in labor unions, which gave them a platform for electoral politics. When the coal industry was nationalized, the union leaders further solidified their position in the nationalized corporation. In this way, private labor intermediaries became local political leaders who controlled the state apparatus to some extent. Corporations follow similar patterns. Both mafias and corporations exploit weak governments, collude with them, and often operate with a high degree of independence. Like mafias, corporations often derive their power from socially embedded networks that they craft in local communities and populations. Because the roots of their influence are embedded in social networks, simple legal and regulatory changes are often insufficient to limit their power. Transnational corporations engaged in extraction of natural resources share with mafias the ability to leverage monopoly power in one domain into control of other domains. As a result, this case study of the coal mafia in India offers a unique entry point to understand corporate sovereignty.","[Goyal, Yugank] OP Jindal Global Univ, Econ, Khewra, Haryana, India",O.P.

A recognised method for solving arable land resource shortage problems is to encourage marginal farmers to terminate their arable land use contracts with the government so that they can be transferred to farmers with better prospects. This paper analyses the drivers behind farmers' willingness to terminate their arable land use contracts based on survey data from agricultural households in Guanzhong, Shaanxi Province, China, using a multivariable logistic model. Results show that households led by male householders, with large families, fewer agricultural labourers, more plots of land, including family members with non-agricultural skills training and including family members who are covered by rural residents' health insurance, are more likely to terminate their contracts.","[Gao, Jia; Song, Ge] Northeastern Univ, Sch Humanities & Law, Shenyang 110169, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Strijker, Dirk] Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Landleven 11, NL-9747 AD Groningen, Netherlands; [Li, Shiping] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Northeastern University - China; University of Groningen; Northwest A&F University - China,"Gao, J (通讯作者)，Northeastern Univ, Sch Humanities & Law, Shenyang 110169, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",jiagao.nwsuaf@hotmail.com; d.strijker@rug.nl; songgelaoshi@163.com; 1628973943@qq.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [41571165]; Ministry of Education of Liaoning Province [W2014048]; China Scholarship Council,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education of Liaoning Province; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41571165), the Ministry of Education of Liaoning Province (Grant No. W2014048) and the China Scholarship Council.

Empirical evidence shows that most prediction models suffer from a loss of information, model uncertainty, and structural instability by relying on low-dimensional information sets. In this study, we evaluate the predictive ability of various lately refined forecasting strategies, which handle these issues by incorporating information from many potential predictor variables simultaneously. We investigate whether forecasting strategies that (i) combine information and (ii) combine individual forecasts are useful to predict US stock returns, that is, the market excess return, size, value, and the momentum premium. Our results show that methods combining information have remarkable in-sample predictive ability. However, the out-of-sample performance suffers from highly volatile forecast errors.

It was possible to conclude that the strongest correlations found were between the happiness and the prosperity indexes; the traffic commute time and the quality of life indexes, by cities; and the pollution and the quality of life indexes, by cities, which aim to explain sustainable mobility behaviors and its impact in the improvement of the population well-being and satisfaction.

By considering the 2008 dehubbing of Malpensa Airport as a natural experiment, we estimate the impact of a reduction in flight network connectivity on employment in the travel to work areas of Lombardia, Piemonte, Liguria and Emilia Romagna. The de-hubbing decision, in fact, permanently affected the intercontinental accessibility of the airport, with only a temporary effect in terms of passengers. We found that areas characterized by export-oriented sectors suffered from contraction in the degree of connectivity, which decreased as an effect, along with distance from the airport.

There is increasing evidence that employers need to place greater emphasis on communication with talented young people. Jobseekers usually have only basic information and vague knowledge and experience about a job and organizational characteristics in the early stage of the recruitment process, and in this situation the symbolic functions of a brand are significant. Nowadays, prospective applicants search for information about future employers by using their recruitment websites and social media. The study identifies the significant factors (symbolic traits) which attract Czech university business students to choose their potential employers. The study also contains a survey which investigates the use of social media and recruitment websites in relation to the employer brand, including perceptions of an ideal employer. The study brings results about symbolic employer attributes, which are presented in semantic differentials and contribute to research on employer branding by presenting how young people use recruitment websites and company social media to search for a potential employer. The findings of the conducted study suggest that chosen symbolic traits of an ideal employer are similar in the respondents and are independent of gender and employment status. According to the findings regarding social media and recruitment websites, respondents that follow information about job offers on an organization's social media profiles don't find the organization's profiles on social sites important, whereas respondents that follow information about job offers on an organization's recruitment websites find the organization's profiles on social sites important. The paper concludes with theoretical and practical implications followed by directions for future research.","[Eger, Ludvik; Micik, Michal] Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt Trade & Serv, Plzen, Czech Republic; [Rehor, Petr] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Management, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen; University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,"Eger, L (通讯作者)，Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt Trade & Serv, Plzen, Czech Republic.",leger@kmo.zcu.cz; micikm@kmo.zcu.cz; rehor@ef.jcu.cz,"Mičík, Michal/D-2014-2016; Eger, Ludvik/C-1330-2016; Rehor, Petr/S-1425-2017","Mičík, Michal/0000-0002-4112-4160; Eger, Ludvik/0000-0002-5437-3297; Rehor, Petr/0000-0003-2438-3395",,,,,43,15,18,15,124,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The objective of this work is the investigation of empirical characteristics of the Portuguese stock index (PSI-20) returns. The daily returns show evidence of time dependency in much of the data, suggesting that the series may best be described as fractional Brownian motion (gBm). Rescaled-Range Analysis (classical and modified) and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis were used to measure the degree of dependence. The estimations of Hurst exponents evidence long memory, in the form of persistence. Complementarily, Rescaled-Range Tests (classical and modified) and Fractional Differencing Test suggest a stochastic process of short-term memory that degenerates over long periods. Dynamics of fractal structure refutes the Efficient Market Hypothesis, and may compromise the perfect arbitrage, making the markets more risky to invest. Furthermore, it prevents the reliability of asset pricing models that use martingale processes.","[Gomes, Luis M.

Market segmentation is useful to develop profiles of key groups to better understand consumer needs and purchase motivation. However, the food related lifestyle concept is used as a framework; little attention has been paid to food related lifestyle profile in the context of certain type of consumer orientation among young consumers in the Czech Republic. Theoretically, the study is based on cognitive approach to food related lifestyle segmentation, but methodologically an approach is applied to the segmentation of food consumers based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour. Data from a 2015 nationwide Czech food consumer survey (n=331) was used in factor analysis to identify Sustainability oriented variables; Health oriented variables; Social and ethics oriented variables. These factors scores were used to identify consumers segments; this was done by means of multilevel latent class cluster analyses. To explore difference between consumers, which are based on the food related lifestyle concept. The results emphasized the importance of personal characteristics that in turn affected strategies to communicate with the different segments to promote sustainable foods.

In 2010 the European Commission 2010; European Council adopted a new strategy, Europe 2020, which stressed again the importance of innovations. Therefore it is important to evaluate the current level of the European Union Member States' technological and economic development as well as its innovations impact on it. Innovation impact on economic development was analyzed by correlating various composite indices with GDP per capita indicator. A new conceptual model for the European Union Member States' technological and economic development according to the world-system approach is proposed in this article. The world-system approach describes structure, relations and dynamics of international systems encompassing separate entities such as states. Three main roles of the states can be defined: core, semi-periphery and periphery. Core states are the most technologically and economically developed ones and accumulate capital from peripheral states. The model consists of system of indicators, application of multi-criteria evaluation methods and summarized ranking. The system of indicators covers indicators describing technological, economic and social situation in the European Union treated as objectives. MULTIMOORA and TOPSIS methods were used together in order to improve robustness of the analysis. Summarized ranks resemble level of technological and economic development of certain European Union Member States and thus their roles in the European world-system. There were three groups of Member States defined, representing core, semi-periphery and periphery of the European world-system. These ranks can be used in further studies instead of single indicators representing economic development (e.g. GDP per capita). In addition, some theoretical issues regarding multi-criteria evaluation methods are discussed in the paper.","[Li, Changxing] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Li, CX (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",Changxing_li@126.com,,,,,,,48,8,8,0,7,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Emerging work about the interaction between MNEs, space and place also highlights the need for finer scale research to understand the strategy and knowledge exchange of MNEs, which remains limited to this point. To address this need for fine-grained analyses of firm co-location behaviour, this paper uses point-level data to test hypotheses about the co-location behaviour of three types of manufacturing firms in the Detroit metropolitan area. Variations in this behaviour highlight that foreign rather than domestic firms may be the primary source of knowledge spillovers, which speaks to the internationalisation of manufacturing activity in the region over time. New domestic standalone ventures appear to have been crowded out from cluster activities, suggesting a policy opportunity to integrate new standalone ventures into collaborative ventures with other firms in the region.","[Mack, Elizabeth A.; Credit, Kevin] Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog Environm & Spatial Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Suandi, Matthew] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University; Michigan State University,"Mack, EA (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog Environm & Spatial Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",emack@msu.edu,,"Credit, Kevin/0000-0002-3320-4670",,,,,52,2,3,3,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

It conceptually reconciles the reality by looking at the original ideas of 'A Behavioral Theory of the Firm' by Cyert and March. Study critically examines available theoretical models of firm's rational behavior investigated in heuristic theories. These models offer an interpretation of entrepreneurial behavior as a product of personal preferences and characteristics. A theoretical re-orientation towards recognition of entrepreneurial behavior is developed and illustrated. Contemporary research outcomes coincide that the emerging, probably eclectic, paradigm strongly emphasizes the role and quality of human capital including the entrepreneur's skills. Study is based on in-depth qualitative empirical research and subsequently it derives from statistically established theoretical patterns. It explores and explains the way entrepreneurs make economic decisions, their actions and counteractions with business environment, while, at the same time, focusing on Czech specifics. Firms have proved exceptional flexibility and have succeeded in counteracting and even manipulating the shortcomings and disadvantages of business environment. They have exploited chances and grasp opportunities in spite of additional expenditures that increased their costs. It has been proved that decisions are not made according to designed strategic plans aimed at the achievement of goals and permanent profit increase. Research has discovered that behavioral patterns further offer an access to specialized inputs, discovered relations proved to provide the entrepreneur with access to knowledge and information, even though bounded rationality and imperfect knowledge often lead to satisfactory solution and are typical for Czech firms. To create a dynamic economy, which ensures that entrepreneurs can start and develop their businesses, public policy should understand entrepreneurship, support it, provide relevant public goods and motivate it properly.","[Mandysova, Ivana] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Inst Adm & Social Sci, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Mandysová, I (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Inst Adm & Social Sci, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",Ivana.mandysova@upce.cz,,,,,,,46,0,1,3,19,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

In some developing countries, depending on the characteristics of the city, instead of cycling or walking, captive users opt for informal services to commute. Although they are less safe and possibly less comfortable than regulated BRT services, demand for informal services such as motorcycle taxis has grown in recent years, affecting the self-sustainability of some BRT systems. This research aims to provide a richer explanation of the choice process between the BRT feeder service and motorcycle taxis in the context of the City of Bucaramanga, Colombia. Initially, we analyzed a set of effect indicators by diverging stacked bar charts, and then we used a hybrid discrete choice model to incorporate comfort and safety perceptions, in addition to the tangible attributes traditionally used. We found that safety perception, which varies by gender, age and income, is a key variable in modeling the choice process. Based on an empirical chart analysis and the modeling results, we proposed some policies aimed at changing user choices to stimulate the demand for BRT feeder system.","[Marquez, Luis] Univ Pedag & Tecnol Colombia, Sogamoso, Colombia; [Pico, Ricardo] Univ Pontificia Bolivariana, Medellin, Colombia; [Cantillo, Victor] Univ Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia",Universidad Pedagogica y Tecnologica de Colombia (UPTC); Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana; Universidad del Norte Colombia,"Márquez, L (通讯作者)，Univ Pedag & Tecnol Colombia, Sogamoso, Colombia.",luis.marquez@uptc.edu.co; ricardo.pico@upb.edu.co; vcantill@uninorte.edu.co,"Márquez, Luis/L-4522-2013; Cantillo, Victor/AAC-6403-2021; Márquez, Luis/ISV-1348-2023","Cantillo, Victor/0000-0003-1184-2580;",,,,,56,19,20,1,26,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Service orientation is regarded as a crucial strategy or capability that helps organizations stay competitive in today's uncertain business environment. The adoption of service orientation by manufacturing firms can be associated with changes in the positions that firms' occupy in their industry value chain The current state of knowledge does not give answers questions whether, and if yes, then which kind of service orientation contributes to achieving better results depending on the place in the value chain? Hence, in this paper the focus was placed in particular on examining the relationship between the place in the value chain and two highlighted service orientations i.e. services in support of the product business orientation (SSP BO) and services in support of the client's actions business orientation (SSC BO). Each orientation has been operationalized separately in the form of three dimensions of service orientation, i.e. 1. type of offered services (scope), 2. scale of services provided (i.e. the range of clients who use the services) and 3. proactivity of companies in offering them to its customers. The research was carried out on a sample of 138 polish manufacturing companies from nine different industries. Surveys were used for data collection in which senior executives were the respondents. Research has shown that there is a relationship between SSC BO and the share of service sales in the revenues, but at the same time, such relationship was not confirmed in the case of SSP BO. The average level of share of revenues from sales of services that are achieved by enterprises located in the lower part of the value chain is not higher than the results of enterprises in the upper part of the value chain.","[Matusek, Miroslaw; Wolny, Maciej] Silesian Tech Univ, Zabrze, Poland",Silesian University of Technology,"Matusek, M (通讯作者)，Silesian Tech Univ, Zabrze, Poland.",miroslaw.matusek@polsl.pl; maciej.wolny@polsl.pl,"Wolny, Maciej/C-6972-2015; Matusek, Mirosław/O-9426-2018","Wolny, Maciej/0000-0002-8872-7794;","National Science Center, Poland [DEC-2017/01/X/HS4/00304]","National Science Center, Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","The presented results are part of the research on the construction and validation of a service orientation measurement tool for manufacturing enterprises implemented as part of a single scientific activity Service orientation of manufacturing enterprises - construction of a measuring tool, No. DEC-2017/01/X/HS4/00304 financed by the National Science Center, Poland.",,40,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,1235,1247,,,,,,13,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553202025,0

The results obtained were compared for each CSR component, a correlation coefficient was calculated and a scatter plot was built. The study identified a weak dependence between the CSR of the retailers and the consumer expectations, however, for a number of CSR components the retailers' practices exceed the consumer expectations. The European retailers demonstrated a higher CSR and higher-quality non-financial reporting than most Russian retailers.

Genomic selection method is recommended to be applied not only to separate cattle herds, but also whole dairy breed (Lithuanian Black and White, Lithuanian Red, Holstein) selection programs, as the genomic information of each animal is ranked on the basis of international data enabling international breeding value evaluation and participation in cross-country international dairy cattle breeding programs.","[Morkuniene, Kristina] Lithuanian Univ Hlth Sci, Inst Biol Syst & Genet, Tilzes 18, LT-47181 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Kerziene, Sigita] Lithuanian Univ Hlth Sci, Dept Phys Math & Biophys, Tilzes 18, LT-47181 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Miceikiene, Astrida] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Inst Econ Accounting & Finance, Univ Str 10, LT-53361 Akademija, Kaunas Distr, Lithuania",Lithuanian University of Health Sciences; Lithuanian University of Health Sciences; Vytautas Magnus University,"Morkuniene, K (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Univ Hlth Sci, Inst Biol Syst & Genet, Tilzes 18, LT-47181 Kaunas, Lithuania.",kristina.morkuniene@lsmuni.lt; sigita.kerziene@lsmuni.li; astrida.miceikiene@asu.lt,,,,,,,25,0,1,0,10,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Recent revisions to the law reduced the restoration requirements for Areas of Permanent Preservation (APP) and Legal Reserve (LR) and established new tools to facilitate compliance, encourage environmental conservation and strengthen the supervision and monitoring of protected areas. The goal of these changes is to facilitate compliance, encourage environmental conservation, and strengthen the monitoring of protected areas. This paper investigates the probability that a household in Rondonia, Brazil will set aside land for permanent preservation and, once this decision is made, the extent of restoration. Our results suggest that-even in a region that is heavily deforested and under conditions of weak enforcement-households are complying with the law by developing formal plans for restoration. Most important, we find that access to extension agents, existing APP guidelines, and other policy levers (such as environmental licensing) have made a significant impact on the development of these plans suggesting that the 2012 Forest Code has the potential to impact future land restoration decisions.

Additionally, previous studies shed minimal light on open innovation practices in the small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) context. This study attempts to remedy these research gaps using a unique dataset of Korean SMEs in manufacturing industries. I examined the effects of SMEs' two inbound open innovation activities, external search and collaboration activities, on innovation efficiency. To measure SMEs' innovation efficiency scores, I used the data envelopment analysis method, which calculates the relative innovation efficiency scores among them. The results revealed external search activities of SMEs improve their innovation efficiency, whereas their collaboration activities decrease their innovation efficiency. I also found the positive effect of SMEs' external search activities on innovation efficiency is weakened by their internal R&D capacity. Nevertheless, with higher levels of internal R&D capacity, SMEs can improve their innovation efficiency through collaboration activities. Furthermore, the results showed the effects of these two inbound open innovation activities alter through the SMEs' growth phases and the effects of collaboration activities on SMEs' innovation efficiency and innovative performance are different.","[Park, Ji-Hoon] Keimyung Univ, Coll Business Adm, 1095 Dalgubeol Daero, Daegu, South Korea",Keimyung University,"Park, JH (通讯作者)，Keimyung Univ, Coll Business Adm, 1095 Dalgubeol Daero, Daegu, South Korea.",jihoonpark@kmu.ac.kr,"Park, Ji-Hoon/AAM-9356-2020","Park, Ji-Hoon/0000-0001-7075-8114",,,,,105,23,27,16,125,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

In India, the number of ART (Assisted Reproductive Technology) clinics has more than doubled over the past three years. This expansion has been accompanied by a similarly explosive growth in populist narratives that assert that one of the services offered by such clinics, commercial gestational surrogacy (CGS), is a form of labour that is so exceptional(ly) exploitative it should be banned. Provocative headlines proclaiming that surrogates are Renting their wombs' and Pimping their pregnancies' fuel such assertions, suggesting that surrogates become reduced to mere wombs, vessels for carrying the offspring of entitled and wealthy foreigners. Although superficially compelling, such arguments fail to withstand detailed interrogation. Utilizing insights from anthropology, the history of science and law and bringing to bear the findings of extended fieldwork in Mumbai, Jaipur and Delhi, I critically analyse three assertions made in relation to surrogacy: that it is (i) a particularly intimate or invasive form of bodily exploitation; (ii) a uniquely sacralized form of affective labour and (iii) a uniquely generative form of labour. In arguing against exceptionalism, I contend that such practices cannot be adjudged through application of universal ethical principles and norms, but rather must take account of the complexity of the lived experience of all the participants, placed in their sociological and geographical contexts.","[Parry, Bronwyn] Kings Coll London, Sch Global Affairs, Room 4-19 Bush House North East,40 Aldwych, London, England",University of London; King's College London,"Parry, B (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Sch Global Affairs, Room 4-19 Bush House North East,40 Aldwych, London, England.",bronwyn.parry@kcl.ac.uk,,"Parry, Bronwyn/0000-0001-8909-5701",Wellcome Trust [097733/B/11/Z]; Wellcome Trust [097733/B/11/Z] Funding Source: Wellcome Trust,Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust); Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust),The project entitled 'Investigating reproductive ethics in context: The Indian experience' was supported by the Wellcome Trust [grant number 097733/B/11/Z].,,37,14,15,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Hiring a new music director may increase subscription ticket sales, and economic downturns will decrease ticket sales. We find that increasing flexible subscriptions contributes to a decline in total subscription tickets and single ticket sales, in general.

Budget deficit is a deficit that occurs when state revenue is smaller than the country's larger expenditure. Whereas the current account deficit is a condition of the current account balance that has a deficit due to a smaller export value compared to imports of a country coupled with a net outflow of a country. The savings gap is the inability of domestic savings to finance non financial investments due to the small amount of domestic savings while the need for domestic investment is quite large. So this deficit phenomenon is known as triple deficit. By using Vector Autoregression (VAR) method and time series data from the year 2003:Q1-2016:Q4, this study shows that budget deficit and current account deficit have one-way relationship, budget deficit and saving investment gap have one way relationship and current account deficit and saving investment gap not have causality or one way relationship.","[Yeniwati] Univ Negeri Padang, Padang, Indonesia",Universitas Negeri Padang,"Yeniwati (通讯作者)，Univ Negeri Padang, Padang, Indonesia.",yeniwati.unp@gmail.com,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,3,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-703-4,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,64.0,,,,,,249,254,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9GP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470910100029,0

I develop a formal theory of domestic judicial defiance in which domestic and supranational judges vie for jurisprudential authority in a non-hierarchical setting. The model emphasises the role of domestic non-compliance costs and power asymmetries in determining the conduct of domestic and international judges. I argue that the EU represents a special case of a particularly effective international regime. Weak domestic courts have little to gain from an escalated conflict with the European court of Justice. But even domestic judicial superpowers like the German Federal Constitutional Court have strong incentives to seek mutual accommodation with European judges. The analysis also yields new insights into concepts, such as judicial dialogue and constitutional pluralism that have featured prominently in the legal literature, and suggests new hypotheses for empirical research.","[Dyevre, Arthur] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Law, Tiensestr 45, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Dyevre, A (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Law, Tiensestr 45, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",arthur.dyevre@law.kuleuven.be,,"Dyevre, Arthur/0000-0002-8702-6179",,,,,53,4,4,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

We build on institutional change theory to identify potential determinants as to why some countries still lag in this harmonization process. Oversight systems are a key institutional factor to guarantee the quality of financial information, essential to maintain investors' confidence and deep and stable capital markets. Thus, the harmonization of these systems has long been an objective of the EU. Our analyses serve to identify, analyse and compare how EU countries have incorporated European-wide requirements into their national legal systems. Particularly, we study: (1) basic characteristics of the system and bodies for public oversight, (2) organizational structure, (3) financing (4) transparency, (5) supervisory, and (6) disciplinary mechanisms.

In particular the transport industry is still considered as a large polluter. Therefore, stakeholders put pressure on the industry to work on their environmental footprint. Shippers assess whether their supply chain as a whole can be increasingly 'greened', given increasing environmental awareness from both customers (in B2B settings) and consumers (in B2C settings). Ports, as important nodes in transport networks, seek to respond to these pressures. However, their variety of geographical location, economic situation, governance structures and administrative heritage would suggest different preferences towards environmental initiatives. This paper discusses the results of a multiple case study analysis, based on desk research and in-depth interviews with seven port authorities within the Hamburg-Le Havre range. The main goal was to investigate how port authorities respond towards the challenge of greening the shipping industry, in particular on the motives and rationale behind the set-up of pricing schemes, and what kind of institutional arrangements are installed. From an institutional theory perspective, a high degree of isomorphism is observed in the Hamburg-Le Havre range as these ports are focusing mainly on Environmental Shipping Index (ESI) based bonus schemes for environmental differentiated port infrastructure pricing. Managerial and policy implications/recommendations, based on the empirical results of the cross-case study, are formulated in order to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the use of environmental differentiated charging schemes.","[Geerts, Magali; Langenus, Mychal; Dooms, Michael] VUB, Brussels, Belgium",Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Geerts, M (通讯作者)，VUB, Brussels, Belgium.",Magali.Geerts@vub.be,,"Dooms, Michael/0000-0003-0572-9063",,,,,61,3,3,1,19,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

Matrix methods may usefully be deployed to characterise the architecture of resources, costs, and revenues that a business uses to create and deliver value to customers that defines its business model. Systematisation of this technique would support a taxonomical approach to empirical studies of business models. Generalisation of this matrix approach provides a formal linkage between business models, strategy, and value creation using the Hamiltonian economics associated with the Maximum Principle. Factor analysis permits the endogenous identification of critical resource combinations in the business model that underpins resource-based views of strategy, resolving the tautological impasse identified by Priem and Butler (2001).","[Johnson, Peter] Univ Oxford, Exeter Coll, Turl St, Oxford OX1 3DP, England",University of Oxford,"Johnson, P (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Exeter Coll, Turl St, Oxford OX1 3DP, England.",peter.johnson@exeter.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,24,2,2,0,12,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,CHICHESTER,"THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0143-6570,1099-1468,,MANAG DECIS ECON,Manag.

For logging companies, REDD+ projects provide the opportunity to compensate a voluntary reduction of the logging intensity by valuing the associated carbon gain. We explored, from the perspective of a logging company, a range of scenarios for reducing logging intensity so as to assess the possibilities for emissions reductions and to evaluate the financial feasibility of such projects. On the basis of Monte Carlo simulations for a typical export-oriented forest concession, we calculated intervals of break-even prices of permanent carbon credits. We show that logging intensity reduction is an attractive option when there is a complete cessation of logging, and for little exploited and low-profit forests. The most feasible IFM projects would be those that require a major reduction of logging intensity. Our work suggests that instead of improving forest logging techniques IFM projects based on a voluntary reduction of logging intensity would rather lead the exclusive choice of carbon or timber valuation.

We report the results from an experiment in which manager subjects make effort and fraud decisions that affect a firm's value. The main treatment variable is the incentive contract, which can be of either the simple equity or stock option type. We find that both effort and fraud are increasing in a manager's share of equity and decreasing in the strike price of an option. Interestingly, the stock option contract induces relatively more fraud than the simple equity contract, even though the two induce the same effort.","[Santore, Rudy] Univ Tennessee, Dept Econ, 505A Stokely Management Ctr, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Tackie, Martin] Ernst & Young LLP, Atlanta, GA USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Santore, R (通讯作者)，Univ Tennessee, Dept Econ, 505A Stokely Management Ctr, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",rsantore@utk.edu,,,,,,,18,1,1,1,27,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,CHICHESTER,"THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0143-6570,1099-1468,,MANAG DECIS ECON,Manag.

The Take off the European referendum has no direct impacts on the pollution abatement costs of UK-based carriers. 3.

This paper assesses whether the exemption of Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) from the LCC affected the registration rate of these vehicles in Greater London and the surrounding areas. The analysis uses official data on the number of HEVs registered across the local authorities of the United Kingdom. This dataset is assessed using [1] exploratory spatial analysis to determine the degree of spatial variation in HEV registrations, [2] area classifications to consider if HEV registrations diminish as nearness to the LCC recedes, and [3] spatial regression models to evaluate the association between distance to the LCC and HEV registrations, controlling for other area characteristics (i.e. socioeconomic, household, and transport system variables). The results clearly show that nearness to the LCC is positively associated with HEV registrations, implying that this form of transport policy is effective at promoting the adoption of low emission vehicles.","[Morton, Craig; Lovelace, Robin; Anable, Jillian] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Univ Rd, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Morton, C (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Univ Rd, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",c.morton@live.co.uk,,"Morton, Craig/0000-0003-0984-9580; Anable, Jillian/0000-0002-4259-1641; Lovelace, Robin/0000-0001-5679-6536",ClimateXChange centre of expertise in Scotland; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: UKRI; ESRC [ES/L011891/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ClimateXChange centre of expertise in Scotland; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),An earlier version of this paper was presented at the 2017 Transportation Research Board annual conference.

Focusing on the concepts of green growth and degrowth the paper provides indications that particularly in protected areas that are confronted with acceptance problems, an efficiency-driven green growth approach guided by a spirit of sustainability can be the basis for moving towards more sustainable modes of development. However, the study raises the question of time frames for regional sustainability transitions and the parameters these depend on.","[Panzer-Krause, Sabine] Univ Hildesheim, Inst Geog, Univ Pl 1, D-31141 Hildesheim, Germany",University of Hildesheim,"Panzer-Krause, S (通讯作者)，Univ Hildesheim, Inst Geog, Univ Pl 1, D-31141 Hildesheim, Germany.",sabine.panzer-krause@uni-hildesheim.de,,,,,,,97,6,6,3,37,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

In the model, both the borrower and the creditor undertake actions-the former on accident reducing care and the latter on the screening of loan applicants. Creditor rights may not be preserved entirely due to competing claims from tort victims. The impact of better credit protection crucially depends on the structure of the informational asymmetry. For situations where only the entrepreneur's action is privately observed, better protection of creditor rights leads to an improvement in the terms and availability of credit. When the actions of the borrower and the lender are both unobservable the results are completely reversed. The impact of better credit protection on social welfare is ambiguously dependent on the quality of borrowers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The true motivation can be identified by modeling each policy goal as the focus of the optimization anchoring a data envelopment analysis of the efficiency of the observed implementation. In other words, we rank performance based on how far observed behavior is from the optimal behavior under each possible goal, and the goal for which the distance is smaller reveals the specific motivation of investment or any policy decision for that matter. The approach is tested on Spain's land transport infrastructure policy since it is argued by many observers to be driven more by political than economic concerns, resulting in a mismatch between capacity investment and traffic demand. The method clearly shows that investments have generally been more consistent with a political objective (the centralization of economic power) than with an economic objective (maximizing mobility).","[Bertomeu-Sanchez, Salvador; Estache, Antonio] Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, 50 Ave Franklin Roosevelt CP 114, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Bertoméu-Sánchez, S (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, 50 Ave Franklin Roosevelt CP 114, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",sbertome@ulb.ac.be; aestache@ulb.ac.be,,,Chaire Bernard Vanommeslaghe,Chaire Bernard Vanommeslaghe,"We are grateful to the Chaire Bernard Vanommeslaghe for funding support; to Germa Bel for his time and for sharing his knowledge of the sector; to Daniel Albalate, Micael Castanheira, Bram De Rock, Renaud Foucart, Marisela Montoliu, Sergio Perelman and Lorenzo Ricci for their comments and suggestions; to Luis Bertomeu-Sanchez for his contribution in the map-making.

Based on a spatial analysis and ethnography of urban synagogues in the northern Israeli mixed city of Acre that were established and constructed by communities of Jewish immigrants from North African countries, we demonstrate how significant shifts in the city's demographic pattern and landscape have affected these institutions' ascribed functions and meanings. We theorise this dynamic as strongholding', or, more specifically, strongholding the synagogue as a means of strongholding the city. The formation of the synagogue as a stronghold is enacted through a dual configuration process by which the religious legitimacy, which the synagogue bestows on those who maintain it, is interwoven into a broader urban sociopolitical struggle to claim a presence in the city.","[Ram, Moriel; Gutman, Meirav Aharon] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Architecture & Town Planning, Haifa, Israel",Technion Israel Institute of Technology,"Ram, M (通讯作者)，Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Architecture & Town Planning, Haifa, Israel.",moriram@gmail.com; meiravag@gmail.com,"Aharon-Gutman, Meirav/AAN-9241-2020","Aharon-Gutman, Meirav/0000-0002-9590-2300",,,,,65,11,12,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

A rich body of literature has examined the spatial transformation of manufacturing firms from coastal to inland China, while little attention has been paid to the market shift engaged by export-oriented firms, particularly from exports towards China's domestic market. Taking electronics industry as a case, this study examines the process and trajectories of production relocation and market rebalancing of electronics firms during the period of 1998 and 2009. Drawing upon the global production networks (GPNs) framework, particularly the evolutionary strategic coupling, decoupling and recoupling dynamics, the study argues that China's world factory' has been restructured through divergent decoupling of electronics production and exports from coastal regions, for example, the Pearl River Delta (PRD) on the one hand, and selective recoupling with a small number of cities in inland regions and Yangtze River Delta. The spatial expansion of electronics exports and changing ratio of exports to sales outputs among various provinces elucidates the emerging attempts at developing domestic market-oriented production networks, yet with limited penetration to the domestic market. Through transition from structural coupling to selective recoupling, electronics firms like Foxconn, a Taiwan-based contract manufacturer for global lead firms, for example, Apple, have strategically leveraged among diverse regional production networks in China. The findings of the study could enrich the developing literature of GPNs, particularly the dynamic strategic coupling, decoupling and recoupling in the evolution of regional production networks in the changing global economy.","[Yang, Chun] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Geog, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [He, Canfei] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Baptist University; Peking University,"Yang, C (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Geog, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",chunyang@hkbu.edu.hk; hecanfei@urban.pku.edu.cn,"Yang, Chun/AFP-6023-2022","Yang, Chun/0000-0002-0169-3449","General Research Grant (GRF), Research Grant Council of Hong Kong [HKBU257210]; Hong Kong Baptist University [FRG1/14-15/042, FRG2/14-15/055]; National Natural Science Fund of China [41571119]; National Science Fund of China for Distinguished Young Scholars [41425001]","General Research Grant (GRF), Research Grant Council of Hong Kong; Hong Kong Baptist University; National Natural Science Fund of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Science Fund of China for Distinguished Young Scholars(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars)","Financial support from the General Research Grant (GRF), Research Grant Council of Hong Kong (HKBU257210), Faculty Research Grant ((FRG1/14-15/042 and FRG2/14-15/055), Hong Kong Baptist University and the National Natural Science Fund of China (41571119) and the National Science Fund of China for Distinguished Young Scholars (41425001) are gratefully acknowledged.

Three main insights emerge from our experiments. First, we find a significant decrease in message usage with message cost in both treatments and a higher decrease in the indirect-message treatment. Second, we find that although there is no significant effect of costless or costly indirect messages on the frequency of risky actions, both costless, and costly direct messages significantly increase the frequency of risky actions. Third, while we find a significant increase in the coordination rate on the payoff-dominant equilibrium from costless indirect message treatment to costly indirect message treatment, this rate significantly decreases from costless direct message to costly direct message treatment. Our findings show that depending on the structure of messages, message cost may increase or decrease the coordination rates on the payoff-dominant equilibrium with respect to costless communication. However, costly communication increases efficient coordination rates with respect to the no communication baseline.

Based on original data on Burundi, we investigate the sensitivity of poverty headcount calculations to considering individual-instead of household-level consumption. Relying on a survey module which provides information on the share of expenses allocated to each member of the households, we calculate poverty statutes on an individual basis. Exploiting these direct measures to compute poverty headcounts allows us to put forward the discrepancy between individual- and household-level poverty computations. We identify hidden poor, i.e. poor individuals living in non-poor households, and show that they are predominantly children. We finally discuss potential mechanisms that could drive the results, and emphasize the importance of improving data collection devices for poverty-related policy making.","[Mercier, Marion] Univ Paris Dauphine, PSL, LEDa, UMR DIAL, Bonn, Germany; [Verwimp, Philip] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium",Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Mercier, M (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Dauphine, PSL, LEDa, UMR DIAL, Bonn, Germany.",mercier@dial.prd.fr,,,FNRS; ARC project [15/19-063],FNRS(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS); ARC project(Australian Research Council),The data used in this paper were collected in an FNRS research project on longitudinal and intra- household dynamics.

The relatively recent attention for UFT spurred the emergence of a variety of policy measures. Nevertheless, local authorities experience difficulties in choosing a successful solution. Generally lacking are short and long-term assessments, a multi-stakeholder approach and a solid contextual understanding based on data. In order to tackle these pressing causes for policy failure, we developed a policy assessment framework. The framework includes four methodologies that are relevant for UFT policy assessment and introduces 45 indicators for the collection of UFT data that enable monitoring and benchmarking and provide input for the assessment methodologies. The paper covers the policy assessment framework and a case study application on the Belgian city of Mechelen. As the city struggles with selecting an appropriate and broadly supported policy measure to increase UFT sustainability, a multi-actor multi-criteria analysis (MAMCA) is applied. The results show that conflicting interests greatly impede policy measure selection, making further adaptations to the city's proposals necessary. The policy assessment framework represents a well reasoned and solid process for UFT policy-making that is supported by the stakeholders involved. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, households in urban and periurban areas may prefer diverse forest areas in their neighborhoods. The main objective of this study is to estimate and compare the impacts of proximity to forest recreational services based on the nearby forest and the regional forest environment, which includes spatially heterogeneous recreational quality. The regional forest environment is computed based on forest recreational services with respect to the travel time to housing. The empirical results show that differences exist between the forest valuations and their recreational services depending on which forest environment is considered. The size of the nearby forest is the only characteristic with a positive and significant impact on housing prices. Conversely, the regional forest environment positively influences housing prices based on certain parameters, such as large forest size, absence of protected areas and the existence of hiking and biking paths, which imply public access and maintenance.

For economic geographers working on the environment, governance refers primarily to state- and nonstate-based institutional and regulatory arrangements shaping human-environment interactions. Yet the theoretical and empirical links between these two concepts of governance are opaque. Drawing on a longitudinal case study of the canned tuna value chain and a historic materialist method, we demonstrate how interfirm strategies over the appropriation of value and distribution of costs and risks work through the environment. We document moments of change in the value chain that enliven a dynamic understanding of how a lead firm becomes and reproduces its power, and strategies that subordinate firms deploy to try to counter the power of lead firms. We posit that these moves broaden value chain scholarship's focus from governance typologies toward the gravitational tendencies of capitalist competition and that such tendencies are inextricable from the environmental conditions of production through which they are made possible. This approach enables us to look at value chains and the environmental conditions of production as mutually constitutive, helping to explain vexing modern environmental problems as a core element of the general tendencies, mechanisms, and drivers of power in chains.","[Havice, Elizabeth] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Geog, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Campling, Liam] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, London E1 4NS, England",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Havice, E (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Geog, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",havice@email.unc.edu; l.campling@qmul.ac.uk,,"Havice, Elizabeth/0000-0003-0760-2082",National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; Southwest Regional Fisheries Division; School of Oriental and African Studies; SDOAS Research Fellowship,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Southwest Regional Fisheries Division; School of Oriental and African Studies; SDOAS Research Fellowship,"The ideas for this article have long been in development.

Based on that valuation, I develop a model of corporate pension policies in which sponsoring firms weigh contributions to their pension plan against the exercise of growth options in the allocation of limited financial resources. The model shows how corporate pension funding and asset allocation policies are shaped by the sponsoring firms' characteristics, such as growth options, the marginal corporate tax rate, and regulatory variables such as the deficit reduction contribution rate, the variable-rate insurance premium, and the maximum possible fraction of operating assets that can be seized by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.

We investigate the relationship between competition and product liability in a spatial model of oligopoly, where reputation provides a market incentive for safety investment and higher liability may distort consumers' incentive for product care. We find that partial liability, together with reputation concerns, can motivate firms to make safety investment. Increased competition due to less product differentiation diminishes a firm's gain from maintaining reputation and raises the socially desired product liability. On the other hand, an increase in the number of competitors reduces the benefit from maintaining reputation, but has a non-monotonic effect on the potential gain from cutting back safety investment; consequently, the optimal liability may vary non-monotonically with the number of competitors. In general, therefore, the relationship between competition and product liability is subtle, depending on how competition is measured.","[Chen, Yongmin] Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Chen, Yongmin] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Hua, Xinyu] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Zhejiang University; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Chen, YM (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.;Chen, YM (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",Yongmin.Chen@colorado.edu; xyhua@ust.hk,,,Hong Kong Research Grant Council [642211],Hong Kong Research Grant Council(Hong Kong Research Grants Council),"We would like to thank three referees, a co-editor, Albert Choi, Mitchell Polinsky, Kathryn Spier, participants of seminars at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, the University of International Business and Economics, and of the 2016 Annual Meeting of the American Law and Economics Association for their valuable comments.

Matching data from the Survey of International Air Travelers with Bureau of Economic Analysis data on U.S. service outsourcing, we find that international business travel leads to more outsourcing of more complex services. We further provide evidence on the differential role of international business travel by showing that: (i) business travel by managers leads to relatively more outsourcing of more complex services and (ii) business travel by non-diaspora members leads to relatively more outsourcing of more complex services.","[Liu, Runjuan; Scholnick, Barry; Finn, Adam] Univ Alberta, Alberta Sch Business, 3-23 Business Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R6, Canada",University of Alberta,"Liu, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Alberta Sch Business, 3-23 Business Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R6, Canada.",Runjuan.Liu@ualberta.ca,"Finn, Adam/G-9770-2011","Scholnick, Barry/0009-0001-1057-2753","Alberta School of Business, University of Alberta","Alberta School of Business, University of Alberta","We would like to thank Anca Cristea, Sarah Moore, Jennifer Poole, Li Zhou and seminar participants at several universities and conferences for comments.

In practice, though, decision-making takes into account many other aspects that are more. or less political. When properly defined, they may be introduced in the decision process through multi-criteria analysis. Most important among these aspects are redistributive effects, which are, typically, associated to territorial, social and environmental considerations. There are, however, some important redistribution effects that have never been properly analysed and quantified until now. They are related to the evolution, throughout the projects' lifespan, of the costs and benefits of the project affecting successive (overlapped) generations, and of the financing structure adopted, which determines who the final payers will be: either users, through tolls or tariffs for the use of the project, and/or taxpayers. Relating the actual payment for the investment to the net benefits occurring to the users and citizens in general for each generation, it is possible to ascertain if there is a balanced intergenerational distribution of burdens and benefits over the whole project lifecycle. The Intergenerational Redistributive Effects Model (IREM), a model based on a survey based definition of the annual generation, includes an ad-hoc analytical procedure for the establishment of indicators of these effects allowing their comparison among different projects. Such indicators could provide a valuable input into the decision making process and, in particular, in the adoption of a financing structure that represents an adequate share of the actual investment expenditure among those who will benefit from the project.","[Penyalver, Domingo] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Ctr Innovat Transport CENIT, C Jordi Girona 1-3,Edif C3-S120, ES-08034 Barcelona, Spain; [Turro, Mateu] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Transport & Reg Planning, C Jordi Girona 1-3,Edif C3-S120, ES-08034 Barcelona, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Centre Internacional de Metodes Numerics en Enginyeria (CIMNE); Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya,"Penyalver, D (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Cataluna, Ctr Innovat Transport CENIT, C Jordi Girona 1-3,Edif C3-S120, ES-08034 Barcelona, Spain.",domingo.penalver@upc.edu; m.turro@upc.edu,"Rojo, Domingo Peñalver/M-5544-2019","Rojo, Domingo Peñalver/0000-0001-5468-3546",,,,,32,4,4,0,4,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

An analysis of transit mode choice for commute trips in Los Angeles,TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Public transit; Mode choice; Transit service quality; Transit policy; Ridership,BUILT ENVIRONMENT; TRAVEL; DETERMINANTS; DECISIONS; RIDERSHIP; SERVICE; SYSTEM; IMPACT; US,"U.S. public transit agencies struggle to attract and retain riders. Unprecedented public investments have been made over the past several decades for expanding and improving transit service across cities. Unfortunately, however, there is no evidence of increase in ridership once growth in population and aggregate travel demand are accounted for. Consequently, the quest for boosting patronage continues. The challenge, experts argue, is to attract people out of cars. In this paper, I use a recent state-wide travel survey from California and take advantage of a new comprehensive historical archive of regional real-time multi-modal transportation system data to explore contexts in which persons belonging to car-owning households within Los Angeles County use transit for their commute. I find that few car owners use transit, and that lack of access to the household vehicle(s) explain choice of transit to a large extent. While discretionary transit use (or transit use by choice) is rare, I find evidence that fast (relative to car), frequent and reliable transit service along with fewer transfer requirements strongly correlate with car-owners' transit mode choice. Home and workplace neighborhood density, proximity to transit stop, and availability of rail are other critical facilitators. Even if observed effects are due, in part, to self-selection, there are important lessons for transit planners. For example, results suggest that all else equal: reduction in transit-to-auto travel time ratio by unity can increase odds of transit mode choice by about 25%; reduction in headway by 10 min can increase the odds by about 30%, and; lowering the standard deviation of schedule deviation from over to under three minutes can result in 2.6 times increase in the odds. This paper identifies effective strategies for increasing transit's competitiveness relative to auto, and hence attracting people out of their cars. While rail network expansion programs and transit-oriented development efforts must continue across U.S. cities, it is important that planners also advocate for investments in key dimensions of bus service quality that patrons value, such as speed, frequency and reliability. Efficient network designs that reduce transfer requirements, introduction of bus rapid transit services, and improvements in real-time operations, scheduling and long-range planning by using ITS (intelligent transportation systems) infrastructures across modes are critical. This study shows that careful planning can promote discretionary transit use by attracting existing latent demand and by creating new demand in an era of increasing government interest in transit and growing traffic congestion. Broader positive effects on the travelling public and the environment are much greater than what this study can predict.","[Chakrabarti, Sandip] Univ New Orleans, Dept Planning & Urban Studies, 302 Milneburg Hall,2000 Lakeshore Dr, New Orleans, LA 70148 USA",University of Louisiana System; University of New Orleans,"Chakrabarti, S (通讯作者)，Univ New Orleans, Dept Planning & Urban Studies, 302 Milneburg Hall,2000 Lakeshore Dr, New Orleans, LA 70148 USA.",chakrabarti.sandip@gmail.com,,,USC METRANS Transportation Research Center; USC Lusk Center for Real Estate; Lincoln Institute of Land Policy,USC METRANS Transportation Research Center; USC Lusk Center for Real Estate; Lincoln Institute of Land Policy,"This research, conducted when the author was at the University of Southern California, was supported by fellowships from the USC METRANS Transportation Research Center, USC Lusk Center for Real Estate, and the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy.

The current paper aimed to explore potential factors that can be attributed to purchasing PEVs in order to estimate their penetration in 58 California counties. A Multiple Logistic Regression Analysis was applied to the 2012 California Household Travel Survey dataset, which includes both PEV and conventional car buyers' information, as well as some other secondary data sources. The model developed a broad set of factors including demographic and travel-related characteristics, socioeconomic variables, and infrastructural and regional specifications. The results identified that a household's income, maximum level of education in the household, the buyer's car sharing status, charging stations density, and gas price in the region can significantly impact PEV adoption. The model was validated using data from the 2012 Household Travel Survey conducted in the Delaware Valley region. With sufficient data availability, the methodology can be applied to evaluate changes in vehicle fleet composition and the levels of emissions in response to transportation policies. The model is believed to have a wide range of applications in electricity utilizing, gasoline/diesel retailing, and battery and automotive manufacturing. Additionally, the model can assist policy makers and transportation planners to optimize their infrastructural investments by identifying counties where the response of drivers to added charging station would be maximized, implying that larger benefits can be achieved.","[Javid, Roxana J.] Savannah State Univ, Dept Engn Technol, Savannah, GA 31404 USA; [Nejat, Ali] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Civil Environm & Construct Engn, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",University System of Georgia; Savannah State University; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Javid, RJ (通讯作者)，Savannah State Univ, Dept Engn Technol, Savannah, GA 31404 USA.",javidr@savannahstate.edu,"Nejat, Ali/AAY-6681-2020","Nejat, Ali/0000-0002-7169-3380",,,,,70,129,145,7,98,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

The objective of this research is to analyse the effects of perceived value and customer trust, and role of technology in banking service qualities and customers' satisfaction in Pakistani context. For this purpose we employed modified SERVQUAL model with four dimensions such as empathy, competence, reliability, and online service. An adapted questionnaire was used to carry out this survey research, and collected 830 responses from the customers of Pakistani banking industry. We used factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and bootstrapping methods to carry out this research. The results of the study demonstrated that our four-dimensional model of modified SERVQUAL has a significant impact on overall customer satisfaction. It is further concluded from the bootstrapping method that modified SERVQUAL dimensions and customer satisfaction are positively mediated by the perceived value and trust. Finally, it is also concluded that the implementation of technology serves as moderating variable in the banking sector. The outcomes of this research are beneficial to the senior management of banking sector in order to implement the effective and customised online banking structure to gain competitive advantages, and provide vibrant online banking services that enhance the standard and ease of services to the customers and earn their confidence.

Poor quality of service can be attributed to two features of the paratransit business operating model: driver remuneration on the basis of a daily 'target system'; and cash-based business management in which vehicle depreciation is ignored as an operating expense. In Kenya, the voluntary organisation of fragmented inter-city matatu businesses into Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SACCOs) has resulted in improved service, regulatory compliance and technology adoption, but little is known of how they operate. The aim of this paper is to gain insight into how the Kenyan inter-city matatu SACCOs are organised and have improved services, and to explore the transferability of this experience and the lessons it offers. The exploratory nature of the study, and constrained resources, necessitated that the research adopt a qualitative case study method. It was found that most of the case study SACCOs have addressed the root causes of poor service quality by shifting the remuneration of drivers from daily cash targets to salaries, and by requiring vehicle depreciation costing through compulsory contributions to the cooperative's capital savings from which vehicle acquisition and repair loans can be derived. Due to the particular shuttle-like nature of inter-city services and the considerable institutional support that exists in Kenya for cooperatives, the direct transfer of successes to other contexts is likely to prove difficult. Identifying the features of the inter-city SACCO model that have led to paratransit service improvements, and attempting to replicate these, may therefore be more effective than attempting to replicate the model in its entirety. These features are argued to be operator consolidation, accompanied by salaried drivers, systematic vehicle monitoring and compulsory vehicle depreciation costing. They can be adopted in other forms of paratransit organisation and regulation, but will require considerable adaptation to context.","[Behrens, Roger] Univ Cape Town, Dept Civil Engn, Ctr Transport Studies, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa; [McCormick, Dorothy; Ommeh, Marilyn] Univ Nairobi, Inst Dev Studies, POB 30197-00100, Nairobi, Kenya; [Orero, Risper] Kenya Methodist Univ, Dept Business Adm, POB 45240-00100, Nairobi, Kenya",University of Cape Town; University of Nairobi; Kenya Methodist University,"Behrens, R (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Dept Civil Engn, Ctr Transport Studies, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa.",roger.behrens@uct.ac.za; dmccormick@uonbi.ac.ke; risorero@yahoo.com; saramarilyno@gmail.com,,"Behrens, Roger/0000-0002-2969-6641",Development Workshop-Angola,Development Workshop-Angola,"The research presented in this paper was made possible through funding from Development Workshop-Angola, originating from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

This article addresses this gap by integrating an evolutionary dimension in an augmented regional knowledge production function framework to examine the territorial dynamics of knowledge creation in Russia. The empirical analysis identifies a strong link between regional research and development (R&D) expenditure and patenting performance. However, R&D appears inadequately connected to regional human capital. Conversely, multinational enterprises (MNEs) play a fundamental role as global knowledge pipelines. The incorporation of historic variables reveals that the Russian case is a striking example of long-term path dependency in regional patterns of knowledge generation. Endowment with Soviet-founded science cities remains a strong predictor of current patenting. However, current innovation drivers and policies also concur to enhance (or hinder) innovation performance in all regions. The alignment of regional innovation efforts, exposure to localized knowledge flows and injections of foreign knowledge channeled by MNEs make path renewal and path creation possible, opening new windows of locational opportunity.","[Crescenzi, Riccardo; Jaax, Alexander] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Crescenzi, R (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",r.crescenzi@lse.ac.uk; a.jaax@lse.ac.uk,"Crescenzi, Riccardo/F-9165-2014",,"European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union [H2020/2014-2020, 639633-MASSIVE-ERC-2014-STG]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI",European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 Programme H2020/2014-2020 [Grant Agreement no. 639633-MASSIVE-ERC-2014-STG].,,92,39,43,4,51,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

This paper provides detailed evidence on the mechanism by which a public pension system depresses fertility, based on historical data. Our theoretical framework highlights that the effect of a public pension system on fertility is ex ante ambiguous while its size is determined by the internal rate of return of the pension system. We identify an overall negative effect of the introduction of pension insurance on fertility using regional variation across 23 provinces of Imperial Germany in key variables of Bismarck's pension system, which was introduced in Imperial Germany in 1891. The negative effect on fertility is robust to controlling for the traditional determinants of the first demographic transition as well as to other policy changes.","[Fenge, Robert] Univ Rostock, Dept Econ, Ulmenstr 69, D-18057 Rostock, Germany; [Scheubel, Beatrice] European Cent Bank, D-60604 Frankfurt, Germany; [Fenge, Robert; Scheubel, Beatrice] CESifo, Munich, Germany",University of Rostock; European Central Bank; Ifo Institut,"Scheubel, B (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, D-60604 Frankfurt, Germany.;Scheubel, B (通讯作者)，CESifo, Munich, Germany.",robert.fenge@uni-rostock.de; beatrice.scheubel@ecb.europa.eu,,,,,,,82,11,13,3,62,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

This study is based on multiple case studies in the water sector that we carried out in several different countries. Our findings suggest five business model innovations: (a) design, (b) renewal, (c) expansion, (d) diversification and (e) replication. Each business model innovation is a specific response to the barriers met in the BoP market and requires consistent configuration between its various components (i.e. value proposition, value creation and profit equation).

They then make a second, private and anonymous judgement of the probability of the event, which is subsequently aggregated mathematically. The method performed well relative to both an equally weighted linear pool and a prediction market, and is relatively simple to implement. The results indicate the value of discussion for removing arbitrary linguistic uncertainty and for sharing and debating knowledge, thereby improving the judgements. Weighting individual judgements based on prior performance using Cooke's method improved group judgements. Even though some of the results are not statistically significant, the study may not have had sufficient power to detect some important effects.

Therefore, supply chain management (SCM) is considered a strategic factor for the better attainment of organizational goals such as enhanced competitiveness, improved customer service and increased profitability. Because the, Supply chain management as a vital challenge to the Cement industry and developing infrastructure as a whole has been posed by scholars. This article analyses Lean, Agile, Resilient, and Green (LARG) supply chain management competitive strategies in Iranian cement industries. The lean, agile, resilient and green SCM paradigms had been adopted to improve the SC performance. We used Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) technique to weighting strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) based on LARG supply chain management practices for 11 Iranian cement companies. Then the Strategic Position and Action Evaluation (SPACE) matrix used to check if which strategy is appropriate. In the SPACE matrix we assessed Iranian cement industries across four dimensions include: Industry Attractiveness (IA), Environmental Stability (ES), Competitive Advantage (CA) and Financial Strength (FS). The results showed that Iranian cement industries can follow an aggressive strategy as it leverages its strengths into the opportunities. Iranian cement industries are also blessed because it has a good competitive advantage in an industry which is considered to be attractive. Among the strategic choices, develop new local markets strategy has the first priority, followed by the; Increase production capacity, Export markets development, Diversification in product with QSPM method. Finally, some actions recommended for Iranian cement industries in such a strong position.","[Jamali, Gholamreza; Asl, Elham Karimi] Persian Gulf Univ, Dept Ind Management, Bushehr, Iran; [Hashemkhani Zolfani, Sarfaraz] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Dept Management Sci & Technol, Technol Foresight Grp, Tehran, Iran; [Hashemkhani Zolfani, Sarfaraz] Kerman Univ Med Sci, Hlth Serv Management Res Ctr, Inst Futures Studies Hlth, Kerman, Iran; [Saparauskas, Jonas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Vilnius, Lithuania",Persian Gulf University; Amirkabir University of Technology; Kerman University of Medical Sciences; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Jamali, G (通讯作者)，Persian Gulf Univ, Dept Ind Management, Bushehr, Iran.",gjamali@pgu.ac.ir; Elh.karimiasl@gmail.com; sa.hashemkhani@gmail.com; jonas.saparauskas@vgtu.lt,"Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani/AAA-9918-2021; Jamali, Gholamreza/Q-7722-2019; Karimi Asl, Elham/KAL-8204-2024","Jamali, Gholamreza/0000-0002-2994-9143; Karimi Asl, Elham/0009-0006-1241-4683",,,,,65,15,15,4,34,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

We also investigate the different effects of four categories of factors, namely intermediate inputs, consumption, investment and exports. We find that intermediate inputs and consumption are the main forces behind the decline in the proportion of agricultural GDP in these three countries. Furthermore, the different intermediate inputs of industries and the different degrees of consumption of various sectors can result in different effects.

However, the situation with award of compensation is controversial. The jurisprudence illustrates many approaches to the assessment of the issue of damage and payment of compensation. In the paper will be analyzed several cases and approaches of the tribunals to the compensation of expropriation of the foreign investments in the frame of the EU-Russian commercial relations, specifically in the gas sector. Since, the issue of the compensation of expropriation in the capital intensive investment projects is very sensitive, especially in the field of the state owned natural resources field, thus it should be considered carefully. The article suggests to include to the international and bilateral investment treaties the specific and concrete methods and approaches to the compensation of expropriation, based on the analysis of the relevant cases.

Doing so, we developed an environmental computable general equilibrium model and investigate carbon tax policy responses in the economy applying exogenously different degrees of carbon tax into the model. Three simulations were carried out using an Algerian social accounting matrix. The carbon tax policy illustrates that a 1.52 % reduction of carbon emission reduces the nominal GDP by 1.26 % and exports by 3.04 %; a 2.67 % reduction of carbon emission reduces the nominal GDP by 1.92 % and exports by 4.86 %; and a 3.72 % reduction of carbon emission reduces the nominal GDP by 3.79 % and exports by 6.90 %. Imposition of successively higher carbon tax results in increased government revenue from the baseline by 23.68, 50.18, and 76.38 %, respectively. However, fixed capital investment increased in scenario 1a (first) by 0.23 % but decreased in scenarios 1b (second) and 1c (third) by 0.35 and 2.03 %, respectively, from the baseline. According to our findings, policy makers should consider initial (first) carbon tax policy. This policy results in achieving reasonably good environmental impacts without losing the investment, fixed capital investment, investment share of nominal GDP, and government revenue.","[Mohammed, Touitou] Univ Algiers 3, Fac Econ Commercial & Managements Sci, Rd Ahmed Oueked, Dely Brahim, Algeria",University of Algiers 3 Ibrahim Sultan Cheibout,"Mohammed, T (通讯作者)，Univ Algiers 3, Fac Econ Commercial & Managements Sci, Rd Ahmed Oueked, Dely Brahim, Algeria.",touitoutouitou@yahoo.fr,,,,,,,26,39,58,0,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-48454-9; 978-3-319-48453-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,1,20,,10.1007/978-3-319-48454-9_1,0.0,,,20,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1MX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447881400001,0

The research results revealed that both entrepreneurial orientation and market orientation are positively associated with business performance, and that market orientation partially mediates the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and business performance.

The quantification of the economic loss presents complex characteristics linked to the number of subjects and objects potentially involved in the accident, to be translated into the definition of a multiple function of the loss that connects the dependent variable (the loss) with the set of independent variables ascribable to different cost voices linked to road accidents-loss of the productive ability, human costs, sanitary costs, administrative costs, legal costs, and material damage to third parties' properties. The valuation of the aforementioned costs supposes practical and methodological questions; the practical problem concerns data availability, the methodological question concerns the tools. The problem can be solved within an evaluative perspective, after having defined the valuation's standards and the valuation's procedures, identifying them among the ones recognized by the International Valuation Standards (IVS). This work proposes to address the problem of the social costs of road accidents in evaluative terms, defining first standards and procedures of valuation, with particular reference to social costs from road accident related to human costs, both patrimonial and non-patrimonial ones.","[Salvo, Francesca; De Ruggiero, Manuela; Farace, Valentina] Univ Calabria, Environm & Chem Engn Dept, Cubo 46b, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy",University of Calabria,"Salvo, F (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, Environm & Chem Engn Dept, Cubo 46b, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy.",francesca.salvo@unical.it; manueladeruggiero@gmail.com; valentinafarace@libero.it,"Salvo, Francesca/AAD-7215-2019",", Salvo Francesca/0000-0002-3085-3966; De Ruggiero, Manuela/0000-0001-5895-7073",,,,,26,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1865-3529,,978-3-319-49676-4; 978-3-319-49675-7,GREEN ENERGY TECHNOL,,,2017,,,,,,,241,253,,10.1007/978-3-319-49676-4_18,0.0,,,13,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI6HB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413289600018,0

Two-fold findings are discussed: the hybrid practices impacting on host market institutions, involving laws and regulations, fair competition, business networks, empowerment, corporate social responsibility, employee retention and quality control; and those impacting on consumption patterns, involving tailored offerings, targeting, new market ideology, store location, price and cost leadership. By doing so, the TNCs create new competitive pressures on China's retail market. The findings show the transfer of management practices that do not align with a host market may subtly alter its norms and practices. To sustain competitive advantage and enhance territorial embeddedness, the TNCs switch their key stakeholders from the governments to their businesses, the society and the consumers over time.

Our analysis enables the evaluation of social, economic and environmental aspects of urban life that represent the determinants of cities' competitive profiles and consequently, the positions on the ranking lists. The research is based on the data on perceptions of citizens on different aspects of urban quality, provided by the Eurostat's Urban Audit Perception Survey. For the assessment of various hierarchically structured indicators of cities' smart performance, a multi-criteria analysis model is developed, combining the AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) for determining the relative importance of criteria and TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method of ranking. The main finding of the paper implies that direct perceptions of citizens on the overall life satisfaction in the analyzed European cities are not influenced by their smart performance. The comparison of ranks obtained by the constructed multi-criteria model and perceived satisfaction of life indicates a rather weak relation.","[Stankovic, Jelena; Dzunic, Marija; Marinkovic, Srdan] Univ Nis, Fac Econ, Trg Kralja Aleksandra 11, Nish 18000, Serbia; [Dzunic, Zeljko] Univ Nis, JUNIS, Univ Ski Trg 2, Nish 18000, Serbia",University of Nis; University of Nis,"Stankovic, J (通讯作者)，Univ Nis, Fac Econ, Trg Kralja Aleksandra 11, Nish 18000, Serbia.",jelena.stankovic@eknfak.ni.ac.rs; marija_dzunic@ni.ac.rs; z.dzunic@ni.ac.rs; srdjan.marinkovic@eknfak.ni.ac.rs,"Dzunic, Marija/HME-2028-2023; Stanković, Jelena J./P-6945-2018","Dzunic, Marija/0000-0001-5269-1921; Stanković, Jelena J./0000-0002-9875-9861; Marinkovic, Srdan/0000-0001-9012-9454; Dzunic, Zeljko/0000-0002-0249-9904",,,,,65,30,31,0,36,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

This issue has been considered on the basis of many studies, observations, and interviews with business executives, their employees and customers. With reference to them, it can be easily seen that in the new dynamically changing market, where the companies are oriented not only on efficiency, but also on modernization and even survival, a lot of them lose half of their customers within five years, half of their employees within four years and half of their investors within less than a year. This disturbing phenomenon clearly requires the need or even the necessity to understand the organizational culture in a new way concerning its integral aspect created by relationship built on three levels: company vs. employee, company vs. customer and employee vs. customer. An integral approach to the culture is so important as it is a set of values and norms of conduct that are the source of energy and a stimulator of company's activities aimed to reach its particular objective and at the same time a basic factor to fulfill its mission and implement the strategy of improving its business effectiveness. Moreover, the culture represents identity of company, affects its image and strengthens its reputation. Therefore, the subject of this paper is presented in three aspects: Integration of customer-oriented organizational culture; Integration of employee-oriented organizational culture; Employee orientation to customer needs. To study the problem more deeply, the research was carried out using survey and analytical-synthetic methods.","[Swierszcz, Katarzyna] Mil Univ Technol, Fac Logist, Ul Gen Sylwestra Kaliskiego 2, PL-00908 Warsaw, Poland",Military University of Technology in Warsaw,"Swierszcz, K (通讯作者)，Mil Univ Technol, Fac Logist, Ul Gen Sylwestra Kaliskiego 2, PL-00908 Warsaw, Poland.",katarzyna.swierszcz@wat.edu.pl,"Świerszcz, Katarzyna/D-6335-2018","Świerszcz, Katarzyna/0000-0002-1819-6705",,,,,15,2,2,6,13,VOLKSON PRESS,KUALA LUMPUR,"C-3A-15 CENTRIO PANTAI HILLPARK, JALAN PANTAI MURNI, BANGSAR SOUTH,, KUALA LUMPUR, WILAYAH PERSEKUTUAN KUALA LUMPUR 59200, MALAYSIA",,,978-1-948012-02-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,316,319,,10.26480/icemi.01.2017.316.319,0.0,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM2GZ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000461012100109,0

This paper focuses on the topic of which type of ownership results in better performance, family firm or non-family firm. Using A-share stock market data from 2003 to 2014, we examine the relationship between ownership and firm performance, and consider the impact of the type of family firms and management authority on firm performance. In addition, we built a model to evaluate, the impact of firm size, firm age, firm leverage, growth, and industry factors. Evaluation of the data shows that firm performance of family firms controlled by single natural person, single family, and the whole family are in descending order. We also find that greater management power can significantly reduce the performance of family performance, but all types of family firms' performance are significantly better than that of non family firms. The model is found to be robust, and can be used to evaluate company performance.","[Tang, Liang; Lu, Kangyin; Wu, Wei] Northeast Normal Univ, Business Sch, Jingyue Str 2555, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China",Northeast Normal University - China,"Tang, L (通讯作者)，Northeast Normal Univ, Business Sch, Jingyue Str 2555, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China.",tangl123@nenu.edu.cn; Luky440@nenu.edu.cn; Wuw451@nenu.edu.cn,"Tang, Liang/AAV-7726-2020","Lu, Kangyin/0000-0002-0698-1327",,,,,23,2,2,0,16,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Electronic commerce allowed selling and buying of products or services to many times larger number of customers than ever before. Electronic banking as a part of electronic commerce is nowadays very important distribution channel for banking services. With the intense development of information and communication technologies also several forms of electronic banking arose and also vanished. Especially mobile banking recorded turbulent development in recent decades. Mobile banking in smart devices together with internet banking are now the main forms asserting in the electronic banking market. Competition among banks in the field of electronic banking pushes them to improve their electronic banking services to sustain or increase their market share. The important issue is trust of bank customers in the form of electronic banking used. Banks' customers also sensitively perceive security of electronic banking forms used by them. In this article, we mainly investigated the influence of security and trust on electronic banking adoption. Research model based on technology acceptance model was developed and research hypotheses based on this research model were constructed. Data for hypotheses verification was gathered by online survey with 211 answering respondents. The influence of perceived security, trust, attitude toward using and behavioral intention to use electronic banking in Slovakia was examined using factor analysis. The results reveal that all factors investigated have statistically significant direct and indirect effects on electronic banking adoption by users on the Slovak retail banking market.","[Vejacka, Martin] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Appl Math & Business Informat, Kosice, Slovakia; [Stofa, Tomas] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Banking & Investment, Kosice, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice; Technical University Kosice,"Vejacka, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Appl Math & Business Informat, Kosice, Slovakia.",martin.vejacka@tuke.sk; tomas.stofa@tuke.sk,"Vejačka, Martin/P-2998-2016; Štofa, Tomáš/AAH-4415-2019","Vejačka, Martin/0000-0002-9761-7597; Štofa, Tomáš/0000-0002-9824-3531",,,,,59,9,11,4,30,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Financial distress jeopardizes the continuity of an alliance and the value of the investments involved. Thus, firms should reduce leverage to signal continued commitment and to induce investments from alliance partners. Accordingly, we find that a firm's current alliance propensity predicts its subsequent capital structure decisions and that this relationship is most pronounced in the presence of other exchange hazards.

Directive 2009/16/EC, as amended, which entered into force on January 2011, is the latest version of those Directives. Aside from specifying targeting, inspection, and detention procedures, this piece of legislation establishes that each Member State (MS) shall be inspected every five years by the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) to monitor the level of implementation and enforcement of the Directive. We analysed 25 inspection reports prepared by the Agency in connection with MSs inspections, to determine levels of implementation, compliance, and harmonisation with the provisions of the Directive 2009/16/EC. This article summarizes the main shortcomings and observations as identified in the inspection reports and concludes that while the Directive has been properly implemented by the MSs, there remain areas where harmonisation is yet to be achieved.

We follow birth cohort 1979 from age 16 until age 35 and compare spatial trajectories between university graduates(-to-be) and their lower educated peers. We conclude that, in a context of dominating rural-to-urban migration flows, the highest educated(-to-be) are more than others attracted to metropolitan core areas and the Randstad. Second, we aim to test whether this urban preference may be prompted by spatial variation in socio-economic progression by comparing changes in the relative wage position of employees in different spatial settings. Metropolitan settings and the Randstad in general are found to function more than other regions as socio-economic escalators during the first phase of the labour career.

This question, fundamental to travel demand management and land-use planning, has only been partially addressed in the literature so far. The impacts on travel to the destination concerned have been studied, but not the impacts on wider travel behaviour. This paper reports on a natural experiment related to destination parking, where a university removed the right of most undergraduates living off-campus to park on its main suburban campus. A survey was conducted to compare the travel behaviours of two groups of undergraduate students: the first group started before and the second group started after the introduction of the parking restriction (n = 858). The survey captured licence,holding, c.ar. availability. during the term and vacation periods, and the mode of-transport used to travel to campus and for the last trip to another location. The parking restriction was associated with a fall in the modal share of driving to campus of nine percentage points. Car availability during term-time fell by 14 percentage points and licence-holding fell by nine percentage points. The policy change was associated with greater changes amongst females than males. Overall, the results suggest that removing the right of young adults to park at a frequent destination delayed their acquisition of driving licences and cars. These findings may explain part of the fall in licence-holding observed amongst young adults in Great Britain in recent decades.","[Melia, Steve; Clark, Ben] Univ West England, Ctr Transport & Soc, Bristol, Avon, England",University of West England,"Melia, S (通讯作者)，Coldharbour Lane, Bristol BS13 1QY, Avon, England.",steve.melia@uwe.ac.uk,,,,,,,27,9,10,2,24,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Whether there is an economically-optimal equilibrium of uneven-aged forest can be tested deterministically by varying interest rate i. To answer this question, optimisation focused on maximising the net present value for the long-term period was performed using the Subplex algorithm integrated within a density-dependent stand-level matrix transition model. A regular-grid inventory of mixed uneven-aged forests in the West Carpathians, Central Slovakia, was used to parameterise the model. The results showed that a steady state can be reached that is characterised either by a near equilibrium at an i of 1% and higher, or by a continuous fluctuation at an i of 0% and 0.5%. When starting optimisation with a real stand situation with i of 2% and higher, deviations from an equilibrium state appeared both at the beginning and end of the optimisation run. The conclusion is therefore to only interpret the middle-stabilised sequence from the long-term optimisation results as a real equilibrium. Considering the individual target diameter specific for crown size and stem quality of trees within the extended matrix model improved the financial results by 7%. Crown size, representing tree vigour and growth potential, was more important for the improvement of financial results compared to stem quality related to timber price.","[Roessiger, Joerg; Kulla, Ladislav] Forest Res Inst Zvolen, Natl Forest Ctr, TG Masaryka 22, Zvolen 96092, Slovakia; [Bosel'a, Michal] Tech Univ Zvolen, Fac Forestry, TG Masaryka 24, Zvolen 96053, Slovakia",National Forest Center - Slovakia; Technical University Zvolen,"Roessiger, J (通讯作者)，Forest Res Inst Zvolen, Natl Forest Ctr, TG Masaryka 22, Zvolen 96092, Slovakia.",rossiger@nlcsk.org,"Bosela, Michal/J-6051-2014; Roessiger, Joerg/AAF-2940-2020; Roessiger, Joerg/GLV-1343-2022","Bosela, Michal/0000-0001-6706-8614; Roessiger, Joerg/0000-0002-2450-7477; Roessiger, Joerg/0000-0002-2450-7477",Slovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-0439-12 FORESTMAN: 70%]; Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Slovak Republic [08V0301],Slovak Research and Development Agency(Slovak Research and Development Agency); Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Slovak Republic,This work was supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency (Project APVV-0439-12 FORESTMAN: 70%); and by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Slovak Republic (Item No. 08V0301 - Project VIPLES: 30%).,,53,9,9,0,15,NOW PUBLISHERS INC,HANOVER,"PO BOX 1024, HANOVER, MA 02339, UNITED STATES",1104-6899,1618-1530,,J FOREST ECON,J.

Applying stochastic actor-oriented models on longitudinal relational data from a mature cluster in a medium-tech industry, we show that triadic closure and geographical proximity increase the probability of tie creation but does not influence tie persistence. Cognitive proximity is positively correlated to tie persistence but firms create ties to cognitively proximate firms only if they are loosely connected through common third partners.

Some of these policy recommendations are quite consistent with what has often been proposed for the past three decades, which is that redistributive policies or welfare at the bottom should benefit the least well-off and address inequality.","[Rani, Uma] Int Labor Org, Res Dept, 4 Route Morillons, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland",,"Rani, U (通讯作者)，Int Labor Org, Res Dept, 4 Route Morillons, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",amara@ilo.org,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

However, the feasibility of introducing large numbers of fuel cell electric trucks, buses, and vans to the roads remains unclear, in part because the MHDV market is highly diverse in terms of vehicle size, use, and vocation. This paper attempts to answer the question: will hydrogen fuel cell MHDVs be space or weight constrained given their range of operation? The results suggest that most MHDVs have sufficient space for hydrogen storage tanks under the side rails, behind the cab, and/or under the chassis to accommodate 90 percent of each vehicle segment's daily range of operation, although identifying a standard size, design, and placement of these components may be challenging.","[Kast, James; Morrison, Geoffrey; Gangloff, John J., Jr.] Oak Ridge Inst Sci & Educ, US DOE, Fuel Cell Technol Off, 1000 Independence Ave SW, Washington, DC 20585 USA; [Vijayagopal, Ram] Argonne Natl Lab, 9700 S Cass Ave, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Marcinkoski, Jason] US DOE, Fuel Cell Technol Off, 1000 Independence Ave SW, Washington, DC 20585 USA; [Morrison, Geoffrey] Cadmus Grp Inc, Waltham, MA USA",Oak Ridge Associated Universities; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge Institute for Science & Education; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Argonne National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE),"Kast, J (通讯作者)，Oak Ridge Inst Sci & Educ, US DOE, Fuel Cell Technol Off, 1000 Independence Ave SW, Washington, DC 20585 USA.",jamesfkast@gmail.com; gmorrison101@gmail.com; jgang87@gmail.com; rvijayagopal@anl.gov; jason.marcinkoski@gmail.com,,,"Department of Energy (DOE) Office of the Secretary; DOE [DE-AC05-060R23100]; Argonne, a U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science laboratory [DE-AC02-06CH11357]","Department of Energy (DOE) Office of the Secretary; DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Argonne, a U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This research was supported in part by the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of the Secretary administered by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) for the DOE.

High-speed rail projects are often among the worst practices for cost overruns and demand overestimation, even where traffic figures may tell a history of apparent success. In the paper, we analyse two significant cases of delusions of success, namely the Italian and Spanish HSR programmes. The Italian one shows excellent demand performances, but is among the continent's worst cases for construction costs. The Spanish one, recognised worldwide as one of the most successful outcomes of HS policy, is the one where potential demand estimations were systematically neglected, and the planned network appears largely out-of-scale compared to actual traffic. In both cases, the forecasts were not simply biased, as well-known literature on megaproject failures has clearly shown: Italian lines were deliberately designed to increase the cost, and the Spanish network was deliberately planned out-of-scale. By means of the two cases, the paper will show that the core of the problem does not lie in the wrong estimations, but in deliberate choices of overinvestment, overdesign and overquality.","[Beria, Paolo] Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture & Urban Studies DAStU, Milan, Italy; [Albalate, Daniel; Bel, Germa] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econometr Stat & Appl Econ, Barcelona, Spain",Polytechnic University of Milan; University of Barcelona,"Beria, P (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture & Urban Studies DAStU, Milan, Italy.",paolo.beria@polimi.it; graffagraffa@gmail.com; albalate@ub.edu; gbel@ub.edu,"Albalate, Daniel/N-8124-2019; Bel, Germà/A-1388-2008; Beria, Paolo/A-9439-2010","Albalate, Daniel/0000-0002-4940-4589; Bel, Germà/0000-0002-1330-8085; Grimaldi, Raffaele/0000-0002-7832-2398; Beria, Paolo/0000-0001-5171-6576","Italian Ministry of Education University and Research (MIUR), within the SIR programme [RBSI14JR1Z, 197]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO-2016-76866-R]; SGR, Government of Catalonia [2017-SGR-644]","Italian Ministry of Education University and Research (MIUR), within the SIR programme(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); SGR, Government of Catalonia","The Italian part of the research is derived from the project QUAINT (grant number: RBSI14JR1Z), supported by the Italian Ministry of Education University and Research (MIUR), within the SIR programme (D.D. n. 197 del 23 gennaio 2014).

A tendency is seen for optimal speed limits to become higher. In the most recent estimates made for Norway, the optimal speed limit was in no case lower than 60 km/h. Adopting a speed limit of 60 km/h on roads in urban areas now having speed limits of 30, 40 or 50 km/h would most likely lead to an increase in the number of accidents and killed or injured road users. It is a political objective in Norway to reduce the number of killed or injured road users and to encourage more walking and cycling. Raising speed limits would conflict with both these objectives. This paper discusses if a re-interpretation of the notion of optimal speed limits can applied to justify low speed limits in urban areas. Traditionally, analyses of optimal speed limits have included motorised travel only. It is shown by means of simple numerical examples, that by including the effects of motorised travel speed on walking and cycling, optimal speed limits tend to be lower than when only motorised travel is included.","[Elvik, Rune] Inst Transport Econ, Gaustadalleen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway",Institute of Transport Economics,"Elvik, R (通讯作者)，Inst Transport Econ, Gaustadalleen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway.",re@toi.no,,"Elvik, Rune/0000-0003-1460-350X",Norwegian Public Roads Administration [15/251550],Norwegian Public Roads Administration,The study presented in this paper was funded by the Norwegian Public Roads Administration (15/251550).,,32,5,5,0,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

J,"Coetzee, J",,,,"Coetzee, Johan",,,Strategic implications of Fintech on South African retail banks,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,IMPACT; TRUST,"Background: Since the global financial crisis, banks have been exposed to new opportunities and threats unprecedented in history driven fundamentally by technology. So-called 'Fintech disruptors' are aggressively tapping into their service delivery chain to offer clients a better (cheaper, more convenient or efficient) value proposition. As banks have subsequently been forced to think more strategically about how to conduct themselves due to the imminent use of, for example, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, biometrics and big data, regulators have simultaneously had to ensure that the pervasiveness of technological disruption does not threaten the soundness of banks and the stability of economies. Aim: To identify the strategic implications of Fintech on South African retail banks. Setting: The study is conducted in the South African retail banking industry. Methods: A post-positivist paradigm approach that is qualitative in nature. Results: There are several main findings: firstly, technology-based skills are becoming mandatory for staff and regulators alike; secondly, interaction policy is migrating clients towards a remote-based distribution strategy; thirdly, the bank of the future will not rely as heavily on brick-and-mortar branches as it has in the past; fourthly, new competitors are entering the fray and offer competitive digital-only solutions; finally, given the innovation and growth shown by these disruptors, financial sector regulators will have to find ways to hold them accountable. Conclusion: By adapting to the Fintech revolution, South African retail banks are hoping to become strategically pre-emptive rather than merely proactive. This will allow them not only to identify opportunities first, but also to offer solutions before competitors are able to do either of these.","[Coetzee, Johan] Univ Free State, Dept Econ & Finance, Bloemfontein, South Africa",University of the Free State,"Coetzee, J (通讯作者)，Univ Free State, Dept Econ & Finance, Bloemfontein, South Africa.",coetzj@ufs.ac.za,"Coetzee, Johan/O-7574-2019","Coetzee, Johan/0000-0001-8457-8261",,,,,70,18,34,7,56,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

We use data covering the years 2001 to 2011, a period which encompasses the boom, bubble and collapse in the Irish housing market. We find that the household formation decision is affected by the rent-to-income ratio while tenure choice depends upon the difference between rent and the user cost of housing, a notional cost of services derived from owning a home. After the crash, the balance of these costs favoured renting, resulting in a decrease in owner occupancy. In addition, we find that falling average rents caused entry to the housing market to become more affordable, and that this was linked to significantly higher household formation rates.","[Byrne, David] Cent Bank Ireland, Dublin, Ireland; [Duffy, David] Irish Business & Employers Confederat, Dublin, Ireland; [FitzGerald, John] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland",European Central Bank; Central Bank of Ireland; Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI),"FitzGerald, J (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland.",john.fitzgerald@esri.ie,,,National Asset Management Agency (NAMA); Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (bpfi),National Asset Management Agency (NAMA); Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (bpfi),"This paper was prepared as part of a research programme funded jointly by the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) and the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (bpfi).

Investigations have looked at domestic (US) poverty as well as its global manifestations at the base of the pyramid. Together they form a body of scholarship with underlying assumptions about what scholars, policy makers, and consumer advocates believe constitutes being poor versus not being poor. While these studies have much to offer, ambiguous definitions of impoverishment guide their research, which also include choices among possible measurement instruments. To address this deficit, our article approaches the differences in research focus across constituencies, seeking to understand how poverty is both defined and measured within our field. Under the conceptual foundation of the consumption adequacy perspective, we advance a definition of poverty that is used to determine the lived experiences of material impoverishment.","[Farrell, Justine Rapp] Univ San Diego, Mkt, San Diego, CA 92110 USA; [Hill, Ronald Paul] George Washington Univ, Sch Business, Dept Strateg Management & Publ Policy, Business Eth, Washington, DC 20052 USA",University of San Diego; George Washington University,"Farrell, JR (通讯作者)，Univ San Diego, Mkt, San Diego, CA 92110 USA.",jrapp@sandiego.edu; ronhill@email.gwu.edu,"Hill, Ronald/GOK-1216-2022",,,,,,51,17,17,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

Employers can statistically discriminate based on group membership as well as criminal records. It first shows that self-fulfilling expectations cannot exist when there are diminishing returns to deterrence from increasing expected sanctions. This eliminates the possibility of multiple equilibria within groups, and suggests that statistical discrimination by employers can only be motivated by differences across groups' criminal tendencies. This type of statistical discrimination typically leads to an increase in crime, and the article identifies sufficient conditions for this result. This suggests that societies in which group membership is salient (e.g. due to racial heterogeneity) are, ceteris paribus, likely to have higher crime rates. Attempting to fix the negative impacts of statistical discrimination through policies that reduce the visibility of criminal records (e.g. ban the box) increases crime further. Moreover, such policies cause greater negative effects for law abiding members of the higher-criminal-tendency group, which is consistent with the unintended consequences associated with ban the box campaigns discussed in the empirical literature.","[Mungan, Murat C.] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,"Mungan, MC (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Antonin Scalia Law Sch, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",mmungan@gmu.edu,,"Mungan, Murat/0000-0003-1948-6488",,,,,27,8,11,1,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1465-7252,1465-7260,,AM LAW ECON REV,Am.

The objective of this paper was to compare the predictive ability of univariate and bivariate models, in terms of forecasting US gross national product (GNP) growth at different forecasting horizons, with the bivariate models containing information on a measure of economic uncertainty. Based on point and density forecast accuracy measures, as well as on equal predictive ability (EPA) and superior predictive ability (SPA) tests, we evaluate the relative forecasting performance of different model specifications over the quarterly period of 1919:Q2 until 2014:Q4. We find that the economic policy uncertainty (EPU) index should improve the accuracy of US GNP growth forecasts in bivariate models. We also find that the EPU exhibits similar forecasting ability to the term spread and outperforms other uncertainty measures such as the volatility index and geopolitical risk in predicting US recessions. While the Markov switching time-varying parameter vector autoregressive model yields the lowest values for the root mean squared error in most cases, we observe relatively low values for the log predictive density score, when using the Bayesian vector regression model with stochastic volatility. More importantly, our results highlight the importance of uncertainty in forecasting US GNP growth rates.","[Segnon, Mawuli] Univ Munster, Ctr Quantitat Econ, Munster, Germany; [Segnon, Mawuli] Mark E AG, Hagen, Germany; [Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa; [Bekiros, Stelios] European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, Florence, Italy; [Bekiros, Stelios] IPAG Business Sch, Paris, France; [Wohar, Mark E.] Univ Nebraska Omaha, Dept Econ, Omaha, NE USA; [Wohar, Mark E.] Loughborough Univ Technol, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough, Leics, England",University of Munster; University of Pretoria; European University Institute; IPAG Business School; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Omaha; Loughborough University,"Segnon, M (通讯作者)，Ctr Quantitat Econ, Stadtgraben 9, D-48143 Munster, Germany.",segnon@uni-muenster.de,"Bekiros, Professor Dr. Stelios/K-4041-2014","Bekiros, Professor Dr. Stelios/0000-0002-9376-8726; Wohar, Mark/0000-0002-4967-0609",,,,,67,19,19,2,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

We consider a problem in which emerald ash borer (EAB) spreads from an infested to an uninfested jurisdiction, where both contain ash trees on public and private land. We develop a dynamic model of cooperative Nash bargaining to examine how the mix of land ownership within each municipally affects the path of a negotiated transfer payment from the uninfested to the infested jurisdiction. Using a numerical simulation, we demonstrate that a bargaining agreement can be reached only below a threshold level of public land ownership in the infested municipally. The value of this threshold depends on the effectiveness of the transfer payment in supporting more intensive control efforts, such as tree removal, that delay spread. In a landscape with mixed ownership, free riding by private landowners on the public control effort is one factor that leads to a decrease in this threshold. We also find that in the presence of free riding, a bargaining agreement can only exist if the jurisdictions commit to a path of transfer payments that spans multiple years. This suggests a role for higher government to play in supporting multi-year cross-jurisdictional agreements.","[Siriwardena, Shyamani D.; Cobourn, Kelly M.; Amacher, Gregory S.] Virginia Tech, Dept Forest Resources & Environm Conservat, Blacksburg, VA USA; [Haight, Robert G.] USDA Forest Serv Northern Res Stn, St Paul, MN USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Cobourn, KM (通讯作者)，Dept Forest Resources & Environm Conservat, Cheatham Hall 0324,Room 307,310 West Campus Dr, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",kellyc13@vt.edu,,,U.S. Forest Service Northern Research Station,U.S. Forest Service Northern Research Station(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service),This work was supported by the U.S. Forest Service Northern Research Station.,,26,3,4,0,10,"ELSEVIER GMBH, URBAN & FISCHER VERLAG",JENA,"OFFICE JENA, P O BOX 100537, 07705 JENA, GERMANY",1104-6899,1618-1530,,J FOREST ECON,J.

This revealed that cruising time could be reduced by seeking drivers to pay for parking as a way of improving social welfare.","[Brooke, Sarah] Univ Aberdeen, Ctr Transport Res, Sch Engn, Kings Coll, Fraser Noble Bldg, Aberdeen AB24 3UE, Scotland; [Ison, Stephen] Loughborough Univ, Sch Civil & Bldg Engn, Transport Policy, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England; [Quddus, Mohammed] Loughborough Univ, Sch Civil & Bldg Engn, Intelligent Transport Syst, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",University of Aberdeen; Loughborough University; Loughborough University,"Brooke, S (通讯作者)，Univ Aberdeen, Ctr Transport Res, Sch Engn, Kings Coll, Fraser Noble Bldg, Aberdeen AB24 3UE, Scotland.",Sarah.Brooke@abdn.ac.uk; S.G.Ison@lboro.ac.uk; M.A.Quddus@lboro.ac.uk,,,,,,,39,8,8,0,7,UNIV BATH,BATH,"JRNL OF TRANSPORT ECON & POL CLAVERTON DOWN, BATH BA2 7AY, AVON, ENGLAND",0022-5258,1754-5951,,J TRANSP ECON POLICY,J.

This issue has risen in importance with increases in households debt levels and changes in the ways automobile purchases are financed. This paper examines the level of automobile-related debt among lower-income households, and the effects of living in automobile-dependent neighbourhoods, using seven of the largest Canadian metropolitan areas as case studies. Detailed household survey data pertaining to both automobile loans and other forms of debt in 2012 are analyzed and compared with census data related to automobile dependence at the neighbourhood (census tract) level. Descriptive and inferential analyses are presented, demonstrating relationships between levels of automobile dependence and higher relative burdens of household indebtedness, particularly for automobile loans, although the relationships are dependent on, and mediated by, local context. The implications for transport policy are discussed.","[Walks, Alan] Univ Toronto, Dept Geog, 3359 Mississauga Rd, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada",University of Toronto; University Toronto Mississauga,"Walks, A (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Geog, 3359 Mississauga Rd, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada.",alan.walks@utoronto.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC),Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This research was funded by a Grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC).

We contribute to this literature by taking up the assumption that publishers may internalize the harm from termination decisions and illuminate the consequences for the contractual relationship between authors and publishers. We provide a bargaining model, the results of which offer new insights and provide a benchmark for future research. We identify differences in contract structures between terminating and non-terminating authors and introduce some key principles for contractual designs. A risk analysis reveals that, contrary to the view in the literature, a termination option does not necessarily force authors into lotteries.

Methods: This objective was achieved through eliciting and bringing together the views of different stakeholders. Different stakeholders were interviewed using qualitative research methodologies. The sample demographics were fairly representative and ranged from operators to executives and from employee to employer representatives. The main form of data collection was one-on-one face-to-face interviews. Results: One of the major findings of this research is that stakeholders have different levels of understanding of mechanisation and modernisation. The levels of understanding were found to be proportional to the levels of education. Conclusion: There seems to be general support for mechanisation and modernisation among the participants. The identified socio-economic challenges and benefits were relatively similar and aligned among participants. The main difference, however, pertained to the depth and scope of the problem or opportunity as perceived by different participants. Interviewees were also unanimous in identifying the social-economic benefits of mechanisation; these were in line with those identified in the literature, namely benefits in occupational health and safety issues, efficiency, costs and improved life of mines. Furthermore, participants viewed mechanisation and modernisation as an opportunity to reskill themselves and to improve operations and quality of life. More importantly, stakeholders seemed to share a common vision and interest of the future; as such, they were able to see beyond their constituencies and interests.","[Gumede, Hlangabeza] Univ Witwatersrand, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Gumede, H (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Johannesburg, South Africa.",hlangabeza.gumede@gmail.com,,,Oceana Business Re-Engineering; Ayanda Mbanga Communications; Letaba Elihle Investments,Oceana Business Re-Engineering; Ayanda Mbanga Communications; Letaba Elihle Investments,"The research described in this article was carried out by the author for a dissertation at University of Reading (and Henley Business School).

Yet in the United States, wealth inequality between white families and families of color who are earning the same incomes has reached startling levels. The racial wealth gap, which reduces the opportunities available to African American families, has proved to be a pernicious and enduring phenomenon since it was first identified in 1990. This article identifies and explores the role of neighborhoods in creating and perpetuating the ongoing racial wealth gap. Wealth available to a family influences the neighborhood a family is able to afford to live in: through wealth available to purchase a home or wealth available to put down a deposit on an apartment. This article makes the case that the neighborhood a family lives in not only influences social outcomes, but also influences how much wealth a family can build over the years, either as a homeowner or a renter. It also discusses the key wealth mechanisms that influence neighborhood access as well as how a household's neighborhood location influences wealth accumulation. Historical government policies created an inequitable landscape of neighborhoods across the United States. Government policies must seek to address this historical injustice.","[Thomas, Hannah] Abt Associates Inc, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Mann, Alexis] Inst Assets & Social Policy, Waltham, MA USA; [Mann, Alexis] Heller Sch Social Policy, Sociol & Social Policy, Waltham, MA USA; [Meschede, Tatjana] Brandeis Univ, IASP, Waltham, MA 02254 USA; [Meschede, Tatjana] Brandeis Univ, Heller Sch Social Policy & Management, Waltham, MA 02254 USA",ABT Associates; Brandeis University; Brandeis University,"Thomas, H (通讯作者)，Abt Associates Inc, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",Hannah_Thomas@abtassoc.com; armann@brandeis.edu; Meschede@brandeis.edu,,"Meschede, Tatjana/0000-0001-8019-7701",,,,,35,9,11,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Aim and setting: Excluding informal financial transactions in official monetary data, however, underestimates the volume of financial transactions and incorrectly presents the cost of credit, bringing into question the accuracy of expected effects of monetary policy on economic activity. Methods: Using IFS data for Malawi constructed from two survey data sets, indigenous knowledge and elements of Friedman's data interpolation technique, this study employs innovation accounting in a structural vector autoregressive model to compare monetary policy outcomes when IFS data are taken into account and when they are not. Results: The study finds evidence that in certain instances, the formal and informal financial sectors complement each other. For example, it is observed that the rate of inflation as well as output increase following a rise in either formal financial sector (FFS) or IFS lending. Further investigation reveals that in other cases, the FFS and IFS work in conflict with each other. Demonstrating this point, the study finds that a rise in FFS interest rates is followed by a decline in FFS lending while IFS lending does not respond significantly and the response of FFS and IFS loans combined is insignificant. When IFS interest rates are raised, total loans decline significantly. Conclusion: The study, therefore, concludes that exclusion of IFS transactions from official monetary data has the potential to frustrate monetary policy through wrong inferences on the impact of monetary policy on economic activity.","[Ngalawa, Harold] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Durban, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Ngalawa, H (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Durban, South Africa.",ngalawa@ukzn.ac.za,"Ngalawa, Harold Phellix/HGE-9156-2022","Ngalawa, Harold/0000-0002-7040-5594",,,,,43,1,1,0,1,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Information asymmetry is said not only to increase transaction costs and decrease liquidity, but also to diminish the quality of the investment decisions taken by investors, thus weakening the overall functioning of markets. Aim and setting: A well-developed Internet investor relations (IIR) strategy, coupled with increased disclosure levels, should theoretically decrease information asymmetry levels. The majority of related studies to date used either an indirect disclosure proxy or involved an examination of the annual report, and have used data from United States or European companies. Empirical studies to date have produced mixed results. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether a relationship exists between the quality of IIR (via corporate websites) and information asymmetry. Method: This study used data from Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE)-listed companies. Multiple regression analysis was applied with information asymmetry as dependent variable and IIR as one of a set of selected explanatory variables. A self-constructed measurement instrument was used to measure IIR for a sample of 85 companies. Given the inherent difficulty with direct observation of information asymmetry, three different proxies were used to estimate information asymmetry. Results: A significant negative association was found between IIR and information asymmetry for all three information asymmetry proxies that were used: bid-ask spread, price impact, and analyst following. Conclusion: Empirical support is provided for the notion that companies may potentially benefit from a well-developed IIR strategy through reduced information asymmetry.","[Nel, George F.] Univ Stellenbosch, Sch Accountancy, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Smit, Eon] Univ Stellenbosch, Business Sch, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Brummer, Leon M.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Financial Management, Pretoria, South Africa",Stellenbosch University; Stellenbosch University; University of Pretoria,"Nel, GF (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Sch Accountancy, Stellenbosch, South Africa.",gfn@sun.ac.za,,"Nel, George/0000-0001-5503-9883",,,,,43,10,10,3,22,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

A relational view is taken for linking local developments and policies with overarching, more remote spheres of influence and impact, which can be considered both beneficial and critical for the port and the city. In order to illustrate the argument, a framework of three issues is applied to discuss the port-city interface: first, the role of ports as economic engines of their wider region; second, the cruise ship industry as a market segment that re-connects port and city; third, semi-political bodies and institutions that play key roles as intermediaries and knowledge brokers.

We make further use of the variation in bilateral transport costs between all counties in our study area induced by the HSR to identify the strength and spatial scope of agglomeration forces. Our most careful estimate points to an elasticity of output with respect to market potential of 12.5%. The strength of the spillover declines by 50% every 30 min of travel time, diminishing to 1% after about 200 min.

Analyze the preference for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) as opposed to hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) or normal combustible vehicles (NCVs) in Germany. Design. Survey of 400 respondents who stated their preference for one of the three vehicles and considered purchase price, driving range, fuel costs, emissions, refueling availability, refueling time, acceleration and policy incentives. Binary and multinomial choice logit models are applied. Main findings. We find strong evidence that previous experience of driving a BEV and car sharing are significant factors to state a preference for electric cars. Other factors such as driving range, purchase price, gender, ecological awareness and incentives such as tax exemptions also influence the choice. Originality. The preference for BEVs among German customers would increase if granted the opportunity of a driving experience and, more intensely when combined with car sharing opportunities. Increasing the availability of car sharing of electric vehicles seems an excellent way to penetrate the market.","[Guillen, Montserrat; Piulachs, Xavier] Univ Barcelona, Riskctr, Dept Econometr, IREA, Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Guillen, M (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Riskctr, Dept Econometr, IREA, Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",mguillen@ub.edu,"Guillen, Montserrat/E-1407-2011","Guillen, Montserrat/0000-0002-2644-6268",Spanish Ministry of Education [ECO2016-76203-C2-2-P]; ERDF grant [ECO2016-76203-C2-2-P],Spanish Ministry of Education(Spanish Government); ERDF grant,The Spanish Ministry of Education and the ERDF grant ECO2016-76203-C2-2-P is acknowledged.

Moreover, these appeals are first assigned at random to a chamber, with a judge then designated as the rapporteur who will be most closely involved with the case. Using handcollected original data on the background characteristics of EU judges and on competition judgments by the General Court between 1989 and 2015, we test the extent to which the legal origins of judges bear a statistically significant effect on case outcomes and that the rapporteur plays a crucial role in the decision-making process. In particular, if a rapporteur comes from a country whose administrative law has a strong French influence, the decision is more likely to favor the Commission than if he is from any other EU country. These results are robust to alternative political ideology variables, including left-right politics and a preference for European integration.","[Zhang, Angela Huyue] Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Angela Huyue] Kings Coll London, Competit Law & Trade, London, England; [Liu, Jingchen] Columbia Univ, Dept Stat, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Garoupa, Nuno] Texas A&M Univ, Sch Law, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Garoupa, Nuno] Catolica Global Law Sch, Res Innovat, Lisbon, Portugal",University of Hong Kong; University of London; King's College London; Columbia University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Universidade Catolica Portuguesa,"Zhang, AH (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Zhang, AH (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Competit Law & Trade, London, England.",,,,British Academy; NSF [CMMI-1069064]; Army Grant [W911NF-12-R-0012]; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems [1633360] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,British Academy; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Army Grant; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),"We are grateful for the generous help that we received from a number of current and former members and staff of the Court of Justice of the European Union.

We were surprised that the most under subscribed element in the LMS was the set of lecture screencasts since, at least from an anecdotal perspective, students seem to prefer visual/aural learning to reading. Students tended to use elements in a just-in-time fashion. We observed a decrease in usage of the LMS over the course of the semester.

The fast incorporation of iterative possibilities, the increasing of electronic devices, different programming languages costs and legal implications of the use of licenses and author property seems a big challenge to face. Teachers have the expertise in its themes, its own curricula program, general and specific knowledge. Even more, they have the know-how about students learning problems to understand complex themes. In the other side, there are a lot of new possibilities to enhance and make easy the learning-teacher process, however confrontation to constant changes in information and communication technologies, and legal aspects represents a barrier.

For empirical analysis, we utilized asymmetric ARDL technique, which documents the potential asymmetric effects of outward foreign direct investment on economic growth in both the long run and short run. The empirical results suggest that ignoring the intrinsic asymmetries may conceal the true information about the equilibrium relationship among the variables and thus lead to misleading results. Particularly, the findings revealed that economic growth in China responds positively but differently to an increase and decrease in its overseas investment. The empirical evidence obtained through asymmetric model seemed to be superior to that of symmetric model and thus leads to more efficient policymaking to achieve sustainable economic development. Our study contributes to the existing literature by providing new insights on the outward foreign direct investment-led growth hypothesis. The findings suggest that firms investing abroad can bring source country benefits by securing access to key input factors and accessing advanced foreign technology.","[Ali, Usman; Wang, Jian-Jun] Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Shan, Wei] Dalian Med Univ, Dept Ophthalmol, Second Hosp, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Amin, Azka] Shandong Univ, Ctr Econ Res, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China",Dalian University of Technology; Dalian Medical University; Shandong University,"Wang, JJ (通讯作者)，Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Dalian, Peoples R China.",drwangjj@dlut.edu.cn,"Amin, Dr. Azka/AAZ-6312-2021; Wang, Jian-Jun/A-1044-2011; Amin, Azka/JBR-8673-2023; Amin, Azka/HKO-1703-2023","Wang, Jian-Jun/0000-0002-9045-7404; Ali, Usman/0000-0003-0259-9224","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71672019, 71271039, 71421001]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant (number 71672019, 71271039 and 71421001).",,40,38,39,3,22,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Furthermore, to address the issue between economic development, social and environmental sustainability in the present supply chain and operational management (SC&OM) system, organizations must figure out how to adjust these, and enable them to exist together to guarantee supportable practices. This equalization might be conceivable by creating elective vitality sources, as well as generally by significantly containing the development spirals of economy, populace and exhaustion of environmental assets and advance innovations. This exercise in careful control should likewise be joined by a profound understanding that the idea of the issue is the pressure between here and now development and long haul survival. Companies which incorporate sustainability in practices, business ethics and collaboration along entire supply chain tend to be leading in respective industries. Given this situation, incorporation of sustainability issues need to be integrated to competitive and supply chain strategy. Sustainable practices can be defined from many dimensions; however, the most popular dimensions are: economic, social and environmental (Triple Bottom Line). Thus, keeping sustainability issues in the centre, this paper makes an attempt to identify a significant issue that threatening sustainability, analyse the response of the companies on this issue, and finally shows the potential consequence for the companies in case of failure to adopt sustainable SCM practices.","[Bhuyan, Abu Hasanat Md Monzurul Islam] Univ Hull, Kingston Upon Hull, N Humberside, England; [Sarwar, Abdullah] Multimedia Univ, Fac Management, Cyberjaya 63100, Selangor, Malaysia",University of Hull; Multimedia University,"Bhuyan, AMMI (通讯作者)，Univ Hull, Kingston Upon Hull, N Humberside, England.",hasnat6250000@gmail.com; sunabdullah@gmail.com,"Sarwar, Abdullah/G-8388-2014","Sarwar, Abdullah/0000-0001-6475-7393",,,,,59,0,0,3,9,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,4235,4247,,,,,,13,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553205027,0

Value at Risk can be considered as one of the most important risk assessment tools in the financial sector. VaR measurement methods are based on standard Basel I, which describe the exact populated capital requirement calculations depending on the level of risk. This approach did not take into account the distribution of portfolio risks and the volatility of individual risk factors and this was the reason for the formulation of the Basel II rules and the formation of VaR models. This paper provides a brief overview of the historical development of the Value at Risk model from its foundations to the present days. We also focused on describing the basic VaR methods, on clear description of their calculation and comparing of their advantages and disadvantages. Despite the occasional criticism, the Value at Risk model can be considered as a very important and often used risk assessment tool in the financial sector.","[Chutka, Jan; Adamko, Peter] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1-8215, Zilina, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Chutka, J (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1-8215, Zilina, Slovakia.",chutka.jan@fpedas.uniza.sk; peter.adamko@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Adamko, Peter/P-3807-2015; Adamko, Peter/AAE-2567-2021","Adamko, Peter/0000-0001-6256-4475;",[VEGA 1/0428/17],,The paper is an output of the science project VEGA 1/0428/17 Creation of New Paradigms of Financial Management At The Threshold of The 21stcentury In Conditions Of the Slovak Republic.,,18,0,0,0,4,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,8231,8239,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553209021,0

This article examines the consequences that this shift has had for East African firms that are part of global value chains (GVCs). Prior work yielded contradictory expectations: firms might benefit from connectivity through increased efficiencies and improved access to markets, although they might also be further marginalized through increasing control of lead firms. Drawing on extensive qualitative research in Kenya and Rwanda, including 264 interviews, we examine 3 sectors (tea, tourism, and business process outsourcing) exploring overarching, cross-cutting themes. The findings support more pessimistic expectations: small African producers are only thinly digitally integrated in GVCs. Moreover, shifting modes of value chain governance, supported by lead firms and facilitated by digital information platforms and data standards are leading to new challenges for firms looking to digitally integrate. Nevertheless, we also find examples in these sectors of opportunities where small firms are able to cater to emerging niche customers, and local or regional markets. Overall, the study shows that improving connectivity does not inherently benefit African firms in GVCs without support for complementary capacity and competitive advantages.","[Foster, Christopher] Univ Sheffield, Informat Sch, Sheffield S1 4DP, S Yorkshire, England; [Graham, Mark; Friederici, Nicolas] Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, Oxford OX1 3JS, England; [Mann, Laura] London Sch Econ, Dept Int Dev, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Waema, Timothy] Univ Nairobi, Sch Comp & Informat, Nairobi, Kenya",University of Sheffield; University of Oxford; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Nairobi,"Foster, C (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Informat Sch, Sheffield S1 4DP, S Yorkshire, England.",christopher.foster@sheffield.ac.uk; mark.graham@oii.ox.ac.uk; l.e.mann@lse.ac.uk; waema@uonbi.ac.ke; nicolas.friederici@oii.ox.ac.uk,"Waema, Timothy Mwololo/AAW-3446-2021","Waema, Timothy Mwololo/0000-0002-6451-0363; Foster, Christopher/0000-0001-7827-2485; Graham, Mark/0000-0001-8370-9848",ESRC; DFID; ESRC [ES/I033777/1]; ERC [335716]; [RES-167-25-0701]; Alan Turing Institute [TU/B/000042] Funding Source: researchfish; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I033777/1] Funding Source: researchfish; European Research Council (ERC) [335716] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC); ESRC [ES/I033777/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); DFID; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); ; Alan Turing Institute; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This article was based on research funded by the ESRC and DFID.

In this paper, we analyzed the main motivations of tourists when deciding to go on holiday. The questionnaire was applied to a sample of 1010 tourists. It focused on issues such as how to get used to vacation, the budget allocated for a holiday, and how often holidaymakers go on holiday. As a method of research we used the method of the questionnaire and the results obtained were processed by: the association test (Chi-Square), Critical Value, Pearson's C value and Cramer's value V. Regarding the holiday destination, most tourists say they choose to spend their holiday in the coastline at a rate of 44%, while 25% of the respondents choose to go to the mountains and 18% of the interviewees choose to spend their holidays outside the country. Those who choose to spend their holidays in the Danube Delta represent 14% of all interviewed.","[Hontus, Adelaida Cristina; Tindeche, Cristiana; Cretu, Romeo Catalin] Univ Agron Sci & Vet Med, Bucharest, Romania",University of Agronomic Science & Veterinary Medicine - Bucharest,"Hontus, AC (通讯作者)，Univ Agron Sci & Vet Med, Bucharest, Romania.",adelaidahontus@yahoo.com; tindeche_cristina@yahoo.com; creturomeocatalin@yahoo.com,"Tindeche, Cristina/HTQ-7212-2023; HONTUS, ADELAIDA/HTP-6007-2023","Tindeche, Cristina/0009-0000-2401-1300; HONTUS, ADELAIDA/0009-0000-6394-4517",,,,,9,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,4121,4129,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553205014,0

Firms are priori classified into under-or over-invested and effect of financial development is analyzed individually on each classification by using panel data estimations. The research concludes that firms suffering from under(over-) investment problem due to financing constraints (agency problem), are more likely to increase (decrease) their investment in the response of underlying financial development in the economy. This study has demonstrated a novel approach by concurrently incorporating the monitoring and financing issues that disturb the optimal level of investments.

The rationale for the relevance of the chosen topic is that the current stage of socio-economic development of society is characterized by many problems associated with the manifestation of such a phenomenon as the failure of the market, which generally reflects the effectiveness of market self-regulation processes in crisis situations. Under these conditions, there is a need for state regulation of individual processes of economic development. At the same time, in many cases, the action of the mechanisms of state intervention has a multidirectional significance, which should be taken into account when implementing various strategies aimed at stabilizing market relations. The paper deals with two main approaches to the formation of MP - monetarism and keynesianism, which give a different assessment of the regulatory instruments of monetary policy, and the need for government intervention in economic development at the macroeconomic level. Formation and implementation by the Bank of Russia of the main directions of the unified state monetary policy, allows to assert that at the present stage, the achievement of a certain level of inflation is not a sufficient condition for economic growth, and in some cases it slows down, coming into conflict with other instruments of state regulation of the economy. The conclusions made in the work allow us to give general recommendations on the application of certain instruments of the economy state regulation.","[Kichigin, Oleg E.; Degtereva, Viktoriia A.; Nadezhina, Olga S.] Peter Great St Petersburg Polytech Univ, St Petersburg, Russia; [Maleeva, Tatyana V.] Leningrad State Univ, Dept Publ Adm, St Petersburg, Russia",Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University; Saint Petersburg State University,"Kichigin, OE (通讯作者)，Peter Great St Petersburg Polytech Univ, St Petersburg, Russia.",kichigin_oe@spbstu.ru; degtereva_va@spbstu.ru; nadezhina_os@spbstu.ru; maleeva_t@mail.ru,,,,,,,31,1,1,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,6843,6851,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553207081,0

Inter alia, we analyze correlative data dependence of selected variables. The survey is focused also on financial behavior of respondents and their skills in terms of financial literacy concept. Last but not least, we deal with features of respondents' financial decision making under the conditions of risk and uncertainty. At first, we show that statistically significant dependency of FL level on respondents' sex does exist. Male respondents reached higher FL than female ones. Hypothesis of better high school education of economy at Business Secondary School was rejected, rate of financially literate respondents who attended Grammar School or Business Secondary School is comparable. Subsequently, students in their last year of studies at EKF TUKE and NHF EUBA have significantly higher level of FL than those students who are at the beginning of their studies. Contrary, at FM PU the rate of financially illiterate first-year students was lower than the rate of financially literate students in their last year of studies.

Financial organizations representing cloud services are undergoing significant changes under the influence of information technology. Cloud services provide savings through standardization of equipment, virtualization, new features of multiple use of software applications, as well as paying for a new format for the use of resources by the client, which will be the main driving force of the global IT market in the next ten years.Methodology. Methods of analyzing the scientific and information base, methods of synthesizing the obtained data into theoretical conclusions and practical recommendations were applied. The methodological and theoretical basis of the research is the scientific works of domestic and foreign scientists on the theory and practice of economic and financial security. Results. Currently, there are two main areas of development and research for the state, financial companies, banks, as well as for software vendors in Russia and abroad. The first area is software as a service. In due course, all applications that have client demand do not require the need for a licensed purchase, their public access is put on the Internet.

Yet while significant research has identified the integral role of socio-spatial aspects to the duration, composition, performance and coevolution of multinational enterprise (MNE) activity, there is limited understanding of how subnational regions coordinate with investment over time. This paper seeks to explore how subnational regions, and their composite institutions, function in coordinating - or not - to attract multinational investment and facilitate collocation advantages. Using case study analysis of two subnational regions within a single advanced economy, we illustrate the potential variation and implications of subnational institutional structure, posturing and engagement with FDI.

The linear and nonlinear tests have been used to determine the stationarity of unemployment rates. The findings show that in eight out of ten countries, unemployment is a stationary process which implies that the hysteresis hypothesis has not been confirmed. The unemployment rates in Albania, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Croatia, Romania, Greece, Montenegro and Turkey manifest mean reverting behaviour. The movements of unemployment rates in the next period can be forecasted with a relatively high degree of certainty in terms of the mentioned countries. The unemployment in FYR Macedonia and Serbia is a non-stationary process.

The response of businesses and public organizations to this attention is diverse, ranging from developing internal policies and putting demands on suppliers, to philanthropy projects, working directly with suppliers on aspects of labor practices or engaging in activities ensuring human rights in supply chains. The problem, however, is that these efforts are undertaken by very few large companies, while the majority of organizations still have not started addressing social issues in their daily activities.

The first part presents theoretical aspects of sustainable regional development, raises the problems of primary phenomena hindering such development, sustainable development definitions, the role of creativity, the importance of NGOs, good governance of regional space. The next part of the article provides the characteristics of sustainable development indicators selected for the analysis in accordance with the approach adopted by the Central Statistical Office in Poland towards measuring the level of sustainable regional development. The synthetic measure of development (SMD) represents the applied research method, which offered the basis for constructing the ranking and identifying the position of particular Polish regions. The research results remain the core of the study since they illustrate the indicator values in the years under analysis. Within the framework of the final remarks and conclusions it was emphasized that in none of the studied regions, in terms of implementing sustainable development standards, the situation can be assessed as favourable or very favourable and the reasons for such state of the matter were provided. In spite of the relatively unfavourable results, a gradual improvement of the situation was observed over the years. It was pointed out that one of the fundamental barriers to the implementation of sustainable development standards is the absence of awareness and understanding of the discussed development concept.","[Raszkowski, Andrzej; Bartniczak, Bartosz] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Econ Management & Tourism Jelenia Gora, 3 Nowowiejska St, PL-58500 Jelenia Gora, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Raszkowski, A (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Econ Management & Tourism Jelenia Gora, 3 Nowowiejska St, PL-58500 Jelenia Gora, Poland.",andrzej.raszkowski@ue.wroc.pl; bartosz.bartniczak@ue.wroc.pl,"Bartniczak, Bartosz/T-8247-2018",,,,,,53,55,55,0,13,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Due to a more borderless and disruptive world, this strategy is increasingly popular in searching for global talent. However, little is known about the role of international assignment in employer branding. This research explores international assignment branding practices across multi-national companies (MNCs) operated in Indonesia. Focusing on internal and external branding practices, this research examines the implications of international assignment branding practices on women's perception towards towards MNC's attractivenss (external) and on female employees' participation in international assignment (internal). A qualitative approach was adopted using semi-structured interviews with Indonesian female employees across five MNCs as well as female final-year students and fresh graduates. It is found that international assignment is less significant factor of MNC's attractivess compared to other factors, especially interest and economic value. This finding is also supported by MNC's lack of external branding efforts in international assignment branding. It is also found that national culture and work-family issues shape MNC's internal branding practices, which in turn, affect the perception of Indonesian women on international career opportunities. Interestingly, word of mouth plays a role in branding effort, both to prospective and existing employees. While gender bias is not found in international assignment practices across all MNCs, early assignment was found to be effective to boost young and single female employees' participation in international assignment in regards to the presence of work-family conflict.","[Sari, Nayunda A.; Andini, Mutia S.] Univ Indonesia, Depok, Indonesia",University of Indonesia,"Sari, NA (通讯作者)，Univ Indonesia, Depok, Indonesia.",nayunda@ui.ac.id; mutia.slsb@gmail.com,,,Indonesian Endowment Fund For Education and Directorate of Research and Community Engagements Universitas Indonesia,Indonesian Endowment Fund For Education and Directorate of Research and Community Engagements Universitas Indonesia,This research was funded by Indonesian Endowment Fund For Education and Directorate of Research and Community Engagements Universitas Indonesia.,,56,0,0,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,5821,5834,,,,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553206086,0

The management of returnable packaging has a great impact on logistics systems of any company. Efficient management of returnable packaging systems in companies is achieved by monitoring and creating visibility of all transactions carried out along the entire supply chain. In this project, two main problems associated with the management of returnable packaging are addressed in a company of the automotive sector: the constant lack of availability of returnable packaging in production and the complex process of monitoring returnable packaging. The processes of management on returnable systems were analyzed and improvement measures were adopted in order to eliminate the most critical issues of the returnable packaging process.

We focus on regional determinants but estimate panel count data models for firms of different size, thus indirectly controlling for a major firm-level determinant. We find that most of the determinants used in previous studies analysing developed countries are also relevant here. The fit of the model improves, however, when variables that proxy for the specificities of developing economies are considered. We also find that while the exit of micro-small firms seem to be mostly driven by factors that are commonly found in developed countries, large firms are more influenced by factors that are typically not considered in developed countries' studies. These results raise doubts about the usefulness of public policies based on evidence from developed countries and show the importance of a differentiated analysis across firm size.","[Daniela Cala, Carla] Univ Nacl Mar del Plata, Fac Ciencias Econ & Sociales, Funes 3250, RA-7600 Mar Del Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Manjon-Antolin, Miguel; Arauzo-Carod, Josep-Maria] Univ Rovira & Virgili, CREIP, Dept Econ, Ave Univ 1, Reus 43204, Catalonia, Spain; [Manjon-Antolin, Miguel; Arauzo-Carod, Josep-Maria] Univ Rovira & Virgili, QURE, Dept Econ, Ave Univ 1, Reus 43204, Catalonia, Spain; [Arauzo-Carod, Josep-Maria] IEB, Ave Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Catalonia, Spain",National University of Mar del Plata; Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Calá, CD (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Mar del Plata, Fac Ciencias Econ & Sociales, Funes 3250, RA-7600 Mar Del Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina.",dacala@mdp.edu.ar; miguel.manjon@urv.cat; josepmaria.arauzo@urv.cat,"Arauzo-Carod, Josep-Maria/D-6612-2013; Manjon, Miguel/L-5809-2014","Arauzo-Carod, Josep-Maria/0000-0002-3801-223X; Manjon, Miguel/0000-0002-6291-9480; Cala, Carla Daniela/0000-0001-7294-5837",'Xarxa de Referencia d'R+D+I en Economia i Politiques Publiques'; SGR programme of the Catalan Government [2014 SGR 299]; [ECO 2013-41310-R]; [ECO 2014-55553-P],'Xarxa de Referencia d'R+D+I en Economia i Politiques Publiques'; SGR programme of the Catalan Government; ;,"This research was partially funded by ECO 2013-41310-R, ECO 2014-55553-P, the 'Xarxa de Referencia d'R+D+I en Economia i Politiques Publiques' and the SGR programme (2014 SGR 299) of the Catalan Government.

However, the demand for and development of highly mobile or highly accessible roads likely varies according to the level of economic development, and this might have a significant influence on economic growth. The objectives of the present study were twofold: 1) to evaluate how road infrastructure growth facilitates export-led growth processes and 2) to determine the investment level needed for different road types to facilitate economic and commercial activities at different developmental levels. To shed light on these issues, fixed-effects linear regression analysis was conducted using time-series cross-sectional data on the relative improvement in road mobility as compared to improvement in road accessibility (MPA) and economic growth for 60 countries over the period 1980-2010. The key finding of this study was that in countries with a medium and high level of development, improvements in road mobility facilitated export-led growth. This indicates that policies to promote export should be implemented in conjunction with high-mobility road network expansion to enhance economic growth, particularly in countries with a medium level of development, which generally suffer from lower levels of high-mobility road network development. Such expansion in road mobility is necessary to fulfill demands for long-distance travel and enable the transportation of goods and services across regions, thereby facilitating productivity and trade. On the other hand, in countries with a low level of development, more investment is required to build roads with higher accessibility. Such roads are required to facilitate local business and trade activities. This type of road development is necessary to achieve sustainable economic growth in these countries.","[Choy Peng Ng] Univ Pertahanan Nas Malaysia, Fac Engn, Civil Engn Dept, Kuala Lumpur 57000, Malaysia; [Choy Peng Ng; Law, Teik Hua; Kulanthayan, S.] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Engn, Rd Safety Res Ctr, Serdang 43400, Malaysia; [Wong, Shaw Voon] Malaysian Inst Rd Safety Res, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Pertahanan Nasional Malaysia; Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Ng, CP (通讯作者)，Univ Pertahanan Nas Malaysia, Fac Engn, Civil Engn Dept, Kuala Lumpur 57000, Malaysia.",cpng@upnm.edu.my; lawteik@upm.edu.my; wongsv@miros.gov.my; kulan@upm.edu.my,"Law, Teik-Hua/AAO-9999-2021; Wong, Shaw Voon/HLX-8315-2023; Ng, Choy Peng/HPE-1082-2023; Ng, Choy Peng/AAV-9031-2020","Law, Teik-Hua/0000-0002-1560-1672; Ng, Choy Peng/0000-0001-7817-9408; Mani, Kulanthayan/0000-0002-5048-2410",,,,,102,20,22,0,18,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Here, I argue that there is a fundamental mendacity to reconciliation, given stubborn asymmetries of social power and disrespect. Reconciliation as an ideal carries an impetus towards resolution that covers over the necessary role that conflict plays in political strugglesincluding the role that conflict plays within struggles for reconciliation. Nevertheless, despite the mendacity of reconciliation, its meaning still holds political value. Reconciliation implies an orientation towards social repair, which even the strongest critics of reconciliation cannot bring themselves to reject. Some lies are worse than others, and some lies might be noble or necessary. Reconciliation is the lattera fiction that is less pernicious than its absence. In this light, the task is to locate means of political reconciliation that do not obscure the conflicts and asymmetries of social life but enable social actors to face up to these conflicts and to discover novel ways to repair the damage that they can do.","[McIvor, David W.] Colorado State Univ, Polit Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Colorado State University,"McIvor, DW (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Polit Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",david.mci-vor@colostate.edu,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

A differences-in-differences research design permits circumvention of typical endogeneity problems in hedonic price estimations: Namely, the construction of the northwest runway in 2011 led to new aircraft noise exposure and subsequent price decreases in some southern parts of Frankfurt. The paper compares price changes in differentially affected areas around the announcement of the runway location in December 2007 and around its commissioning in October 2011. Noise changes are measured using publicly known noise projections as well as detailed noise assessment data for 2007 and 2012. The results suggest very little realization of externality costs before noise is actually apparent.

Previous studies suggest firms sourcing out IT services to external service providers are generally more process innovative.

As proposed by our framework of differences between manufacturing and service firms, a more detailed analysis reveals that this positive relationship only holds for services firms.

In this context, British researchers, official policymaking bodies and NGOs have put forward the notion of 'transport poverty', building on an implicit analogy between (recognised) fuel poverty and (neglected) transport affordability issues. However, the conceptual similarities and differences between 'fuel' and 'transport' poverty remain largely unaddressed in the UK. This paper systematically compares and contrasts the two concepts, examining critically the assumption of a simple equivalence between them. We illustrate similarities and differences under four headings: (i) negative consequences of lack of warmth and lack of access; (ii) drivers of fuel and transport poverty; (iii) definition and measurement; (iv) policy interventions. Our review suggests that there are important conceptual and practical differences between transport and domestic energy consumption, with crucial consequences for how affordability problems amongst households are to be conceptualised and addressed. In a context where transport and energy exhibit two parallel policy worlds, the analysis in the paper and these conclusions reinforce how and why these differences matter. As we embark on an ever closer union between our domestic energy and transport energy systems the importance of these contradictions will become increasingly evident and problematic. This work contributes to the long-term debate about how best to manage these issues in a radical energy transition that properly pays attention to issues of equity and affordability.","[Mattioli, Giulio; Lucas, Karen; Marsden, Greg] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Mattioli, Giulio] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Mattioli, Giulio] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Room 104,34-40 Univ Rd, Leeds LS2 9JU, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds; University of Leeds; University of Leeds,"Mattioli, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.;Mattioli, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.;Mattioli, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Room 104,34-40 Univ Rd, Leeds LS2 9JU, W Yorkshire, England.",g.mattioli@leeds.ac.uk,"Mattioli, Giulio/J-7314-2019; Mattioli, Giulio/JCF-0799-2023","Mattioli, Giulio/0000-0003-1309-554X; Marsden, Greg/0000-0003-3570-2793","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/M008096/1]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I006664/1, ES/J00023X/2] Funding Source: researchfish; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/M008096/1, EP/K011723/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/K011723/1, EP/M008096/1] Funding Source: UKRI; ESRC [ES/I006664/1, ES/J00023X/2] Funding Source: UKRI",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This work arises from the research project Energy-related economic stress in the UK, at the interface between transport, housing and fuel poverty, funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (grant number EP/M008096/1) as part of the RCUK Energy Programme.

We use these data to analyze how markets respond to litigation in the most important court for corporate disputes in the United States. The detail in the dataset allows us to explore how case characteristics such as the timing of the filing, the presence of certain procedural motions, litigation intensity, and the judge assigned to the case relate to firm value. Unlike previous studies, we document that negative abnormal returns are associated with the filing of derivative cases, and we show that this association is particularly strong for cases that are first filed in Delaware and are not related to a previously disclosed government investigation. We also develop some evidence that market participants can anticipate litigation intensity and respond by valuing the firm equity less and that markets associate cases with pension fund plaintiffs with better outcomes than cases without this institutional involvement. Finally, we find little evidence of abnormal returns associated with judicial assignment at the time of filing for derivative cases, but we do observe an association between judicial assignment and case filing for merger cases.","[Badawi, Adam B.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Law, Boalt Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chen, Daniel L.] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Badawi, AB (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Law, Boalt Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",abadawi@berkeley.edu,,,"European Research Council [614708]; Swiss National Science Foundation [100018-152678, 106014-150820]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche; Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation; Templeton Foundation [22420]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [106014_150820] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF); European Research Council (ERC) [614708] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)",European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Agence Nationale de la Recherche(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation; Templeton Foundation; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We thank Scott Baker, Tony Casey, Rob Jackson, Kate Judge, Pauline Kim, the Honorable Travis Laster, John Morley, Usha Rodrigues, Amanda Rose, Max Schanzenbach, Andrew Schwartz, Richard Squire, Randall Thomas, audiences at the Annual Meeting of the American Law and Economics Association and the National Business Law Scholars Conference, two anonymous referees, and Delaware attorneys who wish to remain anonymous for valuable comments.

Two types of prison work programs are studied-voluntary ones and mandatory ones. A voluntary work program is socially beneficial: if prisoners are paid a wage that just compensates them for their disutility from work, the deterrent effect of the prison sentence is unaffected, but society obtains the product of the work program. But a mandatory work program is superior to a voluntary work program: if prisoners are forced to work without compensation, the deterrent effect of the prison sentence rises, allowing society to restore deterrence and save resources by reducing the probability of detection or the sentence length, and also to obtain greater output than under the optimal voluntary work program. In an extension of the basic analysis, however, in which prisoners vary in their disutility from work, a voluntary work program may be superior to a mandatory work program because prisoners with relatively high disutility from work can elect not to work.","[Polinsky, A.

I examine this question using a large panel of private-foundation tax returns and hand-collected data on state-law variations in the right of donors to sue wayward managers of nonprofits. In both difference-in-differences and triple-difference estimations, I find on average that standing to sue substantially increases donations and reduces the share of firms' expenses devoted to administrative costs among private foundations. These outcomes are robust to other estimating strategies, such as propensity-score matching and regression adjustment with inverse probability weights. Coefficients are smaller and less precise among large operating charities. I argue that my results weigh in favor of expanded donor standing to sue, at least for foundations. My findings also suggest that the agency costs of philanthropic organizations are substantial, which has implications for, among other policy debates, tax policies that encourage perpetual lived philanthropy.","[Galle, Brian] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Georgetown University,"Galle, B (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",,,,,,,,55,4,4,0,3,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

Given the middleman role that employees of emerging indigenous-owned retail firms play in the distribution chain from manufacturers to the consumers, the ethical perceptions of these employees are critical to the leveraging of businesses' strategic orientations. Employees are the coal face of the firm, withering intense competition from these firms' rivals and achieving the firms' strategic orientations (profitability, market share, business growth and survival). In order to meet stakeholder expectations simultaneously largely depends on the ethical conduct of such employees. Aim: The overall aim of this study is to contribute to ethical theory and literature by demonstrating how employees' ethical perceptions and behaviour shape the strategic orientations of the business. To achieve this aim, the study sought to: (1) establish the typical ethical dilemmas that employees of these retail firms faced in their daily tasks, (2) assess how they responded to these ethical challenges, (3) ascertain whether demographic factors such as age, level of education, gender and their position in the organisational hierarchy influence their reaction to ethical dilemmas; and (4) determine these employees' overall perceptions of ethical issues within their organisations. Setting: The study was conducted on employees of an indigenous-owned fast-food firm operating in two cities in Zimbabwe. Methods: A survey was conducted on 108 employees working in two cities. A structured questionnaire was developed and administered to the employees. Results: The results suggested that a majority of the respondents were ethically conscious and could make ethical choices. In addition, most respondents deemed the ethical scenarios presented to them as morally wrong, suggesting that the surveyed employees wished to engage in ethical behaviour. However, while the respondents were deemed to be ethically astute in their individual capacities, they seemed to lack an in-depth knowledge of the ethical policies of their organisation. Conclusion: The study concludes that owners and managers of small firms should provide interventions to cascade ethical policy to the lower ranks of the organisation to enhance the ethical perception amongst employees of these firms. The study implication is that an institutional top-down approach is critical to embedding ethical sensitivity into employees without which employees may continue to speculate about the business ethics of their organisation.","[Rambe, Patient; Ndofirepi, Takawira M.] Cent Univ Technol, Dept Business Support Studies, Bloemfontein, South Africa",Central University of Technology,"Ndofirepi, TM (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Technol, Dept Business Support Studies, Bloemfontein, South Africa.",takandofirepi@gmail.com,"Ndofirepi, Takawira/S-9857-2019","Ndofirepi, Takawira/0000-0001-7409-2241; Rambe, Patient/0000-0002-6230-1998",,,,,92,2,2,1,7,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

This motivates us to propose a flexible empirical Markov-switching bivariate copula that allows for distinct time-varying dependence between credit default swap (CDS) spreads and equity prices in crisis and tranquil periods. The model identifies high-dependence regimes that coincide with the recent credit crunch and the European sovereign debt crises, and is supported by in sample goodness-of-fit criteria relative to nested copula models that impose within-regime constant dependence or no regime-switching. Value-at-Risk forecasts that aim to set day ahead trading limits for the hedging of CDS-equity portfolios reveal the economic relevance of the model from the viewpoints of both regulatory and asymmetric piecewise linear loss functions.

For purposes of quasi maximum likelihood estimation, innovations to GARCH processes are typically assumed to be identically and independently distributed, with mean zero and unit variance (strong GARCH). Under less restrictive assumptions (the absence of unconditional correlation, weak GARCH), higher order dependency patterns might be exploited for the ex ante forecasting of GARCH innovations, and hence, stock returns. In this paper, rolling windows of empirical stock returns are used to test the independence of consecutive GARCH innovations. Rolling p-values from independence testing reflect the time variation of serial dependence, and provide useful information for signaling one-step-ahead directions of stock price changes. Ex ante forecasting gains are documented for nonparametric innovation predictions, especially if the sign of the innovation predictors is combined with independence diagnostics (p-values) and/or the sign of linear return forecasts.

However, factors are not observable and have to be estimated. In particular, the space spanned by the unknown factors is typically estimated via principal components. This paper proposes a novel procedure for estimating the factor space, resorting to a wavelet-based multiscale principal component analysis. A Monte Carlo simulation study is used to demonstrate that such an approach may improve both the estimation and the forecasting performances of factor models. The empirical application then illustrates its usefulness for forecasting GDP growth and inflation in the United States. (C) 2017 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Their book systematically asks how the role of ideology varies across the tiers of the federal judicial hierarchy. A major finding is that the impact of ideology increases from the bottom to the top of the judicial hierarchy. Their typical methodology formulates an ex ante measure of judicial ideology such as the political party of the appointing president, and demonstrates that this measure correlates with later judicial behavior, often voting on case dispositions. Along the way, they investigate a multitude of topics, including some quite underaEuroexplored ones. We argue that ELP's theory is only weakly connected to their empirical practice, for the latter focuses on the role of ideology in judging while the former says almost nothing about that relationship.

In the penultimate section of the essay, we explore this disconnection between ELP's theory, practice, and interpretation. Its origin (we argue) lies in an extremely thin conceptualization of law.

Incentive delegation creates frictions for each party between its objectives of within-firmrent extraction and market/job stealing from the rival firm. The net effect is restraint in production, resulting in a larger bargaining pie. But each player's payoff will be inversely related to his bargaining power. We also show that if players are given a choice to delegate, they will not resort to delegation when their bargaining power is sufficiently high. This is in contrast to the scenarios commonly assumed in many models.

A Stackelberg game is employed to model the lead time quote and pricing decision process between the two members under the conditional value-at-risk criterion. A unique equilibrium is obtained. Using the corresponding centralized mode as a benchmark, we find that a less risk-averse supplier is better to cooperate and share risk with the retailer to improve the entire supply chain's efficiency. With a uniformly distributed realized lead time, the impact of the supplier's risk aversion on the decisions can be characterized by a few threshold values of the late delivery penalty cost. In particular, when the unit delay penalty cost exceeds a certain level, a more risk-averse supplier will counter-intuitively quote a shorter lead time by risking a higher delay penalty cost.

We also compared results for an ordinary least squares regression, and found few differences between unweighted and weighted models. Unweighted regressions produced more conservative significance tests than the counterpart, and some econometricians have suggested that unweighted analyses are better for hypothesis testing. If estimation of the magnitudes of effects is important, weighted regression may be better because it produces consistent estimators.

The model highlights the distinction between the right to approve and the right to propose. The right to approve is weak; the right to propose is impactful but can help as well as hurt shareholders. Managers have an incentive to deter proposals from activist shareholders by adjusting corporate policy; one might conjecture that external pressure leads them to choose policies more appealing to other shareholders in order to reduce the electoral prospects of activist proposals. However, we show that when deterrence occurs, it is always by moving policy toward the position favored by the activist, even if this reduces shareholder wealth. Our analysis stresses the central role of voting uncertainty in determining the value consequences of shareholder rights and proxy access.","[Matsusaka, John G.; Ozbas, Oguzhan] Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Matsusaka, JG (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",matsusak@usc.edu; ozbas@usc.edu,,,USC,USC,"We thank anonymous referees and Wouter Dessein (the Editor) for constructive feedback.

Together, cases that involve online RPM and MFN can be viewed as a natural experiment of how antitrust economics and law may adapt to an online world. Thus far, legal theories that have been inconsistent with economic theories have dictated enforcement across jurisdictions, which has led to confusion that thwarts potentially efficient business practices. This paper distinguishes issues of online RPM from traditional RPM and online RPM from online MFN. We apply the economics learning to RPM and analyze the antitrust cases of online RPM and MFN to date in the United States, Europe, and Australia.

In those transactions, seller relationship-specific investment increases the amount of contractual detail, while buyer relationship-specific investment decreases it. We interpret these results using a hostages model applied to cash-flow and credit constrained firms. Sellers are more likely to be vulnerable to hold up than buyers are, implying that seller losses from hold up (and consequently the incentive to use a more detailed contract) increase with seller investment and decrease with buyer investment. This leads to the asymmetric effects of buyer and seller relationship-specific investment. Asymmetry is present in empirical estimates using a variety of methods that counter bias due to the endogeneity of the specific-investment variables, but is not present in OLS estimates.

The modelling of risk at farm level is not new, however, the inclusion of risk in Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP) models is particularly challenging. Most of the few existing PMP-risk approaches have been conducted at farm-type level and for a very limited and specific sample of farms. This implies that the modelling of risk and uncertainty at individual farm level and in a large scale system is still a challenging task. The aim of this paper is to formulate, estimate and test a robust methodology for explicitly modelling risk to be incorporated in an EU-wide individual farm model for Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) analysis, named IFM-CAP. Results show that there is a clear trade-off between the behavioural model (BM) and the behavioural risk model (BRM).

The aim of the study is to offer a methodological contribution for the curricular damage estimation enabling overcoming the equitable approach. The curricular value of a company is a goodwill rate. It falls under the so-called intangible assets. It expresses the assets of the references acquired and is directly related to its skill level, ascertained by the certification of the certifying body S.O. A. (Societ... Organismo Attestazione). The real interest in acquiring certification categories has given rise to a true-though improper-market of qualification requirements with the exchange of the SOA certification through the transfer of the ownership of the business branch. This is because they make possible accessing more active market segments, or rather increasing the classification level held, in order to increase chances of awarding a contract. The analysis of the sales offers has enabled appraising the most likely exchange value of a business branch provided with a certification and hence tackling, in a more rigorous way, the subject of the curricular damage estimation, or rather the goodwill variation the company would achieve through the attainment of a higher classification, or rather the failed loss of the classification held. The estimation rationale identifies as complementarity the economic aspect to consider the curricular damage. It is methodologically quantifiable as the difference between the curricular value held by the company at the submission of bid in relation to category and classification of certification held, and the curricular value the company could attain thanks to the increase in the business turnover deriving from carrying out the tender, by acquiring a higher classification than the one held, or rather a failed decrease of the current classification. The amount of the curricular damage appraised with this approach is meaningfully lower than the one usually equitably acknowledged by administrative jurisprudence, that does not take into account the capital alteration caused by the non-awarding of the said contract.","[Basile, Marco Clemente] Univ Naples 2, DICDEA, Via Roma 29, Aversa, CE, Italy",Universita della Campania Vanvitelli,"Basile, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Naples 2, DICDEA, Via Roma 29, Aversa, CE, Italy.",ingmarcobasile@fastwebnet.it,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1865-3529,,978-3-319-49676-4; 978-3-319-49675-7,GREEN ENERGY TECHNOL,,,2017,,,,,,,63,78,,10.1007/978-3-319-49676-4_6,0.0,,,16,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI6HB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413289600006,0

In particular, we ask whether a model with common international business cycle factors adds marginal predictive power over a domestic alternative. We answer this question using a dynamic factor model (DFM), and run an out-of-sample forecasting experiment. Our results show that exploiting the informational content in a common global business cycle factor improves the forecast accuracy in terms of both point and density forecast evaluation across a large panel of countries. We also document evidence showing that the Great Recession has a huge impact on this result, causing a clear shift in preferences towards the model that includes a common global factor. However, this time is different in other respects too, as the performance of the DFM deteriorates substantially for longer forecasting horizons in the aftermath of the Great Recession.

On the basis of seven cases from Belgium, a country with a strong commuting culture and a traditional tendency towards multimodality, we show that the conversion of a sustainability discourse into policy actions often leads to realisations which are essentially to be labelled as non-sustainable. On the one hand we discuss a number of cases where additional travel is unintentionally stimulated, with an unforeseen contribution to global warming as a result. On the other hand, we refer to cases where subsidies for sustainable transport modes seem to be geared towards wealthier groups, while poorer groups are exposed to additional expenses. The cases cover different steps of the policy process: (1) problem definition and selection of indicators, (2) the choice of a particular solution, and (3) the design of the chosen plan or programme, and illustrate the mechanisms underlying goal-displacements.

The main goal of the article is to highlight the negative consequences of this phenomenon for the French economy and problems with his regulation. Due to the varied forms of forgery (e.g. counterfeiting credit cards, clothes, medicines, food, luxury goods), the French legislature decided on penalization, not only in the Penal Code, but also in Monetary and Financial Code, or in the Code of Consumption. Statistical data contained in the paper (for the period of 2005- 2010) clearly shows that the phenomenon of counterfeiting is one of the most important economic problems in France, considering its steady, strong growth in almost all sectors of the economy. Thus, it is clear that making active efforts to fight against this pathology (especially by the Police, Military Police, as well as by specialized organizations, for instance Direction Generale des Douanes et Droits indirects) does not bring the expected results.

The Dred Scott case in 1857 denied constitutional rights to enslaved Africans and their descendants living in the United States. The Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 created a constitutional right to abortion that denied constitutional personhood to human beings prior to birth. Both cases involved applications of what legal scholars call substantive due processthat is, a substantive interpretation of the constitutional requirement that governments provide persons with due process of law that moves beyond procedural formalism. Although many constitutional scholars deny the legitimacy of substantive due process as a legal doctrine, this article proposes that the judicial system cannot ultimately avoid substantive moral questions in constitutional interpretation. In both cases examined here, the crucial question was about who counts as part of the people whom the Constitution protects, and that question could not be answered in purely formal terms. Both Dred Scott and Roe v. Wade erred not by engaging substantive moral questions but rather by denying, in different ways, the natural rights of human persons.","[Dyer, Justin Buckley] Univ Missouri, Polit Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Dyer, Justin Buckley] Univ Missouri, Kinder Inst Constitut Democracy, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Dyer, JB (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Polit Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.;Dyer, JB (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Kinder Inst Constitut Democracy, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",,,,,,,,18,0,2,1,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

At that time many portfolios perceived as well-diversified suddenly had become undiversified portfolios. Usually the risk parity is calculated for the individual stocks. In this article, the method of estimating the risk parity portfolios for grouped stocks was discussed. The presented model was applied to selected stocks belonging to different groups (sectors) and quoted on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. The main goal of empirical research was the analysis of risk parity portfolios calculated for the groups of stocks and also for the individual stocks.

In this paper, we examine whether the rollout also affected the social connections that teens make. Specifically, we look at the relationship between increased broadband access and teen fertility. We hypothesize that increasing access to high-speed internet can influence fertility decisions by changing the size of the market as well as increasing the information available to participants in the market. We seek to understand both the overall effect of broadband internet on teen fertility and the mechanisms underlying this effect. Our results suggest that increased broadband access explains at least 7 % of the decline in the teen birth rate between 1999 and 2007.

This paper examines Amazon's distribution strategy to demonstrate the importance of distribution strategy to the success and sustainability of its organization. The analysis indicates that the distribution strategy, including technology, shipping, and distribution infrastructure, is the most vital factor for the success of Amazon. Recognizing the importance of distribution systems, constantly innovating convenient and on-time delivery methods, and taking control of inventory and shipping activities have separated Amazon from its competitors and led Amazon to establish many different types of fulfillment facilities all over the world. Given Amazon's continued growth that came with its constant strive for delivery and cost efficiency and customer satisfaction, it was inevitable that Amazon would eventually venture into the actual shipping business and emerge as the competitor of the traditionally well-known shipping companies such as DHL, FedFx, and UPS. The previous and current Amazon's distribution strategies demonstrate that Amazon will continue to focus on developing and implementing new and creative distribution strategies to separate itself from the rest of the retail and e-businesses.","[Hahn, Yoonah] SUNY Empire State Coll, Saratoga Springs, NY 12866 USA; [Youn, Myoung-Kil] Eulji Univ, Coll Hlth Ind, Daejeon, South Korea; [Kim, Dongho] SUNY Empire State Coll, Business Int Business & Mkt, Saratoga Springs, NY 12866 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Empire State College; Eulji University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Empire State College,"Youn, MK (通讯作者)，Eulji Univ, Coll Hlth Ind, Daejeon, South Korea.",Yoonah.Hahn@esc.edu; retail21@hanmail.net; Dongho.Kim@esc.edu,"Youn, Myoung-Kil/X-8048-2019","Youn, Myoung-Kil/0000-0001-8524-5012",,,,,15,0,0,7,43,KODISA,SEONGNAM,"HANSHIN OFFICETEL STE 1030, 2463-4 SHINHEUNG-DONG SUJEONG-GU, SEONGNAM, GYEONGGI-DO 461-720, SOUTH KOREA",2287-478X,,,INT CONF KOREA DISTR,,,2017,,,,,,,311,312,,,,,,2,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ1UR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418104000087,0

We test this impact by using panel data on 20 European countries from 2002 to 2013, and running two major empirical models. We apply several econometric approaches and control for several independent variables such as education, employment in specific sectors, and some of the macroeconomic indicators. We find that the employment effect is insignificant for the three subgroups. Moreover, we find that the earnings of foreign-born workers are positively affected by an increase in the minimum wage. These findings are consistent with previous empirical work done in the U.S. The effect of the minimum wage on the average earnings of natives in European countries is positive and highly significant as well. This is inconsistent with previous empirical work done on skilled and unskilled non-immigrants in the U.S. Other than that, we notice that in the long run, the effect of minimum wage on earnings of the three subgroups remains positive, but is slightly negative on the employment of these subgroups, suggesting the possible existence of labor market rigidities.","[Halawi, Balsam Youssef] Amer Univ Beirut, Dept Econ, Beirut, Lebanon",American University of Beirut,"Halawi, BY (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Beirut, Dept Econ, Beirut, Lebanon.",Balsam.halawi@gmail.com,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-46319-3; 978-3-319-46318-6,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,5.0,,,,,,365,404,,10.1007/978-3-319-46319-3_24,0.0,,,40,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH5KL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000401101000024,0

The work was based on a case study of Stockholm, Sweden, focusing on four current plans and strategies of key importance for sustainable mobility. We identify and discuss implementation challenges related to sustainable mobility using a theoretical framework from the policy integration literature, with a focus on the dimensions of layering, drift and exhaustion (Rayner & Howlett 2009). The empirical analysis led us to identify a complementary dimension which we call 'Parallel policy making'. The parallel policy making reflects a fundamental lack of integration of sustainable mobility in policies and plans of strategic importance, which hinders effective policy integration. Altogether, we conclude that a better insight into the practice of parallel policy making is crucial for development of more effective implementation strategies for sustainable mobility in Stockholm and elsewhere.

J,"Mpwanya, MF; van Heerden, CH",,,,"Mpwanya, Musenga F.; van Heerden, Cornelius H.",,,A supply chain cost reduction framework for the South African mobile phone industry,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,IMPLEMENTATION,"Background: The costs incurred in the provision of products and services across the supply chain are on the rise in many industries, including the mobile phone industry. Despite this, there is limited information in South Africa on the perceptions of supply chain players regarding cost reduction in the mobile phone industry. Furthermore, there is currently no framework for reducing supply chain costs in the South African mobile phone industry. Aim: The purpose of this study is to explore supply chain costs in the South African mobile phone industry, and to develop a supply chain cost-reduction framework for the South African mobile phone industry. Setting: This study explores supply chain costs in four mobile phone companies operating in the South African mobile phone industry, of which three mobile network operators and one mobile retailing group. It uses semi-structured interview data collected in 2011. Method: This study adopted a qualitative case study design to understand supply chain costs and develop a supply chain cost-reduction framework for the South African mobile phone industry. Eight semi-structured interviews with managers of mobile phone companies were conducted. The data were analysed with the help of Atlas. ti, using an adapted three-phased analytical framework as suggested by Miles and Huberman (1994) and O' Dwyer (2004). Results: The study found that consolidation of strategic relationships through collaboration and strategic alliances between MNOs and other supply chain players is one of the ways to drive costs down across the supply chain. Outsourcing of some of the support activities and retailers' direct purchasing transactions from device manufacturers were also found to be other avenues for reducing supply chain costs in the industry. Conclusion: The study suggests that mobile network operators (MNOs) need to consolidate their strategic relationships by increasing the share of the network infrastructure, and emphasising the need to strive for operational efficiencies. This combined effort should result in significant cost reductions across the supply chain. The findings of this study provided some avenues that managers of mobile-phone companies could consider to drive costs down supply chain-wide and service end-users at lower rates. The findings of this study could also help regulating authorities to get insights into supply chain cost reduction and develop appropriate mobile phone policies in South Africa.","[Mpwanya, Musenga F.] Tshwane Univ Technol, Dept Marketing Logist & Sport Management, Pretoria, South Africa; [van Heerden, Cornelius H.] Tshwane Univ Technol, Fac Management Sci, Off Execut Dean, Pretoria, South Africa",Tshwane University of Technology; Tshwane University of Technology,"Mpwanya, MF (通讯作者)，Tshwane Univ Technol, Dept Marketing Logist & Sport Management, Pretoria, South Africa.",mpwanyamf@tut.ac.za,"van Heerden, Cornelius Hendrik/N-1931-2019","van Heerden, Cornelius Hendrik/0000-0002-2950-6051",,,,,54,1,2,3,24,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Is there revenue leakage due to over or under forecasting, resulting from lack of accuracy on the methods used? This paper evaluates accuracy of revenue forecasted over eleven years in a semi-autonomous Tax administration, a revenue collection body which collects taxes on behalf of government in Malawi. We investigate whether forecasting method which was used was the most accurate, unbiased and efficient, and whether better forecasts could have been used. We compare different Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) and Mean Square Error(MSE) calculated from different time series methods using software CB predictor to establish the most accurate method for forecasting revenue collection for this organization. Actual data provided by Ministry of Finance in Malawi was used. The study shows that the forecasting method used by the organization was not most accurate than using the Last Value Forecasting Method which had the lowest MAD among the other forecasting time series method that were tested. The current method used by the organization had huge forecasting errors. The paper further recommends the use of Last Value Forecasting Method, and suggests other forecasting objectives the organization's may have other than accuracy.","[Nanthuru, Stella Binauli] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Nie, Guihua] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Econ, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Technology; Wuhan University of Technology,"Nanthuru, SB (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",binaulistella@yahoo.co.uk; niegh@whut.edu.cn,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-369-2,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,31.0,,,,,,93,96,,,,,,4,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK1KF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431849100022,0

This paper examines the economic feasibility of REDD+ in community forests within two watersheds in central Nepal, Ludikhola and Kayarkhola, using data on forest product demand, carbon sequestration, carbon price and REDD+ related costs. The benefits of REDD+ are about $7994, $152, and $64 per community forest, per hectare of forest area, and per household in Ludikhola watershed compared to $4815, $29, and $56 in Kayarkhola watershed, respectively, under the business-as-usual scenario. Compared to the EU ETS carbon price ($10.3/tCO(2)e), the average break-even carbon price in community forests is much higher in Kayarkhola watershed ($41.8/tCO(2)e) and much lower in Ludikhola watershed ($2.4/tCO(2)e) when empirical estimates of annual expenditure in community forests are included in the analysis. The incorporation of annual expenditure estimates and opportunity cost of sequestered carbon (in the form of firewood prices in local markets) in the analysis suggests that community forests are economically infeasible for REDD+ at the prevailing carbon prices. The implication of our findings is that economic feasibility of REDD+ in community forests depends on the local contexts, carbon prices and the opportunity costs, which should be carefully considered in designing REDD+ projects.

Our paper is built on a brief literature review and on an analysis of the Romanian higher education, by taking into account official statistical data in this field. We observed there is an imbalance between supply and demand in education, if we consider the number of graduates and the needs of our economy.

The question is, accordingly, not whether one advocates a Creating Shared Value, but which concept of Creating Shared Value is plausible and productive. This paper examines the question as to whether Michael E. Porter's and Marc R. Kramer's specific concept of Creating Shared Value is convincing or not, through the lens of a research program called Business Metaphysics, referring predominantly to the Process Metaphysics of Alfred North Whitehead and the Transaction Economics of John R. Commons. As a result, the paper shows that Porter and Kramer commit the Fallacy of Misplaced Concreteness, namely of mistaking the abstract (the ideal world of an overall win-win) for the concrete (the contingent and messy world of real business). From time to time, a new conceptual spectre haunts the world of business. In recent decades, we witnessed for example: Shareholder Value, Stakeholder Management, Corporate Social Responsibility, Sustainability, and lately the spectre of Creating Shared Value (Porter/Kramer Harv Bus Rev 89: 62-77, (2011); Porter Harv Bus Rev (2011), Porter Creating shared value (Ideas for Change) (2012); Porter/Kramer Calif Manage Rev 56(2): 149-151 (2014)), which aims at replacing all the other (conceptual) spectres. We are told about The Big Idea and How to Fix Capitalism and unleash a new wave of growth (Titel page of Harvard Business Review Vol. 89 No. 1-2 (2011) or How to reinvent capitalism (Porter/Kramer Harv Bus Rev 89: 62-77, (2011): 63). The way how this  Big Idea is presented, it almost takes after a religious promise of a promised land of a magical capitalism. The question arises as to whether the concept of Creating Shared Value can do justice to this ambitious claim. My answer is that it cannot. I will provide the reasons for this answer in the light of a research program which I call Business Metaphysics.","[Schramm, Michael] Univ Hohenheim, Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Schramm, M (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Stuttgart, Germany.",Michael.Schramm@uni-hohenheim.de,"Schramm, Michael/IQR-8301-2023","Schramm, Michael/0000-0001-8693-1604",,,,,76,2,3,2,11,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2211-2707,,978-3-319-48802-8; 978-3-319-48801-1,ETHICAL ECON,,,2017,52.0,,,,,,81,117,,10.1007/978-3-319-48802-8_6,0.0,,,37,Economics; Ethics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BI6HA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413288200006,0

In most cases, loyalty program organizers aim to establish consumer databases for the purpose of identification of individual customers: loyalty program members. The structure and quality of customer data often has a strategic effect on retailers' decision-making accuracy and profitability. On the other hand, consumers worry about their privacy and fear their personal data may be misused. For a good-faith loyalty program organizer, it is an ongoing task to reconcile their corporate interests with the interests of consumers who are often rewarded by purchase incentives and personalized services. Consumer's willingness to disclose personal information to loyalty program organizers is not uniform. In fact, individual preferences, sociodemographic and lifestyle factors play a very important role. This study provides a structured quantitative analysis of customers' willingness to share selected key types of personal and contact data with loyalty program organizers in the Czech Republic. Cost-benefit assessments based on our results may help marketing managers with establishing and/or amending key LP incentives. We identify and discuss important differences in personal and contact data-sharing preferences among specific consumer groups. To highlight some of the empirical results, respondents aged 65 and older are significantly less willing to disclose personal data as compared to younger consumers. On the other hand, we do not find a statistically significant evidence for education-based differences in data sharing preference.

Throughout the paper, I addressed aspects of transformational and real leadership in higher education, highlighting the need for adaptive change in education in the current context. Given the scope of the adaptive change interventions, the emphasis is put on transformational leadership, as the main conceptual drive of such endeavour. The transformation through an adaptive change process of the School starts from the vision of articulating an authentic educational system that cultivates values that it uses and likes in the broadest sense of the components of this vision. The primary objective of the present review is to reveal how the real leadership theories are applied in higher education institutions. This paper concludes with an academic leadership summary for educational institutions to enhance managerial effectiveness, which would also be beneficial to future research for studying relationships between specific leadership styles and effectiveness in higher education. Although leadership has been mostly discussed in organizational context, managerial effectiveness is of great significance also in educational setting.","[Todorut, Amalia Venera] Constantin Brancusi Univ Targu Jiu, Targu Jiu, Romania",Constantin Brancusi University,"Todorut, AV (通讯作者)，Constantin Brancusi Univ Targu Jiu, Targu Jiu, Romania.",amalia_venera@yahoo.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",2286-1440,,,INT MANAGE CONF,,,2017,,,,,,,823,828,,,,,,6,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM6KT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000466917100085,0

All observers are the slaves of their disciplines, which force them to see through the lens of their concepts and methods. The big question is, whether it is necessary for us to stay within the cage of our existing disciplines. Transdisciplinarity examines territories beyond different disciplines. In this study, decisions and their ontology have been observed through the lens of transdisciplinarity. Depending on this approach, a Knowledge-based System, namely the Doctus KBS can be seen as a Decision Support System tool and as Knowledge Representation. During the development of Doctus KBS, used a symbolic logic to visualize knowledge, the process of thinking together was examined to define ontology of the concepts. This study examines how ontology can be applied to inter-agent (human or machine) communication and the reusing of concepts. The goal of this study is the presentation of a different approach.","[Velencei, Jolan] Obuda Univ Budapest, Keleti Fac Business & Management, Tavaszmezo 15, H-1083 Budapest, Hungary",Obuda University,"Velencei, J (通讯作者)，Obuda Univ Budapest, Keleti Fac Business & Management, Tavaszmezo 15, H-1083 Budapest, Hungary.",velencei.jolan@kgk.uni-obuda.hu,"Velencei, Jolan/H-8715-2012","Velencei, Jolan/0000-0003-0040-3494",,,,,12,5,5,0,0,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-499-5,,,,2017,,,,,,,865,871,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ7IS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427306200089,0

The research reveals the catch-up process in emerging industries in developing countries is different from the original Utterback and Abernathy (U-A) model and Kim's model, the reverse U-A model, and confirms the model proposed by Linton and Walsh. Innovation in the catch-up process in emerging industries in developing countries follows the same stages as that in advanced countries, but there is a time delay in the start of commercialisation. The research showcases a large role for competitiveness derived from owning critical technology in the production process (process-based innovation) in the catch-up process.

Departing from conventional parametric techniques, this paper employs a fully nonparametric approach to analyze the link between corporate social responsibility and corporate financial performance in Chinese banking sector. Specifically, the slack-free Multi-directional Efficiency Analysis is extended into the conditional efficiency framework. The results indicate that corporate social responsibility has a significant impact on banking performance, where an increase in CSR generally leads towards an increase in conditional efficiency, but the attainable frontier might be shifted to any direction for the highest values of corporate social responsibility. In details, the analysis of pure efficiency indicates that corporate social responsibility has a stronger impact on increasing net profit if compared to that on contracting the amount of non-performing loans. In other words, it turns out that corporate social responsibility is likely to affect the attainable frontier in the direction of expanding net profit rather than contracting non-performing loans, because the portfolio of non-performing loans is difficult to reduce and therefore the impact of corporate social responsibility is not significant either on the frontier or on average efficiency. However, there exists a trade-off between corporate social responsibility and bank performance when a certain limit is exceeded in Chinese banking. Thus, a minimal increase in corporate social responsibility is likely to contribute to improvements in banking performance (productivity), whereas a negative effect is observed at the highest levels of corporate social responsibility.","[Zhu, Ning] South China Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Commerce, Dept Finance, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Stjepcevic, Jelena] Univ Montenegro, Maritime Fac Kotor, Podgorica, Montenegro; [Balezentis, Tomas] Lithuanian Inst Agr Econ, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Yu, Zhiqian] Guangzhou Univ, Sch Econ & Stat, Dept Econ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bing] Jinan Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",South China University of Technology; University of Montenegro; Lithuanian Institute of Agrarian Economics; Guangzhou University; Jinan University,"Zhu, N (通讯作者)，South China Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Commerce, Dept Finance, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",ningzhu@scut.edu.cn; jelena.stjepcevic@opstinakotor.com; tomas@laei.lt; yzq_8866@hotmail.com; twangb@jnu.edu.cn,"Balezentis, Tomas/D-8609-2015","Balezentis, Tomas/0000-0002-3906-1711",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71703040]; Humanities and Social Research Project of Ministry of Education in China [17YJC790215]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2017BQ010]; Philosophy and Social Science Project of Guangdong Province [GD15XYJ19],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanities and Social Research Project of Ministry of Education in China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Philosophy and Social Science Project of Guangdong Province,"The authors gratefully acknowledge financial supports from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71703040), the Humanities and Social Research Project of Ministry of Education in China (17YJC790215), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2017BQ010), and the Philosophy and Social Science Project of Guangdong Province (GD15XYJ19).",,51,15,15,5,62,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The total performance of municipal public transport operators is divided into three components: effectiveness, efficiency and economy. The data are taken from the Annual Reports of the Association of Transport Companies for the 2011-2015 period containing data on the activities of 19 operators of municipal transport in the Czech Republic. Effectiveness is understood to be an company's ability to reach determined objectives. Passenger transport is the main object of municipal transport companies. Efficiency is understood to be the relationship between the input used and the output reached. Economy means avoiding waste during the implementation of business processes. It means procuring input at the lowest possible cost. Total performance is determined by combining all three above-mentioned components. Data Envelopment Analysis was used to evaluate performance and its components.","[Zizka, Miroslav] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Business Adm & Management, Liberec, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Zizka, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Studentska 2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic.",miroslav.zizka@tul.cz,"Zizka, Miroslav/I-5624-2016","Zizka, Miroslav/0000-0002-7804-3954",,,,,19,1,1,0,3,VERBUM-CATHOLIC UNIV RUZOMBEROK PRESS,RUZOMBEROK,"ANDREJ HLINKU 60, RUZOMBEROK, 034 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-561-0519-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,48,58,,,,,,11,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7OJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455255500005,0

In so doing, it contributes to the wider debate on financial inclusion and financialization. The product, processes and narratives examined are a local manifestation of global finance's emphasis on engaging commercially viable means to bring previously unbanked' populations within its fold. Based on fieldwork in Lahore and Karachi, two of Pakistan's largest cities, this paper highlights how the financial inclusion' agenda of microfinance has effectively financialized the lives of poor Pakistani women. Our analysis finds that Pakistani MFBs draw on patriarchy's hierarchical norms and the precariousness of low-income living in ways which bolster their own financial positions. This is supported by the country's central bank, which has granted collateralized microfinance products a risk-free' rating, easing the path to the financialization of jewellery which in a South Asian context is directly associated with women's social standing and economic security. The outcome is a deepening of deep-seated vulnerabilities.","[Zulfiqar, Ghazal] Lahore Univ Management Sci, Suleman Dawood Sch Business, DHA, Room 327,3rd Floor, Lahore Cantt 54792, Pakistan",Lahore University of Management Sciences,"Zulfiqar, G (通讯作者)，Lahore Univ Management Sci, Suleman Dawood Sch Business, DHA, Room 327,3rd Floor, Lahore Cantt 54792, Pakistan.",ghazal.zulfiqar@lums.edu.pk,,,,,,,70,11,11,2,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Our analysis led us to conclude that if China's air policy makers encourage 80 + major cities to initiate made-in-China LCCs, it would solve the looming short-term policy disaster (losing the majority of China-ASEAN markets to SE Asian LCCs); help solve an important medium-term policy goal of inducing Chinese mega carriers to get more efficient vs. competing foreign carriers; and the long-term need for preparing China's mega carriers to claim the global leadership roles such as setting standards on the global civil air transport sector.

This article aims at overcoming this limitation by demonstrating that political borders actually comprise several lines of fracture in the continuity of socioeconomic space. As such, border effects must be decomposed into their building blocks in order to more clearly identify the sources of border-related inefficiencies and enact appropriate policies. By applying an original methodology, the article analyzes the extent to which different types of barriers create obstacles to different growth assets. Results applied to European cross-border regions on a newly collected database at NUTS3 level suggest that (1) physical obstacles hamper several types of economic interactions; (2) sociocultural barriers limit the exploitation of intangible assets; and (3) social and cultural barriers limit the access to intermediate goods and to geographically close labor markets. Evidence-based policy implications call for the identification of the sources of these discontinuities, of the real cost that they engender, and of the type of growth assets hampered in their exploitation by the presence of a border.","[Capello, Roberta; Caragliu, Andrea; Fratesi, Ugo] Politecn Milan, ABC Dept, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Capello, R (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, ABC Dept, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",roberta.capello@polimi.it; andrea.caragliu@polimi.it; ugo.fratesi@polimi.it,"Fratesi, Ugo/IAM-5881-2023; Caragliu, Andrea/AAI-2320-2020","Fratesi, Ugo/0000-0002-0755-460X; Caragliu, Andrea/0000-0003-0865-3404; Capello, Roberta/0000-0003-0438-6900",,,,,65,33,39,5,57,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

To date, no empirical evidence has been found to support the potential asymmetric effects of exchange rate and income on maritime trade flows. The objective of this paper is to explore the long-run exchange rate and income asymmetries in bilateral maritime freight flows between Japan and the US. We use both aggregate and disaggregate industry data from January 2003 to July 2016 in a nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) framework. From the nonlinear ARDL models, the exchange rate is found to be an important factor affecting the maritime freight flows in exporting and importing industries in Japan. This conclusion differs from the findings from the linear ARDL models in which exchange rate is insignificant in the majority of cases. More importantly, we find empirical evidence of the asymmetric effects of exchange rate and income on the bilateral maritime freight flows at both aggregate and disaggregate levels. This suggests that using the perfectly reversible (linear) elasticities of demand could mislead the effects of exchange rate and income changes and result in biased estimation. At the disaggregate level, the asymmetric effects of exchange rate and income changes tend to vary across industries.","[Chi, Junwook] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Travel Ind Management, 2560 Campus Rd,George Hall 346, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Chi, J (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Travel Ind Management, 2560 Campus Rd,George Hall 346, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",jwchi@hawaii.edu,,"Chi, Junwook/0000-0002-8496-5285",,,,,38,7,7,0,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

However, the pricing of leases is complicated because the leasing rate must embody an expectation of the car's residual value after contract expiration. This paper develops resale price forecasting models in order to aid pricing decisions. One feature of the leasing business is that different forecast errors entail different costs. The primary objective of this paper is to identify effective ways of addressing cost asymmetry. Specifically, this paper contributes to the literature by (i) consolidating prior work in forecasting on asymmetric functions of the cost of errors; (ii) systematically evaluating previous approaches and comparing them to a new approach; and (iii) demonstrating that forecasting using asymmetric cost of error functions improves the quality of decision support in car leasing. For example, if the costs of overestimating resale prices are twice those of underestimating them, incorporating cost asymmetry into forecast model development reduces costs by about 8%.

This paper proposes a new concept, called Multilevel Premium Highways (MPH), to tackle traffic congestion with different options addressing travelers' diverse needs. The new concept is featured by: (i) a fully priced highway with hierarchical speeds designated on different lanes; (ii) a discriminated toll strategy; and (iii) a package of complementary services directly funded by the toll revenues. To examine the effectiveness of MPH, this paper firstly develops a qualitative comparison with the conventional value pricing (VP) schemes, and conducts a spreadsheet-based benefit-cost analysis under two scenarios with the realistic input data, and then performs a sensitivity analysis to examine the impacts of key factors (e.g., traffic demand and travelers' willingness-to-pay). Discrete choice models are also applied to unveil the impacts of heterogeneous travelers on the performance of MPH. Results show that MPH appears to be economically and financially sustainable for large-scale applications, although the initial settings (e.g., the designated speeds and toll values) of highway lanes influence the relative performance between MPH and the conventional VP schemes.","[Fan, Wenbo; Jiang, Xinguo] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Transportat & Logist, 111 Erhuan Rd, Chengdu 610031, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Southwest Jiaotong University,"Jiang, XG (通讯作者)，Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Transportat & Logist, Natl United Engn Lab Integrated & Intelligent Tra, 111 Erhuan Rd, Chengdu 610031, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",wbfan@swjtu.edu.cn; xjiang@swjtu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [NSFC 51608455, 71771191]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The authors greatly appreciate two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments that significantly improve the paper.

On the basis of the selected scenarios, we develop a new approach for evaluating the performance of strategies across a series of scenarios. Furthermore, the proposed approach is used to analyse the relationships between exports and the six indicators of the logistics performance index (LPI): customs, infrastructure, international shipments, logistics quality and competence, tracking and tracing, and timeliness.

A spatially unequal distribution of employment opportunities leads to important differences between urban and rural areas. Making use of newly released data at the district level on home-to-work commuting, this article examines the determinants of commuting patterns in the largest rural-urban megaregion of India. This paper finds that short trips and non-motorized travel are still predominant in the region. The residents of higher-income districts more often choose to commute by private motorized modes, including cars, whereas residents of poorer areas are tied to non-motorized modes and public transport, and they often must commute longer distances. One problem seems to be the low provision of rail service in the region compared to roads, which is more pronounced in rural areas. Overall, the socio-demographic, economic, infrastructure and area based variables help explain the variation in the commuting patterns. This paper emphasizes that policy aiming at sustainable future transport in the National Capital Region requires (i) a shift in government policies from promoting road-based transportation to promoting transit, (ii) the regional integration of rural and urban areas by public transport, and (iii) investment in the provision of rural transport (roads and rail network) for regional development.","[Jain, Manisha; Korzhenevych, Artem; Hecht, Robert] Leibniz Inst Ecol Urban & Reg Dev, Weberpl 1, D-01217 Dresden, Germany; [Korzhenevych, Artem] Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Business & Econ, Helmholtzstr 10, D-01062 Dresden, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur okologische Raumentwicklung; Technische Universitat Dresden,"Jain, M (通讯作者)，Leibniz Inst Ecol Urban & Reg Dev, Weberpl 1, D-01217 Dresden, Germany.",m.jain@ioer.de; a.korzhenevych@ioer.de; r.hecht@ioer.de,"Jain, Manisha/AAZ-2968-2020; Hecht, Robert/I-7496-2019; Korzhenevych, Artem/F-7066-2019","Jain, Manisha/0000-0002-6377-0016; Hecht, Robert/0000-0001-8420-7233; Korzhenevych, Artem/0000-0002-3835-9372",,,,,56,20,22,6,62,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

In the theoretical study of VOT variation with respect to trip length, it was found that VOT could be changed by various effects while the direction could not be determined. Yet, the study was able to summarize that most of the empirical studies demonstrate a phenomenon of an increase in trip length. Based on the survey results in Korea, this study compares the case of applying VOT by trip length, the case of using the existing method of fixed VOT, and the results of the benefit calculation. The comparison indicates that applying the differentiated VOT by trip length tends to increase the benefit, however, the benefit yielded is not always higher than applying the fixed VOT, due to the different spatial distributions of travel demand associated with each project.","[Kim, Nam Seok] Hanyang Univ, Dept Transportat & Logist Engn, 2nd Engn Buld 55 Hanyangdaehakro, Ansan 426791, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Yook, Donghyung] Korea Res Inst Human Settlements, 5 Gukchaegyeonguwon Ro, Sejong City 30147, South Korea",Hanyang University,"Yook, D (通讯作者)，Korea Res Inst Human Settlements, 5 Gukchaegyeonguwon Ro, Sejong City 30147, South Korea.",nskim@hanyang.ac.kr; dhyook@krihs.re.kr,,,,,,,37,2,3,0,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

The response variables to consider were the average time in the system, the fuel consumption and the greenhouse effect gas (CO2) emissions. Different experiments were performed using the simulation model developed in the PTV-VISSIM software, which represents the vehicle traffic system. The obtained results for the different proposed scenarios allow proper levels to be determined for vehicle traffic system operation to improve mobility, reduce contamination rates and decrease fuel consumption for different motor vehicles using the avenue. As a result, it was possible to establish a methodology that combines microsimulation and design of experiments to program traffic lights and define the operating conditions of a complex vehicular flow system.","[Espinoza Mondragon, Jaime; Jimenez Garcia, Jose Alfredo; Medina Flores, Jose Martin; Vazquez Lopez, Jose Antonio] Technol Inst Celaya, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Tellez Vazquez, Sandra] Polytech Univ Guanajuato, Guanajuato, Mexico",,"García, JAJ (通讯作者)，Technol Inst Celaya, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",alfredo.jimenez@itcelaya.edu.mx,"GARCIA, JOSE ALFREDO JIMENEZ/Q-2897-2019; , JOSE ANTONIO/E-3274-2019",", JOSE ANTONIO/0000-0002-1687-2140",CONACYT [403927]; Prodep [ITCEL-PTC-020]; Instituto Tecnologico de Celaya,CONACYT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); Prodep; Instituto Tecnologico de Celaya,"To the authors are grateful for the financial support from CONACYT, Scholarship Number 403927.

This narrow focus neglects nonpatent assets held by a broader set of economic agents, such as trademarks, and overlooks the evolving ways owners are employing and monetizing their intangible assets. To help remedy this deficiency, the Office of Chief Economist of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is releasing a series of datasets in formats convenient for researchers. This article describes the USPTO Trademark Assignment Dataset, a database of over 785,000 transactions recorded during 1952-2013 affecting almost 4.2 million trademark registrations and applications. We provide a comprehensive description and present key trends, showing that among registrations issued during 1978-2013, more than 31% were affected by some transaction during their lives, 21% were transferred to different parties, and 12% were involved in at least one security interest agreement. Examining transaction rates by registration cohort, we find evidence that registered U.S. trademarks may be more likely to be traded than are U.S. patents. Other trends and findings are discussed. Despite limitations, these data open new avenues for research, particularly with respect to trademark collateralization and the market for brands.","[Graham, Stuart J.

In this paper, we 1) further develop the PAC measure of perceived accessibility in order to capture how easy it is to live a satisfactory life with the help of the transport system, 2) compare levels of perceived accessibility between residential areas and main travel modes, and 3) compare residents' perceived accessibility to the objective accessibility level for the same residential area. Data from 2711 residents of Malmo, Sweden show that perceived accessibility is consistently different from objective accessibility across 13 residential areas, with minor differences in levels of perceived accessibility between areas. Surprisingly, bicycle users rate their accessibility significantly higher than those who mainly use the car or public transport for daily travel, contrary to objective accessibility assumptions. These differences point at the importance of including perceived accessibility as a complementary tool when planning for and evaluating transport systems.","[Lattman, Katrin; Olsson, Lars E.; Friman, Margareta] Karlstad Univ, SAMOT CTF, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden",Karlstad University,"Lättman, K (通讯作者)，Karlstad Univ, SAMOT CTF, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden.",Katrin.lattman@kau.se; lars.e.olsson@kau.se; margareta.friman@kau.se,"Lättman, Katrin/AFU-6484-2022; Olsson, Lars E./W-2631-2017","Olsson, Lars E./0000-0002-6570-6181; Lattman, Katrin/0000-0001-5398-6633",Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems [2014-05335]; Vinnova [2014-05335] Funding Source: Vinnova,Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems(Vinnova); Vinnova,Financial support was obtained through grant #2014-05335 from the Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems.,,55,89,97,26,137,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

The optimal amount of investment in preventive enforcement is greater than that which maximizes deterrence, but, smaller than that which minimizes criminal harm. Thus, ignoring preventive benefits and/or inconvenience costs results in an inefficient investment portfolio over enforcement methods, and in a predictable manner. Stopping standards, which determine the threshold suspicion required to trigger a stop, are tools that can be used to optimally trade-off the costs and benefits associated with preventive enforcement. The optimal stopping standard is weaker than its analogs in the trial context, namely standards of proof, which generally require preponderance of the evidence in civil trials and proof beyond a reasonable doubt in criminal trials. Finally, suspicionless stops can be optimal in a variety of circumstances, and are more likely optimal when enforcers perform poorly in forming suspicions; inconvenience costs are small; the population is unresponsive to deterrence measures; and the attempt rate is high.","[Mungan, Murat C.] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,"Mungan, MC (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Antonin Scalia Law Sch, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",mmungan@gmu.edu,,"Mungan, Murat/0000-0003-1948-6488",,,,,28,6,6,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1465-7252,1465-7260,,AM LAW ECON REV,Am.

The developments have been reported at past Thredbo Conferences, including by the author in 2007 and 2015. The franchising regime has been remarkably resilient and has been through at least five phases. Using the concept of regulatory cycles, this paper reviews the prospects for a sixth and possibly final phase. Rail statistics are reviewed and a welfare analysis of rail reforms in Britain is undertaken, building on and updating work presented in 2011. This suggests that franchising has been modestly welfare enhancing over the substantive phases of franchising to date, even though the transaction costs associated with franchising are substantial and apparently increasing. However, there remain concerns. Train operating costs remain high. There are also concerns about the costs that the vertical separation of operations and infrastructure impose on the system and there are plans for experiments with forms of integration. The competitive picture is evolving, in part in response to the commissioning of High Speed 2 and the Competition and Markets Authority's recommendations. Given this backdrop, this paper will consider some of the pros and cons of further changes to the franchising regime.","[Preston, John] Univ Southampton, Fac Engn & Environm, Transportat Grp, Room 4003,Bldg 176,Burgess Rd, Southampton SO16 7QF, Hants, England",University of Southampton,"Preston, J (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Fac Engn & Environm, Transportat Grp, Room 4003,Bldg 176,Burgess Rd, Southampton SO16 7QF, Hants, England.",jpreston@soton.ac.uk,,,,,,,59,3,3,0,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

For a range of issues, the policymaker (PM) prefers to remain less informed about policy than may be socially optimal, even when acquiring expertise or better information is costless. Such a strategy leads to more-intense lobbying competition and larger political contributions. We identify a novel benefit of campaign finance reform, showing how contribution limits decrease the incentives that PMs have to remain under-informed on the issues on which they vote. The analysis goes on to allow for a fully general information strategy in the spirit of Bayesian Persuasion.

In this context, British researchers, official policymaking bodies and NGOs have put forward the notion of 'transport poverty', building on an implicit analogy between (recognised) fuel poverty and (neglected) transport affordability issues. However, the conceptual similarities and differences between 'fuel' and 'transport' poverty remain largely unaddressed in the UK. This paper systematically compares and contrasts the two concepts, examining critically the assumption of a simple equivalence between them. We illustrate similarities and differences under four headings: (i) negative consequences of lack of warmth and lack of access; (ii) drivers of fuel and transport poverty; (iii) definition and measurement; (iv) policy interventions. Our review suggests that there are important conceptual and practical differences between transport and domestic energy consumption, with crucial consequences for how affordability problems amongst households are to be conceptualised and addressed. In a context where transport and energy exhibit two parallel policy worlds, the analysis in the paper and these conclusions reinforce how and why these differences matter. As we embark on an ever closer union between our domestic energy and transport energy systems the importance of these contradictions will become increasingly evident and problematic. This work contributes to the long-term debate about how best to manage these issues in a radical energy transition that properly pays attention to issues of equity and affordability.","[Mattioli, Giulio; Lucas, Karen; Marsden, Greg] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Mattioli, Giulio] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Mattioli, Giulio] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Room 104,34-40 Univ Rd, Leeds LS2 9JU, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds; University of Leeds; University of Leeds,"Mattioli, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.;Mattioli, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.;Mattioli, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Room 104,34-40 Univ Rd, Leeds LS2 9JU, W Yorkshire, England.",g.mattioli@leeds.ac.uk,"Mattioli, Giulio/JCF-0799-2023; Mattioli, Giulio/J-7314-2019","Mattioli, Giulio/0000-0003-1309-554X; Marsden, Greg/0000-0003-3570-2793; Lucas, Karen/0000-0002-4009-7017",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council as part of the RCUK Energy Programme [EP/M008096/1]; EPSRC [EP/M008096/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council as part of the RCUK Energy Programme(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This work arises from the research project Energy-related economic stress in the UK, at the interface between transport, housing and fuel poverty, funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (grant number EP/M008096/1) as part of the RCUK Energy Programme.

A trip survey was conducted in 2014 to explore the impacts of the economic crisis on the trip characteristics between the city centre and the greater area of Thessaloniki, the second largest city of Greece. The sample consisted of 853 randomly selected users of the city centre and is representative of the sex and age distribution of the overall population of the urban agglomeration. Aiming to minimise their expenses, the individuals have reduced the trip frequency by private car, notably for optional trip purposes like shopping and entertainment, or they have shifted to public transport, motorbike, walking and cycling for downtown trips. In some cases, this reduction in expenses led to household relocation. These changes were more evident in the lowest income groups. In general, the effects of the economic crisis are proving more effective in limiting car use compared to any sustainable mobility measure that has been implemented in the past. However, households, despite their income, appeared mostly uncertain to preserve any sustainable mobility behaviour. In fact, their decision seems to depend on the future economic conditions.","[Papagiannakis, Apostolos] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Spatial Planning & Dev, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece; [Baraklianos, Ioannis] ENTPE, Transport Urban Planning Econ Lab, Rue Maurice Audin, F-69518 Lyon, France; [Spyridonidou, Alexia] Inst Spatial Policies, Trzaska Cesta 2, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Papagiannakis, A (通讯作者)，Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Spatial Planning & Dev, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece.",apa@plandevel.auth.gr,"Papagiannakis, Apostolos/AFT-4588-2022","Papagiannakis, Apostolos/0000-0001-7183-2742",Research Committee of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki [89565],Research Committee of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,This research was supported by the Research Committee of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki under grand no 89565.,,29,34,38,3,38,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

These concerns have led many city and state legislatures to pass laws requiring drivers to provide a minimum amount of distance between their vehicle and cyclists when passing them on roadways. Many believe these laws are ineffective in reducing the number of bicyclist fatalities because they are difficult for police to enforce, contain loopholes, and the minimum distance required is inadequate. This paper tests this claim empirically using data on 18,534 bicyclist fatalities from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System and a differences-in-differences approach, in a negative binomial model, to identify the effect of minimum distance passing laws on bicyclist fatalities. The analysis fails to find a significant effect of enacting a minimum distance passing law on the number of cyclist fatalities after controlling for differences in weather, demographics, bicycling commuter rates, state level traffic, and time variation.","[Nehiba, Cody] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Nehiba, C (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",cnehiba@uci.edu,,,"University of California Center on Economic Competitiveness in Transportation; University of California, Irvine Department of Economics","University of California Center on Economic Competitiveness in Transportation; University of California, Irvine Department of Economics","The author thanks Kevin Roth, David Brownstone, Jan Brueckner, Linda Cohen, Paulina Oliva, Doug Houston, and seminar participants at UC Irvine, ITEA Annual Conference, and S4C Colloquium for their helpful suggestions.

However, the national labor law may impose some restrictions that delay or hamper the firing decision of the employer. This study proposes a different legal pathway for policymakers whose goal is to reduce the use of bankruptcy without acting on the design of the bankruptcy law. Using a sample of 33 countries from 2007 to 2015, we show that the total amount of firing restrictions leads to more bankruptcies. The employer's legal obligation to notify a third party prior the dismissal of one employee tends to increase the number of bankruptcies. It is very likely that the employer's rescue strategy endures an intense ex post monitoring of the employment contracts and/or a strong legal opposition to the layoff decision from such third party. In addition, labor codes that apply priority rules in case of reemployment can increase the use of bankruptcy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We use 3 measures of managerial overconfidence: the press coverage of chief executive officers, his/her age, and his/her experience in the industry. Our results show that the firms run by overconfident managers actually invest more in R&D expenditures, even after controlling for country, industry, and time factors. Overconfident managers not only spend more on R&D but also amplify the effect of financial determinants of R&D such as firm liquidity or profitability. Nevertheless, overconfident managers do not invest efficiently in R&D, and these expenditures can negatively affect the value of the firm.","[Zavertiaeva, Marina A.; Lopez-Iturriaga, Felix J.; Kuminova, Evgeniia V.] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Int Lab Intangible Driven Econ, Perm, Russia; [Lopez-Iturriaga, Felix J.] Univ Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); Universidad de Valladolid,"López-Iturriaga, FJ (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Int Lab Intangible Driven Econ, Perm, Russia.",flopez@eco.uva.es,"Zavertiaeva, Marina/AAR-2067-2020; Lopez-Iturriaga, Felix J./F-5321-2012","Zavertiaeva, Marina/0000-0002-9866-9137; Lopez-Iturriaga, Felix J./0000-0003-0875-5283",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2017-84864-P]; National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE) Basic Research Program,Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE) Basic Research Program,"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, Grant/Award Number: ECO2017-84864-P; National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE) Basic Research Program",,93,19,23,6,46,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,CHICHESTER,"THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0143-6570,1099-1468,,MANAG DECIS ECON,Manag.

They are seen by policy makers and private businesses as catalysts of regional economic integration, pushing traditional businesses into increasingly complex international value chains. However, the outcomes of such development initiatives are still barely understood. Critics argue that development policies are based on simplified models that are unable to sufficiently address the complexity of regional development. Policies on value-chain development, for example, can lead to conflicts, external dependencies, land rush, and a polarization of wealth. Growth corridors often go hand-in-hand with socio-economic transformations and land-use conflicts. This paper first discusses the theoretically possible desired and undesired regional socio-economic effects of modern corridors. Second, we illustrate the potential and challenges to realize integrative (or inclusive) development by contrasting three growth corridors: the SAGCOT growth corridor in Tanzania, the Walvis Bay-Ndola-Lubumbashi Development Corridor (WBNLDC) in Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe, and the growth corridors in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS).","[Dannenberg, Peter; Diez, Javier Revilla] Univ Cologne, Inst Geog, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany; [Schiller, Daniel] Univ Greifswald, Inst Geog & Geol, Makarenkostr 22, D-17487 Greifswald, Germany",University of Cologne; Universitat Greifswald,"Diez, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Inst Geog, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",p.dannenberg@uni-koeln.de; j.revilladiez@uni-koeln.de; daniel.schiller@uni-greifswald.de,"Schiller, Daniel/A-1553-2019; Revilla Diez, Javier/J-2392-2019; Dannenberg, Peter/J-5771-2016","Revilla Diez, Javier/0000-0003-2065-1380; Dannenberg, Peter/0000-0002-4159-6635",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft within the newly established collaborative research center [CRC228],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft within the newly established collaborative research center(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The authors are thankful for the constructive comments of two anonymous reviewers.

It argues that multinational companies should not only be viewed as victims of othering in that they suffer from obstructive policies and hostile public opinion, but rather that othering also matters within such firms. As a consequence of the links they establish between different countries, employees in such companies are constantly confronted with various socio-cultural backgrounds and frequently develop rather different expectations of how their counterparts should perform. This contribution analyses how and why managers and works councils in Germany practice distancing or othering towards owners of German firms located in China and India. It shows that othering can be critical within foreign direct investments. We approach the issue of othering by focusing on the sense of superiority of the involved parties, their positions in the company organisation and their related professional ethics, as well as the dynamics of othering that are mobilised in critical situations. The analysis is based on qualitative interviews from two different research projects.","[Fuchs, Martina] Univ Cologne, Wirtschafts & Sozialwissensch Fak, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany; [Franz, Martin] Univ Osnabruck, Geog, Seminarstr 19 A-B, D-49074 Osnabruck, Germany; [Henn, Sebastian] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Geog, Lehrstuhl Wirtschaftsgeog, Lobdergraben 32, D-07743 Jena, Germany",University of Cologne; University Osnabruck; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Fuchs, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Wirtschafts & Sozialwissensch Fak, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",fuchs@wiso.uni-koeln.de,"Fuchs, Martina/H-6035-2015; Henn, Sebastian/AAB-6552-2019","Fuchs, Martina/0000-0002-4644-1448; Henn, Sebastian/0000-0001-8313-7931; Franz, Martin/0000-0002-1187-5166",German Scientific Foundation [FU 424/15-1]; Hans Boeckler Foundation,German Scientific Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Hans Boeckler Foundation,"This manuscript has evolved in the context of different research projects.

Fiscal sustainability has emerged as an important subject for Swaziland given the increasingly volatile government revenues especially those coming through the South African Customs Union (SACU), which threw the country into a severe fiscal crisis between 2010 and 2012, as well as the pressures on increased government spending in the post-fiscal crisis era. Aim: This article primarily focuses on studying whether Swaziland's fiscal policy remains on a sustainable path or whether corrective measures would be required. Setting: Study focuses on Swaziland, a small open economy that is vulnerable to external shocks. The country also relies heavily on South African Customs Union (SACU) revenues. Methods: The study employs a broad approach to assessing fiscal sustainability in Swaziland covering both deterministic and stochastic analysis. On the deterministic analysis, the article studies the evolution of debt given macro-economic variables and further estimates fiscal sustainability indicators such as the primary gap and tax-gap. From a stochastic analysis, the article uses the Trehan and Walsh Methodology as well as Hakkio and Rush Methodology. Results: Fiscal sustainability indicators reflected that the country is on an unsustainable path with a primary gap and tax-gap of about 7% of gross domestic product (GDP) that has to be corrected. The econometric results also portray an evidence of 'weak-form' sustainability in the long-run. This is because public expenditures are rising at a faster pace than revenues thereby rendering government deficits unsustainable in the medium term. The econometric results also suggest a tax-spend hypothesis in the long-run, while short-run developments point to a spend-tax hypothesis. In both instances the correction measure is cutting expenditure, mainly recurrent expenditure. Conclusion: The study recommends corrective measures (mainly cuts in government expenditure) for fiscal policy to be brought back into a sustainable path without which a fiscal crisis is imminent. The recommendations are mainly based on the fiscal sustainability indicators as they are more forward looking for the short to medium term. The article suggests fiscal rules based on these indicators.","[Nxumalo, Welcome N.; Hlophe, Nomvuyo F.] Cent Bank Swaziland, Dept Econ Policy Res & Stat, Mbabane, Switzerland",,"Nxumalo, WN (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Swaziland, Dept Econ Policy Res & Stat, Mbabane, Switzerland.",ncobas22@gmail.com,,,Swaziland Economic Policy Analysis and Research Centre (SEPARC),Swaziland Economic Policy Analysis and Research Centre (SEPARC),"The authors would like to thank the Swaziland Economic Policy Analysis and Research Centre (SEPARC) who initiated the exercise of this research article through her call for paper and the 100% funding that they provided for this article.

Ask the business rescue practitioners,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,DELPHI METHOD,"Background: Business rescue, in terms of Chapter 6 of the Companies Act No 71 of 2008, is still relatively new to the South African business environment. The need for a successful business rescue regime is beyond doubt. However, a consistent manner to measure the success of the regime has not been determined. Previous research into possible indicators of business rescue success was based on a review of international business rescue regimes that share the same underlying philosophy as the South African business rescue regime. Aim and Setting: This study extends previous research efforts by soliciting the opinions of 16 South African, senior business rescue practitioners on the indicators of business rescue success. Method: The researchers used a qualitative research approach. The Delphi research technique was used to gather qualitative and quantitative empirical data from business rescue practitioners. Results: The experts reached a high level of consensus on various indicators of a successful business rescue. Most notable are that business rescue should save as many jobs as possible and that the actual outcome should be compared to that estimated in the business rescue plan. A novel indicator of success is the business rescue points saved or rescued, when using the public interest score.

J,"Dippenaar, M",,,,"Dippenaar, Mareli",,,The role of tax incentives in encouraging energy efficiency in the largest listed South African businesses,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,POLICY,"Background: South Africa is faced with a significant challenge of securing the supply of electricity as well as reducing its greenhouse gas emissions. The implementation of energy efficiency (EE) and renewable energy (RE) measures by energy consumers, especially businesses, is becoming increasingly important and a number of tax incentives have been introduced to promote EE and RE. Objective: The objective of this preliminary study was to determine the role that the available tax incentives play in the decision making of South African businesses regarding investment in RE or EE projects. Aim: To determine this role, the largest South African businesses were selected from the Johannesburg Stock Exchange Top 40 Index. Method: The study contained both empirical and non-empirical elements. A literature review was conducted to determine the role of tax incentives globally, while questionnaires were distributed to determine the role in South Africa. Results: Findings highlighted that, while tax incentives do play a role in decision making, various other non-tax factors drive South African businesses' decisions to invest in EE and/or RE projects. These businesses do not perceive the available tax incentives as effective, nor do they regard them as sufficiently motivating for businesses to change their environmental behaviour. They also feel that the government should reduce the burden of complying with the requirements of Section 12L (the EE allowance). Conclusion: Improving the available RE and EE tax incentives in South Africa might result in more businesses considering the implementation of RE or EE projects. It is therefore recommended that the available tax incentives are expanded and/or the qualifying criteria simplified.","[Dippenaar, Mareli] Stellenbosch Univ, Sch Accountancy, Stellenbosch, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Dippenaar, M (通讯作者)，Stellenbosch Univ, Sch Accountancy, Stellenbosch, South Africa.",lagrange@sun.ac.za,,"Dippenaar, Mareli/0000-0002-1589-0187",,,,,57,4,8,0,9,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

As a hybrid and immensely popular system run by the NCAA, intercollegiate athletics has been critiqued as ethically hypocritical, educationally corrosive, materially exploitative, and economically unsustainable. Economic, political and legal pressure has been building over the last 10 years to reform the system. Such reform will ultimately require a choice between the professional and the amateur models, or a bifurcation whereby a select group of a few dozen schools chooses a professional paradigm while a thousand-plus schools opt for the official NCAA vision of academically centered amateur athletics. After considering the arguments for a market-oriented reform in the direction of professionalism, I argue for an educationally-based reform that is accompanied by a constrained and conditional antitrust exemption for the NCAA or an alternative governing body.","[Zimbalist, Andrew] Smith Coll, Northampton, MA 01063 USA",Smith College,"Zimbalist, A (通讯作者)，Smith Coll, Northampton, MA 01063 USA.",azimbali@smith.edu,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

The purpose of this paper is to approach the SE by means of the latent variable method and the structural equation model-partial least squares and to explore similar behaviors in terms of the obtained results, by analyzing the subsamples of the countries under observation. Political measures need to be implemented carefully to counter the effects of the SE and policy-makers should have to adopt economic policy practices to drive the SE into the formal economy, particularly in less-developed countries.","[Quintano, Claudio; Mazzocchi, Paolo] Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Management & Quantitat Studies, Via G Parisi 13, I-80132 Naples, Italy",Parthenope University Naples,"Mazzocchi, P (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Management & Quantitat Studies, Via G Parisi 13, I-80132 Naples, Italy.",paolo.mazzocchi@uniparthenope.it,"Quintano, Claudio/AAZ-2542-2020",,,,,,67,3,3,1,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

In the framework of the neoclassical theory, human capital is one of the most competitive, non-copiable source that households have. Thus, there are legitimate questions: first, how to evaluate the effectiveness of household investments in financial instruments and human capital, and secondly, which of the types of household investment will be most effective?

Today, there is a lack of a wide variety of methodologies for assessing the economic security of public higher education institutions, and the existing methodologies in most cases have a number of limitations. This circumstance has necessitated the construction of a comprehensive methodology for assessing the level of economic security of public universities that meets modern requirements. On the basis of the formulated principles and criteria, a step-by-step methodology for assessing the economic security of the state University on the basis of public reporting data was developed. However, this methodological development needed to be tested in order to confirm its effectiveness. Thus, the research objective was to test the developed methodology for assessing the economic security of a state university. Universities under the jurisdiction of the Federal Agency for Fisheries (FAR) were selected as the object of the study. The subject of the research is the activity of state organizations of higher education in the framework of ensuring their economic security. The basis of the study was the works of domestic and foreign authors; regulatory and legal acts of the Russian Federation governing the activities of universities; public reporting of FAR universities. The study identified the strengths and weaknesses of FAR universities, recommendations to improve the level of economic security of each educational institution. Also the main problems of the entire set of higher education institutions within the jurisdiction of FAR were identified. The approbation showed the effectiveness of the developed methodology for assessing the economic security of a state university. This methodology includes a scorecard, as well as reasonable threshold values. It allows not only to assess the level of economic security of the institution as a whole, but can be used to compare the level of economic security of any aggregate of universities according to certain criteria: jurisdiction, regional affiliation, university profile, etc. The methodology is based on public reporting data, that allows its use by a wide range of people.","[Bastrykin, Sergey V.; Vorob'eva, Olga A.; Demko, Olesya A.; Obukhova, Nadezhda S.; Taraskina, Anna V.] Astrakhan State Tech Univ, Dept Econ Secur, Astrakhan, Russia",Astrakhan State Technical University,"Bastrykin, SV (通讯作者)，Astrakhan State Tech Univ, Dept Econ Secur, Astrakhan, Russia.",,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,7244,7254,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553208021,0

The results of this study indicate that the dimensions of trust (Multi Dimensional Trust) influence the intention of the community in adopting e-money services, while the perceived risk does not affect the intention of the community in adopting e-money services. Performance expectation variable (Performance Expectancy) is the biggest factor that influences people's intention to adopt e-money services.

This paper aims at measuring the temporal dynamics of influences of domestic and external factors on the variance of four main types of capital inflows to Croatia and analysing policy implications stemming from the results. The empirical analysis employing a SVAR model revealed that, amongst other things, the inflows of equity capital were under a dominant influence of eurozone indicators, while the debt flows were under a more significant influence of domestic factors.

Even if such firms do not deliberately follow an open innovation strategy, they are exposed to knowledge flows from other organisations. A particularly interesting issue is the connection between openness and the need to develop dynamic capabilities for distinct phases of knowledge processing. Building on resource-based views, we have developed hypotheses on the respective importance of KIBS firms' dynamic capabilities and their inclination to engage in open innovation.

This standard is useful for the proposed electronic healthcare system which monitors the health state of pregnant women and persons who have blood pressure diseases by using a smart bracelet which continuously monitors their blood pressure. The patients can also send messages to their personal doctor about their state.

The perspectives of firms and academic researchers, the main stakeholders of KTOs, are useful complements to assess KTO activity. The goal of this article is to study the effectiveness that these stakeholders attribute to KTOs. Based on survey data collected in the Spanish region of Andalusia, the article explores stakeholders' perceptions and determinants. The results show that the level of engagement in a diversified range of activities and the importance attributed to knowledge transfer in the strategy of both research groups and firms are the best predictors of the perceived effectiveness of KTOs.

J,"Sil, R; Samuelson, K",,,,"Sil, Rudra; Samuelson, Kate",,,Anatomy of a massacre: the roots of heightened labour militancy in South Africa's platinum belt,ECONOMY AND SOCIETY,,,English,Article,,,,,,South Africa; Marikana; labour; trade unions; strikes; miners,MARIKANA,"On 16 August 2012, a protracted strike at a platinum mine in Marikana, South Africa, culminated in the killing of 34 mineworkers by local security forces. Some viewed this tragedy through the lens of South Africa's apartheid past, recalling such events as the Sharpeville massacre of 1960. Others saw this episode as the latest cycle of angry protest and violent repression stemming from heightened inequality and poverty under global capitalism. This paper explores a set of institutional factors that occupy the middle ground between these two narratives about the massacre at Marikana. At the national level, despite progressive labour regulations and a long-standing alliance between the leading trade union (COSATU) and the ruling African National Congress, institutional channels for social dialogue and collective bargaining were less effective than expected given COSATU's inability to criticize policies focused on business-led growth at the expense of the social protection of workers. At the sectoral level, gigantic platinum companies faced with falling commodity prices sought to limit losses by planning retrenchments and limiting wage increases, triggering repeated and sometimes violent wildcat strikes, especially when workers' grievances were set aside by local representatives of the COSATU-affiliated National Union of Mineworkers. The argument may be seen as a labour-focused variant of Huntington's gap hypothesis': workers' militancy has grown as existing institutional frameworks for ensuring labour peace have failed to effectively channel the frustrations of workers most in need of social protection.","[Sil, Rudra] Univ Penn, Dept Polit Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Samuelson, Kate] Univ Oxford, St Antonys Coll, Oxford OX2 6JF, England",University of Pennsylvania; University of Oxford,"Sil, R (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Dept Polit Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",rudysil@sas.upenn.edu; kate.samuelson@sant.ox.ac.ok,,,,,,,71,5,5,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

This pattern is aimed at increasing the efficiency of the business structure as a whole.","[Smagina, Valentina; Yakunina, Inna; Danova, Natalia] Tambov State Univ, Tambov, Russia",Derzhavin Tambov State University,"Smagina, V (通讯作者)，Tambov State Univ, Tambov, Russia.",dissovet@tsu.tmb.ru; yakunina@bk.ru; m-natali26@yandex.ru,,"Smagina, Valentina/0000-0002-3899-0236",,,,,8,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,2869,2876,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553203091,0

Economic institutions affect economic growth through allocation of resources like physical and human capital. Unfortunately, there is dearth of empirical studies showing the impact of economic institutions on growth of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Aim: This study investigates the impact of economic institutions on economic growth of the ECOWAS. Setting and method: The study applied cause and effect relationship. The study used econometric research techniques of unit root and co-integration tests to establish the time series properties of the data; the vector error correction and co-integration regression models to estimate the population parameters. The research data comprised data obtained from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the Transparency International (TI) and Heritage Foundation databases. The variables employed were the real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (RGDPPC), corruption perception index (CPI), property rights protection (PROPRGT), private investment per capita (INVESPC), government expenditure per capita (GOEXPPC) and trade openness (TRAOPN). Results: The results of the data analysed showed that economic institutions represented by the property rights index engender RGDPPC growth in ECOWAS. The CPI could not stimulate RGDPPC growth in ECOWAS. The results also show that all the other variables stimulated growth except trade openness. Conclusion: The study concludes that good economic institutions, private investments, and government intervention by providing security, economic and social infrastructural facilities are conducive for economic growth in the ECOWAS region. The study recommended that more efforts be made at curbing corruption in the region.","[Wanjuu, Lazarus Z.; le Roux, Pierre] Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Dept Econ, Port Elizabeth, South Africa",Nelson Mandela University,"Wanjuu, LZ (通讯作者)，Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Dept Econ, Port Elizabeth, South Africa.",s214030008@nmmu.ac.za,,,,,,,47,8,9,0,10,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

When firms locate first, they locate inefficiently and always underinvest in cost-reducing R&D. Although the R&D investment improves social welfare under either timing, profit always declines and so it would never be undertaken if firms cooperate. Both timings are relevant as we identify circumstances under which each will endogenously be chosen in a premarket stage.

This research proposes such empirical assessment for the Paris region, using a simple method based on individuals' trip durations. We combine information on passengers and commercial transport (to describe road demand) with a GIS describing the stock of infrastructures (road supply) on that territory. According to econometric results, the travel times react differently to the flow of similar and dissimilar vehicles: Cars and vans are more impacted than trucks by the volume of small vehicles, whereas large vehicles are more affected than cars and vans by the presence of other large vehicles. Our methodology thus highlights varying and reciprocal congestion impacts, which is not common in the literature. We then propose various marginal congestion costs, for various origin-destination pairs, various time periods and various types of vehicles. In particular, we decompose external losses incurred to each category of vehicles by each category of vehicles. These results constitute valuable materials for future appraisals of transport policies in the Paris region.","[Beziat, Adrien; Koning, Martin] Univ Paris, IFSTTAR, East 14-20 Blvd Newton, F-77447 Marne La Vallee, France; [Toilier, Florence] 2 Rue Maurice Andin, F-69518 Vaulx En Velin, France",Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Universite Paris Cite,"Beziat, A (通讯作者)，Univ Paris, IFSTTAR, East 14-20 Blvd Newton, F-77447 Marne La Vallee, France.",adrien.beziat@ifsttar.fr; martin.koning@ifsttar.fr; florence.toilier@entpe.fr,,,Volvo Research and Educational Foundations through the MetroFreight Center of Excellence; Ile-de-France region; ADEME; DRIEA,Volvo Research and Educational Foundations through the MetroFreight Center of Excellence; Ile-de-France region(Region Ile-de-France); ADEME; DRIEA,"We would like to acknowledge the two anonymous referees for their constructive comments and suggestions.

We document a postacquisition decrease in output prices with no concomitant decrease in revenues for the main common supplier industry.

It is an important contribution because it recognises the heterogeneous nature of vulnerability across areas within a country, but its analysis is aspatial because it does not explicitly account for the relative location of or the potential for spillovers between areas. Aim: This article aims to provide a purely methodological contribution towards the debate surrounding the measurement of multidimensional vulnerability by: (1) augmenting Naude et al. (2009b)'s model to take account of spatial contiguity, (2) comparing spatial and aspatial local vulnerability indices estimates to illustrate the presence and importance of spatial spillovers between contiguous areas and (3) extending their methodology on the Vulnerability Intervention Index to present results which highlight areas that are performing better and worse than expected. Methods: Principal components analysis, queen-contiguity weight matrix and local indication of spatial association (LISA) maps were utilised. Results: Application of the methodological extensions to South African Magisterial District data illustrates the presence and importance of spatial spillovers in shaping local vulnerability. Conclusions: Our results illustrate a clear urban-rural vulnerability divide and the need for appropriate policy. It is argued that account of spatial spillovers is an important issue if full and accurate vulnerability indices are to be identified.","[Rossouw, Stephanie] Auckland Univ Technol, Fac Business Econ & Law, Sch Econ, Auckland, New Zealand",Auckland University of Technology,"Rossouw, S (通讯作者)，Auckland Univ Technol, Fac Business Econ & Law, Sch Econ, Auckland, New Zealand.",stephanie.rossouw@aut.ac.nz,,"Rossouw, Stephanie/0000-0003-3538-9215",,,,,61,0,0,1,5,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Only models that use employers' expectations on a longer sample do better at short horizons. Furthermore, quarterly predictions constructed using Google-based models provide forecasts that are more accurate than those from the Survey of Professional Forecasters, models based on labor force flows, or standard nonlinear models.

Drawing on survey data, this study examines the relationships between the neighbourhood food environment, mobility and obesity among residents from the lower eastside neighbourhoods of Detroit, Michigan. Certain dimensions of the local food environment are found to contribute to obesity, but these dimensions occur at different scales. Residents who rely on their immediate neighbourhood food environment have a higher likelihood of being obese than residents who do not utilise the stores around them. At a broader level, lower eastside Detroit residents with a greater concentration of fast food establishments around them have a higher possibility of being obese than residents with fewer fast food restaurants around them. The salience of the fast food environment warrants additional attention in terms of public health interventions.","[Ledoux, Timothy F.] Westfield State Univ, Dept Geog & Reg Planning, 577 Western Ave,POB 1630, Westfield, MA 01086 USA; [Vojnovic, Igor] Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog, 118 Geography Bldg, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Thomas, June Manning] Univ Michigan, A Alfred Taubman Coll Architecture & Urban Planni, 2000 Bonisteel Blvd, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Pothukuchi, Kameshwari] Wayne State Univ, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, 656 W Kirby, Detroit, MI 48202 USA",Massachusetts System of Public Higher Education; Westfield State University; Michigan State University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Wayne State University,"Ledoux, TF (通讯作者)，Westfield State Univ, Dept Geog & Reg Planning, 577 Western Ave,POB 1630, Westfield, MA 01086 USA.",tledoux@westfield.ma.edu; vojnovic@msu.edu; thomasju@umich.edu; k.pothukuchi@wayne.edu,"LeDoux, Timothy/ABB-9859-2021","LeDoux, Timothy/0000-0002-5556-3105",NSF's HSD [SES 0624263],NSF's HSD,The authors would like to thank Dr. Bouke van Gorp and the anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments and suggestions that helped strengthen the quality of this article.

This paper focuses on the 1995 Czech Parental Benefit reform which extended the payment of universal parental benefits to 4 years instead of 3 without an equivalent extension of job-protected parental leave, leaving to mothers the choice of either guaranteed return to employment or an additional 12 months of benefits. The study relies on a difference-in-differences strategy to assess the net effect of this large-scale reform on mothers' labour market participation. I find a strong negative impact on mothers' probability of return to work at the end of parental leave, with a heterogeneous size with respect to their educational attainment. I also find evidence of the persistence of this detrimental effect on mothers' employment beyond the short-term horizon targeted by the legislators.","[Mullerova, Alzbeta] Univ Paris Nanterre, F-92001 Nanterre, France; [Mullerova, Alzbeta] IOS Regensburg, F-92001 Nanterre, France",,"Mullerova, A (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Nanterre, F-92001 Nanterre, France.;Mullerova, A (通讯作者)，IOS Regensburg, F-92001 Nanterre, France.",alzbeta.mullerova@u-paris10.fr,,"Mullerova, Alzbeta/0000-0002-1585-3167",,,,,29,14,14,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

The analysis uses a new data set based on harmonised small area data and harmonised morphological definitions of what a town is. The paper hypothesises first that a general model of demographic growth can be applied across national urban systems and secondly that regional demographic change is a significant predictor of demographic change in towns nested within those regions within this generalised model. A fixed effect multi-level regression analysis tests the importance of town-level and regional factors among towns from five national systems but also within two individual national urban systems. The findings suggest that national context still matters and within some national systems, regional context also strongly predicts demographic change in towns.","[Smith, Ian] Univ West England, Dept Accounting Econ & Finance, Bristol, Avon, England",University of West England,"Smith, I (通讯作者)，Univ West England, Dept Accounting Econ & Finance, Bristol, Avon, England.",ian5.smith@uwe.ac.uk,,,ESPON - European Regional Development Fund,ESPON - European Regional Development Fund,This work has been funded by the ESPON 2013 Programme which is partly financed by the European Regional Development Fund.

Our main identification strategy, which combines spatial and time differencing, shows that conditional on locating in a municipality that hosts a ZFU, the policy has a positive and sizable impact on the probability to locate in the ZFU part rather than in the non-ZFU part of municipalities. However, the impact is highly heterogeneous across zones, industries and firms. We also show that this positive effect is entirely due to within-municipality diversion effects. Regarding labor market outcomes, the policy has a positive effect on employment, especially for low-wage workers. As for wages, the effect is null for low-wage workers, and negative for high-wage ones.","[Mayer, Thierry] Sci Po, CEPII, CEPR, Banque France, Paris, France; [Mayneris, Florian] Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, CORE, Louvain, Belgium; [Py, Loriane] Banque France, Inst Polit Publ, Paris, France",European Central Bank; Bank of France; Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po); Universite Catholique Louvain; European Central Bank; Bank of France,"Mayneris, F (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, CORE, Louvain, Belgium.",florian.mayneris@uclouvain.be,,,"Direction de l'Animation de Recherche et des Statistiques (DARES, French Ministry of Labour); Secretariat General du Comite Interministeriel des Villes (SG-CIV, French Ministry of Urban Affairs); French State grant through the program Investissements d'Avenir [ANR-10-EQPX-17]","Direction de l'Animation de Recherche et des Statistiques (DARES, French Ministry of Labour); Secretariat General du Comite Interministeriel des Villes (SG-CIV, French Ministry of Urban Affairs); French State grant through the program Investissements d'Avenir(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR))","This research was partly funded by the Direction de l'Animation de Recherche et des Statistiques (DARES, French Ministry of Labour) and the Secretariat General du Comite Interministeriel des Villes (SG-CIV, French Ministry of Urban Affairs).

However, it is well known that all transit trips have an access and egress component which is mostly executed through walking or bicycling. Hence, the choice of whether to choose transit for a particular trip depends as much on the walking or bicycling component of the trip as the transit component itself. A major source of inaccuracy in traditional mode share estimation models is the failure to identify this inherent dependence of transit trips on bicycling and walking. In New Delhi, where almost all access and egress trips for buses are made by bicycle/walking, the inaccuracies in mode share estimation could be more significant. This research aims to study behavioral effects of integrating bicycling and walking infrastructure with transit and provide predictions for outcomes of policy implementations modifying bicycle-to-transit or walk-to-transit environment in New Delhi. Four policy variables each are selected that affect pedestrian access to transit (sidewalk width, lighting, crossings and surrounding hygiene) and bicycle access to transit (bicycle lane, bicycle parking, bicycle sharing and on-board vehicle capacity) respectively. To gauge user behavior for hypothetical situations, stated preference survey data is collected through intercept surveys. 90 respondents were interviewed with upto 10 choice scenarios per individual with a total of 897 scenario responses (461 Pedestrian Infrastructure Scenarios +436 Bicycle Infrastructure Scenarios). Choice modelling is performed through a simple Multinomial Logit (MNL) model (in case there is no significant heterogeneity among individual preferences) and Random-Taste Mixed Logit model (to incorporate significant heterogeneity among various types of individual preferences). Modelling results showed that among pedestrian infrastructure, only presence of crossings could affect transit use and there is possibly significant heterogeneity in the population regarding use of sidewalks. Among bicycle infrastructure variables, presence of bicycle lanes and bicycle sharing is expected to positively impact transit use with no significant heterogeneity among the population. Finally, based on modelling results, three policy implementation scenarios are tested presence of pedestrian crossings near all transit stops, introduction of bicycle lanes throughout the city and introduction of bicycle sharing system throughout the city. The scenario analysis shows possibility of considerable rise in transit mode share and GHG emission savings. This motivates further research to corroborate these findings with a larger sample, evaluation of viability of the ideas and possibly investigating implementation details.","[Mohanty, Sudatta] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bansal, Sugam; Bairwa, Khushi] Indian Inst Technol, New Delhi 110016, India",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi,"Mohanty, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",sudatta.mohanty@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,43,19,22,2,28,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Rabinowicz's account is subject, however, to one important objection: if strict preferences involve betterness judgements, then his analysis contrasts with the intuitive understanding of parity. In this paper, I examine Rabinowicz's three responses to this objection and argue that they do not succeed. I then propose an alternative solution. I argue that the objection can be avoided if we relativize' Rabinowicz's account and define parity in terms of opposite strict preferences between two items that are only relatively permissible, rather than permissible simpliciter. I argue that this account of parity can be defended if we take seriously the distinction between sufficient and decisive reason for a preference relation. I also show that, on the basis of this distinction, we can arrive at a more extensive taxonomy of value relations than the one proposed by Rabinowicz.","[Rossi, Mauro] Univ Quebec, Dept Philosophie, CP 8888,Succursale Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Rossi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec, Dept Philosophie, CP 8888,Succursale Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",rossi.mauro@uqam.ca,,,,,,,18,2,2,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

A survey was carried out in Guangzhou, China to examine respondents' car ownership and travel mode perceptions and choices, as well as personal and situational characteristics. A quota sampling procedure was used to select members of three different groups: car owners; no car but planning to buy one in the next 5 years car intenders; and no car and not planning to buy one. We find that car ownership is the most important among included predictors of travel mode choice, which also depend on other personal and situational factors, but only indirectly by attitudinal factors. However, attitudinal factors have a strong impact on the intention to buy a car, while controlling for other personal and situational factors. Our results suggest that several policies can be further improved in China for greater effectiveness in reducing the car use of car owners and car intenders. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Using two national longitudinal studies: the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey Children and Young Adults (NLSCYA) and the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey (NLSY79), we link the financial behavior of 2,520 young adults back to their general self-control skill and their parents' financial behavior conducted during children's adolescence. We find evidence of intergenerational consistency in financial behavior between parents and their children. Results from the generalized structural equation model indicate that parents' financial behavior affects that of their children both directly and indirectly through general self-control skill development. Furthermore, the influence of parents is moderated by parent-child relationship. These findings highlight the importance of parental financial socialization. Its implications are discussed.","[Tang, Ning] San Diego State Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Finance, San Diego, CA 92182 USA",California State University System; San Diego State University,"Tang, N (通讯作者)，San Diego State Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Finance, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",ntang@mail.sdsu.edu,,,,,,,52,27,35,1,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

J,"Rateiwa, R; Aziakpono, MJ",,,,"Rateiwa, Ronald; Aziakpono, Meshach J.",,,Non-bank financial institutions and economic growth: Evidence from Africa's three largest economies,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Background: In order for the post-2015 world development agenda - termed the sustainable development goals (SDGs) - to succeed, there is a pronounced need to ensure that available resources are used more effectively and additional financing is accessed from the private sector. Given that traditional bank lending has slowed down, the development of non-bank financing has become imperative. To this end, this article intends to empirically test the role of non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) in stimulating economic growth. Aim: The aim of this article is to empirically test the existence of a long-run equilibrium relationship between economic growth and the development of NBFIs, and the causality thereof. Setting: The empirical assessment uses time-series data from Africa's three largest economies, namely, Egypt, Nigeria and South Africa, over the period 1971-2013. Methods: This article uses the Johansen cointegration and vector error correction model within a country-specific setting. Results: The results showed that the long-run relationship between NBFI development and economic growth is relatively stronger in Egypt and South Africa, than in Nigeria. Evidence in respect of Nigeria shows that such a relationship is weak. The nature of the relationship between NBFI development and economic growth in Egypt is positive and significant, and predominantly bidirectional. This suggests that a virtuous relationship between NBFIs and economic growth exists in Egypt. In South Africa, the relationship is positive and significant and predominantly runs from NBFI development to economic growth, implying a supply-leading phenomenon. In Nigeria, the results are weak and mixed. Conclusion: The study concludes that in countries with more developed financial systems, the role of NBFIs and their importance to the economic growth process are more pronounced. Thus, there is need for developing policies targeted at developing the NBFI sector, given their potential to contribute to economic growth.","[Rateiwa, Ronald] Univ Stellenbosch, Business Sch, Stellenbosch, South Africa; Competit Commiss South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Rateiwa, R (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Business Sch, Stellenbosch, South Africa.",rrateiwa@hotmail.com,,"Aziakpono, Meshach/0000-0002-5290-3311",,,,,48,11,11,1,9,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The trade-off between agglomeration and dispersion forces in the form of pollution from stationary forces, production externalities and commuting costs, determines the emergence of industrial and residential clusters across space. In this context, we define two kinds of spatial policies that can be used in order to close the gap between optimal and market allocations. More specifically, we show that the joint implementation of a site-specific environmental tax and a site-specific labor subsidy can reproduce the optimum as an equilibrium outcome.

Also, academic research puts emphasis on a need for investigations of the roles, expectations and requirements of followers in the leadership-followership relationship. Followers' experiences and expectations of leadership behaviours in an air navigation service provider (ANSP) organisation were investigated and served as orientation and setting applicable to this study. Aim: The aim of the research was to identify and understand how follower experiences and expectations of leadership behaviours in a safety-critical commercial environment can affect leadership training and growth. The above-mentioned motivated this investigation of leadership traits and behaviours within an explicit context and from a follower's viewpoint. Setting: The setting for the study was twenty two Air Traffic and Navigation Services Company sites where followers' experiences and expectations of leadership behaviours in an air navigation service provider (ANSP) organisation were investigated and served as orientation and setting applicable to this study. Methods: An ethnographic case study research style was adopted and followed because it allowed for an all-inclusive, holistic narrative report and interpretation. The samples for the quantitative and qualitative components of this study were parallel and methods employed addressed different aspects of the phenomenon, which allowed for a mixed methods research design. A one-way causality in the research design was observed because traits of followers that might influence leaders' behaviours were excluded. Data were collected by means of a Leader Trait and Behaviour Questionnaire completed by participants, individual interviews and focus group consultations. Results: Research findings dispensed a deeper appreciation of followers' epistemological and ontological views, within a specified context, which were supported by a common need to achieve organisational safety objectives. A practical managerial benefit was found in the insights presented by followers of leadership, which can possibly benefit leadership development and training needs, along with training and advancement of followers. Conclusions: Research findings potentially add to enhancing understanding of leadership development theory, synonymous with a safety-critical commercial setting. A critical insight into the 'unexplored' leadership behaviour qualities found within a safety-critical milieu is subsequently offered.","[Joubert, Christiaan G.] Air Traff & Nav Serv, Gauteng, South Africa; [Feldman, Joseph A.] Univ South Africa, Grad Sch Business Leadership, Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Feldman, JA (通讯作者)，Univ South Africa, Grad Sch Business Leadership, Pretoria, South Africa.",feldmja@unisa.ac.za,,,,,,,83,4,10,0,1,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The draft directive delegates the right to define one apportionment factor, the term 'Employee' to the Member States, which can choose a narrow or a broad definition, the latter including also atypical employment schemes. Using a game-theoretic approach we show that defining 'Employee' broadly so as to maximize the Member State's share in the apportionment factor is only optimal when tax rate differences and different sizes of atypical employment schemes are disregarded. If such differentials and the multinational corporation's reactions to different domestic definitions are included a narrow definition of 'Employee' yields the highest individual pay-offs to the countries involved. Our paper differs from previous research on the economic effects of the CCCTB apportionment formula as it is the first analysing the employment factor and its distortive effects. We discuss possible tax minimizing strategies for multinationals by shifting employment and develop a model to quantify these potential relocations. The results of our paper may be relevant for the European Commission and the Council, when debating the details of formula apportionment. Furthermore we show how Member States could use the 'Employee' definition to both minimize factor emigration and maximize factor immigration, if the factor definitions remain unchanged.","[Eberhartinger, Eva; Petutschnig, Matthias] WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Finance Accounting & Stat, A-1020 Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Petutschnig, M (通讯作者)，WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Finance Accounting & Stat, A-1020 Vienna, Austria.",eva.eberhartinger@wu.ac.at; matthias.petutschnig@wu.ac.at,,,,,,,47,1,1,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

In doing so, they have frequently failed to account for systematic bias in the seats-votes curve, and been unable to provide candidates and campaign strategists with constituency-level information. On the other hand, existing accounts of constituency-level election forecasting suffer from data sparsity, leading to a lack of precision. This paper proposes a correction-combination procedure that allows for the correction of individual constituency-level forecast models for election-invariant bias, then combines these models based on their past performances.

That is, there should be deregulation once the entrant is fully competitive with the incumbent. This is because temporary regulation accelerates corporate investment and enhances economic welfare.

A Review of Consumer Perceptions of and Behavior Toward the Price of Organic Food,JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS,,,English,Review,,,,,,,WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; PRODUCTS-IMPLICATIONS; LIFE-STYLES; DEMAND; CONSUMPTION; MARKET; DETERMINANTS; CHOICE; MILK; LABELS,"Support for organic farming is a promising policy for improving sustainability in the food sector. Further consumer demand, however, is hindered by high prices. We review research from 2000 to 2014 on the role of perceived price, income, price knowledge, willingness to pay, and reactions to price changes on organic food. We find that price is the major perceived barrier to purchase. Income is only a partial explanatory factor and is superseded by psychographic variables. Willingness to pay a premium is around 30% (ranging from 0% to 105%) and depends on consumer segments and product category.

In the case of intelligence agencies, we presume they rely on reason and science to protect the national interest. By contrast, the general view of secret societies and occult groups is that they engage in rituals and practices that have little or nothing to do with normal social intercourse, or even with reality. This article shows that these common assumptions are false, and that secret societies and intelligence agencies share many important traits. Our understanding of the CIA's role in supporting the production of Hollywood movies will be enhanced by taking these similarities into account. Intelligence work and the operations of secret societies are shown to overlap in five categories: religious underpinnings, occult practices to control the mind, cryptography, violations of social convention, and cryptic transparencythe ability to carry out secret activities in plain sight. These affinities explain why the CIA can promote movies that are actually quite candid in their revelation of the dark underside of the Agency. In so doing, the CIA projects a subliminal message that whatever questionable actions it takes are justified by a higher good, which can only be known by insiders.",,,,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Robust risk equalisation is especially important in an Irish context given acute risk segmentation and incentives for risk selection that have evolved within the market. Using uniquely acquired VHI data (N=1,235,922) this analysis assesses the predictive efficacy of both current and alternative risk equalisation specifications. Results suggest that the low predictive power of the current risk equalisation design (R-2 = 6.8 per cent) is not appropriately correcting for anti-competitive incentives and asymmetries in the market.

Roughly, this criterion says that one institutional scheme is normatively superior to another to the extent that the former engenders more widespread political competition than the latter. I show that this criterion should be endorsed by both global egalitarians and their statist rivals, as it follows from their common commitment to the moral equality of all persons. I illustrate the normative import of the competition criterion by exploring its potential implications for the scope of egalitarian principles of distributive justice. In particular, I highlight the challenges it raises for global egalitarians' efforts to justify extending the scope of egalitarian justice beyond the state.","[Wiens, David] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Polit Sci, 9500 Gilman Dr,323 SSB 0521, La Jolla, CA 92092 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Wiens, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Polit Sci, 9500 Gilman Dr,323 SSB 0521, La Jolla, CA 92092 USA.",dwiens@ucsd.edu,"Wiens, David/H-3624-2019","Wiens, David/0000-0002-2221-0725",,,,,102,1,1,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

Recently, the film industry has worked with related firms to develop a standardized ecosystem for the sale and access to digital versions of their films. This system, known as UltraViolet, embodies infinite durability; the perpetual access to a purchased film across computing platforms and time. The author makes use of exogenous variation in the implementation of this system to study the effect the introduction of this new feature has had on the decision to buy or rent. His findings show that the inclusion of infinite durability creates enough value to spur increased purchasing behavior. Also, the inclusion of infinite durability creates a high degree of substitutability amongst products that include it in purchase markets. Lastly, the author found evidence that the lack of inclusion of infinite durability will spur consumers to rent rather than buy.","[Axarlian, Gabriel Pablo] Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Econ, Northridge, CA 91330 USA",California State University System; California State University Northridge,"Axarlian, GP (通讯作者)，Dept Econ, Bookstein Hall,Room 3125 18111,Nordhoff St, Northridge, CA 91330 USA.",gaxarlian@gmail.com,,,,,,,18,2,2,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0899-7764,1532-7736,,J MEDIA ECON,J.

The greatest human achievements have been accomplished by using these one-time processes projects, regardless of which human activity they are related to (flight to the moon - the Apollo project, the tunnel under the Mont Blanc, etc.). An investment project is a set of very complex activities and procedures in which, although all segments are taken into account, undesirable and unpredictable situations can always occur. In each project, no matter how similar or even identical to the previous one it may seem, attention should be devoted to the smallest of details to reduce the risks to the lowest possible level. Disregard could prove fatal for a company or organisation, and in case of a large project, it could lead to bankruptcy and liquidation of companies. A project is, in fact, a unique process, at least with the set object of the project, so the organisation must adapt to projects that are very different in terms of object, duration, ultimate goals, purpose, environment in which they appear, complexity in terms of costs, investments, etc. This is evident when projects related to new products are compared, projects of building an electric power plant, overhaul projects, and other.",,,,edvard.badurina@gmail.com,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2017,13.0,,,,,,81,90,,,,,,10,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM4RS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000463854000005,0

This paper acts as a corrective by presenting evidence to show that since the financial crash of 2008 the political terrain the City operates on has become more contested, crowded and noisier. The contribution develops a middle course between a positive assessment of the role of civil society in relation to global finance, and a more pessimistic reading. We demonstrate how macro-narratives and public story-telling both construct and contest City and financial sector power. In a new pattern since the financial crash, NGOs have moved from campaigns of limited duration and narrow focus, to a more sustained presence on macro-structural issues. Adopting a supply-demand framework for assessing governance and regulatory change, we look at the emergence of TheCityUK as a new advocacy arm and the strategies of three of the more prominent and focused NGOs that have mobilized in the aftermath of the crash: the Tax Justice Network's (TJN) use of the 'finance curse'; Positive Money on private endogenous money creation; and Finance Watch counterweight strategies at the level of the European Union. We suggest these mobilizations highlight the need for a more concerted and orchestrated construction of a global institutional civil society infrastructure in finance (a global financial public sphere) to achieve greater access, resources, scrutiny and oversight for a range of specialist expert NGOs.","[Baker, Andrew] Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Baker, Andrew] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield Polit Econ Res Inst, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Wigan, Duncan] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield; Copenhagen Business School,"Baker, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.;Baker, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sheffield Polit Econ Res Inst, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",a.p.baker@sheffield.ac.uk; dw.dbp@cbs.dk,,"Baker, Andrew/0000-0001-6677-930X",European Commission Horizon 2020 Framework Program [649456-ENLIGHTEN],European Commission Horizon 2020 Framework Program,Duncan Wigan's research was funded by the European Commission Horizon 2020 Framework Program 2015-2018 [#649456-ENLIGHTEN].,,82,19,20,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

The main goal of this research is to conduct an analysis useful to measure the marginal effect of the attributes which contributes to price setting; the empirical analysis is developed on the prices of accommodation establishments from Romania. The study focuses on small and medium sized accommodation units, most of them entirely privately-owned. Within the analysis we set attributes from inside and outside the accommodation establishment as long as they are both ultimately linked with the pricing policy. Several hedonic specifications are estimated, in order to investigate the significance of accommodation attributes in the formation of room rates. There is a set of attributes with significant effect on the room price in all models, but with different intensity. The managers have to pay more attention to their internal facilities, goods or amenities (as recreational facilities), and to be committed to increasing the quality of their service delivery process, but there is also an opportunity for higher prices supported by attractive neighbourhoods. These findings are useful for the entrepreneurs interested in developing new businesses in tourism but also for managers already performing in the sector. Both categories have to face challenges such as new services development, price setting policy, choosing new locations. A flexible pricing strategy could become an effective and efficient tool for accommodation units in order to increase their performance. These elements are potential competitive dimensions and provide good opportunities for adapting to a dynamic market. Public and local administration organizations can develop appropriate policies for regional development based on hedonic models and thus, generate revenues and create opportunities for a sustainable development of tourism and also of the geographical region.","[Buiga, Anuta; Lazar, Dorina] Babes Bolyai Univ Cluj Napoca, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Stat, Forecasting,Math, Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Stegerean, Roxana] Babes Bolyai Univ Cluj Napoca, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Management, Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Chis, Alexandru] Babes Bolyai Univ Cluj Napoca, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Mkt, Cluj Napoca, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj; Babes Bolyai University from Cluj; Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Buiga, A (通讯作者)，Babes Bolyai Univ Cluj Napoca, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Stat, Forecasting,Math, Cluj Napoca, Romania.",anuta.buiga@econ.ubbcluj.ro; roxana.stegerean@econ.ubbcluj.ro; alexandru.chis@econ.ubbcluj.ro; dorina.lazar@econ.ubbcluj.ro,"CHIS, Alexandru/B-3242-2017; Stegerean, Roxana/ABC-1871-2021; Lazar, Dorina/C-5061-2012; Buiga, Anuta/IAQ-2094-2023","CHIS, Alexandru/0000-0003-4026-1988; Stegerean, Roxana/0000-0002-0758-2993; Lazar, Dorina/0000-0003-0478-1185;",,,,,23,7,7,0,21,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

This situation is likely to raise a myriad of issues for managers, as new cohorts of employees - forming Generation Y - will represent 75% of the global workforce by 2025. As genuine seekers of flexibility in terms of both time and space, the members of Generation Y strive for working in digital environments, for collaborating with managers who act as coaches or mentors and encourage communication, teamwork, positive motivation and individual and team performance. Starting from these premises, the current paper aims to analyse managing people dynamics through the lens of Generation Y, in general, and through the lens of undergraduate and graduate students from a Romanian University. The used instrument relies on the profile of the effective manager proposed by the Human Resources Office of the United Nations. Elaborating on the findings of a questionnaire-based survey with 121 students, the investigation supported that all four dimensions of the managerial profile (i.e., Communication, Teamwork, Motivation and Managing Individual Performance) were positively valued by the participants at the study and, further, that there are significant positive influences among them. This fact confirms the intricate dynamics of the managerial function as perceived by Generation Y members.","[Cristea, Georgiana; Vatamanescu, Elena-Madalina; Mitan, Andreea] SNSPA Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, Bucharest, Romania",,"Cristea, G (通讯作者)，SNSPA Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, Bucharest, Romania.",madalina.vatamanescu@facultateademanagement.ro; andreea.mitan@facultateademanagement.ro,"Mitan, Andreea/AAP-8450-2021; Vatamanescu, Elena-Madalina/F-4872-2017",,,,,,27,2,2,0,7,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",2286-1440,,,INT MANAGE CONF,,,2017,,,,,,,738,748,,,,,,11,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM6KT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000466917100076,0

First of all, they were used to eliminate manual administrative work associated with accounting and finance, The eighties were marked by the personal computer which massively entered the business sphere and because of the friendly price and multimedia features, it decentralized and reorganized data processing. The usage of computers in the eighties has spread from accounting and finance sphere to every part of the business. Computers also became a common part of the production preparation and production realization through numerically controlled machines. Capabilities as much as the possibilities of computer usage in business have significantly grown in the moment of democratization of the global computer network Internet, which has allowed direct interaction between the market and business. The result of these processes is the emergence and evolution of concepts such as electronic commerce, electronic business, electronic marketing, customer relationship management and the like. But as the computer power increased, along with price decreases and computer size reduction, the more machines started to use computers for their specialized and general purposes. Today computers are used to control and manage almost all devices, from complex intelligent systems used for transport, to home appliances such as TV sets, oven and refrigerators. Since computers are so omnipresent in all spheres of life, there is a possibility to use them for improvement of customer relationship management as well as business process automation associated with satisfying the needs of customers. Generally speakink the evolutive processes in information-communication technology enable evolutive processes in marketing, customer relationship management, electronic business, computer aided manufacturing, and other areas. Most significantly, the development of information-communication technology enables the evolution of customer relationship management concept into automatisation of management of all relationships i.e, business processes of manufacturing businesses.

Relevant parts of society question whether business is creating value for the many or just for a few. At the same time there is an expectation that business contributes to solutions to huge challenges such as poverty or climate change. In such an environment, the concept of Shared Value is catching a lot of attention from academics and business practitioners because it appears to offer an appealing narrative about how business can develop innovative solutions to societal challenges that are creating business and societal value simultaneously. According to the authors, this requires a re-definition of the role and the purpose of business in society, a definition that would be fundamentally different compared with the most prominent economic and business theories that in turn claim that business has to maximize profits or respectively has to create value for the shareholders first and foremost. This situation analysis raises some important questions that this article tries to explore: How could it happen in the first place that business is under such scrutiny, given that companies are creating considerable value for societies? And for what reason have economists been at least ambivalent if not even agnostic concerning moral values, ethics and social responsibilities of companies in modern societies for so many years? And what alternative concepts in regards to the role and responsibilities of business as possible tools to address societal challenges - were offered in former times and can be seen as foundations for the Shared Value concept? The article makes a rather explorative attempt to offer some perspectives to these questions and specifically to how companies could respond to these expectations. We propose that companies should operate with a strategic portfolio approach, i.e. using a portfolio of interventions - of which Shared Value is one - with the aim to optimize the positive impact on society and minimize the negative footprint. Lastly, the article discusses some of the concerns that were raised against the Shared Value concept, either because these are an inherent element of it or because of how it is positioned within the academic debate on the corporate responsibilities of companies.","[Fuerst, Michael] Novartis Int AG, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland",Novartis,"Fürst, M (通讯作者)，Novartis Int AG, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.",michael.fuerst1@gmail.com,,,,,,,41,2,2,1,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2211-2707,,978-3-319-48802-8; 978-3-319-48801-1,ETHICAL ECON,,,2017,52.0,,,,,,55,77,,10.1007/978-3-319-48802-8_5,0.0,,,23,Economics; Ethics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BI6HA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413288200005,0

Abstract The job of all jobs and the question of all questions of ural areas, all tourist destinations is:how to win and keep guests and preserve the ecosystem?The best way is to create tvonderful experiences through synergy of:attractive nature, material and spiritual culture, catering industry, trade, the hospitableness and the guest -friendship of the host. The question is what constitutes the tourist offer, how are tourist needs and desires developed and shaped, how are use -values created and how are values for the guests generated and how are experiences of products, services, attractions, events, relationships and their combinations as goods in the tourist market valued? Man is both subject and object in tourism; he is the initiator and the investor, the one who operates and who is the subject of operation; he is the goal and the meaning of the tourist activity -the one who works and for whom others work. Therefore, tourism requires a very complex, interdisciplinary approach to the study of tourism needs and desires, motivations and expectations and the implementation of tourist programs, which should satisfy the expressed numerous needs and even greater aspirations, motivations and expectations. Marketing research of tourism and rural areas in particular, requires investigation of all that constitutes the life of man, as a guest and as a host, in longer or shorter period of time, in the place of temporary residence. The study of tourism, of what guests gain with practice and experience in the tourist (and rural) destination, is not possible without an interdisciplinary approach of many sciences, such as sociology, psychology, anthropology, medicine, history, geography, ecology, law, marketing, architecture, civil engineering, economy and more. It is known that the basic interests of ourists are linked to natural and cultural values -beauty of landscapes, pleasant climate, cultural and historical heritage, but also to residential conditions -accommodation, food, transport to and in the tourist town, and to relations -of hospitableness and guest -friendship with the hosts, and the rural areas.Wonderful, great experiences in the rural area can be realized only by a broad combination of various products and services, in attractive conditions, with numerous events, with human relations, in a limited time, i.e. through the synergy of gifts:nature, material and spiritual culture, catering industry and trade, as well as hospitableness and guest -friendship -the spiritual gifts of a rural destination.","[Gardijan, Petar] Polytech Sibenik, Shibenik, Croatia; [Kovilic, Marija; Mrcela, Ante] Univ Coll Inspect & Personnel Management Split, Split, Croatia",,"Gardijan, P (通讯作者)，Polytech Sibenik, Shibenik, Croatia.",gardijan@vus.hr; marakovilic@gmail.com; amrcela9@gmail.com,,,,,,,15,0,0,1,3,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2017,13.0,,,,,,1178,1192,,,,,,15,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM4RS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000463854000076,0

Laotzu regards charity as the first merit of the three treasures, love thought of Confucius, benevolence advancement of Mencius and Mocius's concept of universal love are China's simple charity thoughts. The creeds of the Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism all present thought of charity. Confucianism focuses on kindheartedness. Buddhism focuses on charity. Taoism focuses on retribution of good and evil. All shows that China's charitable culture has been inherited so far with its long history. In the guidance of this charity culture, China's charity has developed so rapidly that more and more charity organizations have appeared, and the scale of the organization has gradually expanded, to bring our charity initial progress. While with the successive exposure of charitable organizations credibility crisis, China's charity organizations are facing a major test in the development process, whose credibility has suffered a great fall. Credibility is the foundation of the development of charity and the source of development. Without credibility, there is no guarantee on development of charitable organizations, and charity will be difficult to carry out. And the credibility of charitable organizations is one of the compositions of social capital, and the improvement of the credibility will increase the social capital stock. The social capital can be converted into other forms of capital in certain conditions, which is essential for the development of charitable organizations. It is a constructive choice to improve the credibility of charity organizations, to excavate the potential social capital, to reorganize the existing social capital, to cultivate the new social capital, and to continuously improve the social capital stock. Social capital mainly consists of institutional norms, social trust and participation in the network. So, the paper will explore countermeasures and suggestions to strengthen the credibility of charity organizations through the following three aspects.","[Hu, Liu] Wuhan Business Univ, Sch Phys Educ, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Kang, Xing] Res Ctr Rural Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Wuhan Business University,"Kang, X (通讯作者)，Res Ctr Rural Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",345209019@qq.com; 376449013@qq.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,10,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",2475-8868,,978-1-60595-467-7,DESTECH TRANS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,529,533,,,,,,5,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6YS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426981200096,0

Current conceptualizations of regional path development are based on experiences from core regions and fail to provide satisfactory theoretical explanations of new path-creating activities in peripheral areas. Our conceptual approach combines the notions of path development and knowledge bases, enabling us to distinguish between an analytic and a synthetic route of path creation. We argue that due emphasis should be given to exogenous sources of new path development and policy actions in order to understand how analytical and synthetic routes unfold in peripheral regions. These factors are still underappreciated in prevailing models of path creation. The article contains an analysis of the emergence and evolution of new industries in two peripheral regions in Norway and Austria: the electronics and software industry in Arendal-Grimstad in southeastern Norway, and the software industry in Muhlviertel in Upper Austria. The two industries have developed differently: through the synthetic route based on the emergence and restructuring of manufacturing firms in Arendal-Grimstad and through the analytical route building on the establishment of research facilities in Muhlviertel. Our analysis suggests that the inflow of new analytical and synthetic knowledge from exogenous sources and various types of policy interventions have been vital in sparking the formation of new industrial paths in both regions. The findings clearly challenge uniform, narrowly conceptualized models of industrial evolution and support recent work that advocates a broader theoretical framework to capture exogenously led and policy-supported path-creation processes.","[Isaksen, Arne] Univ Agder, Dept Working Life & Innovat, POB 422, N-4604 Kristiansand, Norway; [Trippl, Michaela] Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Box 118, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",University of Agder; Lund University,"Isaksen, A (通讯作者)，Univ Agder, Dept Working Life & Innovat, POB 422, N-4604 Kristiansand, Norway.",arne.isaksen@uia.no; michaela.trippl@circle.lu.se,,,Norwegian Research Council [233737/O50],Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),We are grateful to three reviewers and the editor for very valuable comments on previous versions of this article.

We provide a multi-country study of bagging, of which there have been very few to date, that examines out-of-sample forecasts for the G7 and a broad set of Asian countries. We find that bagging generally improves the forecast. accuracy and generates economic gains relative to the benchmark when portfolio weight restrictions are applied. Bagging also performs well compared to forecast combinations in this setting. We incorporate data mining critical values for appropriate inference on bagging and combination forecast methods. We provide new evidence that the results for bagging cannot be explained fully by data mining concerns. Finally, the forecasting gains are highest for countries with high trade openness and high FDI. The potentially substantial economic gains could well be operational, given the existence of index funds for most of these countries. (C) 2016 International Institute of Forecasters.

The mean squared forecast errors are derived under broad regularity conditions, and it is shown that, in practice, the forecasts obtained will converge to their population ensemble counterparts. The theoretical results are illustrated by examining the performances of singular spectrum analysis forecasts when applied to autoregressive processes and a random walk process. Simulation experiments suggest that the asymptotic properties developed are reflected in the behaviour of observed finite samples. Empirical applications using real world data sets indicate that forecasts based on singular spectrum analysis are competitive with other methods currently in vogue.

In 2008 the Polish central bank (NBP) adapted the policy similar to the European Central Bank (ECB) and since then it has been trying to place the POLONIA rate around the NBP reference rate, mainly by influencing the liquidity conditions through open market operations. We try to answer the question how effective this control was. We identify a set of factors that determine overnight rates, namely: liquidity, expectations, confidence in the banking sector and central bank operations. We analyze to what degree each of these factor has been influencing the POLONIA rate in the period from 2006 to 2016. To this end we have used a non-standard econometric method, namely dynamic model averaging, which allows to identify the set of variables that provide the best description of the explanatory variable. The results reveal that before the outbreak of financial crisis in 2008 the spread between POLONIA rate and reference rate could be explained mainly by liquidity conditions. After the crisis had begun, the importance of liquidity factor decreased and the expectations played a more important role in determining the spread. The liquidity situation has regained its importance in determining the spread since the beginning of 2012, after the central bank had undertook appropriate measures to normalize the situation on the interbank market.","[Kliber, Pawel] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Kliber, P (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Poznan, Poland.",p.kliber@ue.poznan.pl,"Kliber, Paweł/AAD-2543-2022",,,,,,16,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,,978-3-319-54885-2; 978-3-319-54884-5,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,25,33,,10.1007/978-3-319-54885-2_3,0.0,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI5UA,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412819500003,0

Then the public's moral quality can be improved and the traditional concept on helping others can be developed.","[Li, Jin-yong] Xian Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Marxism, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Xi'an University of Science & Technology,"Li, JY (通讯作者)，Xian Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Marxism, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",lmy0824@163.com,"Li, Jing/GYU-5036-2022; liu, xy/JEP-3175-2023; Zhang, Hui/HHN-8494-2022",,,,,,3,0,0,0,1,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",2475-8868,,978-1-60595-467-7,DESTECH TRANS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,508,511,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6YS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426981200091,0

It uses a regression analysis to investigate the association between women's empowerment and its covariates. The study also uses a multinomial logistic regression to assess what determines households' decision-making and attitudes toward physical abuse of spouses. It finds variables of sources of empowerment such as education and media exposure to have a net positive association with women's empowerment, while other variables such as residence and the age at first marriage to be negatively associated with women's empowerment. A further analysis shows that the effects of education, age of the respondent, wealth and the number of children ever born remain strong conditions which effect households' decision-making and attitudes about physical abuse. In general, it seems that for women to fully realize their potential and rights, specific emphasis should be put on variables that increase their access to resources and knowledge such as education, employment for cash, and media exposure, but variables that are negatively associated with their empowerment such as higher age at first marriage should also be taken into account.","[Musonera, Abdou] MIFOTRA SPIU, Kigali, Rwanda; [Heshmati, Almas] Jonkoping Univ, JIBS, Jonkoping, Sweden; [Heshmati, Almas] Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Jonkoping University; Sogang University,"Heshmati, A (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Univ, JIBS, Jonkoping, Sweden.",abdoumusonera@gmail.com; almas.heshmati@gmail.com,,,,,,,44,3,4,1,8,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",2367-1033,,978-981-10-4451-9; 978-981-10-4450-2,FRONT AFR BUS RES,,,2017,,,,,,,11,39,,10.1007/978-981-10-4451-9_2,0.0,,,29,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK1SG,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432206900002,0

This study concludes that inflation and unemployment have a long-run negative and significant relationship on real gross domestic product. In the long run, the coefficients are not significant at the 5% level; it is only the inflation coefficient and error which are significant. Real gross domestic product increases when inflation reduces with a p-value of 0.00266; real gross domestic product increases when unemployment reduces with a p-value of 0.09882. The coefficient from the error correction model means that the effect of the shock will reduce by 0.0483% each quarter, meaning that the effect of the shock will reduce by 19.32% in each 4th quarter. This further means that it will end at 20 quarters, that is, after a five-year period.

Five dimensions of activity must work well and in synchrony: harmonious relations within the family and an understanding of how it should be involved with the business, an ownership structure that provides sufficient capital for growth while allowing the family to control key parts of the business, strong governance of the company and a dynamic business portfolio, professional management of the family's wealth, and charitable foundations to promote family values across generations.","[Pavlak, Miroslav] Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Business Adm & Management, Univ 22, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Pavlák, M (通讯作者)，Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Business Adm & Management, Univ 22, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic.",mpavlak@kpm.zcu.cz,,,,,,,13,0,0,1,6,VERLAG GUC-GESELLSCHAFT UNTERNEHMENSRECHNUNG CONTROLLING M B H,LOBNITZ,"STEINWEG 32, LOBNITZ, D-08294, GERMANY",,,978-3-86367-051-1,GUC FACHB,,,2017,33.0,,,,,,117,122,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6KP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426794300013,0

Using correlation analysis and binary logistic regression model it was found that the most significant factor influencing trust in all countries is provided information by the bank. In addition, in Lithuania - bank's characteristics, in Latvia - customers' risk perception and bank's characteristics, in Estonia - respondents' experience of cooperation with a bank were highlighted as significant. The following measures of fit are used in order to describe the created logistic models: contingency table test, Nagelkerke pseudo-R-2, Pearson chisquare test, Wald test. However, there is a limitation - the survey was conducted online. Nevertheless, as Internet penetration rate is high enough in investigated countries (from 76 percent in Latvia to 91 percent in Estonia), survey results can be adapted for at least seventy-five percent of each country's population.

The paper fills the gap by combining two separate streams in knowledge sharing, where the first reflects the paradigm of the organizational behaviour theory and highlights the impact of organizational culture and employees' trust; where the second one discloses the impact of technology deployment in knowledge sharing. Building on the premises that interdependence between variables that affect knowledge sharing raises form organizational culture of trust and available technologies, we examine the structural origins of knowledge sharing. As a method structural equation modelling test was used to analyse the data. Hypothesised five-factor model was tested through two stages using AMOS software. The findings carry theoretical implications for the knowledge management body of knowledge since they extended the research on knowledge sharing by integrating organisational culture and technological solutions into one complex system. Form practical perspective, the relationship among four predictors - trust in leadership, trust in co-workers, trust in technologies for knowledge management, and fear of losing one's value - provide a proof on how organizations knowledge sharing is composed and how it could be developed.","[Smaliukiene, Rasa; Chlivickas, Eugenijus] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Smaliukiene, Rasa; Bekesiene, Svajone; Magyla, Marius] Gen Jonas Zemaitis Mil Acad Lithuania, Dept Engn Management, Silo G 5A, LT-10322 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; General Jonas Zemaitis Military Academy of Lithuania,"Smaliukiene, R (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.;Smaliukiene, R (通讯作者)，Gen Jonas Zemaitis Mil Acad Lithuania, Dept Engn Management, Silo G 5A, LT-10322 Vilnius, Lithuania.",rasa.smaliukiene@vgtu.lt; svajone.bekesiene@lka.lt; Eugenijus.Chlivickas@vgtu.lt; marius.magyla@lka.lt,"Smaliukiene, Rasa/L-3577-2019; Bekesiene, Svajone/I-6433-2019; Bekešienė, Svajonė/ABH-5393-2020","Smaliukiene, Rasa/0000-0002-5240-2429; Bekesiene, Svajone/0000-0002-3757-6770; Bekešienė, Svajonė/0000-0002-3757-6770",,,,,47,14,16,1,31,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

This circumstance takes the form of a lump-sum forward payment of lifetime rent by residents, which leaves most longevity risk to be covered by homes. To analyze this circumstance, I construct a structural econometric model of industrial organization for this market. For the underlying structure of longevity risk, I assume that both individual consumers and nursing homes utilize the subjective evaluation. My empirical analysis detects excess payments that can be compensated for only by an unrealistically long stay in nursing homes.

In the present research, it is argued that traditional endorsement theory is unsuitable to explain this situation; instead an innovated mode, from the perspective of co-branding is created to interpret the phenomenon of multiple brand endorsements. This paper argues that two brands using the same celebrity as endorser would become celebrity-caused co-branding because meanings and associations can transfer from one brand to the other. The empirical analysis finds that pre-eristing attitude and co-branding fit can affect evaluation of celebrity-caused co-branding. There is a negative correlation between pre-existing attitude and co-branding evaluation, and co-branding fit will have an impact on celebrity-caused co-branding evaluation. In marketing practice, companies should consider not only the notability and credibility of celebrities, but also the other brands endorsed by them. For less-known brands, it is beneficial to choose those celebrities who are endorsing some other well-known brands, but for well-known brands, it is better not to choose those celebrities who are endorsing other less-known brands. Furthermore, the co-branding fit between these endorsed brands should also be considered.","[Tian, Shengbing] Shanghai Univ, SHU UTS SILC Business Sch, Management & Mkt, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Deng, Nianqi] Shanghai Univ, SHU UTS SILC Business Sch, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shanghai University; Shanghai University,"Deng, NQ (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ, SHU UTS SILC Business Sch, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",tian1298@163.com; dnqsilc0331@163.com,,,,,,,31,0,0,1,36,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Groundnut (or peanut) is an essential oilseed in the world. The crop as an industrial product, widely cultivated not only by smallholder farmers within the tropical and warm temperate areas in Africa but also large-scale farmers in America and Asia. Peanut farmers in Nigeria faced with limited farm inputs, finance, solely rely on natural rainfall with either recurrent drought or excess rains. In the era of groundnut pyramid (in the 1940s and 60s), the crop was the leading export product in Nigeria, and the country was the leading exporter of the product in the world. However, Nigeria moved from being the largest to the third largest producer in the world. The nation also lost its glory as it is no longer among the major global exporters. Using the OLS approach, the results show that area cultivated, yields, fertiliser, producer and world prices, exports, domestic consumption, and openness have effects on groundnut production in Nigeria. The findings reveal that Nigeria export is highly volatile, as it is mainly concentrated in few countries. There is a need for export promotion and market diversification for competitiveness and earnings to be accelerated and sustained in the country.","[Verter, Nahanga] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Reg Dev & Int Studies, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Verter, N (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Reg Dev & Int Studies, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",nahanga.verter@mendelu.cz,"Verter, Nahanga/E-4845-2018","Verter, Nahanga/0000-0002-5889-134X",,,,,14,0,0,0,1,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-499-5,,,,2017,,,,,,,872,882,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ7IS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427306200090,0

As a consequence, the mass base for this sport is still weak, exerting more setbacks in jockey selection. At present, most of the jockey coaches evaluate and predict the jockey candidates based on the past successful experience, which can be shown in the following aspects. Firstly, 15 years' old teenagers in rural or distant areas would be selected as a priority to be trained as jockeys, rather than those grown up in urban areas. The reason lies in the requirements of personalities for jockeys, such as perseverance, tenacity, strong willpower and responsibilities. Secondly, teenagers from the Mongol nationality or Manchu nationality would be preferred thanks to their profound history in horse riding and archery. Therefore, most teenagers there enjoy good foundations in horse ride. All in all, this experience-oriented method of selection makes sense to some extent as it helps coaches to sparkle their speculations and conduct independent thinking, thus forming their own judgments and critical thoughts. However, this method is limited in its subjectivity and contingency. Although it comes from the daily facts, it is lack of scientific proof and abundant practice. What's more, teenagers from rural areas, distant areas or ethnic minorities suffer from low level of education and insufficient horse racing heritage, as a result, jockey coaches always face some communication barriers while imparting relevant knowledge to students.","[Yang, Cheng; Li, Yi] Wuhan Business Univ, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China",Wuhan Business University,"Li, Y (通讯作者)，Wuhan Business Univ, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",506860650@qq.com; 14039618@qq.com,,,program of Colleges and Universities Outstanding Youth and Middle Age Scientific and Technological Innovation Team Project of Hubei Province [T201628],program of Colleges and Universities Outstanding Youth and Middle Age Scientific and Technological Innovation Team Project of Hubei Province,This research was supported by program of Colleges and Universities Outstanding Youth and Middle Age Scientific and Technological Innovation Team Project of Hubei Province (T201628).,,5,0,0,0,2,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",2475-8868,,978-1-60595-467-7,DESTECH TRANS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,564,566,,,,,,3,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6YS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426981200103,0

The study also explores whether the value relevance of annual and interim financial statements has changed over time. Aim: It explores whether the value relevance of interim financial statements is higher than the value relevance of annual financial statements. Finally, it investigates whether accounting information published in interim and annual financial statements has incremental value relevance. Setting: Data for the period from 1999 to 2012 were collected from a sample of non-financial companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Method: The Ohlson model to investigate the value relevance of accounting information was used for the study. Results: The results show that interim book value of equity is value relevant while interim earnings are not. Interim financial statements appear to have higher value relevance than annual financial statements. The value relevance of interim and annual accounting information has remained fairly constant over the sample period. Incremental comparisons provide evidence that additional book value of equity and earnings that accrue to a company between interim and annual reporting dates are value relevant. Conclusion: The study was conducted over a long sample period (1999-2012), in an era when a technology-driven economy and more timely reporting media could have had an effect on the value relevance of published accounting information. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate and compare the value relevance of published interim and annual financial statements.","[Zulu, Mbalenhle; de Klerk, Marna; Oberholster, Johan G.

This paper analyzes CSR activity using quasi-experimental variation created by Section 135 of India's Companies Act of 2013, which requires (on a comply-or-explain basis) that firms satisfying specific size or profit thresholds spend a minimum of 2% of their net profit on CSR. We examine effects on CSR spending and related outcomes, as well as exploring broader theoretical implications. Our analysis uses financial statement data on Indian firms from the Prowess database, along with hand-collected data from firms' disclosures of CSR activity. Using a difference-in-difference approach, we find significant increases in CSR activity among firms affected by Section 135, especially along the extensive margin (i.e. in the fraction of firms engaging in CSR spending). The fraction of firms subject to Section 135 that engage in advertising expenditures declines, consistent with substitution between advertising and CSR. For a subset of large firms, we hand-collect comprehensive CSR data and find that while firms initially spending less than 2% increased their CSR activity, large firms initially spending more than 2% reduced their CSR expenditures after Section 135 came into effect. We explore various explanations for this presumably unintended consequence of Section 135, and also seek to derive some wider implications of this analysis for understanding the role of CSR.

Between 2000 and 2015, total length of India's national highway network has nearly doubled and 4 + lane share of the national highways has increased from 2 to 20%, along with associated improvements in safety and surface quality. National highway development is considered as a tool to promote employment growth by stimulating economic activities and attracting foreign investments. As India's central government continues to increase budget allocations for national highway projects in anticipation of generating more jobs, this study empirically investigates whether past investments can be linked to employment growth. I analyze changes in non-agricultural private sector employment over a 10-year period (2003-2012) across 25 states in response to changes in the density (lane-km per unit area) of national highways, controlling for other factors affecting employment. Using a series of static (pooled ordinary least squares, random-effects and fixed effects) and dynamic (random- and fixed-effects with first-order autoregressive or AR(1) disturbances, and system GMM or generalized method of moments) panel regressions, I find that 10% increase in national highway density in India is associated with 1-6% (depending on model specification and estimation approach) increase in private sector employment, all else equal. This paper provides first empirical evidence suggesting that India's national highway development efforts have produced positive employment benefits in the past. In addition to contributing to transportation planning scholarship, the findings are expected to inform policy-makers in India as they develop future highway investment plans aimed, in part, at economic development. This paper will also be useful to decision-makers in other developing countries with comparable policy environments.","[Chakrabarti, Sandip] Indian Inst Management Ahmedabad, Publ Syst Grp, W-15J Heritage Campus, Ahmadabad 380015, Gujarat, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad,"Chakrabarti, S (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management Ahmedabad, Publ Syst Grp, W-15J Heritage Campus, Ahmadabad 380015, Gujarat, India.",sandipc@iima.ac.in,,,,,,,38,29,30,1,33,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

These models include the RiskMetrics, GARCH, asymmetric GARCH, fractional integrated GARCH and Markov switching GARCH models. We begin by implementing Carrasco, Hu, and Ploberger's (2014) test for regime switching in the mean and variance of the GARCH(1, 1), and find overwhelming support for regime switching. We then perform a comprehensive out-of-sample forecasting performance evaluation using a battery of tests. We find that, under the MSE and QLIKE loss functions: (i) models with a Student's t innovation are favored over those with a normal innovation; (ii) RiskMetrics and GARCH(1, 1) have good predictive accuracies at short forecast horizons, whereas EGARCH(1, 1) yields the most accurate forecasts at medium horizons; and (iii) the Markov switching GARCH shows a superior predictive accuracy at long horizons. These results are established by computing the equal predictive ability test of Diebold and Mariano (1995) and West (1996) and the model confidence set of Hansen, Lunde, and Nason (2011) over the entire evaluation sample. In addition, a comparison of the MSPE ratios computed using a rolling window suggests that the Markov switching GARCH model is better at predicting the volatility during periods of turmoil.

An international study using a stated preference approach,TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Network planning principles; Frequency versus access of public transport service; Stated choice experiment; International comparison; Patronage generation,PUBLIC TRANSPORT; TRANSIT; DISTANCES; QUALITY; STATIONS; ACCESS,"Network planning of bus services requires addressing the trade-off between frequency and coverage. Traditional network planning has focused on coverage using the rule of thumb that people will walk four hundred meters to access bus based public transport services. More modem approaches have recognised that encouraging mode shift means improving quality and thus in the presence of budget constraint, a shift of resources is needed to provide better frequency or smaller headways on core corridors. Using a Stated Choice experiment approach, this paper elicits the trade-off between access distance and headways and how this might vary in a number of cities around the world. The key results confirm travellers in all cities forming part of the sample are willing to walk further for a more frequent service: in Australian capital cities between 226 m and 302 m further for a 10 min reduction in bus headways, while in UK and US this is between 370 m and 475 m further for the same improvement in bus headway. The research provides a consistent valuation for the design attributes of service (such as distance to stop, journey time, headway/frequency and crowding) over eleven cities together with an estimation of the role of socio demographics in tempering how far passengers are likely to walk to access a high frequency corridor and potentially achieve mode shift from the private car.","[Mulley, Corinne; Ho, Chinh; Ho, Loan; Hensher, David] Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Inst Transport & Logist Studies H73, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Rose, John] UTS, POB 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Sydney; University of Technology Sydney,"Mulley, C (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Inst Transport & Logist Studies H73, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",corinne.mulley@sydney.edu.au,"Mulley, Corinne/ACN-0179-2022; Alidadi, Mehdi/HJZ-0235-2023; Rose, John/AAO-2897-2021","Alidadi, Mehdi/0000-0001-5183-7829; Rose, John/0000-0003-4211-0980; Ho, Loan/0000-0003-2388-0912; Mulley, Corinne/0000-0001-6411-1269; Hensher, David/0000-0003-0058-2242; Ho, Chinh/0000-0003-4607-9263; Ho, Chinh/0000-0001-8006-0123",,,,,44,22,22,5,22,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

We conceptualise this relationship by integrating insights from the management literature on innovation barriers with those derived from the international business and economic geography perspectives on the interplay of ownership and location advantages. By exploiting a firm-level panel dataset based on the UK Innovation Survey for the period 2002-2008, we test the relationship between perception of market risk and innovation behaviour in relation to firm ownership-i.e. multinational enterprises (MNEs) versus single domestic enterprises-and location-across regional contexts characterised by different degrees of technological dynamism. Our main results show that ownership advantages operate as a moderator by fundamentally affecting the direction of the relationship: while MNEs react positively to risk perception, single domestic firms reduce their innovation engagement as a strategy to cope with market uncertainty. Yet, ownership advantages play a pivotal role only in relatively inert or stable contexts, as in technologically dynamic regions differences between domestic firms and MNEs disappear.","[Gagliardi, Luisa] Univ Geneva, Sch Social Sci, Dept Econ Hist & Soc, Geneva, Switzerland; [Gagliardi, Luisa; Iammarino, Simona] London Sch Econ, SERC, London, England; [Iammarino, Simona] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England",University of Geneva; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Gagliardi, L (通讯作者)，Univ Geneva, Sch Social Sci, Dept Econ Hist & Soc, Geneva, Switzerland.;Gagliardi, L (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, SERC, London, England.",luisa.gagliardi@unige.ch,,"Iammarino, Simona/0000-0001-9450-1700",Economic and Social Research Council/Joint Programming Initiative Urban Europe [ES/M008436/1]; ESRC [ES/M008436/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council/Joint Programming Initiative Urban Europe; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Economic and Social Research Council/Joint Programming Initiative Urban Europe [Grant Agreement no.

One explanation is that these data have not been in a form amenable for research. To help remedy this deficiency and to foster scholarship, the USPTO Office of Chief Economist is curating internal agency records to release a series of datasets in research-ready formats. This article describes the USPTO Patent Assignment Dataset (UPAD), a relational database of roughly 6 million assignments, licenses, securitizations, and other conveyances involving about 10 million U.S. patents and patent applications, recorded 1970-2014. To promote research uses, this article provides a comprehensive data description and presents stylized facts derived from the records. Although this article discusses several limitations inherent in using these data, the release of the UPAD creates opportunities to conduct original research, particularly relating to intellectual property collateralization and the markets for technology and innovation.","[Graham, Smart J.

J,"Lichtenberg, FR",,,,"Lichtenberg, Frank R.",,,THE IMPACT OF NEW DRUG LAUNCHES ON LIFE-YEARS LOST IN 2015 FROM 19 TYPES OF CANCER IN 36 COUNTRIES,JOURNAL OF DEMOGRAPHIC ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,cancer; mortality; pharmaceuticals; innovation; cost-effectiveness,PHARMACEUTICAL INNOVATION; MORTALITY; BURDEN,"This study employs a two-way fixed effects research design to measure the mortality impact and cost-effectiveness of cancer drugs: It analyzes the correlation across 36 countries between the relative mortality from 19 types of cancer in 2015 and the relative number of drugs previously launched in that country to treat that type of cancer, controlling for relative incidence. The sample size (both in terms of number of observations and population covered) of this study is considerably larger than the sample sizes of previous studies; a new and improved method of analyzing the lag structure of the relationship between drug launches and life-years lost is used; and a larger set of measures of the burden of cancer is analyzed. The number of DALYs and life-years lost are unrelated to drug launches 0-4 years earlier. This is not surprising, since utilization of a drug tends to be quite low during the first few post-launch years. Moreover, there is likely to be a lag of several years between utilization of a drug and its impact on mortality. However, mortality is significantly inversely related to the number of drug launches at least 5 years earlier, especially to drug launches 5-9 years earlier. One additional drug for a cancer site launched during 2006-2010 is estimated to have reduced the number of 2015 DALYs due to cancer at that site by 5.8%;; one additional drug launched during 1982-2005 is estimated to have reduced the number of 2015 DALYs by about 2.6%. Lower quality (or effectiveness) of earlier vintage drugs may account for their smaller estimated effect. We estimate that drugs launched during the entire 1982-2010 period reduced the number of cancer DALYs in 2015 by about 23.0%, and that, in the absence of new drug launches during 1982-2010, there would have been 26.3 million additional DALYs in 2015. Also, the nine countries with the largest number of drug launches during 1982-2010 are estimated to have had 14% fewer cancer DALYs (controlling for incidence) in 2015 than the nine countries with the smallest number of drug launches during 1982-2010. Estimates of the cost per life-year gained in 2015 from drugs launched during 2006-2010 range between $1,635 (life-years gained at all ages) and $2,820 (life-years gained before age 65). These estimates are similar to those obtained in previous country-specific studies of Belgium, Canada, and Mexico, and are well below the estimate obtained in one study of Switzerland. Mortality in 2015 is strongly inversely related to the number of drug launches in 2006-2010. If the relationship between mortality in 2020 and the number of drug launches in 2011-2015 is similar, drug launches 5-9 years earlier will reduce mortality even more (by 9.9%) between 2015 and 2020 than they did (by 8.4%) between 2010 and 2015.","[Lichtenberg, Frank R.] Columbia Univ, New York, NY USA; [Lichtenberg, Frank R.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Columbia University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Lichtenberg, FR (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Business, 504 Uris Hall,3022 Broadway, New York, NY 10027 USA.",frank.lichtenberg@columbia.edu,,,Incyte Corporation; National Institute on Aging [R24 AG048059],Incyte Corporation; National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),Financial support for this research was provided by Incyte Corporation and by the National Institute on Aging (Grant R24 AG048059).,,44,9,9,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",2054-0892,2054-0906,,J DEMOGR ECON,J.Demogr.

Individual, household, and geographic characteristics served as predictors of nudge approval, and the count of significant predictors as measures of controversy. Less high approval rates of nudges in Denmark and Hungary were reflected in higher controversy about System 1 nudges, whereas the United Kingdom and Italy were marked by higher controversy about System 2 nudges, despite high approval rates. High-controversy nudges tended to be associated with current public policy concerns, for example, meat consumption.

The literature does not provide consensus regarding the (dis)benefits of ride-sharing. Furthermore, the limited number of studies identified are examples from the developed world, which are not necessarily transferable to the developing world context. This paper estimates the potential for ride-sharing in Cape Town and its economic, social and environmental impacts. It was found that there were various potential ride-share markets. There are low-income households that are unlikely to own a car anytime soon. These households are potential users for ad-hoc trips that are currently dormant. Furthermore, there is a growing amount of people that omit using their own vehicle, but rather use ride-share services. In the long-term, this group might even give up the private vehicle. For low-income households, the ride-share services mostly address a social need, where the potential impacts for high-income households are economic and environmental. The paper concludes with a systematic scoring of four modes on all economic, social and environmental issues, resulting in non-motorised transport and ride-share being positive, while private car and public transport are negative, in the developing world context.","[Vanderschuren, Marianne; Baufeldt, Jennifer] Univ Cape Town, Dept Civil Engn, Ctr Transport Studies, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Vanderschuren, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Dept Civil Engn, Ctr Transport Studies, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.",marianne.vanderschuren@uct.ac.za; bfljen001@myuct.ac.za,,"Vanderschuren, Maria/0000-0002-1691-0872",,,,,40,24,27,2,17,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

With increased accessibility, HSR station locations have the potential to act as transport nodes as well as evolving as localized urban places by attracting higher-volume passenger flow and increasing economic activity. This paper evaluates the performance of KTX stations as an economic development strategy using the node-place concept, which simultaneously assesses a station's role as node and place. The calculated scores from the node-place index suggest various outcomes of KTX stations. While balanced stations are performing as both nodes and places and are located in urban centers, imbalanced stations that perform neither role well are found on urban peripheries. Our findings indicate imbalanced stations are less effective for attracting passengers and other economic activities. HSR station vitality is depends on interactions with existing urbanized areas, and those located in urban peripheries typically lack this. Station proximity to central business districts is an important consideration for locating future KTX stations in either mid-size cities or suburban areas, in order to maximize the economic impacts of KTX services.","[Kim, Hyojin] Univ North Carolina Greensboro, Dept Geog, 120 Graham Bldg,1009 Spring Garden St, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA; [Sultana, Selima] Univ North Carolina Greensboro, Dept Geog, 224 Graham Bldg 1009 Spring Garden St, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA; [Weber, Joe] Univ Alabama, Dept Geog, 204 Farah Hall,Box 870322, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Greensboro; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Greensboro; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Sultana, S (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Greensboro, Dept Geog, 224 Graham Bldg 1009 Spring Garden St, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA.",h_kim34@uncg.edu; s_sultan@uncg.edu; jweber2@ua.edu,"Sultana, Selima/J-5723-2019","Kim, Hyojin/0000-0003-2876-3045",,,,,54,57,58,10,108,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

First, we find that increased competition leads to a significant increase in R&D investments by neck-and-neck firms. Second, increased competition decreases R&D investments by firms that are lagging behind, in particular if the time horizon is short.

We contribute to the growing literature on ex-post merger evaluations in three ways: (1) we propose a cleaner identification strategy that results from the different event dates; (2) we quantify the effects on prices, but also on variety; (3) we show that the estimated effects exhibit heterogeneity and explain part of that heterogeneity with event characteristics. Our results indicate no effect on the average prices, but that total product variety in a store goes up by more than following a merger. We find that the increase in variety after a merger is driven by stores that are not directly involved in the events, for whom the increase is larger than 4%.","[Trindade, Andre] FGV EPGE Brazilian Sch Econ & Finance, Praia Botafogo 190,Room 1100, BR-22250900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",,"Trindade, A (通讯作者)，FGV EPGE Brazilian Sch Econ & Finance, Praia Botafogo 190,Room 1100, BR-22250900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",andre.trindade@fgv.br,,"Trindade, Andre/0000-0003-0446-3320",USDA/ERS; Northwestern University; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia,USDA/ERS(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Northwestern University; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"We would like to thank the editor (Lawrence White) and two anonymous referees, as well as comments from Mike Abito, Javier Donna, and John Kwoka.

Rising food prices adversely affect food security in South Africa. The ever-increasing prices for food commodities and lack of access to finance make it very difficult to strengthen food security amongst households in South Africa. Aim: The aim of the study is to examine the impact of food prices on household welfare in South Africa. Additionally, the study attempts to analyse the short-and long-run relationship between food prices and household welfare in South Africa. This is done by determining how real household welfare responds and/or reacts whenever there is a shock in food prices and its fundamental determinants. Finally, the study attempts to distil recommendations toward a conceptual framework for the mitigation of the impact of high food prices on households in South Africa. Method: The Vector Error Correction Modelling (VECM) technique is utilised to estimate a regression model. Results: The results reveal that a 1% increase in food prices would reduce household welfare by 21.3%. The study, therefore, confirms a negative correlation between food prices and welfare. Conclusion: Short-run policy recommendations include: (1) subsidising staple food baskets for households in South Africa, (2) reducing prices of staple foods through the reduction of food tariffs and (3) reducing household expenditure on basic needs through subsidisation. These policy options could lessen the burden on households when there is a rise in the prices of staple food sources and therefore improve household welfare. Long-run policy recommendations include: (1) improving the unemployment rate in South Africa and (2) improving access to finance and credit for South African households. By addressing the rising unemployment rates and improving access to finance and credit in South Africa through job creation initiatives and improving micro-credit strategies, an environment can be created where households improve their disposable income.","[van Wyk, Roscoe B.; Dlamini, Cliff S.] Univ Stellenbosch, Business Sch, Stellenbosch, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"van Wyk, RB (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Business Sch, Stellenbosch, South Africa.",roscoevanwyk@gmail.com,,"van Wyk, Roscoe/0000-0002-3640-0319",,,,,44,11,12,1,10,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The standard economic theory of household fertility decision-making generates ambiguous predictions, and the response has large implications for human welfare. We examine the fertility response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic using national household survey data from 14 sub-Saharan African countries. Instrumental variable (IV) estimates using distance to the origin of the pandemic suggest that HIV/AIDS has increased the total fertility rate (TFR) and the number of surviving children.

We add to this literature by analyzing whether big data are useful for modelling low frequency macroeconomic variables, such as unemployment, inflation and GDP. In particular, we analyze the predictive benefits associated with the use of principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), and sparse principal component analysis (SPCA). We also evaluate machine learning, variable selection and shrinkage methods, including bagging, boosting, ridge regression, least angle regression, the elastic net, and the non-negative garotte. Our approach is to carry out a forecasting horse-race using prediction models that are constructed based on a variety of model specification approaches, factor estimation methods, and data windowing methods, in the context of predicting 11 macroeconomic variables that are relevant to monetary policy assessment. In many instances, we find that various of our benchmark models, including autoregressive (AR) models, AR models with exogenous variables, and (Bayesian) model averaging, do not dominate specifications based on factor-type dimension reduction combined with various machine learning, variable selection, and shrinkage methods (called combination models). We find that forecast combination methods are mean square forecast error (MSFE) best for only three variables out of 11 for a forecast horizon of h = 1, and for four variables when h = 3 or 12. In addition, non-PCA type factor estimation methods yield MSFE-best predictions for nine variables out of 11 for h = 1, although PCA dominates at longer horizons. Interestingly, we also find evidence of the usefulness of combination models for approximately half of our variables when h > 1. Most importantly, we present strong new evidence of the usefulness of factor-based dimension reduction when utilizing big data for macroeconometric forecasting.

I consider a dynamic monopoly model with asymmetric information about product quality, in which consumers learn in equilibrium from both prices and other consumers. The main result is that word-of-mouth communication is essential for the existence of separating equilibria, wherein the high-quality monopolist signals high quality through a low introductory price (lower than the monopoly price), and the low-quality one charges the monopoly price. The intuition is simple: low prices are costly, and will only be used by firms confident enough that increased experimentation (and therefore communication among consumers) will yield good news about quality and increased future profits. Additional results are the following: for the high-quality seller, the expected price (quantity) is increasing (decreasing) over time; whereas for the low-quality one, the opposite is true. Moreover, signaling becomes more difficult when consumers pay less attention to their peers' reports and more attention to past prices. Finally, word-of-mouth communication improves consumer welfare.","[Guadalupi, Carla] Univ Illes Balears, Business Dept, Palma De Mallorca, Spain",Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Guadalupi, C (通讯作者)，Univ Illes Balears, Business Dept, Palma De Mallorca, Spain.",carla.guadalupi@uib.es,"Guadalupi, Carla/L-6212-2019","guadalupi, carla/0000-0002-5386-4342",Conicyt,Conicyt(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)),"I would like to thank Anna Bayona, Luis Cabral, Gonzalo Cisternas, Juan Pablo Montero, Carlos Ponce, and Carlos Serrano for helpful comments; seminar participants at the International Workshop on Game Theory (Sao Paulo), SECHI (Vina del Mar), LACEA-LAMES (Sao Paulo), Industrial Organization Workshop (Universidad de Chile, Santiago), and especially Nicolas Figueroa, Joaquin Poblete, and Gaston Llanes for discussions and suggestions.

For identification, we use two sets of triple-difference tests that control for country-level omitted variables using fixed effects for each country-year pair. First, using cross-sectional differences across industries in a country, we find that the effect of EPLs on privatization is disproportionately greater in industries in which separation rates and relocation rates are higher.

The economic value of land use in this paper is tomato production per hectare of land cultivated per farmer and costs are calculated including the cost of seeds and fertilizer. The Bukit Sileh region has the potential for tomato plants that have the opportunity to be economically increased. When harvesting crops is better, farmers should not be harmed due to low tomato prices. To overcome the price remains stable and there is already a market guarantee that tomatoes will still be sold at normal prices. For this reason, it is necessary to create related business units. The step to bring together the related business units, the tomatoes are clustered into a downstream business unit of tomato-based tomato commodities. More and more related business units are established in an area, meaning that the parent industry increasingly has the opportunity to produce. The parent business (tomato plantation) will support the birth of related businesses such as; tomato sauce business, tomato candied business, tomato date business and other tomato-based businesses. The result of the research is that there are no strong linkages between input and output between economic activities and in the future it is expected that there will be a parent industry which is the leading sector encouraging economic growth centers that have agglomeration benefits. The advantage of new agglomeration can arise if there is a close link between existing economic activities at the concentration both in the form of linkages with inputs (backward linkages) or linkages with output (Forward Linkages) which will lead to various forms of external benefits for entrepreneurs both in the form of cost savings production, transportation costs of raw materials and production and savings in the use of facilities because the costs can be shared.

Moreover, today the digital economy is one of the drivers of economic growth; the pace of its development is several times higher than the pace of the traditional economy. The digital economy is the most promising direction under modern conditions when the world economy is influenced by the global financial and economic crisis and the recession that has followed it. The main advantages of the digital economy are the ability to significantly reduce costs of doing business, optimizing expenses, obtaining high financial results. Therefore, it is no coincidence that in many countries the development of the digital economy and its components is a priority. Huge amounts of money are being allocated to the digital transformation of the economy by both private business and state structures. In Russia, the implementation of the digital economy is also the priority nowadays; a state program was adopted aimed at the digital transformation of the Russian economy in 2017. The paper examines the perspectives for the digital economy development in the Russian Federation, studies the current situation of the digital economy in Russia, analyzes the conditions for the realization of the digital economy, assesses the investment climate in the Russian environment for the digital transformation of the economy, estimates the basic component of the industry 4.0 concept - robotics in modern Russian conditions and prospects for its development.","[Bataev, Alexey V.] Peter Great St Petersburg Polytech Univ, St Petersburg, Russia; [Gorovoy, Alexandr A.] St Petersburg Natl Res Univ Informat Technol, St Petersburg, Russia; [Mottaeva, Angela] Moscow State Univ Civil Engn, Moscow, Russia",Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University; ITMO University; Moscow State University of Civil Engineering,"Bataev, AV (通讯作者)，Peter Great St Petersburg Polytech Univ, St Petersburg, Russia.",bat_a68@mail.ru; gorovoy@limtu.ru; angela-1309.m@yandex.ru,"Mottaeva, Angela/AAD-2189-2022","Mottaeva, Angela/0000-0001-8904-4154",Russian Federation [NSH - 3792.2018.6],Russian Federation(Russian Federation),This article is prepared with the support of the Russian Federation President Grant (project NSH - 3792.2018.6),,14,8,8,2,34,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,88,101,,,,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553200008,0

Costs issue is relevant due to the essence of customer perceived value that is the concept of give and take aspects. The main aim of the study was to investigate what is the perception of costs in service buying process in the multichannel sales context. Based on the literature 12 cost components were taken into analysis. The study was conducted in 2015 on a group of 1103 respondents, the research sample was determined by quota-random method, quotas due to age and gender and the nature of the place of residence. CAPI (computer assisted personal interview) method was used with a standardized questionnaire. Based on the factor analysis that refers perceived importance for customers each of 12 identified costs throughout the entire process of service purchasing, three components essential to consumer at the service purchase stage were identified. Identification two of these factors were not surprising - effort and emotions are distinguished in the literature as a separate components of marketing channel using costs. However components referring to perceived time and the service price were located in the same cost factor (the third cost components). Perceived service price and perceived waiting time as equally important play an equivalent role in marketing channel selection. In author's opinion this research result creates a new challenge for service providers. Furthermore, it is of great importance for service companies that operate in a multichannel environment.","[Bondos, Ilona] Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Lublin, Poland",Maria Curie-Sklodowska University,"Bondos, I (通讯作者)，Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Lublin, Poland.",ilona.bondos@poczta.umcs.lublin.pl,,,"National Science Centre, Poland [2014/13/B/HS4/01612]","National Science Centre, Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","Source of research: National Science Centre, Poland, grant No. 2014/13/B/HS4/01612",,44,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,4256,4262,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553205029,0

To cope with this, Slovakia has adapted a protective legal framework to combat this phenomenon. The principle of non-discrimination has constitutional value and the legislative framework to combat this sort of discrimination is complete. In addition, the importation of a new model of more egalitarian management by the multinational companies could have made it possible to stem this phenomenon. Indeed, the growing presence of multinational companies with a highly internationalized organizational culture and advanced policies to promote diversity has contributed to the transformation of the business climate in Slovakia and to raising awareness of different forms of discrimination. The protective legal framework and the presence of multinationals, which generally make firm commitments to gender equality, are a priori elements that are conducive to the fight against discrimination in Slovakia. However, more sociological analysis shows that the practices of societies evolve slowly even in the multinationals as illustrated by the low representation of women in the executive boards of these companies.","[Delaneuville, Frederic; Mitkova, L'udmila] Univ Comenius Bratislava, Fac Management, Bratislava, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Delaneuville, F (通讯作者)，Univ Comenius Bratislava, Fac Management, Bratislava, Slovakia.",frederic.delaneuville@fmuk.uniba.sk; ludmila.mitkova@fm.uniba.sk,"Mitková, Ľudmila/AAF-9802-2019",,,,,,8,0,0,1,4,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,1645,1652,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553202071,0

This paper is based on a view that Globalization as a general phenomenon has implications for the dynamics of college life. An indication that can be observed is the existence of Global Student Mobility. For example at UPI from year to year since 2013 foreign students from 22 countries include Uganda, Uzbekistan, Poland and Finland. This means that internationalization is something that is inevitable. But on the other hand there are indications of a close connection between the low quality of humans and the low quality of PT conditions, also experienced in Indonesia. Based on a World Bank study report on Education in Indonesia illustrates that the level of drop out is high, the number continues low, the rate of participation is low, learning achievement is low which illustrates the performance of education management has not met expectations. In that context, the role of PT in improving human quality is still relevant. Responding to such a phenomenon, the author is interested in finding out what factors are the cause, what should be done, what are the criteria related to the predicate of world-class PT and global competitiveness. This study is expected to give birth to the relevant ideas, strategies and PT development models for improving the management performance of PT.

Based on the primary data, entrepreneurs in the sample are characterized by both autocratic and democratic leadership styles. At the examination of management style, we can see that the Laissez - faire driving style is less favored by female entrepreneurs.

Innovative activity in the agriculture of developed countries is currently being implemented in the areas of integrated automation and computerization of agricultural production, the systematic introduction of resources and energy-saving technologies, the accelerated renovation of the fleet of agricultural machinery, which allows to reduce the production cost of agricultural products, increase labor productivity and improve its conditions and, ultimately, to increase the level of competitiveness and socio-eco- ohmic efficiency of agricultural production in general.The most actual directions of formation of innovative processes in agriculture of the Russian Federation are complex mechanization, automation, electrification and chemicalization of production; land reclamation; application of intensive, resource-saving technologies; creation of high-yielding, immune and highly effective varieties of agricultural crops; the development of breeds of livestock that have a complex of valuable biological and economically useful qualities; biotechnology; deepening of specialization and increasing concentration of production; improving the forms of organization and motivation of highly productive work; development of new forms of ownership and management; integration of agriculture with other branches of the national economy. In the Russian Federation, the need for innovative modernization of agricultural production was recognized in the framework of the national project Development of the agro-industrial complex, federal and regional programs for the development of agricultural production; quite a high activity in the sphere of preferential crediting of the renewal of the machinery park of agricultural producers. In the existing volumes of financing and lending, the need for innovative modernization of the agro-industrial complex is clearly not enough - the innovative activity of the vast majority of agricultural producers continues to be extremely low or completely non-existent. At the same time, in the special literature, problems of a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of innovative processes in agriculture, as well as the formation of the most rational system of state incentives for activating the innovation activity of agricultural producers, have not been adequately covered. Development of scientific and methodological and practical recommendations for improving the management of technological innovation processes in agriculture at the present stage of its functioning. Within this framework, the following main tasks are to be accomplished: 1) analysis of the specifics of the organization and implementation of technological innovation processes in agriculture; 2) study of the features of technological innovation processes in agriculture, including in the context of industries, enterprises and promising innovative projects; 3) development of methods for a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of innovation in the agro-industrial complex; 4) recommendations on the formation of a regional innovation system for the development of agricultural production; 5) substantiation of directions for improving state regulation of technological innovation processes in agriculture. Methodical provisions and practical recommendations aimed at improving the management of technological innovation processes of agricultural development at the present stage of its modernization. Management of innovation in agriculture is necessary for the following measures: 1. On the basis of a comprehensive sociological study of the implementation of innovation processes, the expediency of direct budget subsidies as the main source of innovative modernization of agricultural production is justified. 2. An innovative option for the implementation of an investment project for the construction of a livestock complex is more cost-effective than a traditional, less capital-intensive investment option. At the same time, the maximum economic efficiency of the innovative version of the investment project is achieved provided that the sources of investment financing are diversified on the basis of public-private partnership. 3. The necessity of creating the Public Council for Innovations in Agriculture as a strategic management organ of the regional innovation system for the development of the agricultural complex, which is formed from representatives of various agricultural enterprises, employees of ministries and departments, representatives of specialized science and education, substantiates its main functions.","[Khalturina, Elena N.; Smirnov, Anatoly A.; Kreneva, Svetlana G.; Vinokurov, Ilya S.] Mari State Univ, Yoshkar Ola, Russia; [Nurmuhametov, Ilnar M.] Interreg Open Social Inst, Yoshkar Ola, Russia",Mari State University; Inter-Regional Open Social Institute,"Khalturina, EN (通讯作者)，Mari State Univ, Yoshkar Ola, Russia.",Le_xa@list.ru; ilnar090485@mail.ru; an2saa@bk.ru; kreneva.sv@yandex.ru; i-vinokyrov@mail.ru,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,4,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,7848,7854,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553208093,0

Given Ferson's (1989) finding that large and small stocks can exhibit different risk behaviors, we examine the behaviors of the KOSPI and KOSDAQ stock markets in response to changes in the price level, real interest rate, and real USD/KRW exchange rate using simple and nonlinear autoregressive-distributed lag (ARDL) models. We find that the long-run effects of macroeconomic shocks are relatively insignificant under the simple ARDL model, whereas a significant and negative long-run effect is found for almost every explanatory variable-market pair under the nonlinear model. In addition, we find that the long-run effects of stock price shocks on macroeconomic variables are more significant under the nonlinear model. Overall, the results imply that it is difficult to identify the relationship between macroeconomic variables and stock price dynamics without considering asymmetry.","[Lee, Geul] Coinplug Inc, 11F,20 Pangyoyeok Ro146beon Gil, Seongnam Si 13536, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Ryu, Doojin] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Coll Econ, 25-2 Sungkyunkwan Ro, Seoul 03063, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Ryu, D (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Coll Econ, 25-2 Sungkyunkwan Ro, Seoul 03063, South Korea.",sharpjin@skku.edu,"Ryu, Doojin/AAZ-3318-2020; Lee, Geul/H-8746-2016","Ryu, Doojin/0000-0002-0059-4887; Lee, Geul/0000-0002-3156-7806",,,,,65,12,13,0,7,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

FCM is firstly used to quantize company financial paths of behavior over consecutive years. Financial paths are deployed to depict different patterns of failure and to understand the dynamics of financial failure. Then financial failure prediction model is built based on the proposed financial path (FP) approach. Empirical experiment is carried out with data samples of Chinese listed companies. Through analyzing financial path, it is found that there are mainly four patterns of process to terminal failure. Besides, in order to validate the prediction performance of the financial path prediction model, four prevalent financial failure prediction models, logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), and neural network (NN), are deployed to compare with the proposed model respectively. Experimental results show that FP has significantly better financial failure performance than other four models in terms of accuracy, type I error, and type II error. Therefore, the financial path monitors the change of financial status and acts as a prediction tool for financial failure prediction, which is a significant determinant of the financial success. Managers can recognize the financial failure signal in advance and understand their evolution trend on the future. In addition, the financial path prediction model is also an effective supplement to the research field of financial failure analysis and prediction.","[Liu, Jiaming; Wu, Chong] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology,"Wu, C (通讯作者)，Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",wuchong1971@126.com,"xin, li/JCO-3925-2023; LI, Wenhui/JCD-9947-2023; Li, Juan/JEO-6872-2023",,,,,,41,3,3,2,35,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

One such cybersecurity issue relates to data integrity attacks. This paper focuses on the power industry, where the forecasting processes rely heavily on the quality of the data. Data integrity attacks are expected to harm the performances of forecasting systems, which will have a major impact on both the financial bottom line of power companies and the resilience of power grids. This paper reveals the effect of data integrity attacks on the accuracy of four representative load forecasting models (multiple linear regression, support vector regression, artificial neural networks, and fuzzy interaction regression). We begin by simulating some data integrity attacks through the random injection of some multipliers that follow a normal or uniform distribution into the load series. Then, the four aforementioned load forecasting models are used to generate one-year-ahead ex post point forecasts in order to provide a comparison of their forecast errors. The results show that the support vector regression model is most robust, followed closely by the multiple linear regression model, while the fuzzy interaction regression model is the least robust of the four. Nevertheless, all four models fail to provide satisfying forecasts when the scale of the data integrity attacks becomes large. This presents a serious challenge to both load forecasters and the broader forecasting community: the generation of accurate forecasts under data integrity attacks. We construct our case study using the publicly-available data from Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2012. At the end, we also offer an overview of potential research topics for future studies.

The five-block mechanism is proposed with the aim of increasing the efficiency of the processes of reproduction and weakening or even eliminating the destructive effect of extreme factors on the full cycle of reproduction. To assess the state of the technical potential of grain organizations, a system of scientifically based indicators has been developed. To evaluate the prospects for the development of the level of reproduction of the technical potential of the grain subcomplex and for the separation of grain clusters by natural and climatic zones, an algorithm has been developed taking into account the reproduction of the technical potential.

Thus, having an effective fraud detection algorithm is pivotal for online advertising businesses. In this paper we analyzed click patterns over a generous dataset covering 200 million clicks over 4 days. The key idea was to measure the journey of a user's click across their portfolio and flag IP addresses who produce lots of clicks, but never end up in installing apps.

However, research conducted in order to study the impact of the controllability principle on job performance of managers is still limited Thus, the objective of the paper is to investigate the perception of the controllability principle by junior managers at lower levels in the organizational hierarchy. The research is designed on the basis of the role theory and refers to the influence of the controllability principle on role conflict and role ambiguity, and in turn on the managerial performance. The model is built to replicate in Polish conditions the methodology originally proposed by Burkert et at (2011). The article offers an empirical test using data gathered from 509 junior managers employed in Poland Three out of four hypotheses were supported confirming significant impact of the use of the controllability principle on role conflict and role ambiguity. Simply, as the level of the use of the principle increases, managers are less likely to experience role conflict and role ambiguity. If the role ambiguity decrease, then managerial performance improves.","[Nita, Bartlomiej] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Management Comp Sci & Finance, Komandorska Str 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Nita, B (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Management Comp Sci & Finance, Komandorska Str 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",bartlomiej.nita@ue.wroc.pl,,,,,,,39,1,1,0,9,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The data spanned from 2006 through 2016. The empirical study employed the System Generalised Method of Moments technique of estimation. The major findings of the study revealed that foreign direct investment alone cannot promote economic growth except when there is sufficient absorptive capacity. Only human capital and domestic investment have sufficient absorptive capacity to support foreign direct investment in promoting economic growth. However openness, financial development and infrastructure do not have sufficient absorptive capacity to support foreign direct investment in promoting growth in ECOWAS subregion. The study, therefore, recommended that policies should be directed towards developing the absorptive capacity, (which is the ability of the domestic countries to translate the spillover from the transferred technology into economic growth), instead of wasting scarce resources on attracting foreign direct investment. Also, governments of these countries should provide active and efficient labour market policies and provide workers with training that would make them attractive to all sorts of sophisticated industries and emerging skill need.","[Onayemi, Sherifatu O.; Alege, Philip O.] Covenant Univ, Ota, Nigeria; [Olomola, Philip A.] Obafemi Awolowo Univ, Ife, Nigeria",Covenant University; Obafemi Awolowo University,"Onayemi, SO (通讯作者)，Covenant Univ, Ota, Nigeria.",koredeleonayemi@yahoo.com; polomola@yahoo.ca; philip.alege@covenantuniversity.edu.ng,"OLOMOLA, Philip/AAR-6528-2020",,,,,,21,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,646,657,,,,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553201014,0

The main question addressed is how the Bank of England, Bank of Japan, and European Central Bank's (ECB's) announcements concerning monetary easing affect two major commodities: gold and silver. Our empirical evidence based on daily and high-frequency data suggests that relevant information causes ambiguous valuation adjustments as well as stabilization or destabilization effects. Specifically, there is strong evidence that the Japanese Central Bank strengthens the precious metal markets by increasing their returns and by causing stabilization effects, in contrast to the ECB, which has opposite results, mainly due to the heterogeneous expectations of investors within these markets. These asymmetries across central banks' effects on gold and silver risk-return profile imply that the ECB unconventional monetary easing informational content opposes its stated mission, adding uncertainty in precious metals markets.","[Papadamou, Stephanos] Univ Thessaly, Dept Econ, Volos, Greece; [Sogiakas, Vasilios] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of Thessaly; University of Glasgow,"Sogiakas, V (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch Econ, Gilbert Scott Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",vasilios.sogiakas@glasgow.ac.uk,"Papadamou, Stephanos/I-2580-2019; Sogiakas, Vasilios/AIE-3276-2022","Papadamou, Stephanos/0000-0002-7700-1912; Sogiakas, Vasilios/0000-0002-1641-6129",,,,,39,13,13,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

Among the existing ways to test the market efficiency, the focus is on verifying whether the performance of the index follows a Brownian motion (a random walk process). The aim is that, through this study, the results obtained would contribute to the existing literature. At the same time, investors can use this information by incorporating it into their investment strategies. Two methods are used in this analysis and both target to establish market efficiency dynamically using a moving window approach. The first method uses the equation of a random walk process, while the second estimates the Hurst exponent. Both converge to the same result, namely that within the same period analyzed, market efficiency can change, with the market not being efficient or inefficient from the beginning to the end, as it can fluctuate from one state to another. A cause of this shift are the shocks that appear on the market.","[Pascal, Carmen Emilia] Acad Econ Studies, Fac Finance Insurance Banking & Stock Exchange, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Pascal, CE (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Fac Finance Insurance Banking & Stock Exchange, Bucharest, Romania.",carmen.emilia.pascal@gmail.com,"Pascal, Carmen/AAX-5320-2021",,,,,,11,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,6509,6517,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553207049,0

The tested functions included economy, marketing, sales, technologies, innovations and corporate culture. The survey covered a group of 456 business entities from the entire Czech Republic (from which 83 were large, 124 medium and 249 were micro and small enterprises) and it used statistical tests (one-tailed one-sample test of proportions and interval estimation) to determine which function has the biggest influence on implementation of a strategy of a business entity or which seems to have the biggest influence based on the performed statistical tests. The obtained results have confirmed a special position of the economic function for all the size categories of the enterprises and, with the exception of corporate culture, also significant appreciation of all corporate functions in the category of large enterprises. The small and medium enterprises fail to sufficiently appreciate the technological and innovation functions, as well as marketing and sales.

Since 1994 policy targets to transfer land to black farmers have not been met. Of the 2005 target to transfer about 25 million ha of commercial farmland to black farmers by 2014, less than 5 million ha. have been transferred for commercial use. Some studies report failure rates in resettlement projects of up to 90%. To account for the failures, revisions of policies and amendments to legislations have been proposed within a political environment that is becoming increasingly intolerant to slow progress in land transfers and to resettlement failures. Aim: Against this environment, this paper presents a typology for understanding and evaluating important elements of the land reform project in order to influence progress in the process. Setting: The study adopts a historical review of land reform processes in post-colonial Kenya and Zimbabwe in order to identify potential challenges and key lessons for South Africa. Methods: Hence, using institutional and historical analytical lenses in exploring different narratives, the paper reviews reported failures and successes in land reform policy cases from the selected countries. From an institutional framework, prevalent social institutions and key lessons from Kenya, Zimbabwe and South Africa, a typology for evaluating important elements of the land reform process in South Africa is developed and discussed. Additionally, a review of global data collected on average sizes of farms in different regions of the world is provided as evidence to support propositions of what would constitute efficient farmland size ranges for small to medium commercial farms in South Africa. Results and conclusion: A proposition is made on how to use the typology to guide policy and research interventions to reduce failures and promote successful cases in different areas of the land reform process in South Africa, and possibly other similar contexts.","[Mbatha, Nhlanhla C.] Univ South Africa, Grad Sch Business Leadership, Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Mbatha, NC (通讯作者)，Univ South Africa, Grad Sch Business Leadership, Pretoria, South Africa.",nhlanhla.mbatha@gmail.com,"Mbatha, Nhlanhla Cyril/P-6530-2014","Mbatha, Nhlanhla Cyril/0000-0002-6990-6455",,,,,35,5,6,1,4,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

In particular, we are interested in the moderating effect of flexibility measures on the link between the existence works councils and collective agreements on wages and productivity. In presence of institutional changes, the question is whether works councils in covered plants still generate rather than redistribute rents, given recent decentralisation processes in the German system of industrial relations. We augment a theoretical model to provide hypotheses, which are then tested using empirical analysis of representative German plant level data. We find that the existence of flexibility provisions in collective bargaining agreements does not alter the effect of works council on firms' wages. We find, however, that with flexibility provisions works council presence is associated with higher productivity levels than without such provisions. These findings, however, depend on the level of collective bargaining: they can only be observed in plants covered by industry-level contracts, but do not hold in plants covered by firm-level contracts.","[Braendle, Tobias] Inst Appl Econ Res Tubingen, Ob Dem Himmelreich 1, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Brändle, T (通讯作者)，Inst Appl Econ Res Tubingen, Ob Dem Himmelreich 1, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany.",tobias.braendle@iaw.edu,,,,,,,44,8,8,1,11,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,CHICHESTER,"THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0143-6570,1099-1468,,MANAG DECIS ECON,Manag.

Employees are defined as customer-oriented if they are interested not only in their wage but also in the well-being of their customers. I find that firms may obtain higher profits by hiring self-interested rather than customer-oriented employees. This is because the employees' customer orientation has opposing effects on the profits obtained by the firms. On the one hand, customer-oriented employees provide a given level of quality for a lower wage. On the other hand, the employees' customer orientation increases competition reducing prices. If the second effect dominates, firms find themselves trapped in a prisoners' dilemma as the strategy of hiring self-interested employees is strictly dominated by that of hiring customer-oriented employees. Hence, the very presence of customer-oriented employees may hurt firms. If motivated employees are merely interested in the quality of the good provided, the effect on the price outlined before disappears.","[Manna, Ester] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ, Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Manna, E (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ, Barcelona, Spain.",ester.manna1@gmail.com,"Manna, Ester/H-9353-2015","Manna, Ester/0000-0002-6932-0577","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad; Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (MINECO/FEDER, UE) [ECO2015-66701-R]; Government of Catalonia [2014SGR493]","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (MINECO/FEDER, UE); Government of Catalonia(Generalitat de Catalunya)","I would like to thank the editor, Ramon Casadesus-Masanell, a co-editor, and three anonymous referees for very helpful and constructive comments.

In this perspective, we innovate by conditioning on Fama-French and Carhart risk factors, which directly measures changing market expectations about the economic outlook, on new financial condition indexes and macroeconomic variables. The macro-finance augmented econometric model has a remarkable in-sample and out-of-sample predictive ability, largely outperforming a standard autoregressive specification. We also document a stable relationship between the US dollar/euro Carhart momentum conditional correlation (CCW) and the euro area business cycle.

The HDC can order an immediate repayment or grant a debt suspension. Exploiting the random assignment of bankruptcy filings to managers, we show that a debt suspension has a very significant and negative effect on the likelihood to re-default but that this impact is only short-lived. The effect depends not only on the characteristics of the households but also on the nature of their indebtedness. Our results imply that rather than focusing on a specific debt profile, above all a deeper restructuring of the expenditure side is necessary to make the plan sustainable in case of an uniform increase of the HDC severity. They also single out specific banks lending to particular fragile households. They indicate the importance of policy actions on budget counseling, as well as the importance of regulation of credit distribution to avoid both entering into bankruptcy and re-filing for bankruptcy.","[Fraisse, Henri] Banque France, 31 Rue Croix Petits Champs, F-75001 Paris, France; [Fraisse, Henri] IZA, Paris, France",European Central Bank; Bank of France,"Fraisse, H (通讯作者)，Banque France, 31 Rue Croix Petits Champs, F-75001 Paris, France.",henri.fraisse@acpr.banque-france.fr,,,,,,,29,1,1,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

Increased scrutiny is being placed on South African state-owned entities (SOEs), as a result of the seemingly poor performance of SOEs. Some of the SOEs are reported to have received financial bailouts from taxpayers' money, while executives are raking in millions of rands in remuneration, provoking some concerns on the alignment of executive pay to company performance in SOEs. Aim: The study will assist remuneration committees and policymakers in the structuring of executive pay in SOEs to ensure alignment to company performance. Setting: The study sought to assess, based on empirical evidence, if there is a positive relationship between Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) remuneration and company performance in South African SOEs in the period between 2010 and 2014. All 21 Schedule 2 SOEs were included in the study. Methods: The research was a quantitative archival research methodology. Correlation and multiple regression analysis were the main statistical techniques used in this study. Results: Contrary to popular media, a positive relationship between CEO and CFO remuneration (fixed pay and short-term incentives) and company performance in SOEs was observed. Company size appears to be the key determiner of fixed pay in SOEs. The positive relationship was mainly noted on absolute profitability measurements like EBITDA (earnings before interest and tax and depreciation and amortisation) and net profit. Conclusion: SOE remuneration committees and policymakers should maintain the positive relationship; however, more emphasis should be placed on financial efficiency measurements so as to enhance efficiencies in SOEs.","[Bussin, Mark H.

Congruent with recent research that emphasizes the importance of information flows, we find that the time to settlement is negatively associated with the completion of those procedural events that most effectively facilitate the revelation of new factual information. Consistent with both rational-choice and behavioral theories of litigation, other procedural events are unassociated or even positively associated with the time to settlement.

Consumers might misperceive specific rules, such as those found in food safety regulations, as well as more general standards, such as the unconscionability doctrine or limitations on waivers of default substantive or procedural rights. When demand is affected by systematic misperceptions of legal norms, lawmakers may be able to maximize welfare by deviating from the legal standard that would be optimal in the absence of misperception. We use a formal model to characterize these optimal deviations under different legal regimes (with different types and magnitudes of sanctions). In particular, should the legal standard be adjusted to counteract or confirm the misperception? For instance, if consumers underestimate the level of legal protection is it desirable to raise the legal standard to counteract the misperception? Or should lawmakers lower the legal standard to confirm the misperception?.","[Bar-Gill, Oren] Harvard Law Sch, 1525 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Davis, Kevin E.] NYU, Sch Law, New York, NY 10003 USA",Harvard University; New York University,"Bar-Gill, O (通讯作者)，Harvard Law Sch, 1525 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",bargill@law.harvard.edu,,,,,,,38,4,4,1,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1465-7252,1465-7260,,AM LAW ECON REV,Am.

By doing so, the defendant can induce the plaintiff to drop the lawsuit. This assumes that the cost of a voluntary disclosure is less than the cost of a full trial to the defendant.

In particular, three themes are discussed. The first one is about the ontological problem of defining a town. Administrative, morphological and functional perspectives are considered.

It shows the character of embeddedness' of smaller settlements within urban systems and territorial structures and how the socio-economic performances of smaller-settlement regions are defined by a combination of macro trends, national contextualisation, local dynamics and regional path dependency.","[Servillo, Loris] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Architecture, Planning & Dev Res Grp, Leuven, Belgium; [Paolo Russo, Antonio] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Res Grp Terr Anal & Tourism Studies, Tarragona, Spain",KU Leuven; Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Servillo, L (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Architecture, Planning & Dev Res Grp, Leuven, Belgium.",loris.servillo@asro.kuleuven.be; antonio.russo@urv.cat,"Servillo, Loris/AAG-2306-2020; Russo, Antonio/A-9456-2014","Servillo, Loris/0000-0001-5819-4555; Russo, Antonio/0000-0001-8768-246X",,,,,47,9,9,3,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

The profit-sharing rule between partner firms in code sharing is estimated at 0.92, which suggests that the operating carrier acquires around 92% of profits from a round-trip, and the marketing carrier retains 8% as a commission fee. Meanwhile, the economies of code sharing reduces marginal cost, and firms are able to price at higher markups. This implies that demand increases and consumers have larger surplus if code sharing creates new products.","[Shen, Caixia] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Business Adm, China Ind Dev Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Shen, CX (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Business Adm, China Ind Dev Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",shencaixia@gmail.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403161],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Financial support by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71403161) is acknowledged.

Approach: A firm-level dynamic panel estimates the persistence of profit in the European rail freight sector. Main findings: The persistence of profits shows a high degree of competition in the short run but imperfect in the long run due to the existence of barriers on the market. Secondly, the ratio between capital and labour cost is calculated. It indicates moderate economies of scale. Originality: Knowledge about this new market and the dynamics are limited in the academic literature.

A two equation structural model has been developed which allows the probability of bagging game to be simultaneously entered into the travel cost model. The basic model is based on a Poisson distribution for the travel cost, and a Negative Binomial distribution is used to deal with the issue of overdispersion. Likelihood ratio tests and non-nested model selection tests have been adopted to choose the model which best fits the data. The results show that a Negative Binomial structural model is the best and the probability of bagging game has a significant effect on the travel cost model.

To characterize judgmental forecasts from graphically-presented time series, I propose the correlated response model, according to which the properties of judgmental forecasts are correlated with those of the forecasted series. In two experiments, participants were presented with graphs depicting synthetic price series. In Experiment 1, participants were asked to make point forecasts for different time horizons. Participants could control the graphs' time scales. In Experiment 2, participants made multi-period forecasts, and could apply moving average filters to the graphs. The dispersion of point forecasts between participants (the standard deviation of participants' point forecasts) and the variability of individual participant's multi-period forecasts (local steepness and oscillation) were extracted. Both forecast measures were found to be significantly correlated with variability measures of the original, scaled, and smoothed data graphs. Thus, the results supported the correlated response model and provided insights into the forecasting process.

We explore the effect of institutional variables on road safety, redressing the literature's failure to consider political institutions as road safety determinants. Specifically, we analyze the effect on traffic accidents and fatalities of different political regimes, electoral rules and forms of government. By drawing on an international sample of countries taken over a long time-span, we implement panel data methods to empirically estimate the role of institutions on road safety determinants. We find that democratic institutions are associated with better road safety outcomes. The beneficial effects of democratization become apparent after about four years in countries undergoing a regime transition and are also discernible in established democracies that are consolidating their political institutions. Finally, our results suggest that road safety can be characterized as a local public good and that its provision is greater in parliamentary systems. This paper is the first empirical paper shedding light on the role of institutions to road safety outcomes. Our results provide evidence of how the democratization of countries involve positive externalities to road safety outcomes.","[Albalate, Daniel] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econometr Stat & Appl Econ, Av Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Yarygina, Anastasiya] Inter Amer Dev Bank, 1300 New York Ave, Washington, DC 20577 USA",University of Barcelona; Inter-American Development Bank,"Albalate, D (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Econometr Stat & Appl Econ, Av Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",albalate@ub.edu; yarygina@uchicago.edu,"Albalate, Daniel/N-8124-2019","Albalate, Daniel/0000-0002-4940-4589",,,,,53,2,2,0,9,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"VIA SANTA BIBBIANA 28, PISA, I-56127, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

This has implied a worsening of public service quality and an increase of public transport prices. Using the Spanish Household Survey, this paper analyses the impact on welfare generated by the increase of public transport prices in 2008-2012. For this price and income elasticities have been computed using an LA/AIDS model. Price public transport elasticities are low (around 0.1%) and only significant for the years of the highest price increase. Fuel is substitutive for public transport with a cross-price elasticity of 0.25% and the other goods consumption is almost independent of the consumption of public transport with a cross-price elasticity of 0.06%. The results of income elasticies prove that public transport is a normal good. Results show that this new policy has harmed with a similar impact, low and medium income households. Those households have supported an average loss of welfare of 3.66% of their income. The welfare loss supported by the richest households is 1.5% of their income, which represents only a 40% of the average costs supported by the rest of households. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Container handling in Brazilian terminals has been growing in the past five years. So, given the importance of container handling activity for Brazilian economy, it is relevant to study how the resources are used and also the efficiency of these terminals. This paper evaluates the technical and financial efficiencies of Brazilian container terminals. Initially, bibliographic research was done to understand the handling activities of container terminals, the financial and technical efficiency concepts and the variables related to them. After that, the data were gathered based in reports by port authorities and the technical and financial efficiency were calculated for Brazilian public container terminals. Tecon Santos, Convicon, Tecondi, Rodrimar, Libra Rio, Sepetiba Tecon, Tecon Rio Grande and Tecon Salvador were selected for this study due to the data availability. At the end, we established the technical and financial efficiency rankings enabling comparison of these two types of efficiency for each terminal. Besides this, the terminals' breakeven points were calculated. The data indicate that the terminals with best technical efficiency are not necessarily those with best financial efficiency and vice versa. This paper is relevant since it allows identifying terminals' weaknesses, making it possible to develop actions to improve their performance. Besides that, it helps decision-makers to manage future investments and improvement actions.","[Leal Junior, Ilton Curty] Univ Fed Fluminense, Programa Pos Grad Adm, R Des Ellis Hermydio Figueira 783, BR-27213145 Volta Redonda, RJ, Brazil; [Lopes, Juliana Monteiro] Univ Fed Fluminense, Volta Redonda, RJ, Brazil; [Guimaraes, Vanessa de Almeida; Teodoro, Pitias] Centro Fed Educagao Tecnol Celso Suckow Fonseca, Madrid, Spain",Universidade Federal Fluminense; Universidade Federal Fluminense,"Leal, IC (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Fluminense, Programa Pos Grad Adm, R Des Ellis Hermydio Figueira 783, BR-27213145 Volta Redonda, RJ, Brazil.",iltoncurty@gmail.com; jujumonteiro_18@hotmail.com; vanes-saguim@hotmail.com; pitiasteodoro@yahoo.com.br,,,CNPq; FAPERJ [203986]; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development - Brazil [308729/2014-5],CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); FAPERJ(Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ)); National Council for Scientific and Technological Development - Brazil(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"This paper was published with CNPq support, National Council for Scientific and Technological Development - Brazil (Research Productivity Fellowship Holder - CNPq Brazil Process 308729/2014-5).

Therefore, we investigated the extent to which implicit associationswhich have not been studied in relation to the hypothetical biasaccount for the gap between individuals' willingness to pay (WTP) in hypothetical and real auctions. From a theoretical point of view, implicit associations could be a crucial factor in differentiating the hypothetical and the real setting, because they should exert their effect only (or almost) in the latter.

In particular, we consider Pegram's operator-based autoregressive process for the analysis. Real datasets on infant sleep status are analysed for illustrations.

The evolution of the parameters is determined by the score of the conditional distribution, with the resulting model being observation-driven and being estimated using classical methods. In particular, we consider time variation in both the coefficients and the volatility, emphasizing how the two interact with each other. Meaningful restrictions are imposed on the model parameters in order to achieve local stationarity and bounded mean values. The model is applied to the analysis of inflation dynamics with the following results: allowing for heavy tails leads to significant improvements in terms of both the fit and forecasts, and the adoption of the Student-t distribution proves to be crucial for obtaining well-calibrated density forecasts. These results are obtained using the US CPI inflation rate and are confirmed by other inflation indicators, as well as for the CPI inflation of the other G7 countries.

We consider one of two firms to be overconfident, whereas the other is completely rational and derive the Nash equilibrium to compare with that when both firms are completely rational. Through this comparison and analysis, we establish that (i) the relationship between a firm's overconfidence and the likelihood of that firm developing a monopoly in the market is positive; (ii) a rational firm always suffers a loss because of its competitor's overconfidence in a Cournot competition; and (iii) an overconfident firm does not benefit constantly from its overconfidence, although overconfidence results in permanent, increased, and more aggressive market sharing in competitions.

These policies generally involve restricting the importation of forest products deemed to be produced from illegally sourced timber. Previous research finds no overall trade benefits for these countries to impose such restrictions and conclude rationale to do so is likely based on solely domestic production benefits or perceived social, political or environmental benefits. This study investigates how the implementation of trade policies impacts the trade costs for importing countries that have yet to adopt policies and how their incentives are affected by actions of others. Specifically, we explore the dynamics using a spatial equilibrium price model to simulate actual and hypothetical trade policy actions targeting a well-defined market, the non-tropical hardwood plywood market. This is accomplished through increasing the transaction costs on the non-tropical hardwood plywood exports from high risk producing countries to various combinations of importing countries. We show that non-participating importing countries benefit from the status quo policy regime and have no apparent incentive to join. We show that the incentive to join will increase if a coordinated global policy decreases transaction costs, though it may inadvertently diminish the incumbent countries' continued support for the policy. Thus trade-related economic incentives alone may be insufficient to encourage an effective multilateral regime to address illegal logging and confirm that a complex set of political, environmental and social interests are essential to motivate the development of a full multilateral stable cooperative solution.

We suggest that forecasts of economic variables can be improved by tuning factor estimates: (i) so that they are both more relevant for a specific target variable; and (ii) so that variables with considerable idiosyncratic noise are down-weighted prior to factor estimation. Existing targeted factor methodologies are limited to estimating the factors with only one of these two objectives in mind. We therefore combine these ideas by providing new weighted principal components analysis (PCA) procedures and a targeted generalized PCA (TGPCA) procedure. These methods offer a flexible combination of both types of targeting that is new to the literature. We illustrate this empirically by forecasting a range of US macroeconomic variables, finding that our combined approach yields important improvements over competing methods, consistently surviving elimination in the model confidence set procedure.

An alternative account linking institutions to rule-following behaviour in a game-theoretic framework is developed on the basis of David Lewis's and Ludwig Wittgenstein's respective accounts of conventions and language games. Institutions are formalized as epistemic games where the players share some forms of practical reasoning. An institution is a rule-governed game satisfying three conditions: common understanding, minimal awareness and minimal practical rationality. Common understanding has a strong similarity with Ludwig Wittgenstein's concept of lebensform while minimal awareness and minimal practical rationality capture the idea that rule-following is community-based.","[Hedoin, Cyril] Univ Reims Champagne Ardenne France, Econ & Management Res Ctr REGARDS, 57B Rue Pierre Taittinger, F-51096 Reims, France",Universite de Reims Champagne-Ardenne,"Hédoin, C (通讯作者)，Univ Reims Champagne Ardenne France, Econ & Management Res Ctr REGARDS, 57B Rue Pierre Taittinger, F-51096 Reims, France.",cyril.hedoin@univ-reims.fr,"Hédoin, Cyril/AAL-8244-2021","Hédoin, Cyril/0000-0002-5358-7111",,,,,47,10,11,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

By 2050, the population of the region will probably reach 2.1 billion people [Population Reference Bureau (2016)]. In 2100, SSA's population could be almost 4 billion people [United Nations (2015)]. This rapid demographic increase would translate into a possible quadrupling of the current SSA population by the end of the century (unless fertility would decline sharply in the near future). Nonetheless, the region has embarked on its demographic transition, i.e., the shift from high to low crude birth rates and crude death rates, albeit this process has occurred in SSA at a slower pace than in the rest of the developing world. In particular, the decline of fertility has been slower in SSA than in the other regions of the world. The rapid population growth and the occurrence of a demographic transition in the region have generated discussions on the prospects for SSA to open a demographic window of opportunity and capture a first demographic dividend. However, two crucial dimensions, which have so far been rather neglected, need more attention. First, one will need to define with more accuracy the sub-populations of the working-age adults and their young and older dependents, therefore refining the calculation of the dependency ratio. In particular, one will need to assess the population of the young dependents as well as the population of adults who are actually working. Second, it will be also necessary to examine the conditions required to trigger a faster and significant fertility decline in the region. This is most important because the relationship between the active adults and their dependents is predicated by the fertility decline, which will bring the changes to the age structure.","[May, John F.] Populat Reference Bur, Washington, DC 20009 USA; [Turbat, Vincent] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Georgetown University,"May, JF (通讯作者)，Populat Reference Bur, Washington, DC 20009 USA.",jmay@prb.org,,,,,,,13,7,9,0,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",2054-0892,2054-0906,,J DEMOGR ECON,J.Demogr.

Although they claim their only purpose in these ventures is to guarantee the accuracy of how military and intelligence activities are conducted, it is clear that their agenda goes beyond that goal. Their true aims include ensuring that movies project a positive image of the relevant government agencies. However, the CIA and DoD differ in their understanding of what constitutes good publicity. Films scrutinized and supported by military agencies are primarily evaluated according to whether they provide a vehicle for showing the technical and organizational competence of the Pentagon. To that end, films based on comic book characters or extraterrestrial invaders are viewed positively because they show the war-fighting capacity of the military without having to name any actual enemy. The CIA, by contrast, prefers to support films that enable citizens to develop a stronger sense of patriotism in a world of moral ambiguities. As a result, the CIA is much less fearful of revealing the dark side of its undertakings, as long as a given movie presents a story that shows the value of the CIA in protecting the security of the nation.","[Alford, Matthew] Univ Bath, Bath, Avon, England",University of Bath,"Alford, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Bath, Avon, England.",,,"Alford, Matthew/0009-0000-2062-4767",,,,,29,1,1,2,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

The results of the study exhibit that financial leverage, measured by debt to equity ratio, has significant impact on financial performance variables, measured by return on assets (ROA) and return on capital (ROC), whereas on the other two variables, return on equity (ROE) and earnings per share (EPS), its effect is insignificant. On the other hand, two variables, namely, gross domestic product and interest rate, were used as indicators of overall economy, and their impact was also studied on financial performance. The results show that their effect on financial performance is insignificant. Combining all the results together, it can be concluded that financial performance is majorly determined by firm's choice of financial leverage and not by the overall health of the economy specifically in context of nonfinancial firms in Pakistan. Managers in the search for improved performance apply firm-specific strategies, which they believe will provide their firms with the competitive advantage in the marketplace.","[Ahmad, Muhammad Ishfaq] Liaoning Tech Univ, Coll Sci, Fuxin, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Wang Guohui; Rafiq, Muhammad Yasir] Liaoning Tech Univ, Fuxin, Peoples R China; [Hasan, Mudassar; Rehman, Ramiz-Ur] Univ Lahore, Lahore Business Sch, Lahore, Pakistan",Liaoning Technical University; Liaoning Technical University; University of Lahore,"Ahmad, MI (通讯作者)，Liaoning Tech Univ, Coll Sci, Fuxin, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",m_ishfaq452@yahoo.com; gsxywgh@163.com; mudassarhasan84@yahoo.com; Yasir.stats@gmail.com; Ramiz_rehman@hotmail.com,"Rehman, Ramiz ur/N-9684-2019; AHMAD, MUHAMMAD ISHFAQ/AAG-3417-2020; Wang, Guohui/G-8935-2015","Rehman, Ramiz ur/0000-0001-6019-4781; AHMAD, MUHAMMAD ISHFAQ/0000-0003-1468-1073; Hasan, Mudassar/0000-0002-1782-5901",,,,,49,2,3,1,14,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-48454-9; 978-3-319-48453-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,125,138,,10.1007/978-3-319-48454-9_10,0.0,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1MX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447881400010,0

The study allows denying assumption that poverty risk always moves in the same direction as the income inequality. Such synchronicity was established only in the case of income inequality growth. In countries, where income inequality has been relatively stable, the risk of poverty was increasing-population with the lowest income went up. In the group with declining income inequality, the risk of poverty has also decreased, but at a significantly slower pace and the largest effect was not in the poorest, but in slightly higher income strata.","[Balvociute, Rasa] Siauliai Univ, Dept Econ, Shiauliai, Lithuania",Siauliai University,"Balvociute, R (通讯作者)，Siauliai Univ, Dept Econ, Shiauliai, Lithuania.",rasa.b@iname.com,"Balvociute, Rasa/E-4823-2011","Balvociute, Rasa/0000-0001-9822-9070",,,,,14,1,1,0,5,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-54112-9; 978-3-319-54111-2,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,7.0,,,,,,307,317,,10.1007/978-3-319-54112-9_20,0.0,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ4CE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424822700020,0

Therefore, as a result of this decline in agricultural productivity, changes in consumer prices and trade in comparative advantage occurred. This article aims to correlate the biophysical and socio-economic indicators in order to create an overall picture of the influence of climate change on agricultural efficiency. Climate change is different from one area to another and at regional level these changes and their effects may be less visible. However, variability and climate change can lead to the degradation of food security, especially in vulnerable areas. In this way, it is desirable to attract investments from internal or external funds for adaptation to climate change, as well as avoiding harmful effects on the agricultural crops and local communities. The main factors that can influence the current state of agriculture are of a biological, physical and socio-economic nature. So, it can be stated that crop production can be affected by biophysical factors through temperature variation, temperature increase, rainfall regime change, and increased atmospheric carbon dioxide. Consequently, adaptation to climate change has the role of helping to reduce the number of negative effects due to changes hoping to improve the positive environmental impacts.","[Banacu, Cristian Silvia; Olaru, Bianca Georgiana] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Banacu, CS (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",cristian.banacu@gmail.com; biancageorgiana.olaru@gmail.com,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,4,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",2286-1440,,,INT MANAGE CONF,,,2017,,,,,,,1015,1021,,,,,,7,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM6KT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000466917100106,0

This paper provides a target-based foundation for this effect, and predicts its occurrence in the expected utility framework when utility functions are S-shaped and asymmetrically tailed. First, we introduce a definition of hard-perceived and easy-perceived task based on the mismatch between an uncertain target to meet and a suitably symmetric reference point. Second, switching from a target-based language to a utility-based language, we show how this maps to equivalence between the hard-perceived target/gain seeking and the easy-perceived target/loss aversion. Third, we characterize the agent's miscalibration in self-confidence. Sufficient conditions for acting according to the hard-easy effect and the reversed hard-easy effect biases are set out. Finally, we derive sufficient conditions for the hard-easy effect and the reversed hard-easy effect to hold. As a by-product we identify situations in enterprise risk management where misconfidence in judgments emerges. Recognizing these cognitive biases, and being mindful of to be normatively influenced by them, gives the managers a better framework for decision making.","[Bordley, Robert] Univ Michigan, Dept Ind Engn & Operat Management, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Licalzi, Marco] Univ Ca Foscari, Dept Management, Venice, Italy; [Tibiletti, Luisa] Univ Turin, Dept Management, Turin, Italy",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; University of Turin,"Tibiletti, L (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Management, Turin, Italy.",Bordley_Robert@bah.com; licalzi@unive.it; luisa.tibiletti@unito.it,"Tibiletti, Luisa/AAI-4697-2021; LiCalzi, Marco/B-5084-2011; Tibiletti, Luisa/L-2030-2015","Tibiletti, Luisa/0000-0001-5765-9365; LiCalzi, Marco/0000-0003-4718-708X;",,,,,28,2,2,0,5,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-46319-3; 978-3-319-46318-6,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,5.0,,,,,,659,671,,10.1007/978-3-319-46319-3_41,0.0,,,13,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH5KL,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000401101000041,0

We will begin with the hypothesis that economic performance increases with the growth of the rate of various types of loans. We will first look at research of current scientific knowledge in respect to bank loans and economic development. The basic idea of this article is the hypothesis described above, determined on the basis of standard economic findings and based on the results of a majority of related studies. The development of loans provided can be quantified based on data from the Czech National Bank as total loans and divided into loans to non-financial companies and households, as well as mortgage loans and consumer loans. The development of the economy can also be quantified using data from the Czech Statistical Office on the development of the gross domestic product. The period selected is the years 2004-2015. To determine the relationships between selected variables, we have used statistical methods that respect the specific characteristics of the selected time series, namely the Engle-Granger causality test. Prior to testing, it was necessary to adjust the data as stationary and then test cointegration. An optimum order delay was also determined using the Akaike information criterion. The calculated results, except for consumer loans, confirm the hypothesis regarding the positive impact of the rate of loans provided on economic growth, particularly with a six-month time lag.

Top financial performers focus on liquidity management rather than on returns: both in the short term, by increasing levels of current assets and funding them with short-term liabilities, as well as increasing asset turnover; and in the long term, by aligning equity to non-current assets, while reducing asset and debt intensity levels. Only the manufacturing value chain is analysed, showing the potential for future research in related fields (e.g. value chain, country). Benchmarking and forecasting financial performance yields information and enables agility and accuracy in the strategy setting process. This study makes a unique contribution because it applies the scientific method where no previous related studies have done. It offers the novelty of using a single metric while Ratio Analysis requires multiple unweighted measures.

The aim of this paper was to determine the current status of using the blogs in the buying process in Slovakia and Poland. Results of the questionnaire survey confirmed that the terms of the frequency of visits of the blog between Slovak and Polish customers are not statistically significant. It was further confirmed that the Slovak and Polish customers use blogs by selected activities associated with the purchasing process as well. The last finding was that the frequency of visits of the blog and by whether the customer buys based on the blog, there is a statistically significant dependence.","[Ferencova, Martina] Pavol Jozef Safarik Univ Kosice, Fac Publ Adm, Popradska 66, Kosice 04132, Slovakia; [Kakalefcik, Lukas] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Appl Math & Business Informat, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia; [Kot, Sebastian] Univ Czestochova, Czestochowa Univ Technol, Fac Management, Ul Armii Krajowej 19 B, PL-42200 Czestochowa, Poland; [Kot, Sebastian] North West Univ, Fac Econ Sci & IT, Vaal Triangle Campus,Van Eck Blvd, ZA-1900 Vanderbijlpark, South Africa",University of Pavol Jozef Safarik Kosice; Technical University Kosice; Technical University Czestochowa; Vaal University of Technology (VUT); North West University - South Africa,"Kot, S (通讯作者)，Univ Czestochova, Czestochowa Univ Technol, Fac Management, Ul Armii Krajowej 19 B, PL-42200 Czestochowa, Poland.",sebacat@zim.pcz.czest.pl,"Kot, Sebastian/P-5165-2018","Kot, Sebastian/0000-0002-8272-6918",,,,,31,0,1,0,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-48454-9; 978-3-319-48453-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,49,57,,10.1007/978-3-319-48454-9_4,0.0,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1MX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447881400004,0

The issue of the performance of healthcare systems should be at the forefront in terms of the interest of academic research studies and discussions among the scientific community. The proper functioning of the healthcare system should also be a priority in regard to public policy. These facts should encourage governments to regularly evaluate the performance of their healthcare systems and create international comparisons. Many indicators are used to measure and evaluate performance of healthcare systems - e.g. those created by the WHO, Eurostat, or OECD Health Statistics and OECD Health Policy Studies. For our paper, data from the OECD Health Policy Studies was used as a primary source. V4 states were chosen for the evaluation of the performance of healthcare systems. The reasons for this are as follows: V4 countries are transitive economies of the CEE with a poorer state of health of their populations than in more developed countries of the OECD or EU; the given systems have long been underfinanced; and reforms are focused exclusively on economic goals and lack a broader concept in terms of long-term sustainability. For the purposes of this paper, a composite indicator of the performance of healthcare systems was designed and includes ten variables for the studied ten-year period. In order to establish a comparison of the performance of healthcare systems, three methods were used to model them: (i) using the area of a radar chart, (ii) determining performance based on order, and (iii) determining performance based on distance from the reference unit. These three methods for determining the performance of healthcare systems allow us to compare the performance of healthcare systems in V4 countries specifically. The goals of this paper are as follows: compare and evaluate the performance of healthcare systems among V4 countries using selected indicators from the field of healthcare and establish what position the Czech Republic's healthcare system holds in comparison with other V4 countries.","[Hejdukova, Pavlina] Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Plzen, Czech Republic; [Kurekova, Lucie] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Hejduková, P (通讯作者)，Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Plzen, Czech Republic.",pahejdu@kfu.zcu.cz; xkurl06@vse.cz,"Kureková, Lucie/JTU-7384-2023","Kureková, Lucie/0000-0002-7611-0463; Hejdukova, Pavlina/0000-0003-3387-1198","University of West Bohemia, Faculty of Economics [SGS-2015-019]","University of West Bohemia, Faculty of Economics","This paper was created within the project SGS-2015-019 'The Impacts of Current Legal, Tax, Accounting and Social Changes on Private Businesses and the Public Sector in the Context of Recodifi cation of Private Law' at the University of West Bohemia, Faculty of Economics.",,57,7,7,3,19,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The results show that related establishments that colocate together outperform their counterparts located elsewhere, although it is not clear whether these findings are due to the presence of externalities or alternative explanations. To explore this issue, several proxies for the Marshallian sources of relatedness are further developed to better reveal the underlying mechanisms that drive relatedness. The findings show that technological proximity helps to respectively reduce the costs of moving goods, people, and ideas, thus providing strong support for Marshallian theories of agglomeration. The ownership structure of the firm matters, however. Specifically, wholly privately owned enterprises are more successful than firms where the state is a minority shareholder at converting technologically related spillovers into higher profits and higher-efficiency gains.","[Howell, Anthony] Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Howell, A (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",tonyjhowell@pku.edu.cn,,"Howell, Anthony/0000-0002-4211-0190",School of Economics at Peking University; Natural Science Foundation of China [71603009],School of Economics at Peking University; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"I would like to thank Canfei He, Yang Rudai, David Rigby, Ron Boschma, and other participants of the Evolutionary Economic Geography conference at Peking University for helpful comments.

J,"Klingelhofer, HE",,,,"Klingelhofer, Heinz Eckart",,,Unintended possible consequences of fuel input taxes for individual investments in greenhouse gas mitigation technologies and the resulting emissions,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,DECISION TREES; ENERGY; POWER; SECTOR,"Background: South Africa is planning to introduce a carbon tax as a Pigouvian measure for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, one of the tax bases designed as a fuel input tax. In this form, it is supposed to incentivise users to reduce and/or substitute fossil fuels, leading to a reduction of CO2 emissions. Aim: This article examines how such a carbon tax regime may affect the individual willingness to invest in greenhouse gas mitigation technologies. Setting: Mathematical derivation, using methods of linear programming, duality theory and sensitivity analysis. Methods: By employing a two-step evaluation approach, it allows to identify the factors determining the maximum price an individual investor would pay for such an investment, given the conditions of imperfect markets. Results: This price ceiling depends on the (corrected) net present values of the payments and on the interdependencies arising from changes in the optimal investment and production programmes. Although the well-established results of environmental economics usually can be confirmed for a single investment, increasing carbon taxes may entail sometimes contradictory and unexpected consequences for individual investments in greenhouse gas mitigation technologies and the resulting emissions. Under certain circumstances, they may discourage such investments and, when still undertaken, even lead to higher emissions. However, these results can be interpreted in an economically comprehensible manner. Conclusion: Under the usually given conditions of imperfect markets, the impact of a carbon tax regime on individual investment decisions to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions is not as straight forward as under the usually assumed, but unrealistically simplifying perfect market conditions. To avoid undesired and discouraging effects, policy makers cannot make solitary decisions, but have to take interdependencies on the addressee ' s side into account. The individual investor ' s price ceiling for such an investment in imperfect markets can be interpreted as a sum of (partially corrected) net present values, which themselves are a generalisation of the net present values known from perfect markets.","[Klingelhofer, Heinz Eckart] Tshwane Univ Technol, Dept Managerial Accounting & Finance, Pretoria, South Africa",Tshwane University of Technology,"Klingelhofer, HE (通讯作者)，Tshwane Univ Technol, Dept Managerial Accounting & Finance, Pretoria, South Africa.",klingelhoeferhe@tut.ac.za,,"Klingelhofer, Heinz Eckart/0000-0001-8715-0519",South Africa's National Research Foundation,South Africa's National Research Foundation(National Research Foundation - South Africa),The author received funding from the South Africa's National Research Foundation as a rated researcher.,,44,3,3,1,3,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

To test the hypotheses, I analyse data from a comprehensive survey of large public firms in Europe and the US, and data from public sources pertaining to the surveyed firms. While the empirical results lend support to the hypothesized role of CSC, they also reveal differences between related CSC and unrelated CSC. However, I find no support for the expected performance implications.

The sample of this research (n = 124) consists of managers or human resources managers and specialists. The structured questionnaire measures social representations in six domains: creativity definition; creativity in organizations; characteristics of creative personality; behavior, communication and thinking patterns of a creative person; motivation of creative person. The results of research indicate that Latvian human resources managers and specialists' social representations are grounded on academic theories, however only partly-some of the myths are still present. Social representations of three dimensions of creativity (definitions, creative personality) are not in line with major theoretical assumptions.

The introduction of cost accounting in public hospitals would allow the planning and control of costs, monitoring of costs per patient or service and the calculation of indicators for the analysis and assessment of the economic performance of the business of public hospitals and lead to the transparency of budget spending. A model that would be suited to the introduction in the public hospital is full cost allocation model based on activities or processes that occur, known as the ABC method. Given that this is a calculation of cost of services provided through various internal business processes, it is important to identify all business processes in order to be able to calculate the costs incurred by services. Although the hospital does not do business with the aim to make a profit, they must follow all the costs (direct and indirect) to be able to calculate the full costs i.e. the price of the service provided. In addition, the long-term sustainability of business activities in terms of funding difficulties and the continuous growth of cost of services provided, hospitals must control and reduce the cost of the program and specific activities. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to point out the importance of business processes while introducing ABC method.","[Lutilsky, Ivana Drazic] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Accounting, Zagreb, Croatia; [Juros, Lucija] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb,"Lutilsky, ID (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Accounting, Zagreb, Croatia.",idrazic@efzg.hr; lucajuros@gmail.com,"Ivančić, Lucija/P-1561-2017; Drazic Lutilsky, Ivana/I-2428-2018","Ivančić, Lucija/0000-0003-0491-7230; Drazic Lutilsky, Ivana/0000-0003-3562-9864",University of Zagreb,University of Zagreb,"This work has been fully supported by University of Zagreb funding the project Business processes in the implementation of cost management in healthcare system.

The article dismisses the widespread taxonomical application of knowledge base conceptualizations for classification of firms, industries, and economies into fixed categories based on their dominant knowledge base characteristics. Rather it argues that the knowledge base characteristics vary not only between firms and industries but also over time and through innovation trajectories in firms and industries. The new interpretation implies that the knowledge base characteristics are defined not only by individual-level modes and rationales for knowledge creation and application and by their related spatial implications but also by managerial-organizational aspects with regard to coordination and exploitation of such knowledge dynamics. The integration of literatures from different disciplinary strands, now unified under the umbrella of a reinterpreted knowledge base approach, advances the explanatory value of the knowledge base approach in economic geography and innovation studies as well as related disciplines.","[Manniche, Jesper] Ctr Reg & Tourism Res, Stenbrudsvej 55, DK-3730 Nexo, Denmark; [Moodysson, Jerker] Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Solvegatan 16, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Moodysson, Jerker] Jonkoping Univ, JIBS, POB 1026, S-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden; [Testa, Stefania] Univ Genoa, Dept Mech Engn Energet Management & Transports, Viale Causa 13, I-16100 Genoa, Italy",Lund University; Jonkoping University; University of Genoa,"Manniche, J (通讯作者)，Ctr Reg & Tourism Res, Stenbrudsvej 55, DK-3730 Nexo, Denmark.",manniche@crt.dk; jerker.moodysson@ju.se; stefania.testa@unige.it,"testa, stefania/ISU-1321-2023","testa, stefania/0000-0002-4067-8110",,,,,89,28,32,0,18,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

However, economists were not considerably successful when dealing with the recession forecasting so far, notably, the Great Recession of the late 2000s and early 2010s emerged rather surprisingly. The aim of this paper is to examine the statistical relationship (in terms of Granger causality) between the Consumer Confidence Index (CCI) and real GDP growth in the USA from 1960 to 2015 in order to find whether the CCI can be a suitable predictor of the economic growth, or economic recessions respectively. Also the short-term dynamics of four periods covering US economic recessions (1967-1978, 1975-1985, 1995-2005, and 2005-2015) was examined. The main results are that the CCI Granger causes GDP in the long-run, with the lag of 6 months. As for shorter periods, the CCI Granger caused GDP in three out of four examined periods, including the Great Recession ( with the lag of 3 months), and only for the so called dot-com bubble period Granger causality was reversed, with GDP causing the CCI with the lag of 6 months. These results indicate that the CCI can be considered a suitable predictor of GDP at least for the USA, but more complex and broader study, including other major economics such as the European Union, Germany, or Japan, is certainly needed.","[Mazurek, Jiri; Mielcova, Elena] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Math & Informat, Opava, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Mazurek, J (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Math & Informat, Opava, Czech Republic.",mazurek@opf.slu.cz; mielcova@opf.slu.cz,"Mazurek, Jiri/Z-1303-2019","Mazurek, Jiri/0000-0002-7965-0457; Mielcova, Elena/0000-0002-4675-740X","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","This paper was supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports within the Institutional Support for Long-term Development of a Research Organization in 2016.",,24,9,11,0,16,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

This paper lays out multidisciplinary foundations for the formal theoretical and practical treatment of the interaction between marketing, entrepreneurship and profitability in an organization. The focus of this research is on a company's success as a function of organizational changes and the level of acceptable risk, measured by its profitability. The contribution to the literature on the relationship between entrepreneurship and marketing is reflected in a new approach that relies on the multi-scale (i.e., frequency-dependent) approach or the so-called spiral of success. In addition, this paper highlights the necessity for dynamic abilities and innovative character in an organization. More broadly, it explains an important theoretical paradox that organizations always face high risk, but, in order to survive in business, they need to enter new cycles of entrepreneurial activities (innovation and diversification) that involve even more risk. The novelty of this study lies in its application of the causality tests in the frequency domain for the bivariate system in order to demonstrate the marketing-entrepreneurship paradox. This is, to the authors' best knowledge, the first paper that uses such a methodology in marketing and entrepreneurship. The paper's principal hypothesis is tested on a well-diversified company (Amazon.com) where it is shown that marketing drives changes in net income at both medium and long horizons, but not vice-versa. The findings and related discussions can be useful to academics and practitioners, as well as to public policy-makers.","[Nikolic, Slavka T.; Gradojevic, Nikola; Dakovic, Vladimir; Stankovic, Jelena] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Tech Sci, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Novi Sad, Serbia; [Gradojevic, Nikola] Univ Guelph, Dept Econ & Finance, Coll Business & Econ, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Mladenovic, Valentina] Polytehn Sch New Technol, Nipomo, CA USA",University of Novi Sad; University of Guelph,"Nikolic, ST (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Fac Tech Sci, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Novi Sad, Serbia.",snikolic@uns.ac.rs; ngradoje@uoguelph.ca; v_djakovic@uns.ac.rs; v.mladenovic@uns.ac.rs; stankovicj@uns.ac.rs,"Djakovic, Vladimir/GZL-0620-2022","Djakovic, Vladimir/0000-0002-3282-2899; Gradojevic, Nikola/0000-0003-4001-3159",,,,,47,1,3,2,20,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The unprecedented growth of mutual trade is based on one of the basic principles of economics built on the recognition that international trade realised on the principle of absolute and comparative advantages increases the economic prosperity of national economies because the gains of the winners exceed the losses of the losers. The condition for the application of the above-mentioned principle is the existence of a common market on which obstacles to the free movement of goods, services, people and capital are removed. The refugee crisis in Europe, Brexit and the growth of protectionism in the USA have raised issues connected with the threats that may damage significantly the mutual cross-border cooperation. When analyzing the pros and cons of international cooperation economists often use two tools: the consumer surplus and producer surplus. This paper is an assessment of how the above-mentioned threats, which renew barriers to international trade, can affect the growth or decline in consumer surplus and producer surplus.","[Novy, Milos] Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Univ 22, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Novy, M (通讯作者)，Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Univ 22, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic.",novym@kem.zcu.cz,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,4,VERLAG GUC-GESELLSCHAFT UNTERNEHMENSRECHNUNG CONTROLLING M B H,LOBNITZ,"STEINWEG 32, LOBNITZ, D-08294, GERMANY",,,978-3-86367-051-1,GUC FACHB,,,2017,33.0,,,,,,109,115,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6KP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426794300012,0

The following research methods are used: the systemic, logical and comparative analysis of literature, the analysis of statistical data. The study covers 1990-2014. The results of this study show that economic integration of CEECs increased during the research period. However, such economies as Croatia, Poland and Romania remain relatively close and more dependent on domestic demand than the other CEECs. This means that these countries may be less vulnerable to external shocks but more sensitive to internal policy shocks. The CIS countries are still important trade partners of CEECs. High export and import share of CEECs to (from) the EU shows high regional but low global economic integration of CEECs. The research results show that the major trade partners of most CEECs are Germany and Russia. Therefore, changes in the economic environment of these countries should be observed very carefully in order to mitigate the effect of external shocks that could spread to the CEECs through the real channel.","[Sineviciene, Lina] Kaunas Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Business, Dept Finance, Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Sineviciene, L (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Business, Dept Finance, Kaunas, Lithuania.",lina.sineviciene@ktu.lt,"Sineviciene, Lina/M-7562-2018",,Research Council of Lithuania [MIP-016/2015],Research Council of Lithuania(Research Council of Lithuania (LMTLT)),This research was funded by a grant (No. MIP-016/2015) from the Research Council of Lithuania.,,14,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-54112-9; 978-3-319-54111-2,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,7.0,,,,,,281,295,,10.1007/978-3-319-54112-9_18,0.0,,,15,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ4CE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424822700018,0

According to the Ministry of Commerce data show that in recent years, Chinese rapid growth in cross-border electronic commerce development is a new growth point in the import and export trades. With the development of economy, great progress has been made in cross-border electronic commerce in China. And our country is in the The Belt and Road period, which is the important strategic opportunity period. Cross-border electronic commerce industry should seize this rare opportunity, and grasp the state policy. It will become larger, and then turn into the important strategic industry in various regions. But the scale of cross-border electronic commerce development has been limited due to a number of reasons. One of the biggest and most difficult problems is the logistics, information flow and capital flow cannot be unified in a timely manner. The establishment of the service platform system of cross-border electronic commerce, which is based on the Internet of things, cloud computing, big data and some other modern information technologies, is the key to solve this difficult problem. As the key to maintain the rapid growth of cross-border electronic commerce, the service platform system has three aspects of the service platform system. These three different platforms which are built at different levels control the different aspects and assume different functions in the process of foreign trade transactions. These three platforms are closely connected with each other.","[Wang, Yuqing] Harbin Univ commerce, Accounting Inst, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Lu, Xiaojun] Harbin Univ commerce, Management Expt Ctr, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China",Harbin University of Commerce; Harbin University of Commerce,"Wang, YQ (通讯作者)，Harbin Univ commerce, Accounting Inst, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",1536941605@qq.com; lxjharbin@126.com,"Lu, Xiaojun/F-2924-2014; Wang, yuqing/HIR-1604-2022",,,,,,12,0,0,1,11,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-369-2,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,31.0,,,,,,46,49,,,,,,4,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK1KF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431849100011,0

In particular, we have analyzed how the modal split will change with certain toll rates, whether rail transport can benefit from the increased burden on its intermodal competitor, or whether the car is the biggest beneficiary instead. In addition, we also examined other relevant aspects, such as the revenue development in the national intercity bus market. Our simulations show that the introduction of distance-related road tolls in intercity bus transport (if they are completely shifted to customers in the form of surcharges) will result in significant changes: Thus, at a toll rate of 0.6 ct/passenger kilometer the modal share of intercity buses (by passenger kilometers) in the German long-distance passenger transport sector will drop by about 12 percent to 2.44 percent in the year 2025. At 0.4 ct/passenger kilometer, the share drops by almost three percent.

Here, we lay out a two-region, two-social class model for thinking about this issue, and we exploit its implications to propose a novel account of the present-day divide between North and South of Italy. To illustrate, we document that it also arose because of the region-specific policies selected between 1861 and 1911 by the elite of the Kingdom of Sardinia, which unified Italy in 1861. While pre-unitary revenues from land property taxes and railway diffusion were shaped by each region's farming productivity but not by its political relevance for the Piedmontese elite, the opposite was true for the post-unitary ones. Moreover, tax distortions and the severity of all the other extractive policies are related to the growing post-unitary divide in culture and literacy, but not to the gap in the manufacturing industry value added. These two sets of results imply that extraction has neither eased the formation of a unitary market nor favored industrialization. Reassuringly, we reach similar conclusions when we consider region fixed effects and time dummies whether interacted or not with the structural conditions differentiating the two blocks of regions in 1861, i.e., inclusiveness of political institutions, land ownership fragmentation, and inputs. Crucially, our framework sheds light on the incentives of other groups dominating political and economic unions, e.g., Germany within the post-crisis EU. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This study adds to this literature by empirically analyzing the extent to which municipal transportation apportionments in Massachusetts put marginalized groups at a disadvantage. An analysis of seven-year data of 351 municipalities in Massachusetts receiving reimbursable grants through the Massachusetts Department of Transportation's Chapter 90 program show that municipalities with a higher percentage of non-white individuals received less apportionment through the program. While these disparities exist for African-American, Asian, and Hispanic populations, they are found to be incidental, not deliberate. Lagged effects show that Massachusetts is investing in municipalities with higher percentage of marginalized individuals to reduce this historic resource gap.

By looking at the practices and experiences of both gardeners and non-gardeners, processes of inclusion and exclusion are unravelled in terms of ownership and membership of the community garden. In so doing, exclusionary barriers based on non-ownership and non-membership are pinpointed in particular.","[Spierings, Bas; Van Liempt, Ilse] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Dept Human Geog & Spatial Planning, POB 80115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Maliepaard, Emiel] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Nijmegen Sch Management, Dept Geog Planning & Environm, POB 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands",Utrecht University; Radboud University Nijmegen,"Spierings, B (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Dept Human Geog & Spatial Planning, POB 80115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",B.Spierings@uu.nl; I.C.vanLiempt@uu.nl; E.Maliepaard1@gmail.com,"van Liempt, Ilse/AAJ-3375-2020","van Liempt, Ilse/0000-0002-4978-3101",Faculty of Geosciences at Utrecht University,Faculty of Geosciences at Utrecht University,"This paper draws on fieldwork done by Femke Kok and Benno van der Wilk for their Master thesis in Urban Geography.

Moreover, these concerns have prompted the need to develop alternatives to hydrocarbon fuels, leading to the expectation that fuel cell vehicle numbers will similarly increase. However, the variable and intermittent output of RE generators significantly affects the capability for electricity networks to balance supply and demand, although this may be addressed through energy storage and demand-side response (DSR) technologies. One potential DSR technique that can be implemented at industrial scale is water electrolysis, which is used for hydrogen production. When electrolyser operation is modulated, for example, to respond to the variable output of wind and solar power sources, it can be exploited as a dispatchable demand load. Naturally, this would need to be incentivized by electricity tariff structures that reflect the dynamics of RE availability. This paper aims to compare the economics of continuous and dispatchable electrolyser operation for producing affordable hydrogen at garage forecourts in Libya, while ensuring no interruption in the fuel supply to vehicles. Using the coastal city of Derna as a case study, with renewable energy generated by a wind farm, a suitable turbine specification and the number of turbines needed to meet demand was determined through an analysis of wind speeds. The constantly varying difference between RE power supply and electricity demand on the grinded the surplus power at any given time. Using a linear programming algorithm to optimize the hydrogen cost, based on the current price of electricity, this study examines a hydrogen refuelling station in both dispatchable and continuous operation. As the capital cost is already known, the optimisation focuses on the variable cost in order to reduce the price of hydrogen, which means using the cheaper of two electricity tariffs. Three scenarios were considered to evaluate whether the cost of electrolytic hydrogen could be reduced through using lower-cost off-peak electricity supplies: 1- Standard Continuous, in which the electrolyser operates continuously on a standard tariff of $16/kWh. 2- Off-peak Only, in which the electrolyser operates only during off-peak periods at the lower price of $7 /kWh. 3- 2-Tier Continuous, in which the electrolyser operates continuously on a low tariff at off-peak times and a high tariff at other times. The results indicate that Scenario 2 produced the cheapest electricity at $3.89 per kg of hydrogen, followed by Scenario 3 at $5.10 per kg, and the most expensive was Scenario 1 at $9.26 per kg.","[Rahil, Abdulla; Gammon, Rupert; Brown, Neil] De Montfort Univ, Inst Energy & Sustainable Dev, Queens Bldg, Leicester LE1 9BH, Leics, England",De Montfort University,"Rahil, A (通讯作者)，De Montfort Univ, Inst Energy & Sustainable Dev, Queens Bldg, Leicester LE1 9BH, Leics, England.",p13063959@my365.dmu.ac.uk; rgammon@dmu.ac.uk; NBrown@dmu.ac.uk,,,,,,,69,4,4,0,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

Studies in Chinese cities show that danwei or type of work unit is an important institutional factor in explaining jobs-housing relationship and commuting behavior. We argue that, hukou or household registration (another institutional factor), may also explain the mobility and travel behavior of Chinese urbanites. Unlike population registration systems in many other countries, hukou, one of the most important institutional arrangements in contemporary China, determines an individual's entitlement to state provided benefits and opportunities and plays a crucial role in defining access to housing, jobs, car ownership/usage, education, etc., which has far reaching implications for mobility and travel behavior. Using data collected from Beijing, we use structural equations modeling method to empirically test our hypothesis about the importance of hukou in explaining car ownership, travel time and transport mode choice for daily trips. Results show that hukou status has a significant impact on mobility and travel behavior of individuals. Specifically, local urban residents are found to have better home-work proximity and higher car ownership rate, travel more by non-motorized modes and spend less time on daily travel. This study provides insights into the complex relationships among hukou, built environment, mobility and travel behavior in urban China. The research findings can be used to assist planners and policy-makers in developing effective strategies to promote sustainable urban development.","[Yao, Mingzhu; Wang, Donggen] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Geog, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Baptist University,"Wang, DG (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Geog, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",14486148@hkbu.edu.hk; dgwang@hkbu.edu.hk,,,"GRF grants from the Hong Kong Research Grant Council [HKBU247813, HKBU12606215]",GRF grants from the Hong Kong Research Grant Council,This research is sponsored by two GRF grants from the Hong Kong Research Grant Council (HKBU247813 and HKBU12606215).,,64,21,23,2,78,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Most CF models assumed driver propensity for constant, safe distance is axiomatic. This paper challenges the idea of safety distance as the main parameter defining a unique (or natural) NDB. Instead, it states drivers can adapt to reactive and proactive car following. Drawing on recent CF models close to the Nagoya paradigm and on other phenomena (e.g., wave movement in Nature), we conceived car following by Driving to keep Inertia (DI) as an alternative to Driving to keep Distance (DD). On a driving simulator, three studies (N = 113) based on a repeated-measures experimental design explored the efficiency of these elementary techniques by measuring individual driver performance (e.g., accelerations, decelerations, average speed, distance to leader). Drivers easily grasped and applied either technique and easily switched back and forth between the two. As an overall indicator, all the studies revealed DI trips use about 20% less fuel than DD trips do.","[Blanch Mico, Ma Teresa; Lucas Alba, Antonio; Belles Rivera, Teresa; Ferruz Gracia, Ana Ma] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Ciencias Sociales & Humans, Zaragoza, Spain; [Melchor Galan, Oscar M.] Impactware, Madrid, Spain; [Delgado Pastor, Luis C.] Univ Granada, Fac Psicol, Granada, Spain; [Ruiz Jimenez, Ruiz JimenezFrancisco] Fdn Univ Konrad Lorenz, Dept Psicol, Bogota, Colombia; [Choliz Montanes, Choliz MontanesMariano] Univ Valencia, Dept Psicol Basica, Valencia, Spain",University of Zaragoza; University of Granada; University of Valencia,"Micó, MTB (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Fac Ciencias Sociales & Humans, Zaragoza, Spain.",blanchmi@unizar.es,"Ruiz, Francisco J./AAO-7124-2020; Lucas-Alba, Antonio/F-8793-2018; Blanch Micó, María Teresa/AIC-8256-2022","Ruiz, Francisco J./0000-0001-8863-1111; Lucas-Alba, Antonio/0000-0002-6596-2978;","Fundacion Universitaria Antonio Gargallo y Obra Social Ibercaja, Spain [2015/B011]","Fundacion Universitaria Antonio Gargallo y Obra Social Ibercaja, Spain","We thank the referee for comments that greatly raised the paper's quality, M.

Employing secondary data and document analysis, the paper analyses three national drug strategies and the annual reports of 21 local and regional Drug and Alcohol Task Forces (DATFs), in order to determine the prominence of drug education workers within the statutory response to illicit drug use in Irish society. Drug education has been on the Irish Government agenda since the 1970s; however, drug education continues to remain a small field in Ireland, underfunded and without any national representative voice. This paper argues that drug education in Ireland is becoming subsumed into the formal education sector and positioned primarily within the remit of teachers of Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE). Drug education workers who provide educational programmes in non-formal education settings are unacknowledged in Ireland's most recent national drug strategy and this poses a risk to education programmes that take place in non-formal settings, and diminishes the role of youth and community services/organisations in abating illicit drug use at local and community levels.","[Darcy, Clay] Crosscare Bray Youth Serv, Bray, Ireland",,"Darcy, C (通讯作者)，Crosscare Bray Youth Serv, Bray, Ireland.",claydarcy@gmail.com,"Darcy, Clay/AAG-2089-2020; Pimentel, Priscilla/AAG-6402-2019","Darcy, Clay/0000-0002-3672-4401;",Local Drug and Alcohol Task Force,Local Drug and Alcohol Task Force,"The author of this article is currently employed as a Drug Education Worker, whose post is funded by a Local Drug and Alcohol Task Force.

One of the reforms decreased the average duration of insolvency procedures by increasing the appeal of private workouts as an alternative to formal bankruptcy. Two of the reforms increased the percentage of reorganisations by increasing the quality of insolvency administrators and reducing the costs of financial distress. The impact was larger in firms with lower liquidation values and higher going concern values, suggesting an increase in ex-post efficiency. By contrast, two of the reforms did not achieve their goals and failed to have any robust impact on those dimensions. Our research illustrates the important role that insolvency administrators may play in the design of an efficient bankruptcy system, as well as the need for a legal framework that supports out-of-court workouts as an alternative to formal bankruptcies. More generally, our results highlight the importance of evaluating bankruptcy reforms before assessing their impact on other dimensions such as credit, firm financing and investment.

This article undertakes an unprecedented theoretical study of the object' test in comparison with U.S. antitrust law. It re-conceptualizes object' analysis as a form of preliminary enquiry that serves a similar classificatory function as a U.S. quick look' analysis, namely to distinguish naked restrictions from non-naked ones in order to determine whether summary condemnation or an effect-based analysis is called for. This normative theory rests on the important conceptual distinction between proximate and ultimate objects, and a detailed comparison of the methods of antitrust analysis under E.U. and U.S. law. The article constructs a quick look' framework for object' analysis that combines both theoretical and comparative insights, and applies this framework to critically analyze joint venture restrictions, regulatory restrictions, vertical restrictions, and industry restructuring arrangements.","[Kwok, Kelvin Hiu Fai] Asian Inst Int Financial Law, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Kwok, Kelvin Hiu Fai] Univ Hong Kong, Law, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong,"Kwok, KHF (通讯作者)，Asian Inst Int Financial Law, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Kwok, KHF (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Law, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",,"Kwok, Hiu Fai/G-5208-2012","Kwok, Kelvin Hiu Fai/0000-0002-4817-5622",,,,,27,2,2,0,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

As this may involve important cost trade-offs, this paper analyses bus rapid transit (BRT) and conventional bus procurement in competitive environments through the lens of transaction cost economics. A survey of bus operator managers was performed to measure transaction cost of bus operating firms. Our results show that while asset specificity is significantly higher for BRT compared to conventional bus operations, the level of asset specificity is overall much lower than anticipated. In particular it is human and brand asset specificity (intangible assets) more than physical asset specificity (i.e. buses) that is reported as a source of transaction cost by management. We find that government bus procurement and/or contract pre-specification related to bus procurement may improve economies of scale in service triads but does not aid to overcome hold-up contract problems and transaction costs which are common in incomplete contracts involving uncertainty and relationship-specific investments. In that sense, while the government intervention in bus procurement may be well intended it could in practice do more harm than good to the industry and the wider public.","[Merkert, Rico; Mulley, Corinne; Hakim, Md Mahbubul] Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Inst Transport & Logist Studios, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Merkert, R (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Inst Transport & Logist Studios, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",rico.merkert@sydney.edu.au; corinne.mulley@sydney.edu.au; mahbubul.hakim@sydney.edu.au,"Mulley, Corinne/ACN-0179-2022","Merkert, Rico/0000-0001-9939-7199; Hakim, Dr Md Mahbubul/0000-0002-8079-3607; Mulley, Corinne/0000-0001-6411-1269","TfNSW through the Chair in Public Transport at ITLS, Sydney; Bus Industry Confederation; Bus & Coach Association NSW; Bus and Coach Association South Australia; Bus Association Victoria; Across Latitudes and Cultures Bus Rapid Transit (ALC-BRT) Centre of Excellence for Bus Rapid Transit development - Volvo Research and Educational Foundations (VREF)","TfNSW through the Chair in Public Transport at ITLS, Sydney; Bus Industry Confederation; Bus & Coach Association NSW; Bus and Coach Association South Australia; Bus Association Victoria; Across Latitudes and Cultures Bus Rapid Transit (ALC-BRT) Centre of Excellence for Bus Rapid Transit development - Volvo Research and Educational Foundations (VREF)","The authors would like to thank the many managers from the analysed bus operating firms for providing the data and investing their time to support this research.

Few studies have addressed the impacts of this uncertainty and the main objectives of this article are to quantify major market uncertainties in the Norwegian forest sector and analyse their impacts on the results of a forest sector model study for Norway. The uncertainties are derived from historical time series of the prices and exchange rates for international forest products, and their possible impacts are addressed by applying a Monte Carlo approach. A probabilistic approach in modelling is found to have significant impacts on harvest and forest industry production levels. When uncertainty is included, the relative standard deviation for modelled harvest levels varies from 15% to 45%, while for forest products the standard deviations vary from 30% to 80%. We conclude that the most important uncertainty factor for the Norwegian forest sector is the development of international forest product markets, and improved data on demand should be given high priority in future forest sector modelling development.","[Jastad, Eirik Ogner; Mustapha, Walid Fayez; Bolkesjo, Torjus Folsland; Tromborg, Erik; Solberg, Birger] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm Sci & Nat Resource Management, POB 5003, NO-1432 As, Norway",Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Jåstad, EO (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm Sci & Nat Resource Management, POB 5003, NO-1432 As, Norway.",eirik.jastad@nmbu.no; walid.mustapha@nmbu.no; torius.bolkesio@nmbu.no; erik.tromborg@nmbu.no; birger.solberg@nmbu.no,,"Jastad, Eirik Ogner/0000-0002-1089-0284","Norwegian Research Council [NFR-186946, NFR-255265]; Norwegian Centre for Sustainable Bio-based Fuels and Energy [NRF-257622]",Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway); Norwegian Centre for Sustainable Bio-based Fuels and Energy,"Funding for this study was provided by the Norwegian Research Council through 'SUPOENER: The future role of biomass energy in Norway - an interdisciplinary technological, economical and environmental research program' [NFR-186946],' BioNEXT - The role of bioenergy in the future energy system' [NFR-255265], and the 'Norwegian Centre for Sustainable Bio-based Fuels and Energy' [NRF-257622].

Drawing on data from journey to work and Australia's Green Vehicle Guide, we estimated household transport costs associated with private vehicle fuel use for work travel. By linking household transport costs with housing costs across urban areas we were able to explore: 1) the spatial relationship between household transport fuel costs and direct spending on housing; and 2) areas of households under the highest pressure from transport costs and housing costs. We then estimated how rising fuel prices in Brisbane were likely to affect household housing location. We consider the trends of transport and housing costs and how they might affect urban spatial structure in the future.","[Li, Tiebei; Dodson, Jago] RMIT Univ, Global Urban & Social Studies, Level 4,Bldg 15,124 La Trobe St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Sipe, Neil] Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); University of Queensland,"Li, TB (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Global Urban & Social Studies, Level 4,Bldg 15,124 La Trobe St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",tiebei.li@rmit.edu.au; jago.dodson@rmit.edu.au; n.sipe@uq.edu.au,,"Dodson, Jago/0000-0003-4756-4287",,,,,35,19,20,0,17,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

The consumer can now deploy conservation technologies, and state regulators have begun to modify the form of regulation employed policies that enable conservation and energy efficiency choices on the consumers' part.

Estimation results reveal that the location of capital intensive sectors (such as chemicals, cotton, metalmaking and paper) was driven by domestic market potential and literacy.

Finally, we compute four pricing schedules: uniform price with and without subsidy and two-part tariffs with and without subsidy. Our results show that: (i) the industry exhibits economies of scale when considering both demand-oriented and supply-oriented output measures; (ii) measures of technical efficiency are consistent with the observed exit of firms from the market; (iii) the budget-balanced fare without subsidy is higher than the actual fare, suggesting that subsidies are justified; (iv) the budget-balanced fare with subsidy is higher than the actual fare, suggesting that subsidies are insufficient; (v) two-part tariffs either with or without subsidy are the most effective means of increasing bus travel demand and user welfare; and (vi) a menu of tickets with two options (a uniform price and a two-part tariff) is a Pareto-improving pricing schedule that balances the budget and increases bus travel demand.","[Batarce, Marco] Univ Diego Portales, Ind Engn Sch, Santiago, Chile; [Galilea, Patricia] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Transport Engn & Logist, Santiago, Chile",University Diego Portales; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Batarce, M (通讯作者)，Univ Diego Portales, Ind Engn Sch, Santiago, Chile.",marco.batarce@udp.cl; pga@ing.puc.cl,"Galilea, Patricia/F-8309-2013","Galilea, Patricia/0000-0002-9699-3611; Batarce, Marco/0000-0003-4813-3585","Across Latitudes and Cultures Bus Rapid Transit Centre of Excellence; Volvo Research and Educational Foundations (VREF); CONICYT/FONDECYT Project [3140327]; Centre for Sustainable Urban Development, CEDEUS [CONICYT/FONDAP-15110020]","Across Latitudes and Cultures Bus Rapid Transit Centre of Excellence; Volvo Research and Educational Foundations (VREF); CONICYT/FONDECYT Project(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); Centre for Sustainable Urban Development, CEDEUS","This research was supported by the Across Latitudes and Cultures Bus Rapid Transit Centre of Excellence, funded by the Volvo Research and Educational Foundations (VREF), CONICYT/FONDECYT Project No 3140327, and the Centre for Sustainable Urban Development, CEDEUS (CONICYT/FONDAP-15110020).

We study the difference between carsharing services offering a one-way (free-floating) service utilizing 2-seaters (Car2go) to a two-way service utilizing a range of vehicles (Modo). By analyzing 3,405 survey responses from carsharing users in Vancouver, we found that users of both Car2go and Modo reported reduced vehicle ownership after joining a carsharing service. However, households differ both in how many cars they owned before they joined carsharing services, and how their membership was associated with further change in car ownership. The average Vancouver household owns 1.56 vehicles. According to this survey's respondents, households joining Car2go report average car ownership rates of 1.08 prior to joining up and 0.98 afterwards. Households joining Modo reduced their ownership from an average of 0.68 to 0.36 vehicles. Furthermore, Modo members were close to five times more likely to reduce car ownership compared to Car2go users. We also found that the two services are used differently. Car2go members are more likely to use the service as a complement to all modes of transportation. Modo members are more likely to use access to carsharing as a substitute for private car ownership. Analysis of expressed preferences in response to termination of access to carsharing indicates that carsharing services have been substituting mobility services previously supplied by private vehicles. The intention to gain a vehicle under the service termination was strongest among users who had both Car2go and Modo memberships. These findings show the two services are not rivals but complements providing different mobility services.","[Namazu, Michiko; Dowlatabadi, Hadi] Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Namazu, M (通讯作者)，Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, 2202 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",michiko.namazu@alumni.ubc.ca,,,"Metro Vancouver; Takenaka Scholarship Foundation from Japan; Carnegie Mellon's Climate and Energy Decision Making Center (CEDM) under US National Science Foundation [SES 1463492]; Canada Research Chairs; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1463492] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Metro Vancouver; Takenaka Scholarship Foundation from Japan; Carnegie Mellon's Climate and Energy Decision Making Center (CEDM) under US National Science Foundation; Canada Research Chairs(Canada Research ChairsCGIAR); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We would like to acknowledge support from Metro Vancouver for this study.

Yet informal activities, such as day labouring, generate highly uncertain returns. Although it seems reasonable to conclude that day labourers would be dissatisfied with their lives, this is not necessarily the case as several factors contribute to people's subjective well-being. Aim: This study is in response to a call for more research on the subjective well-being of marginalised groups in South Africa's informal labour market. Setting: The day labour market in South Africa, whose members congregate at hiring sites hoping to be picked up by passers-by in need of temporary, casual workers. Methods: Using Sen's Capability Approach, the study builds on earlier research conducted on the general well-being of day labourers in South Africa, with specific focus on their subjective well-being and geographical location. The results from a countrywide survey of 3830 day labourers were used in a regression analysis to compare the subjective well-being among day labourers across the nine provinces of South Africa. Results: There are statistically significant differences in the well-being of day labourers across the nine provinces. Economic variables play a role in both objective and subjective measures of well-being, while attitudinal and comparison variables are significant for the objective and subjective measures, respectively. Conclusions: Although they have to operate in harsh conditions, day labourers in South Africa display agency by choosing to migrate to richer provinces in search of greater economic opportunity and reward. However, these potential gains are often negated by increased levels of competition and thus depressed wage levels. How to nurture marginalised groups' abilities to exercise agency and take more control of their lives represents fertile ground for researchers in future.","[Blaauw, Phillip F.] North West Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Fac Econ & Management Sci, Potchefstroom, South Africa; [Botha, Ilse] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Accountancy, Coll Business & Econ, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Schenck, Catherina] Univ Western Cape, Dept Social Work, Fac Community & Hlth Sci, Bellville, South Africa",North West University - South Africa; University of Johannesburg; University of the Western Cape,"Blaauw, PF (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Fac Econ & Management Sci, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",derick.blaauw@nwu.ac.za,"Schenck, Catherina J/O-9605-2014","Botha, Ilse/0000-0003-3168-1454; Blaauw, Derick/0000-0001-8750-4946",National Research Foundation (NRF),National Research Foundation (NRF),The authors want to acknowledge the valuable comments and suggestions received from Prof. John Luiz as well as the anonymous referees of the journal.

Operating much like raises, such events have the potential to alter intra-household power dynamics. Using Australian panel data, we estimate couple-specific fixed effects models and find that female promotion has the strongest association with housework time allocation adjustments. These adjustments are in part attributable to concurrent changes in paid work time, but gender power relations also appear to play a role. Further results indicate that households holding more liberal gender role attitudes are more likely to adjust their housework time allocations after female promotion events. Power dynamics cannot, however, explain all the results. Supporting the sociological theory that partners may do gender, we find that in households with more traditional gender role attitudes, his housework time falls while hers rises when he is terminated.","[Foster, Gigi] Univ New South Wales, Dept Econ, Kensington, NSW 2052, Australia; [Stratton, Leslie S.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Econ, 301 W Main St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Stratton, Leslie S.] IZA, 301 W Main St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Stratton, Leslie S.] LCC, 301 W Main St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA",University of New South Wales Sydney; Virginia Commonwealth University,"Stratton, LS (通讯作者)，Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Econ, 301 W Main St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.;Stratton, LS (通讯作者)，IZA, 301 W Main St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.;Stratton, LS (通讯作者)，LCC, 301 W Main St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",gigi.foster@unsw.edu.au; lsstratt@vcu.edu,"Foster, Gigi/D-5297-2019","Foster, Gigi/0000-0002-1588-0202",Australian Government Department of Social Services (DSS),Australian Government Department of Social Services (DSS)(Australian Government),"This paper uses unit record data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey.

In the original setup, a news article is assumed to address policy uncertainty if it contains certain predefined keywords. We argue that the original setup is prone to measurement error, and propose an alternative methodology using text mining techniques. We compare the original method to modality annotation and support vector machines (SVM) classification in order to create an EPU index for Belgium. Validation on an out-of-sample test set speaks in favour of using an SVM classification model for constructing a news-based policy uncertainty indicator. The indicators are then used to forecast 10 macroeconomic and financial variables. The original method of measuring EPU does not have predictive power for any of these 10 variables. The SVM indicator has a higher predictive power and, notably, changes in the level of policy uncertainty during tumultuous periods of high uncertainty and risk can predict changes in the sovereign bond yield and spread, the credit default swap spread, and consumer confidence.

This rapid growth of elderly populations may lead to serious transport issues when their mobility is compromised by the unavailability of public transport services. Public transport concession fare schemes are commonly implemented in many cities to encourage the elderly's participation in social activities. However, these policies emphasize the role of money (i.e., travel fares) in determining willingness to travel. Other possible factors, such as walking distance to and from stops and stations, wait times for public transport services, and seat availability, have not been considered by transport operators and policy makers. In this study, we interviewed 613 elderly Hong Kong residents aged 60 or above regarding their travel decisions using designated modes of public transport to attend social activities in four hypothetical games. A total of 2452 observations were collected for model development. Binary logistic regression models were calibrated to determine which factors significantly influenced the elderly's travel decisions. Based on the model results, this paper suggests policy measures to strengthen public transport planning in Hong Kong with the goal of improving elderly mobility. The findings provide policy insights that can also be applied to other metropolitan cities with similar traffic conditions.","[Wong, R. C. P.; Szeto, W. Y.; Yang, Linchuan; Li, Y. C.; Wong, S.

Long-term forecasts for hourly electricity demands from 2006 to 2023 are done with in-sample forecasts from 2006 to 2012 and out-of-sample forecasts from 2013 to 2023. Quantile regression (QR) is used to forecast hourly electricity demand at various percentiles. Three contributions of this study are (1) that QR is used to generate long-term forecasts of the full distribution per hour of electricity demand in South Africa; (2) variabilities in the forecasts are evaluated and uncertainties around the forecasts can be assessed as the full demand distribution is forecasted and (3) probabilities of exceedance can be calculated, such as the probability of future peak demand exceeding certain levels of demand. A case study, in which forecasted electricity demands over the long-term horizon were developed using South African electricity demand data, is discussed. Aim: The aim of the study was: (1) to apply a quantile regression (QR) model to forecast hourly distribution of electricity demand in South Africa; (2) to investigate variabilities in the forecasts and evaluate uncertainties around point forecasts and (3) to determine whether the future peak electricity demands are likely to increase or decrease. Setting: The study explored the probabilistic forecasting of electricity demand in South Africa. Methods: The future hourly electricity demands were forecasted at 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, ... , 0.99 quantiles of the distribution using QR, hence each hour of the day would have 99 forecasted future hourly demands, instead of forecasting just a single overall hourly demand as in the case of OLS. Results: The findings are that the future distributions of hourly demands and peak daily demands would be more likely to shift towards lower demands over the years until 2023 and that QR gives accurate long-term point forecasts with the peak demands well forecasted. Conclusion: QR gives forecasts at all percentiles of the distribution, allowing the potential variabilities in the forecasts to be evaluated by comparing the 50th percentile forecasts with the forecasts at other percentiles. Additional planning information, such as expected pattern shifts and probable peak values, could also be obtained from the forecasts produced by the QR model, while such information would not easily be obtained from other forecasting approaches. The forecasted electricity demand distribution closely matched the actual demand distribution between 2012 and 2015. Therefore, the forecasted demand distribution is expected to continue representing the actual demand distribution until 2023. Using a QR approach to obtain long-term forecasts of hourly load profile patterns is, therefore, recommended.","[Mokilane, Paul; Debba, Provesh; Koen, Renee; Sibiya, Siphamandla] CSIR, Pretoria, South Africa; [Mokilane, Paul; Galpin, Jacky; Debba, Provesh] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Stat & Actuarial Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Yadavalli, V.

J,"Cerri, L",,,,"Cerri, Luigi",,,Birth of the Modern Corporation: From Servant of the State to Semi-Sovereign Power,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PENNSYLVANIA; PERSONALITY; PROPERTY; RIGHTS,"It is widely known that large business corporations have accumulated enormous political and economic power since the early 20(th) century. They not only create barriers to entry to small firms in the economic domain, they also pose a serious threat to democracy by dominating public discourse and occupying a wide range of public spaces. Efforts to halt or reverse the growth of corporate power have been largely ineffective, in large part because they have been entirely reactive. In order for citizens to reclaim the economy and politics, a new strategy is necessary, one that starts by analyzing the source of corporate power. The method of analysis in this article is historical, specifically the history of changes in the United States of the legal instruments of incorporation and their relationship to emerging conditions in the economy and business. In the first half of the 19(th) century, corporations were chartered by state governments to carry out public benefit activities, particularly infrastructure projects. These mixed corporations lost favor during the depression of the 1840s and were replaced by private for-profit corporations that continued using the same debt financing instruments employed by states. They were also still regulated by the states that issued their charters. When corporations sought to avoid competition by creating cartels, they had difficulty maintaining discipline and discovered they needed new rights in order to gain permanent control of markets. In the 1890s, they were granted the status of natural persons, with the legal protections of citizens, but they also gained the right to buy other corporations, thereby solidifying their market power and making them largely autonomous from public control. Each transition was contested, but when it was completed, it seemed to the public as if corporations had always had their new powers. In order to regain the power to hold corporations accountable to the public, those old contested issues need to be brought back into public discourse, so that citizens might decide for themselves how much power corporations should have.","[Cerri, Luigi] Canopee, Paris, France",,"Cerri, L (通讯作者)，Canopee, Paris, France.",cerriluigi@gmail.com,,,,,,,39,2,2,1,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

The result is robust to controlling for patent and court characteristics but also for an important feature of NPE cases, a lack of product market interaction with the potential infringers.

Yet, a critical step of the legislative process-floor amendments-has been almost entirely ignored in the most prominent theories of legislative decision making. In this paper, we fill this gap by developing a theoretical treatment of agenda setting at the amendment stage. Specifically, our theoretical approach defines the relationship between agenda setting at the amendment stage and outcomes at final passage. We test several implications using data from the US House of Representatives, and show that amendments do mitigate some of the majority party's agenda setting advantage by moderating initial proposals away from the majority party position. However, amendments do not systematically undermine the majority party's negative agenda control, as we find that amendment rolls do not increase the incidence of final passage rolls for the majority party.","[Magleby, Daniel B.; Robinson, Gregory] SUNY Binghamton, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA; [Monroe, Nathan W.] Univ Calif Merced, Merced, CA 95340 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton; University of California System; University of California Merced,"Monroe, NW (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Merced, Merced, CA 95340 USA.",nmonroe2@ucmerced.edu,,,,,,,36,5,5,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

Even homeowners who are arguably well informed tend to overestimate the value of their house. Multivariate regression analyses suggest that this overestimation is positively related to the mortgage loan-to-value ratio and the tenure of the owner-occupier. Moreover, homeowners tend to overestimate the value of the house when the actual value falls below the purchase price of the house.

In a laboratory experiment we examine the effects of a summary review whether a challenge is evidently unfounded, with or without fines.

In light of the tendency of Iraq to adopt international accounting standards, especially since Iraqi banks began in 2016 to apply them, the objective of this research is to identify the extent of the application of the International Financial Reporting Standard for SMEs in the Iraq environment. It also aims to establish the implications of their implementation for the Iraqi economy, especially in attracting foreign investments. The research reached a number of conclusions. The main conclusion indicates that the elements of the transition to the standards of financial reporting for small and medium companies in the Iraqi environment are still incomplete in terms of the availability of the appropriate political environment. The legislative and economic environments are also insufficiently developed for the initiation of this transformation. The main recommendation of the research points out the need for radical reforms at various political, legal, economic and regulatory levels in order to create the appropriate atmosphere required by the process of transition to the standard of financial reporting of small and medium enterprises.","[Alaraji, Fedaa Abd Almajid Sabbar] Craiova Univ, Presidency Univ, AlMustansiriyah Univ, Fac Econ & Adm,Dept Control & Internal Audit, Craiova, Romania; [Aljuhishi, Bakr Ibrahim Mahmood] AlMustansiriyah Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Baghdad, Iraq; [Alalawi, Talib Ghadhban Yaseen] Presidency Univ, Univ AlMustansiriya, Dept Control & Internal Audit, Baghdad, Iraq",University of Craiova,"Alaraji, FAS (通讯作者)，Craiova Univ, Presidency Univ, AlMustansiriyah Univ, Fac Econ & Adm,Dept Control & Internal Audit, Craiova, Romania.",fdaasabbar@yahoo.com; bakerabrahim@yahoo.com; alalwytalib@gmail.com,,"alaraji, fedaa/0000-0003-3055-2685",,,,,6,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,1512,1523,,,,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553202055,0

The research carried out within the project made an evaluation of the productions and of the areas cultivated with seed lots in Romania during 2007-2017. The results of the research have shown a significant increase in average yields per hectare for all categories of certified seeds, the increase in the areas allocated for soybeans, peas and sunflower amid the reduction of those for certified wheat and rape seed. The lack of efficient irrigation systems on the background of climate change leads to the quantitative and qualitative variability of national agricultural seed production.

The study is based on a sample of IPO firms that went public on the Warsaw Stock Exchange during the period from 1998 to 2011. We find that a firm's performance before going public is perceived by investors as an indicator of future performance and it affects IPO valuation. Specifically, our results indicate that high profitability achieved before IPO allows to obtain a high issue price to book value per share ratio. However, our results indicate that the relation between valuation during issuance and profitability gets weaker and ultimately completely disappears after IPO. As a result, 2 years after issuance there are no differences between firms' performance no matter how high they were valued during IPO. Investors willing to pay a higher price for IPO shares do not achieve extra benefits both in terms of accounting and market rates of return.","[Brycz, Bogumila; Dudycz, Tadeusz; Kowalski, Michal J.] Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Science & Technology,"Dudycz, T (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Wroclaw, Poland.",bogumila.brycz@pwr.edu.pl; tadeusz.dudycz@pwr.edu.pl; michal.kowalski@pwr.edu.pl,,,,,,,42,0,0,2,11,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-68285-3; 978-3-319-68284-6,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,25,37,,10.1007/978-3-319-68285-3_3,0.0,,,13,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1XS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448589400003,0

Eventually it enables the user to carry out financial, investment, sensitivity, risk, scenario and what-if analyses according to requirements. It opens possibilities for changes in design or plan in order to optimize given venture in terms of economic results. The introduction contains some critical views of contemporary state in given field, i.e. in evaluation and feasibility assessment of such capital intensive and time demanding ventures. In the next, it is dealing with mathematical formulation of the problem underlying new method and its computer realization. Finally, it presents practical application of the technique to an existing underground mine and mineral processing plant. The task was to make assessment of viability of a proposed mining venture on a selected part of deposit called Silver Vein. The study was to provide overall evaluation of the proposed venture, regarding many engineering aspects with eventually investment and financial analysis, risk and what-if analysis in defined cases, which were presented. The results show viability and optimistic outlook for this mining venture, certainly, at given declared conditions. Additionally, the study has encouraged for future research. The intention is to try to search for a balanced, although less profitable, but more socially oriented subvention-aided mining venture with mine expansion beyond limits of the selected parts of deposit and thereby to prolong the life of mine and to back employment in given region. Future applications being considered is to use the system at planning of highways and motorways within reconstruction of transport infrastructure, being pursued at the present time in Slovakia.","[Cech, Jozef; Sofranko, Marian] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Min Ecol Proc Control & Geotechnol, Dept Montaneous Sci, Kosice, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Cech, J (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Min Ecol Proc Control & Geotechnol, Dept Montaneous Sci, Kosice, Slovakia.",jozef.cech@tuke.sk; Marian.Sofranko@tuke.sk,"Sofranko, Marian/B-6931-2016","Sofranko, Marian/0000-0002-1626-0144",,,,,23,9,9,1,8,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The key to the reduction of global CO2 emissions lies in whether major CO2 emitters can meet established reduction goals. This paper reviews the histories of China, the United States, and India in terms of their respective CO2 emission pathways, reflects on the motivations and mechanisms behind these changes, and predicts whether these three major CO2 emitters can control their coal consumption and promote reduction of global CO2 emissions. We conclude that China is decreasing its coal consumption, India is experiencing irreversible, increase of coal consumption, and the use of coal in the U.S. will depend largely on the energy and climate policies of the Trump administration. To achieve the goal of reduction of global CO2 emissions, the international community should not only increase its scrutiny of coal consumption and CO2 emissions in India but also emphasise the role of international cooperation, which is the only solution to tackling the reduction of CO2 emissions and limiting anthropogenic climate change as economic systems continue to globalise.","[Chen, Jiandong; Cheng, Shulei] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Finance & Taxat, 555 Liutai Ave, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Nikic, Vinko] Adriat Univ Bar, Fac Mediterranean Business Studies, Tivat, Montenegro; [Song, Malin] Anhui Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat & Appl Math, 962 Caoshan Rd, Bengbu 233030, Anhui, Peoples R China",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Anhui University of Finance & Economics,"Song, ML (通讯作者)，Anhui Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat & Appl Math, 962 Caoshan Rd, Bengbu 233030, Anhui, Peoples R China.",jchen@swufe.edu.cn; chengslxs@163.com; nikicv@t-com.me; songmartin@126.com,"chen, jiandong/AAM-3236-2020; Cheng, Shulei/HPD-5106-2023","Cheng, Shulei/0000-0002-8045-4429","Programme for Major Projects in Philosophy and Social Science Research of the Ministry of Education of China [14JZD031]; Key Program of National Social Science Fund of China [15AJY005]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473203, 71171001, 71471001]; New Century Excellent Talents in University [NCET-12-0595]; Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of Southwestern University of Finance and Economics","Programme for Major Projects in Philosophy and Social Science Research of the Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Key Program of National Social Science Fund of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); New Century Excellent Talents in University(Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET)); Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of Southwestern University of Finance and Economics","This work was supported by the Programme for Major Projects in Philosophy and Social Science Research of the Ministry of Education of China (Grant no. 14JZD031), the Key Program of National Social Science Fund of China (Grant no. 15AJY005), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant nos. 71473203, 71171001, and 71471001), the New Century Excellent Talents in University (Grant no.

Taking advantage of a unique opportunity due to the recent establishment and expansion of the New Rural Pension Scheme in China, we explicitly address the endogeneity of pension status and pension income through a fixed-effect model with instrumental variable approach by exploiting exogenous time variation in the program implementation at county level. We find an overall positive effect of pension income on independent living as well as considerable heterogeneity. The positive income effects of the NRPS are concentrated among the elderly with adult children living nearby, of higher socio-economic status, and with better health at baseline; for other groups, the effects are insignificant. We also find that more generous programs exhibit larger effects. Our results highlight that living arrangement is multidimensional in rural China.","[Cheng, Lingguo; Zhang, Ye] Nanjing Univ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Liu, Hong] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Zhong] Renmin Univ China, Beijing, Peoples R China",Nanjing University; Central University of Finance & Economics; Renmin University of China,"Liu, H (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",chenglingguo@gmail.com; liuhong@cufe.edu.cn; zhangye@nju.edu.cn; mr.zhong.zhao@gmail.com,"zhang, ye/F-7972-2019","Zhao, Zhong/0000-0003-3587-400X","NIH [R01-AG023627]; United Nations Fund for Population Activities; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71110107025, 71173227, 71673313, 71233001]; National Social Science Fund of China [13CJY028]; Training Program for Major Fundamental Research of Central University of Finance and Economics [14ZZD001]",NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); United Nations Fund for Population Activities; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Fund of China; Training Program for Major Fundamental Research of Central University of Finance and Economics,"The collection of the data used in this study was supported by NIH R01 grant (R01-AG023627) and the United Nations Fund for Population Activities.

The linkage of human capital with the other factors of production used in the economy, the computerized society, the technical, quality and efficiency of the production of goods and services has become an undeniable truth in the modern world. It follows that no sustainable growth and development strategy would become effective if the importance of human capital were to be minimized or ignored. Regarding these considerations, we aimed to accomplish this approach, to carry out a theoretical and methodological analysis that addresses the main obstacles in evaluating and accounting for human capital.

There are 25 active clusters in Slovakia, where more than 40% of clusters' members are small and medium enterprises. Despite this fact, the level of awareness about benefits of cluster cooperation is still low. This paper presents the results of realized questionnaire surveys, which were focused on findings of how small and medium entrepreneurs perceive the benefits of engaging in cluster cooperation. In this context the paper is focused on assessment of selected reasons that motivate small and medium entrepreneurs to cluster cooperation. Generally speaking, SMEs involved in cluster cooperation are able to enhance the regional competitiveness, contribute to networking and collaboration, provide innovation, maintain the driving power of society within the industry, and increase collective performance.","[Haviernikova, Katarina] Alexander Dubcek Univ Trencin, Fac Social & Econ Relat, Dept Econ & Econ, Studentska 2, Trencin 91150, Slovakia; [Kordos, Marcel] Alexander Dubcek Univ Trencin, Fac Social & Econ Relat, Dept Publ Adm & Reg Econ, Studentska 2, Trencin 91150, Slovakia; [Navickas, Valentinas] Kaunas Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Business, K Donelaicio Str 20, LT-44239 Kaunas, Lithuania",Alexander Dubcek University Trencin; Alexander Dubcek University Trencin; Kaunas University of Technology,"Haviernikova, K (通讯作者)，Alexander Dubcek Univ Trencin, Fac Social & Econ Relat, Dept Econ & Econ, Studentska 2, Trencin 91150, Slovakia.",katarina.haviernikova@tnuni.sk; marcel.kordos@tnuni.sk; valentinas.navickas@ktu.lt,"Havierniková, Katarína/P-1414-2019; Kordoš, Marcel/P-4568-2018; Navickas, Valentinas/GPX-0310-2022; Navickas, Valentinas/AAC-9651-2019; Navickas, Valentinas/I-9119-2018","Havierniková, Katarína/0000-0002-9019-8684; Kordoš, Marcel/0000-0002-1833-7096; Navickas, Valentinas/0000-0002-7210-4410; Navickas, Valentinas/0000-0002-7210-4410;",Slovak Ministry of Education's Scientific grant agency VEGA: The evaluation of clusters' impact measurement on regional development of the Slovak Republic [1/0953/16],Slovak Ministry of Education's Scientific grant agency VEGA: The evaluation of clusters' impact measurement on regional development of the Slovak Republic,This research was financially supported by the Slovak Ministry of Education's Scientific grant agency VEGA: The evaluation of clusters' impact measurement on regional development of the Slovak Republic.

Descriptive statistics was used for data processing; the relationship between two categorical variables was verified by the chi-quadrate test and Tukey's HSD test. The results of the research proved the hypotheses; i.e. that there are significant differences in motivation factors among Slovak employees related to their gender and education. The most significant motivation factors included basic salary, job security and a good working team. The paper presents an original verifiable methodology that can be used in research of a similar focus in other European countries.

In the post-truth era, fake news contributes to the verification of operations undertaken by organisations. The analysis is aimed at the identification of relations between media organisation myths and the fake news crisis on the example of Facebook and Google. Facing the fake news crisis, new media organisations have become involved into detection and elimination of fake information with the use of enhanced algorithms which select content and manage visibility of users. New media organisations have also appealed to their users (and to other media institutions) for help in the identification of fake news.Such an intervention in the social discourse means assuming responsibility for distribution of content and also self-destruction of a myth related to omnipotence and to the neutral character of an organisation which is supposed to act only as an intermediary connecting people and providing best answers to their questions. Such an explicit correction is followed by another one: a change in the social interpretation of Facebook and Google which cease to be viewed as neutral technological organisations, and they become media organisations which are burdened with responsibility to verify content presented to their users.","[Kreft, Jan; Fydrych, Mariana] Jagiellonian Univ, Krakow, Poland",Jagiellonian University,"Kreft, J (通讯作者)，Jagiellonian Univ, Krakow, Poland.",jankreft@uj.edu.pl; mariana.fydrych@gmail.com,,,,,,,30,1,1,0,5,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,1986,1995,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553203006,0

As a result, cross-border acquisition and merging activities have increased dramatically over the recent decades. Because of the fall of the iron curtain and the proceeds of European integration, mainly the European single market has created new possibilities. Moreover, one of the main results of globalization is a greater role of emerging markets in the global economy, especially in the area of foreign direct investment. The paper therefore analyses announced and completed cross border acquisitions between a public listed acquirer and target companies from Central and Eastern Europe and associated reactions of the capital markets. The analysis focuses, in particular, on cross-border Russia versus Germany deals. Examining the sample of 11,085 announced deals over the period from January 1990 through December 2014, the analysis points out some important trends in the global economy in the area of companies acquisition and merging activities. In summary, it can be emphasized that Central and Eastern Europe as the region is very attractive from the market's perspective due to the expected growth rates and the framework conditions as well as from the perspective of Western European investors. Analysis results indicate that Russian market is better in the area of cross-border acquisitions than remaining Central and Eastern European markets. It allows us to suggest that it is worthier investing in Russia than in remaining Central and Eastern Europe.","[Langenstein, Tim] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Kosice, Slovakia; [Vojtkova, Anna; Ruepp, Andreas] Berlin Inst Finance Innovat & Digitalizat, Berlin, Germany; [Uzik, Martin] Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Berlin Inst Finance Innovat & Digitalizat, Berlin, Germany",Technical University Kosice; Berlin School of Economics & Law,"Langenstein, T (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Kosice, Slovakia.",tim.langenstein@ebootis.de; anna.vojtkova@bifid.sk; martin.uzik@hwr-berlin.de; andreas.ruepp@bifid.org,"Uzik, Martin/Q-2851-2016",,,,,,83,1,1,1,10,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

We aim to verify how the risks of the health status change are shaped over age and what the impact of gender and education is. The empirical analysis makes use of a multi-state model for transitions in health. The age-specific health transition probabilities accounting for the individual level variables are estimated based on the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EUSILC) panel data for the years 2008-2011. As a result, we assess age profiles for health transitions with respect to gender and education. The results confirm the well-known regularities in research on health: the risk of being unhealthy is increasing with age, while the probability of recovery is decreasing.

It is called the intrinsic rate of return (IROR). It is defined as the ratio of project return to project's intrinsic value. The IROR approach decomposes the NPV into project scale and economic efficiency. In particular, NPV is found as the product of the project's total invested capital and the excess rate of return, obtained as the difference between the IROR and the minimum attractive rate of return (MARR). This approach provides correct project ranking and is capable of managing time-varying costs of capital. In case of levered projects, shareholder value creation is captured by the equity IROR, which we call Intrinsic Return On Equity (IROE) (net income divided by total equity capital invested). If the project is unlevered, the IROE and the IROR lead to the same decision; if the project is levered, and the nominal value of debt is not equal to the market value of debt, the IROE should be preferred to project IROR.","[Magni, Carlo Alberto] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Econ Marco Biagi, Modena, MO, Italy; [Marchioni, Andrea] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Fdn Biagi, Modena, MO, Italy; [Magni, Carlo Alberto; Marchioni, Andrea] Sch Doctorate E4E Engn Econ Econ Engn, Modena, Italy",Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia; Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia,"Magni, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Modena, MO, Italy.",magni@unimo.it,"Magni, Carlo Alberto/G-3356-2016; Marchioni, Andrea/AAF-2957-2020","Marchioni, Andrea/0000-0002-5193-7691",,,,,21,1,1,0,1,UNIV MINHO,GUIMARAES,"CAMPUS AZUREM, GUIMARAES, 4800-058, PORTUGAL",2183-3974,,978-989-97050-8-1,ICOPEV INT C PROJ EC,,,2018,,,,,,,225,230,,,,,,6,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BN0TO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000473533800038,0

Amid the fast development of science and the growing amount of available knowledge, it is essential that organizations transform individual knowledge into organizational knowledge. Knowledge management is the process of creating, sharing, using and managing the knowledge and information stock of an organization. Moreover, knowledge management is a determining factor for successful entrepreneurial activity. It is equally important for educational institutions to adapt to the new digital society we are living in and to find ways to deliver and disseminate information. The behaviour of the young generation is completely different from their parents', so the teachers' attitude must be different from their earlier attitudes.

Methods of system and comparative analyses, trend extrapolation and dynamic pattern, methods of risk assessment, used in the study, made it possible to make a conclusion, that to provide with proper quality it is necessary to use all possible sources of information in reference to each other. The following main restrictions in the procedures of management decision-making were revealed: craving for standardization of management situations without regard to environment change; ignoring of tools of psychological theory of decisions; decision-making on the basis of incomplete or incorrect information, unreasonably high assessment of significance of certain sources and craving for handling information of certain source - the attempts of transition to linear relationship and linear thinking. Researches of management problems also confirm some typical mistakes (conventional formats) and think that strategic creativity as symbiosis of analysis and free stream of ideas is required for success. Focused specialization in big companies can lead to segregation of subdivisions and reduces system specifications of information assurance and thereby, quality of management decisions. One of the tools of improvement of quality of information assurance of management processes is controlling.

Incumbents mainly reinforce a region's current specialization: incumbent's growth, decline, and industry switching further align them with the rest of the local economy. The unrelated diversification required for structural change mostly originates via new establishments, especially via those with nonlocal roots. Interestingly, although entrepreneurs often introduce novel activities to a local economy, when they do so, their ventures have higher failure rates compared to new subsidiaries of existing firms.

Due to this detailed structure, if the application offers more or no solutions, the decision maker can analyze the previous steps to determine which solution is best suited to the organization or whether there are robot models that partially satisfy the required conditions.","[Patic, Paul Ciprian] Valahia Univ Targoviste, Targoviste, Romania; [Zemouri, Ryad] Conservatoire Natl Arts & Metiers, Paris, France",Valahia University of Targoviste; heSam Universite; Conservatoire National Arts & Metiers (CNAM),"Patic, PC (通讯作者)，Valahia Univ Targoviste, Targoviste, Romania.",patic@valahia.ro; ryadzemouri@cnam.fr,,"Zemouri, Ryad/0000-0002-3283-9391",,,,,10,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,1996,2003,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553203007,0

Accounting standards which are most widely applied are International Financial Reporting Standards and US Generally Accepted Accounting Standards. Those two sets of standards converge since 2002 when Norwalk agreement between the IASB and the FASB has been signed. Those standard setters acknowledged their commitment to develop high quality and comparable accounting standards that could be used both for domestic and cross border financial reporting. As a result of this co-operation, a new common revenue standard was issued. This standard should increase the comparability of financial statements for companies operating in the same industry and also for the companies applying different accounting standards - US GAAPs and IFRSs. The International Accounting Standards Board follows rigorous open due standard setting process which includes the publication of all relevant documents in standard setting process on its website. The public is invited to take part in standard setting process by sending comment letters on documents published on the IASB's official website. Prior to issuing a new standard, the IASB issued Exposure draft and different interest groups sent comment letters to the IASB to point the potential shortcomings in a standard and potential problems in its practical implementation. This paper analyses the procedure of issuing a new standard on revenues (IFRS 15 - Revenues from Contracts with Customers). The purpose of this paper was to identify the most important interest groups that influenced the content of IFRS 15 by sending comment letters on proposed exposure drafts. In order to make relevant conclusions, all publicly available documents related to comment letters received from public on initial and revised exposure draft have been analysed. The research has shown that the most comment letters on new revenue standard has been received from the preparers of financial statements and from accounting professionals, namely accountants, auditors, accounting firms and organizations. We noticed that non-accounting organizations and associations at the national and international levels are also interested in the content and application of new accounting standard on revenues. Regulators at national and international level and national standard setters were also involved in due standard setter process. The smallest number of comment letters was received from academics and financial statement users.","[Pavic, Ivana; Zager, Lajos; Mamic Sacer, Ivana] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Pavic, I (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia.",ipavic@efzg.hr; lzager@efzg.hr; imamic@efzg.hr,"Pavic, Ivana/H-7941-2018","Pavic, Ivana/0000-0002-1597-3652",University of Zagreb,University of Zagreb,This paper is result of a project entitled Influence of changes in accounting principles for revenues' measurement on evaluation of companies' business performance which was financed by the University of Zagreb as short-term research support for 2018.,,16,0,0,0,9,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,908,921,,,,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553201036,0

Using a monthly panel data set (from 2014 to 2016) covering the Brazilian municipalities and a difference-in-differences estimator, we show that Uber's entry into the market resulted in an average reduction of 56.8 percent in the number of rides from cab-hailing apps in the cities where the platform operates. The magnitude of this effect suggests that Uber has had a clearly disruptive effect on the incumbent sector. We also found significant spatial heterogeneity in the competition effects of the platform when comparing the markets of the capitals of the North and Northeast regions (where Uber entered late) with the capitals of the South, Southeast, and Central West regions (where Uber entered early). Only in the second group of municipalities, we found that Uber's entry caused a reduction in taxi fares (reduction of 12.1 percent). This indicates that the cab-hailing app sector reacted to Uber's entry by offering discounts in fares after a longer period of exposure to a competitive environment.","[Resende, Guilherme Mendes] Brazilian Adm Council Econ Def, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Resende, Guilherme Mendes] Brasilia Inst Publ Law, Inst Brasiliense Direito Publico, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [de Andrade Lima, Ricardo Carvalho] Brazilian Fed Publ Minist, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [de Andrade Lima, Ricardo Carvalho] Univ Catolica Brasilia, Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Universidade Catolica de Brasilia,"Resende, GM (通讯作者)，Brazilian Adm Council Econ Def, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.;Resende, GM (通讯作者)，Brasilia Inst Publ Law, Inst Brasiliense Direito Publico, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",guilherme.resende@cade.gov.br; ricardoclima@mpf.mp.br,"de Andrade Lima, Ricardo Carvalho/AAC-4294-2019; Resende, Guilherme Mendes/K-5821-2012; Lima, Ricardo/P-7423-2018","de Andrade Lima, Ricardo Carvalho/0000-0003-3239-2371; Mendes Resende, Guilherme/0000-0002-7138-5492",,,,,28,2,2,1,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

In contrast, I argue that while the private turn might have led to a decline in democratic or public accountability, it did not bring an end to all forms of accountability. Specifically, I suggest that philanthropists' involvement in global health has led to the spread of another, new form of accountability: epidemiological accountability. The latter is a combination of two regimes of expertise and practices hitherto kept separate: audit and epidemiology.

Focusing on Cournot duopoly where membership decision may be delegated to a manager, several equilibrium regimes are sustained depending on the fixed cost of managerial hiring and strength of the network externality exerted by the side whose demand is more price sensitive. The change from null to full delegation sharpens the asymmetric pricing structure and reduces the price level in two-sided markets. Contrary to one-sided markets with direct network effects, the prisoner's dilemma holds for sufficiently strong indirect network externalities. Imperfect interside discrimination of managerial incentives ensures profit maximization and efficient consumers' allocation. Private hiring should occur when the two-sided market exhibits symmetric pricing structure. An explanation for Apple's unprecedented event is provided. The reduction of revenue and managerial bonus in 2016 may be justified by the dissemination of full delegation in the Chinese information technology industry. Apple's upcoming strategy may consist on reducing both access prices, although the side whose demand is more price sensitive should have a greater price reduction. Alternatively, improving the content quality may constitute Apple's corporate strategy, thereby inducing a skimming pricing strategy on Chinese rivals.","[Ribeiro, Vitor Miguel] Autoridade Nacl Comunicacoes, Ave Jose Malhoa 12, P-1099017 Lisbon, Portugal",,"Ribeiro, VM (通讯作者)，Autoridade Nacl Comunicacoes, Ave Jose Malhoa 12, P-1099017 Lisbon, Portugal.",vmsrib@hotmail.com,"Ribeiro, Vitor Miguel/HNC-2682-2023; Ribeiro, Vitor Miguel/AAL-9245-2021","Ribeiro, Vitor Miguel/0000-0002-7223-9841; Ribeiro, Vitor Miguel/0000-0002-7223-9841",,,,,20,3,3,3,20,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,CHICHESTER,"THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0143-6570,1099-1468,,MANAG DECIS ECON,Manag.

This article sheds light on their social engagement outside the formal education system by exploring sports and cultural participation among the children of immigrants. Participating in sport, fitness and cultural pursuits provides children and young people with opportunities for enjoyment and social interaction and may ultimately strengthen community cohesion. In addition, cultural participation outside school has been found to enhance engagement and academic progress within school. The findings show that, at nine years of age, immigrant-origin children are less likely to take part in organised sports or structured cultural activities (such as music or dance classes) than their Irish peers. The participation gap is greater for those from non-English-speaking backgrounds and those whose families are from Eastern Europe, Africa or Asia. The gap between immigrant and Irish children's leisure participation reduces over time, although involvement at nine has a notable influence on participation at 13 and involvement among Asian young people remains lower than among other groups. Lower self-reported popularity levels among immigrant-origin 13-year-olds are largely explained by lower levels of involvement in organised sports. The findings therefore have implications for ensuring the inclusion of immigrant children in out-of-school activities and for their integration more generally.","[Darmody, Merike; Smyth, Emer] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland; [Darmody, Merike; Smyth, Emer] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin,"Darmody, M (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland.;Darmody, M (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",Merike.Darmody@esri.ie,"Smyth, Emer/AAE-6450-2019",,Government of Ireland through the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA); Central Statistics Office (CSO); Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP),Government of Ireland through the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA); Central Statistics Office (CSO); Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP),"The Growing Up in Ireland study has been funded by the Government of Ireland through the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) in association with the Central Statistics Office (CSO) and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP).

We use a random parameter logit model and a latent class logit model to assess the marginal willingness to pay for environmental protection. The main results are as follows. First, we show that respondents clearly exhibit heterogeneous preferences regarding the biodiversity conservation policy. Therefore, a conditional logit model, which assumes the same parameters for all respondents, overestimates the marginal willingness to pay for biodiversity conservation. Second, using the random parameter logit model, we show that the marginal willingness to pay for a 1% improvement in forest conservation is 196 yen; 2,357 yen for farmland conservation; 85 yen for natural parks protection; 1,113 yen for wetland conservation; and 132 yen for endangered species protection. Third, using the latent class logit model, we identified 14 categories of respondents and showed that the utility parameters are significantly different across classes. Therefore, we expect a high probability of conflict in the implementation of biodiversity conservation policies due to substantial differences in the preferences of agents.

The analysis is implemented using data from the stock indices of several developed and emerging stock markets. The empirical findings favour the time-varying market model approaches, which outperform linear model specifications both in terms of model fit and predictability.

Automatic delivery stations represent a solution to reduce mislaid deliveries and consolidate parcels drop-off, minimizing the kilometers travelled, and the costs of urban goods distribution. In order to better understand online shoppers' attitudes towards new delivery services, we analyze the potential demand of automatic delivery stations (lockers) in the city of Belo Horizonte, Brazil. For this purpose, we develop a survey according to stated preference and revealed preference methods, and we assess potential users considering two deliveries services: home delivery and automated delivery stations. The results indicate that, although home delivery is the preferred option, automatic delivery stations score high potential demand for online shoppers. This paper provides an approach to integrate the impact of final consumers' preferences on shaping last-mile operations, and it thus helps policymakers to identify the most suitable innovations to specific urban settings.

Several contributing factors have previously been identified through literature, including regulatory compliance, skills shortages and lack of government support. Globally, there has been an increased interest in smart cities and the variety of services they offer. These technologies were investigated to establish what role, if any, they could play in alleviating the challenges that small businesses face. Aim: Identify the relative impact of each of these challenges on the small-business and the relative value of each of the smart city services in order to determine which services would have the largest impact in addressing the challenges. Method: This research used these factors and identified which challenges had the largest time and financial impact on small businesses and investigated ways in which a variety of smart city services could be leveraged to address these challenges. Using a multi-criteria decision analysis technique, 44 small-business owners participated in the research. Weighted results for the impact of each of the challenges and the value of each of the services were obtained. Results: Through the subsequent analysis of the results, it was found that small businesses face many challenges because of lack of government and entrepreneurial support, as well as widespread corruption. Similarly, the small-business owners identified that educational material, small-business support portals and eGovernment systems would be the most valuable services that a smart city could offer them. Various sources of literature were used to identify these smart city services and link them to the business challenges that they may be able to mitigate. The infrastructural prerequisites for each of the services were also investigated to identify dependencies and potential problems in their deployment. Conclusion: The various aspects of this study were integrated, and a smart city roadmap for small-business support was subsequently developed. This roadmap will assist cities in planning their smart city deployment, so that they may better support small businesses in the role that they play in the country's economy.","[du Plessis, Haydn; Marnewick, Annlize L.] Univ Johannesburg, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Postgrad Sch Engn Management, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Johannesburg,"Marnewick, AL (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Postgrad Sch Engn Management, Johannesburg, South Africa.",amarnewick@uj.ac.za,,"du Plessis, Haydn/0000-0002-5954-6732",,,,,59,6,8,0,33,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

It shows that the degree of bargaining interacts with the extent of product differentiation in determining whether the sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium is sales delegation or profit maximisation. In contrast with the classical result, no sales delegation emerges and the typical prisoner's dilemma of the managerial delegation literature is solved. This holds in both contexts of Cournot and Bertrand rivalries. The article also provides results for the more general cases with heterogeneous managerial bargaining power and endogenous decisions of the owners regarding the bargaining power of the manager that should be or not be hired in a firm.

Hence evaluating the accuracy of a forecast is important for both the generators and consumers of forecasts. There are two aspects in forecast evaluation: (a) measuring the accuracy of past forecasts using some summary statistics, and (b) testing the optimality properties of the forecasts through some diagnostic tests. On measuring the accuracy of a past forecast, this paper illustrates that the summary statistics used should match the loss function that was used to generate the forecast. If there is strong evidence that an asymmetric loss function has been used in the generation of a forecast, then a summary statistic that corresponds to that asymmetric loss function should be used in assessing the accuracy of the forecast instead of the popular root mean square error or mean absolute error. On testing the optimality of the forecasts, it is demonstrated how the quantile regressions set in the prediction-realization framework of Mincer and Zarnowitz (in J. Mincer (Ed.), Economic Forecasts and Expectations: Analysis of Forecasting Behavior and Performance (pp.14-20), 1969) can be used to recover the unknown parameter that controls the potentially asymmetric loss function used in generating the past forecasts. Finally, the prediction-realization framework is applied to the Federal Reserve's economic growth forecast and forecast sharing in a PC manufacturing supply chain. It is found that the Federal Reserve values overprediction approximately 1.5 times more costly than underprediction. It is also found that the PC manufacturer weighs positive forecast errors (under forecasts) about four times as costly as negative forecast errors (over forecasts).","[Guler, Kemal] Anadolu Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Econ, Eskisehir, Turkey; [Ng, Pin T.] No Arizona Univ, Franke Coll Business, Flagstaff, AZ USA; [Ng, Pin T.] Anhui Univ, Sch Econ, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Zhijie] Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA; [Xiao, Zhijie] Shandong Univ, Ctr Econ Res, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China",Anadolu University; Northern Arizona University; Anhui University; Boston College; Shandong University,"Xiao, ZJ (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.",xiaoz@bc.edu,"Guler, Kemal/GZL-8657-2022","Guler, Kemal/0000-0003-2175-3477",TUBITAK [BIDEP 2236]; TUBITAK; Boston College; NSFC [71571110],TUBITAK(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)); TUBITAK(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)); Boston College; NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We thank the Editor and two referees for their very helpful comments on earlier versions of this paper.

Attitudes to immigrants in Ireland became more negative as unemployment rose, but once we account for this, a higher proportion of immigrants was associated with more positive attitudes. Highly educated respondents (with third-level qualifications) report more favourable attitudes to immigrants than those with lower education. The attitudes of those with lower education were more responsive to economic conditions, meaning the gap in attitudes between high and low educated widened in recession.","[McGinnity, Frances] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland; [McGinnity, Frances; Kingston, Gillian] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin,"Kingston, G (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",gillkingston@gmail.com,,,Integration Centre,Integration Centre,"This paper grew from a special theme of the Annual Monitoring Report on Integration 2012 with colleagues Philip O'Connell and Emma Quinn, funded by the Integration Centre.

One key policy involves reducing the amount of revenue lost as a result of the 'cash economy', but before this is possible they first need to have some idea of its size. This study provides evidence of the importance of the cash economy across the EU and suggests that changes in house prices, when the Euro was formed in 1999 can be used as a basis to measure its magnitude. These results build on the theoretical model on how individuals who wished to hide their domestic cash from the authorities when the European single currency was formed in 1999, would have needed to acquire a physical asset, most likely property. This implies changes in property prices between the announcement of the Euro and its implementation reflect the level of wealth being hidden in this way and therefore the extent of the cash economy.","[Cullis, John; Morley, Bruce] Univ Bath, Econ Dept, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England",University of Bath,"Morley, B (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Econ Dept, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",bm232@bath.ac.uk,,"Morley, Bruce/0000-0002-7115-2840",,,,,35,1,1,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

A little-known rule in the German traffic penalty schedule maintains that drivers who commit a series of speeding offenses within 365 days should have their licenses suspended for 1 month. My regression discontinuity design exploits the quasi-random assignment of license suspensions caused by the 365-day cutoff and shows that 1-month license suspensions lower the probability of recidivating within a year by 20 percent. This is largely a specific-deterrence effect driven by the punishment itself and not by incapacitation, information asymmetries, or the threat of stiffer future penalties.","[Gehrsitz, Markus] Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of Strathclyde,"Gehrsitz, M (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",,,,City University of New York,City University of New York,I acknowledge support by the City University of New York Doctoral Student Research Grant program.,,32,10,14,2,16,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

Therefore, sentiment indicators reflecting expectations have a proven track record at predicting economic variables. However, survey respondents largely perceive the world through media reports. Here, we want to make use of that. We employ a rich dataset provided by Media Tenor International, based on sentiment analysis of opinion-leading media in Germany from 2001 to 2014, transformed into several monthly indices. German industrial production is predicted in a real-time out-of-sample forecasting experiment and media indices are compared to a huge set of alternative indicators. Media data turn out to be valuable for 10- to 12-month horizon forecasts, which is in line with the lag between monetary policy announcements and their effect on industrial production.

I argue that the deprivation of engaging in affective relations in public space is an instance of affective inequality, and that the relation between the private and the public space in small cities is a fundamental factor in the constitution of this inequality.

In this article we use a global production network (GPN) approach to examine the evolutionary dynamics of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) sector and its role in an emerging global market for natural gas. We extend recent work in the relational economic geography literature on the organizational practices by which production networks are assembled and sustained over time and space; and we address a significantly underdeveloped aspect of GPN research by demonstrating the implications of these practices for the territoriality of GPNs. The article introduces LNG as a techno-material reconfiguration of natural gas that enables it to be moved and sold beyond the continental limits of pipelines. We briefly outline the evolving scale and geographic scope of LNG trade, and introduce the network of firms, extraeconomic actors, and intermediaries through which LNG production, distribution, and marketing are coordinated. Our analysis shows how LNG is evolving from a relatively simple floating pipeline model of point-to-point, binational flows orchestrated by producing and consuming companies and governed by long-term contracts, to a more geographic and organizationally complex production network that is constitutive of an emergent global gas market. Empirically the article provides the first systematic analysis within economic geography of the globalization of the LNG sector and its influence on global gas markets, demonstrating the potential of GPN (and related frameworks) to contribute meaningful analysis of the contemporary political economy of energy. Conceptually the article pushes research on GPN to realize more fully its potential as an analysis of network territoriality by examining how the spatial configuration of GPNs emerges from the organizational structures and coordinating strategies of firms, extraeconomic actors and intermediaries; and by recognizing how network territoriality is constitutive of markets rather than merely responsive to them.","[Bridge, Gavin] Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Bradshaw, Michael] Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",Durham University; University of Warwick,"Bridge, G (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham DH1 3LE, England.",g.j.bridge@durham.ac.uk; Michael.Bradshaw@wbs.ac.uk,"Bradshaw, Michael/AAL-3664-2021","Bradshaw, Michael/0000-0001-8842-3953",NERC's UKERC [RP 1390198]; EPSRC [EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: UKRI; ESRC [ES/H001174/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H001174/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: researchfish,NERC's UKERC; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"We thank Jim Watson and Paul Ekins for welcoming us to the UKERC fold.

Whereas some states allow the sale of beer, wine and hard liquor at grocery stores and other retail establishments, others restrict the sale of one or more of the beverage categories to liquor stores. In recent years, several states across the country have considered loosening existing restrictions. This paper examines the impact of retail restrictions on retail sector structure and employment using panel data from the fifty US states and the District of Columbia from 2001 to 2013. Our results suggest that restricting hard liquor and wine sales to liquor stores has no impact on employment, number of establishments or total wages in the liquor store sector. However, restricting the sale of hard liquor, wine and beer to liquor stores has a positive effect on employment, wages, and number of establishments in the liquor store sector. Results in the grocery store sector are sensitive to specification, however, there is no strong evidence that retail restrictions have a corresponding negative effect on the grocery and convenience store sectors. These results contribute to the ongoing policy debates regarding the liberalization of state alcohol retail laws by empirically testing a number of the hypotheses put forth by proponents and opponents of the liberalization debate.

It also highlights several policies that the FCC has undertaken purportedly to reduce the divide, including the 2015 Open Internet Order (OIO)-in which the stated intent is to enforce network neutrality. However, long before the OIO, studies have raised concerns that network neutrality policies will discourage investment by internet service providers (ISPs) in broadband infrastructure, to the detriment of broadband accessibility, and may increase average consumer costs-both of which would only further exacerbate the digital divide. In this paper, we provide a holistic analysis of the effects of net neutrality on the digital divide; in doing so, we draw from recent economic research on this issue. Our goal is to present a range of economic considerations that should be taken into account when evaluating the overall impact of the OIO, with particular attention to its impact on the digital divide.","[Connolly, Michelle; Lee, Clement; Tan, Renhao] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Social Sci 213, Box 90097, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University,"Connolly, M (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Social Sci 213, Box 90097, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",mconnoll@duke.edu,,"Connolly, Michelle/0000-0003-0191-1159",,,,,42,8,10,1,39,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

This alternative economic case for IP notably relies on the argument that allowing the copyright on certain massively popular works to expire could lead to their overexploitation, generating negative externalities similar to congestion externalities. This article will assess in detail the plausibility of this effect, by reviewing its most plausible interpretations: a boredom effect, a blurring or tarnishment effect, a snob effect, or a decrease in product diversity. I will argue that while Landes and Posner's argument is ultimately inconclusive and unverified by the current state of empirical research, it also raises greater challenges than has usually been thought. Moreover, taking their argument seriously can also contribute to a better understanding of the purposes and limits of an intellectual property regime.","[Lambrecht, Maxime] Catholic Univ Louvain, Hoover Chair Econ & Social Eth, Pl Montesquieu 3 Bte L2-06-01, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Lambrecht, Maxime] Ecole Droit, Inst Etud Polit Paris, Rue Univ 12, Paris, France",Universite Catholique Louvain,"Lambrecht, M (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, Hoover Chair Econ & Social Eth, Pl Montesquieu 3 Bte L2-06-01, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.;Lambrecht, M (通讯作者)，Ecole Droit, Inst Etud Polit Paris, Rue Univ 12, Paris, France.",maxime.lambrecht@uclouvain.be,,"Lambrecht, Maxime/0000-0001-8909-7547",,,,,48,1,2,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Overall, the regime led to a revenue loss of 25%. In the online experiment, revenue drops by 35%. These results suggest that the positive effect of reduced anonymity, previously established for donation or public goods contexts, does not extend to a consumption environment.

While the existence of a FMP is often used as evidence of sustainable forest management (SFM), State officials mandated to monitor and verify FMPs' implementation often lack the technical knowledge and political incentives to assess the changes that have been introduced, notably in terms of harvested volumes and species. Among tropical timber producers, Cameroon is considered to be exemplary for its progressive forest regulatory framework. Here we aim to estimate for the first time in sub-Saharan Africa the causal impact of the implementation of FMPs on harvested volumes, species and carbon stocks. We do so by using a 12-year (1998-2009) unbalanced longitudinal data set of a detailed, official harvesting inventory of 81 concessions in Cameroon. Results provide evidence to the theoretical expectations that for many years many practitioners have had on the implementation of SFM, i.e. that FMPs show a substantial opportunity to reduce carbon emissions from forest while presenting logging companies with acceptable financial trade-offs. We explore the technical and political reasons for our findings and conclude that these analyses are important for countries that are underwriting carbon-related schemes in which they propose to reduce their emissions through the effective implementation of SFM. We also demonstrate that producer countries do record useful information that, when effectively used, can help them to inform their policies and improve their sustainable development strategies.

Access to the forest clearly matters, but might not be as simple as proximity if quality varies by management and property regime. Using two rounds (2003/2004 and 2010/2011) of nationally representative survey data for rural Nepal, we analyze the impacts of forest proximity and the type of management regimes on housing values. Results from hedonic pricing models indicate that relative to a housing unit that uses a private forest as its primary firewood source, the value of a similar housing unit using a government forest has a 10 percent (2010/11) to 20 percent (2003/04) lower value; the respective percentage reductions for a similar housing unit with community forest source are 7 to 10 percent. Given limited private forestlands, these results offer a measure of support for newly adopted collaborative and leasehold forest programs. In the former, government forests are collaboratively managed by local communities with the government, where revenues are shared equally. In the latter, degraded government forests are transferred to the rural poor for 40-year renewable terms so that households can conserve and use forest products privately.

Analyses of stock market expectations show substantial heterogeneity between consumers. It is commonly speculated that this heterogeneity reflects variations in the beliefs underlying consumers' stock market expectations, that is, their mental models. In an online survey of American adults, we find that consumers think about different economic and political issues when generating stock market expectations for the next year. Regardless of the specific issues on which consumers focused, however, their assessments of the issues seemed to reflect a single underlying perception of changes in economic conditions. Regression analyses show that variation in stock market expectations is related to consumers' overall assessments of economic developments. We discuss the implications of these results for economic surveys and investment communications.","[Chin, Alycia] Consumer Financial Protect Bureau, Res Off, Washington, DC 20552 USA; [de Bruin, Wazndi Bruine] Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Univ Leadership Chair Behav Decis Making, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [de Bruin, Wazndi Bruine] Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Ctr Decis Res, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [de Bruin, Wazndi Bruine] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Engn & Publ Policy, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",University of Leeds; University of Leeds; Carnegie Mellon University,"Chin, A (通讯作者)，Consumer Financial Protect Bureau, Res Off, Washington, DC 20552 USA.",alycia.chin@cfpb.gov; w.bruinedebruin@leeds.ac.uk,"Chin, Alycia/I-9898-2019; BRUINE DE BRUIN, Wandi/N-8588-2018","Chin, Alycia/0000-0002-9570-0549; BRUINE DE BRUIN, Wandi/0000-0002-1601-789X",National Institute on Aging at the National Institutes of Health [P01 AG026571]; Swedish Foundation for the Humanities and the Social Sciences (Riksbankens Jubileumsfond) Program on Science and Proven Experience,National Institute on Aging at the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); Swedish Foundation for the Humanities and the Social Sciences (Riksbankens Jubileumsfond) Program on Science and Proven Experience,"This article is the result of the authors' independent research and does not necessarily reflect the views of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or the United States.

We can usually consider MSE/MSS as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem, and so we need to use an MCDM method to handle it. Uncertainty is one of the important factors that can affect the process of decision-making. Fuzzy MCDM approached have been designed to deal with the uncertainty of decision-making problems. In this study, a fuzzy extension of the CODAS (COmbinative Distance-based ASsessment) method is proposed to solve multi-criteria group decision-making problems. We use linguistic variables and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers to extend the CODAS method. The proposed fuzzy CODAS method is applied to an example of market segment evaluation and selection problem under uncertainty. To validate the results, a comparison is performed between the fuzzy CODAS and two other MCDM methods (fuzzy EDAS and fuzzy TOPSIS). A sensitivity analysis is also carried out to demonstrate the stability of the results of the fuzz CODAS. For this aim, ten sets of criteria weights are randomly generated and the example is solved using each set separately. The results of the comparison and the sensitivity analysis show that the proposed fuzzy CODAS method gives valid and stable results.","[Keshavarz Ghorabaee, Mehdi; Amiri, Maghsoud] Allameh Tabatabai Univ, Fac Management & Accounting, Dept Ind Management, Tehran, Iran; [Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras; Antucheviciene, Jurgita] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Construct Technol & Management, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Hooshmand, Reyhaneh] Allameh Tabatabai Univ, Fac Management & Accounting, Dept Business Management, Tehran, Iran",Allameh Tabataba'i University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Allameh Tabataba'i University,"Keshavarz Ghorabaee, M (通讯作者)，Allameh Tabatabai Univ, Fac Management & Accounting, Dept Ind Management, Tehran, Iran.",m.keshavarz_gh@yahoo.com; amiri@atu.ac.ir; edmundas.zavadskas@vgtu.lt; r.hooshmand.atu@gmail.com; jurgita.antucheviciene@vgtu.lt,"Keshavarz-Ghorabaee, Mehdi/J-5488-2014; Hooshmand, Reyhane/HGA-9170-2022; Amiri, Maghsoud/Z-3160-2019; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/Q-6048-2018; bill, dr/AAB-9639-2022; Antucheviciene, Jurgita/W-6112-2018","Keshavarz-Ghorabaee, Mehdi/0000-0002-0362-1633; Hooshmand, Reyhane/0000-0001-7959-4507; Amiri, Maghsoud/0000-0002-0650-2584; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/0000-0002-3201-949X; Antucheviciene, Jurgita/0000-0002-1734-3216",,,,,41,115,118,4,72,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The novelty of this research is that we provide empirical evidence that the maturity of bank borrowing is contingent on the characteristics of the regulatory and the institutional setting about corporate governance. The main implication of our paper is that corporate governance rules have greater influence in civil-law countries than in common-law countries in promoting efficiency in the use of bank debt maturity. The value of this paper is that our results confirm that the implementation of similar regulations on transparency across countries with different legal systems favors the alignment of the role played by short-term bank debt in addressing asymmetric information, agency costs, and inefficient liquidation.","[Vallelado, Eleuterio] Univ Valladolid, Dept Financial Econ & Accounting, Avda Valle Esgueva 6, Valladolid 47011, Spain; [Saona, Paolo] St Louis Univ Madrid Campus, John Cook Sch Business, Dept Econ & Business, Avda Valle 34, Madrid 28003, Spain; [San Martin, Pablo] Univ Catolica la Santisima Concecion, Fac Ciencias Econ & Adm, Caupolican 491, Concepcion, Chile",Universidad de Valladolid,"Vallelado, E (通讯作者)，Univ Valladolid, Dept Financial Econ & Accounting, Avda Valle Esgueva 6, Valladolid 47011, Spain.",teyo@eco.uva.es; psaonaho@slu.edu; psanmartin@ucsc.cl,"Vallelado, eleuterio/H-6297-2013; San Martin, Pablo/AGP-8502-2022; San Martín Mosqueira, Pablo/T-7977-2019; Saona, Paolo/ABE-3912-2020","Vallelado, eleuterio/0000-0001-8079-7416; Saona, Paolo/0000-0002-3151-9855; San Martin Mosqueira, Pablo/0000-0002-1944-9399",Spanish Ministry of Education [ECO2014-56102-P]; Santander Financial Institute (SANFI),Spanish Ministry of Education(Spanish Government); Santander Financial Institute (SANFI),"The authors are grateful to Assaf Eisdorfer, Taylan Mavruk, Juan Antonio Rodriguez and Valle Santos, to two anonymous referees for their detailed comments and suggestions, and to the seminar participants at the 2013 Southern Financial Association (SFA) Annual Meeting and 2013 Wolpertinger Meeting.

In this study, sales forecasts for a global furniture retailer operating in Turkey were made using state space models, ARIMA and ARFIMA models, neural networks, and Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). Also, the forecasting performances of some widely used combining methods were evaluated by comparison with the weekly sales data for ten products. According to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first time that the recently developed state space models, also called ETS (Error-Trend-Seasonal) models, and the ANFIS model have been tested within combining methods for forecasting retail sales. Analysis of the results of the single models in isolation indicated that none of them outperformed all the others across all the time series investigated. However, the empirical results suggested that most of the combined forecasts examined could achieve statistically significant increases in forecasting accuracy compared with individual models and with the forecasts generated by the company's current system.","[Aras, Serkan; Deveci Kocakoc, Ipek; Polat, Cigdem] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Izmir, Turkey",Dokuz Eylul University,"Aras, S (通讯作者)，Dokuz Eylul Univ, Izmir, Turkey.",serkanaras35@hotmail.com; ipekdeveci@yahoo.com; cigdempolat35@hotmail.com,"aras, serkan/AAH-8566-2021; Kocakoç, Ipek Deveci/P-2098-2019; aras, serkan/Q-2098-2019","Kocakoç, Ipek Deveci/0000-0001-9155-8269; aras, serkan/0000-0002-6808-3979",,,,,88,10,15,3,38,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

By the 2050 there will be more than 20% of world population age 65 and over. This negative demographic transition, i.e. population aging has been showing four very distinctive features: unprecedented, pervasiveness, endurance and profound implications on human life in general. Statistics for the European Union are supporting the above mentioned. Namely, the age structure of the European population is expected to change significantly over the next decades and by 2060, the share of people aged 65 and above will increase from 18% to 30% compared to now, while the share of people aged above 80 will more than double. Thus, it is not surprising that the European Union has launched a notion of Silver Economy related to economic activities of population aged SO and over and their impact on various sectors of the national economy. Elderly persons have been for a long time considered the fiscal burden, but ELT countries have recently started to turn the negative demographic trend of aging into market opportunities for new products, services, jobs and consequently growth. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the issue of silver economy with particular focus on investigating the potential economic value of active aging and elderly people in general. Supporting the silver economy in theory and practice means considering elderly population as an opportunity not a threat to local, regional and national economic development.","[Barkovic Bojanic, Ivana; Erceg, Aleksandar] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Barkovic Bojanic, I (通讯作者)，JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.",ibarkovic@efos.hr; aerceg@efos.hr,"Erceg, Aleksandar/I-8071-2019","Erceg, Aleksandar/0000-0002-1141-1919",,,,,33,8,8,5,29,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2017,13.0,,,,,,1005,1020,,,,,,16,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM4RS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000463854000065,0

More than ever before, the pressure on managers and leaders in organizations has been increased to create new products and a new value to the organization. The need for constant growth and development seeks entry into the personal and organizational change. Here, the key question is how managers and leaders vi1l come to the inspiration and vision regarding what the organization and the people in it in the future should do. This is the key question of leadership and strategic management. Thereat the question what in the future we should do is far more important than how the organizational changes 14411 be implemented. The manner on how to implement organizational change is more a technical issue, and the direction where the development of the enterprise is heading an issue which in itself includes a compass, i.e. in which direction the company is developing This paper deals 1,vith managers and leaders in the companies, with those that determine the direction the company is going to and implement the changes, and how to embed into the dynamic, development and strategic thinking. In the strategic management, the main challenge was and still is a person who bas a vision of the future development of the company. The aim of this paper was to explore the variety of intelligence that managers and leaders have at their disposal, while shaping the future of the company. Besides the types of intelligence, we have identified the four basic levels of the person. For that purpose, it has been studied the achievements of various scientific disciplines that are directly related to an individual, especially philosophy, neuroscience, psychology, logo therapy, anthropological medicine, to meet through the various scientific fields and with the help of modern scientific knowledge could understand how to help persons, such as managers and leaders in achieving their specific tasks, 'The research results reveal that man has four levels of its individuality (biological, psychological, anthropological and theological levels), and that the anthropological level is precisely crucial for the development of freedom of thought, ideas, inspirations, visions, especially freedom from the shackles of limitations and static reasoning. From an anthropological level rise freedom, creativity, vision, intellect, character, interpersonal relations and other person's qualities. These are the very qualities of an individual that have their origin in the anthropological level of man and its afllnnation in the strategic management. By exploring specfic anthropological level we are able to correctly understand how to achieve inspiration, innovation, vision, intellect and to offer a versatile help to the managers and leaders in the exercising of their duties, particularly in the area of strategic development of the company. In conclusion, it is required to meet the various scientific disciplines to offer a versatile answer to the question of who the individual is and how he comes to vision, leadership and healthy, dynamic development.","[Bartolovic, Visnja] Coll Slavonski Brod, Slavonski Brod, Croatia",University of Slavonski Brod,"Bartolovic, V (通讯作者)，Coll Slavonski Brod, Slavonski Brod, Croatia.",visnja.bartolovic@vusb.hr,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,5,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2017,13.0,,,,,,91,107,,,,,,17,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM4RS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000463854000006,0

Social media, above all, amplify attention, opportunities, markets, shopping, rankings and, as a consequence, economic growth. Web domains and social media enable consumers' experiences from information flows to persuasion and from shopping to international trade (Nadeem et al., Int J Inform Manage 35(4):432-442, 2015; Verhoef et al., J Retail 91(2):174-181, 2015; Xu et al., J Mark 78(4):97-112, 2014). Boundaries of economies are vanishing thanks to this e-market for everything and everyone. E-commerce evolves into social commerce (s-commerce), when relationships grow together with transactions and economic performances. Who, what and where of e-commerce get into global and challenging features of s-commerce. Marketing, and especially social media marketing, therefore, has a crucial new role and enhances 'interactive online world' in which 'participants with different interests, resources and power cocreate value' (Kornum and Miihlbacher, J Bus Res 66(9):1460-1464, 2013). Nowadays, consumers are spending more time than ever using social media, and organisations are striving to use social media to reach, engage, catch and hold the millions of consumers who use it daily (Parsons, Allied academies international conference: proceedings of the academy of marketing studies, 16(2):11-15, 2011). After analysing the new marketing scenario and pointing out social media marketing strategies, this paper investigates EU27 for e-commerce performances, exports, imports, trade balance and gross domestic product (GDP) growth as concerns the latest 2010-2015 European Statistics. Thanks to cluster analysis, separating groups will emerge with different growth according to e-commerce performances.","[Besana, Angela; Esposito, Annamaria] IULM Univ, Milan, Italy",IULM International University Languages & Media,"Besana, A (通讯作者)，IULM Univ, Milan, Italy.",angela.besana@iulm.it,,,,,,,37,0,0,2,10,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-48454-9; 978-3-319-48453-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,181,192,,10.1007/978-3-319-48454-9_14,0.0,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1MX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447881400014,0

An annual survey is published by Ernst & Young regarding the quality of the integrated reports of the top 100 entities listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE). Aim: The study on which this article is based was aimed at determining whether the assessment of an entity's characteristics can predetermine the quality of the integrated report generated by that entity. Setting: This article focuses on an analysis of the integrated reporting of the top 100 entities listed on JSE for the financial years ending in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Methods: Comparison of categorical variables, mixed-model repeated measures ANOVA and generalised estimating equations were applied to identify the best classificators to distinguish between excellent integrated reporting and those reports where progress could still be made. Results: The results show that the type of industry the entity finds itself in, the size and profitability of the entity, as well as the composition of the members of the board, have an effect on the quality of the integrated report. Conclusion: Our results indicated that the type of industry, size of an entity, the profitability and composition of the board of directors, all have an effect on the quality of the integrated reporting. Our evidence will assist current and prospective stakeholders in evaluating the expected quality of an entity's integrated report, through the evaluation of certain firm characteristics.","[Buitendag, Natasha; Fortuin, Gail S.; de laan, Amber] Univ Stellenbosch, Sch Accountancy, Stellenbosch, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Buitendag, N (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Sch Accountancy, Stellenbosch, South Africa.",natasha@zinplex.co.ca,,"Buitendag, Natasha/0000-0002-3710-6883",,,,,26,31,38,0,20,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Although, remote collaboration exists already some years, the management and leadership of virtual teams are still not fully mastered in todays' corporations as many virtual teams are operating inefficiently or even decay due to various reasons and insufficient experience. Therefore, this paper aims to highlight the necessity of the integration of virtual teaming already in the academic studies and provides a concept implementable in study subjects with corresponding high level analysis. Collecting experiences with virtual teaming already during educational process may enrich and significantly impact soft skills and technical proficiency that may play an important role in virtual teaming and remote collaboration. Students and primarily students of managerial studies may benefit significantly of such experiences as they will most probably lead and manage international multicultural virtual teams during their professional career. The aim of this paper is to propose a concept of a possible implementation of virtual teaming and collaboration of students in a university study object that may foster collaboration among academic institutions too.

Output hedging can be detrimental to sector play. Furthermore, firms with market power that hedge outputs have incentives to over-produce and distort market prices. In rational markets, such hedging will be expensive and we expect to see a negative relationship between hedging and market power in output industries but not in input industries. We test these predictions on a sample of S&P500 firms from 2001 to 2005. Our results support both hypotheses. Placebo tests show that the same empirical regularities do not apply to currency hedging.

Gold in the investment portfolio is perceived to safeguard individual investors against market risk. The Malaysian government has launched unit trust schemes under the Amanah Saham group which is a government-backed fail-safe investment. Gold investment, however, is a new phenomenon with very little promotion. The central bank has introduced the gold coin series while the private banking sector released few gold-related products. This study is performed to identify the purpose of investing, barriers to invest in gold and to ascertain financial risk tolerance as one of the predictor affecting gold investment behavior among Malaysian employees. Respondents in Peninsular Malaysia were sampled via a multistage random among urban public sector employees. Data from self-administered questionnaires revealed the main purpose to invest on gold was to have savings in the form of physical product. More than one-third of the 403 respondents reasoned out inavailability of funds for gold investment followed by the complication of gold investment procedures which they are not very familiar as the main barriers to gold investing. The significant predictors for gold investment behavior revealed were financial risk tolerance, gold investment attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control with an explained variance of 30.4%. As gold investment is perceived as a safe investment, the result of financial risk tolerance as a positive significant predictor is not as expected. In addition, gold investment subjective norms surpassed the others in predicting gold investment behavior however gold investment knowledge is not significant in predicting investment on gold. It can be concluded that peer group is very important in determining a person's intention to invest in gold. The results from this study may be utilised in marketing practices and business decisions.","[Fauzi, A. W. Ahmad; Husniyah, A. R.; Fazli, S. Mohamad; Amim, O.

This study analyzes a unique database of 75,000 fuel economy estimates self-reported by customers of the U.S. government website www.fueleconomy.gov to evaluate the effectiveness of the government's estimates for these two purposes. The analysis shows great variability in individuals' own fuel economy estimates relative to the official government estimates with a small bias relative to the sample average. For consumers, the primary limitation of government fuel economy estimates is imprecision for a given individual rather than bias relative to the average individual. The analysis also examines correlations between individuals' fuel economy estimates and specific technologies, vehicle class, driving style, method used to calculate fuel economy, manufacturer, and state. Gasoline, hybrid and diesel vehicles were separately evaluated. There is some evidence that the shortfall between test cycle fuel economy estimates (used to measure compliance with regulations) and in-use fuel economy estimates (such as those provided by customers of www.fueleconomy.gov) has been increasing since 2005. If this trend continues, it could affect the benefits realized by fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions standards. A scientifically designed survey of in-use fuel economy is needed to insure that an unbiased sample is collected and that fuel economy is rigorously and consistently measured for all vehicles. The potential for information technology to enable more precise prediction of individual fuel economy should be explored.","[Greene, David L.; Khattak, Asad J.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Liu, Jun] Univ Texas Austin, Ctr Transportat Res, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Wang, Xin] Virginia Dept Transportat, Transportat & Mobil Planning Div, Richmond, VA USA; [Hopson, Janet L.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Goeltz, Richard] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Ctr Transportat Anal, Oak Ridge, TN USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory,"Khattak, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Tennessee, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",dlgreene@utk.edu; akhattak@utk.edu; jun.liu@utexas.edu; xin.wang@vdot.virginia.gov; jhopson@utk.edu; goeltzrt@ornl.gov,"Khattak, Asad J./J-3340-2014; Liu, Jun/HOF-4256-2023; Greene, David/AAB-1183-2021; Wang, Xin/N-3336-2013","Khattak, Asad J./0000-0002-0790-7794; Wang, Xin/0000-0001-5438-5688; Greene, David/0000-0002-7667-5376",,,,,40,26,27,0,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

This paper discusses the problem of estimating the transition probability of client credit behaviour when aggregate proportional data are known. The paper examines the dynamics of credit risk through rating migrations and shows linkages between rating migration and prevailing macroeconomic conditions expressed in GDP growth. Markov Chain methodology is considered as an appropriate method for transition matrices estimation. This paper compares transition probabilities for different economic conditions in Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Transition probability matrices estimated in this paper provide a basis for comparing bank sector. We have separate the economy into two states, when GDP growth was above/below average and we have computed the conditioned transition matrices on these states. We show that the period with a GDP above the average were more stable in both countries. Our findings may have implications for credit risk managers in financial institutions. Moreover our results give a useful framework for stress testing of the credit portfolios.","[Jackuliak, Jozef] Slovenska Sporitelna, Tomasikova 48, Bratislava 83237, Slovakia; [Bohdalova, Maria] Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Dept Informat Syst, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava 82005, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Jackuliak, J (通讯作者)，Slovenska Sporitelna, Tomasikova 48, Bratislava 83237, Slovakia.",jozef.jack@gmail.com; maria.bohdalova@fm.uniba.sk,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,1,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-499-5,,,,2017,,,,,,,357,367,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ7IS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427306200038,0

The main objective of our contribution was to quantify the impacts of selected determinants on the expected life span in European regions between 2001 and 2014. Using the regression analysis applied to the selected data set we could estimate which demographic and socio-economic variables affect the mean life expectancy at birth positive and negative. Regression analysis was performed using a model with fixed and random effects, of which a fixed-effect model was more suitable for our data structure, as confirmed by the Hausman test. On the basis of the estimated regression coefficients, we subsequently determined the impact of each indicator on the mean life expectancy at birth. In most cases, our assumed effect of these variables is confirmed by the variables explained to us. An unexpected result was reflected in GDP per capita GDP, which is also at odds with the theoretical starting points and the results of studies reported in the theoretical part. Knowledge of these impacts is very important not only for the development of relevant policy concepts in the country but also for national and international benchmarking.","[Khouri, Samer; Cehlar, Michal; Horansky, Karol; Sandorova, Klaudia] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Min Ecol Proc Control & Geotechnol, Letna 9-A, Kosice 04001, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Khouri, S (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Min Ecol Proc Control & Geotechnol, Letna 9-A, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",samer.khouri@tuke.sk; michal.cehlar@tuke.sk; karol.horansky@tuke.sk; klaudia.sandorova@tuke.sk,"Cehlar, Michal/G-5948-2017; Khouri, Samer/C-9922-2017","Cehlar, Michal/0000-0001-9670-6195; Khouri, Samer/0000-0001-7243-5124",,,,,36,16,16,2,16,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The choice of the portfolio is based on two stages. In the first one we identify the long-run co-movement using the cointegration analysis to eliminate the assets sharing common trends. Then, using the constrained set of assets from the first stage, we optimise the portfolio employing the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). By comparing the out-of-sample results we finally conclude that the portfolio supported by cointegration analysis performs significantly better than the one based solely on MPT. To illustrate this idea we identify the potential of the international diversification of the Polish Open Pension Funds (OPF) portfolios. We argue that the current OPF asset allocation exhibits insufficient foreign diversification (home bias) so it is desirable to change the regulatory policy to enable OPF investing abroad more.","[Kurach, Radoslaw] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Econ Sci, Komandorska Str 118-120, PL-54042 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Kurach, R (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Econ Sci, Komandorska Str 118-120, PL-54042 Wroclaw, Poland.",radoslaw.kurach@ue.wroc.pl,"Kurach, Radosław/P-2665-2018","Kurach, Radosław/0000-0002-7869-5602",,,,,44,3,3,0,7,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

We follow the root ideas of cybernetics in order to explain the concept of intentionality and its consequences in business system modeling as well as its impact on the business process modeling methodology and language. Possible way of reflecting these ideas in the business processes modeling methodology is outlined using the example of the process meta-model and business process patterns from the MMABP methodology. Then the concept of causality in business systems is explained and relevant informatics theories and techniques for modeling the real world causality are introduced in this context. Particular attention is paid to the topic of relationships between both basic types of the business system models: intentional business process and causal ontology model. General rules and principles of the consistency of models are discussed together with their methodological consequences. Basic types of the consistency of models - completeness and correctness - are identified and also the specific topic of 'structural consistency' is introduced in this context. In the conclusions section the needed reflection of these essential features in the modeling languages and methodology is analyzed and the basic insufficiencies of the contemporary approaches to the business process modeling are pointed out together with the outline of possible ways of their overcoming. As the main challenges in the field of business process modeling methodology and languages we particularly identify the need for respecting all consequences of the fact that business process has to be always taken as a purposeful process as well as the need for implementing the self-perception of the process in order to allow it achieving the higher orders of prediction.,"[Repa, Vaclav] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Informat Technol, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Repa, V (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Informat Technol, Prague, Czech Republic.",repa@vse.cz,"Repa, Vaclav/AAF-6104-2020","Repa, Vaclav/0000-0001-9113-3447",,,,,20,1,1,1,5,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Implementation of adverse selection relies on a steeper information rent to the agent than the standard menu, such that the agent is motivated to distinguish the efficient state of nature from the inefficient.

Academics have investigated the relationship between market orientation and various measures of performance across industries and have found that implementing market orientation can be a source of competitive advantage for companies and organizations. The research proposes to examine associations among three factors (i.e. market orientation, innovation, and performance) and explore what the extent market orientation, innovation affect the degree of performance. The market orientation under a behavioral context composed of: market intelligence generation, the dissemination of this intelligence in the organization and responsiveness to intelligence, is used in this research. A mixed method is a methodology for conducting this study. The unit of analysis is small hotels located in the Bangkok metropolitan region. Firstly, a quantitative approach will be employed. The hotel and accommodation industry was chosen to be target population of this study. Questionnaires were distributed to owners or managers in charge of marketing functions and 212 returned questionnaires were usable. Structural Equation Modeling was employed to analyze results. Later, the qualitative method was used by means of in-depth interview with 22 experts in the hotel industry. The results conclude that market intelligence generation, the dissemination of intelligence and responsiveness to generation have a significant indirect effect on business performance via innovation. The results of in-depth interviews also support the qualitative findings including a relationship between the dissemination of intelligence and responsiveness to generation. The findings add a body of knowledge into the area of tourism marketing and reveal the understanding with regard to small hotels in hotel business. The results are of significance to hotel executives. The unique characteristics of the hotel industry allow these executives to employ innovation more easily than can be done in other industries, permitting the adoption of an innovative culture as a means to achieving a competitive edge. It is easier for such managers to exploit the benefits of flexibility and simplicity inherent in their industry. Business practitioners and executives of small and medium sized hotels should combine sound market orientation with an emphasis on innovation because such a combination is likely to result in higher hotel performance as applying to their operational environment of hotels.","[Sukato, Nuntasaree] Dhurakij Pundit Univ, Coll Innovat Business Adm & Accountancy, Mkt, Bangkok, Thailand",,"Sukato, N (通讯作者)，Dhurakij Pundit Univ, Coll Innovat Business Adm & Accountancy, Mkt, Bangkok, Thailand.",nuntasaree.suk@dpu.ac.th,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,3,VOLKSON PRESS,KUALA LUMPUR,"C-3A-15 CENTRIO PANTAI HILLPARK, JALAN PANTAI MURNI, BANGSAR SOUTH,, KUALA LUMPUR, WILAYAH PERSEKUTUAN KUALA LUMPUR 59200, MALAYSIA",,,978-1-948012-02-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,267,272,,10.26480/icemi.01.2017.267.272,0.0,,,6,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM2GZ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000461012100094,0

Findings from a micro-level research on the service sector confirm that ICT integration, firm's age, the education of the owner, the boss' attitude, family business, networks, new processes, major improvements, market share, on the job training and know-how significantly, and positively increase the probability of a firm's growth. Even though the growth rate of services is currently impressive in the Rwandan economy, no investigations have been done on the determinants of the growth of the firms in the service sector. This paper studies the development of services over the years in Rwanda's economy in detail and empirically estimates its determinants by using an econometric methodology. The empirical results are based on micro-data collected by the Rwanda Enterprise Survey (2011) and the 2014 Establishment Census. The survey has data on 241 firms and establishments. Linear and limited dependent variable techniques are employed to investigate the factors behind the development of service firms. Models are specified and estimated to assess the factors contributing to sales growth, innovations, and turnovers of service firms. The results show that the key factors driving the development of service firms in Rwanda include access to credit, application of ICT, availability of skilled labor, employee development and acquisition of fixed assets. The results suggest that the government should uphold the use of ICT in all service firms, promote access to finance to new service firms and promote on-work training in service firms to speed up Rwanda's shift from a low income to a middle-income state.","[Uwitonze, Eric] MIGEPROF, Single Project Implementat Unit, Minist Gender & Family Promot MIGEPROF, Kigali, Rwanda; [Heshmati, Almas] Jonkoping Univ, JIBS, Jonkoping, Sweden",Jonkoping University,"Heshmati, A (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Univ, JIBS, Jonkoping, Sweden.",uwitonzeric@gmail.com; almas.heshmati@gmail.com,,,,,,,75,1,1,0,8,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",2367-1033,,978-981-10-4451-9; 978-981-10-4450-2,FRONT AFR BUS RES,,,2017,,,,,,,331,368,,10.1007/978-981-10-4451-9_15,0.0,,,38,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK1SG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432206900015,0

This research examines members of VTC, on the basis of involvement theory, using factor analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze the influence between users' involvement and the intention and behavior of inviting travel companions in VTC. The result shows that, firstly, the involvement can be categorized into three dimensions, namely personal, informational and situational dimension. Secondly, all of them positively influence the intention of inviting travel companions. The situational involvement as a factor of influence has the highest ranking. Thirdly, involvement not only indirectly influences the behavior of inviting companions, taking the intention as a mediator, but also directly impacts on the inviting behavior. The research enriches the theory of involvement Discussions and implications with the reference to the conclusion for the future practices in management are also proposed.","[Yi, Tingting; Wu, Ying] South China Normal Univ, Sch Tourism Management, Waihuanxi Rd 378, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Niu, Ning] Univ Sydney, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Camperdown Campus, Sydney, NSW, Australia",South China Normal University; University of Sydney,"Wu, Y (通讯作者)，South China Normal Univ, Sch Tourism Management, Waihuanxi Rd 378, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",ting_ivy@126.com; wuying@m.scnu.edu.cn; nniu8801@uni.sydney.edu.au,,,Humanities and Social Science Foundation of Ministry Education of China [15YJC630161],Humanities and Social Science Foundation of Ministry Education of China,This research was supported by the Humanities and Social Science Foundation of Ministry Education of China (No. 15YJC630161).,,38,0,0,2,20,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Development of assisted areas is one of the most important European Union guidelines and for this purpose almost one third of the EU budget is provided for cohesion policy implementation. Those funds are available through European structural and investment (ESI) Funds. In the 2014.-2020. budgetary period, Croatia has been allocated almost 10,74 billion euros from ESI Funds for various development projects which will contribu e to an even regional development and help achieve a smart, sustainable and effective growth. Besides through ESI Funds, an even regional development is also stimulated through national funding and implementation of strategically determined policies, goals, activities and measures. The Regional Development Strategy of the Republic of Croatia identifies three strategic goals focused on diminishing regional development differences and encouraging sustainable development, which should be achieved through synergy of actions on national, regional and local level. These goals are: (1) increasing the quality of life by encouraging sustainable territorial development, (2) increasing regional economy competitiveness and employment rates and (3) systematic management of regional development.

Since one Dollar of extra spending should not change a certain loser to a certain winner, we extend the literature by allowing the electoral benefit of visibility to be stochastic. The model provides an explanation of earlier empirical findings that district variation in the cost of visibility does not influence incumbents' victory probability. Furthermore, in contrast to previous literature, the model predicts that campaign finance legislation can increase challengers' expected payoffs.","[Cole, Matthew T.] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; [Pastine, Ivan] Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [Pastine, Tuvana] Natl Univ Ireland, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland",California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo; University College Dublin; Maynooth University,"Cole, MT (通讯作者)，Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA.",mtcole@calpoly.edu,,,,,,,55,3,3,0,1,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

However, the empirical research about corporate mobility in the EU has so far been limited in two respects: it has focused on the analysis of foreign companies in the UK and it has mainly been concerned with differences in the costs of incorporation such as minimum capital requirements. This paper aims to fill these gaps. It is the first paper that presents data on incorporations of foreign businesses in the commercial registers of each EU Member State. It is also the first one to assess the impact of differences in the conflict of laws rules applicable to companies as they reflect the case law of the Court of Justice on the freedom of establishment. It finds that countries which have a clear-cut version of the 'incorporation theory' attract more incorporations than countries which have retained elements of the 'real seat theory'. The paper also discusses the policy implications from these findings for EU harmonisation in this field. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

As with operators of other long-distance transport modes, like e.g. train or coach operators, assessing an airline's overall competitive position is not trivial: This is because airlines serve many different, direct and indirect origin-destination (OD) markets between which competition intensity can vary immensely. Hence, airline (or rather airline group) networks compete against each other, meaning that typical, e.g. HHI-based competition assessments at, e.g., the national, airport or direct route levels will not be sufficient to get a full picture. This paper presents a modelling approach for an indicator for the individual competitive positions (CP) of airlines and airline groups at the network level. An application to the intra-European market, based on OD data for 2015, indicates a quite comfortable competitive position for low cost carriers like Ryanair, WIZZ Air, FIyBE or Volotea, followed by the major airline groups (Lufthansa, Air France-KLM, IAG) which focus on hub and spoke networks along some low cost activities. The weakest CP's within our sample of the 30 largest European airlines and airline groups are calculated for leisure airlines like Monarch, which recently filed for bankruptcy.","[Maertens, Sven] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Air Transport & Airport Res, Cologne, Germany",Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR),"Maertens, S (通讯作者)，German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Air Transport & Airport Res, Cologne, Germany.",sven.maertens@dlr.de,"Maertens, Sven/AAE-5658-2020","Maertens, Sven/0000-0002-4618-0946",,,,,46,10,10,1,29,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

Farm incomes and characteristics are observed across the distribution of livestock farmers, using a longitudinal dataset. Potential agricultural and forest income streams are generated and compared in a life-cycle theoretical framework, while the inclusion of attitudinal survey data in the analysis is shown to contribute significantly to the understanding of the planting decision. The study suggests that there is a cohort of younger farmers on larger holdings who might plant if potential forest income is greater than their agricultural income, but we also find that there is a cohort of older farmers on smaller holdings that will never plant, and for whom negative cultural attitudes are stronger than economic drivers. The study concludes that a 'one size fits all' programme based solely on financial incentives may not be the most appropriate means to encourage further farm afforestation and suggests that more targeted approaches may be necessary to nuance incentives to increase afforestation rates and facilitate the use of afforestation as an agricultural greenhouse gas mitigation mechanism.","[Ryan, Mary] Teagasc Rural Econ & Dev Programme, Galway, Ireland; [O'Donoghue, Cathal] Natl Univ Ireland, Policy Lab, Galway, Ireland; [Hynes, Stephen] Natl Univ Ireland, Whitaker Inst, SEMRU, Galway, Ireland",Teagasc; Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway,"Ryan, M (通讯作者)，Teagasc Rural Econ & Dev Programme, Galway, Ireland.",Mary.ryan@teagasc.ie,"Ryan, Mary/AAX-9297-2020; O’Donoghue, Cathal/AAW-4109-2021","O’Donoghue, Cathal/0000-0003-3713-5366",,,,,49,9,10,0,15,"ELSEVIER GMBH, URBAN & FISCHER VERLAG",JENA,"OFFICE JENA, P O BOX 100537, 07705 JENA, GERMANY",1104-6899,1618-1530,,J FOREST ECON,J.

Addressing firms in the media cluster in Bergen, Norway, we examine how and from where companies acquire and combine different types of knowledge for their innovation activities. The empirical analysis, which is based on structured interviews with 22 media companies, identifies two main types of cluster firms: media content providers that rely heavily on symbolic knowledge and media technology providers that draw mostly on synthetic knowledge. Even though they draw on different knowledge bases, the two types of firms are strongly interlinked in their innovation activities and source knowledge from each other. Furthermore, we find that synthetic firms constitute a gateway to the regional R&D system and that the region acts as key arena for the combination of dissimilar knowledge bases.","[Martin, Roman] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Business Adm, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Martin, Roman] Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Lund, Sweden; [Rypestol, Jan Ole] Univ Agder, Dept Working Life & Innovat, Kristiansand, Norway",University of Gothenburg; Lund University; University of Agder,"Martin, R (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Business Adm, Gothenburg, Sweden.;Martin, R (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Lund, Sweden.",roman.martin@handels.gu.se,"Martin, Roman/AAE-1297-2022","Martin, Roman/0000-0001-5003-0986; Rypestol, Jan Ole/0000-0002-1855-2060",Research Council of Norway [12820398]; Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation [MMW 2012.0194]; Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation [W2013-0215:1],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation; Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation,This work was generously supported by the Research Council of Norway [project number 12820398]; the Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation [project number MMW 2012.0194] and the Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation [postdoctoral research grant W2013-0215:1].,,95,17,17,2,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

To get rid of any reverse causality when examining the linkage between transport infrastructure and services and FDI location decisions, we adopt an instrumental approach. To achieve this, we instrumented all of our four transport-related explanatory variables with their historical figures. To handle this system of simultaneous equations, we eventually employ a Three-Stage Least Squares (3SLS) estimation. Using data for the 2000-2010 period, our results suggest that provinces with larger air traffic and denser road network tend to attract more FDI. The adopted scenario analyses suggest that, holding other variables constant, a 10% increase in both air traffic and road network density is likely to attract almost 291 new FDI projects and $4,441 million of FDI stock and create around 33,173 new FDI jobs throughout a 10-year period in the 74 Turkish provinces analyzed. The major contribution of our analyses is covering all of the four transport modes rather than employing one or two. In addition, we adopt traffic volumes for air and maritime transport to better reflect their economic impact rather than using dummy variables. Finally, yet importantly, our study differs from the majority of the previous literature in that it employs an instrumental approach when analyzing the effect of transport infrastructure and services on the location of FDI flows.","[Ozcan, Ismail Cagri] Ankara Yildirim Beyazit Univ, Dept Aviat Management, Ankara, Turkey",Ankara Yildirim Beyazit University,"Ozcan, IC (通讯作者)，Ankara Yildirim Beyazit Univ, Dept Aviat Management, Ankara, Turkey.",icagriozcan@yahoo.com,,"OZCAN, ISMAIL/0000-0002-3809-1847",Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey,Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)),"Parts of this paper were written when the author was a Visiting PostDoc Researcher at Regional Economics Applications Laboratory of University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.

It can also grant benefits in terms of environmental externalities including the reduction of CO2 emissions, which has recently become one of the most important elements defining the sustainability of a transport system. However, the carbon potential granted by road charging is rarely assessed economically, thus confirming a sort of secondary role attributed to CO2 in urban premises. This paper provides an accurate analysis of the relationship between the different forms of road pricing (distance-based, congestion-based and pay-as-you-drive) and their effective role in terms of carbon reduction, which in some contexts is significant, accounting for an overall percentage higher than 10%. Furthermore, practical suggestions to policy makers in terms of implementation of the measure are discussed, highlighting the precautions necessary to include a fair carbon evaluation into an overall effective analysis.","[Cavallaro, Federico; Giaretta, Federico; Nocera, Silvio] Univ IUAV Venezia, Venice, Italy",IUAV University Venice,"Nocera, S (通讯作者)，Univ IUAV Venezia, Dept Architecture & Arts, Dorsoduro 2206, I-30123 Venice, Italy.",nocera@iuav.it,"Cavallaro, Federico/AAK-9173-2020; Nocera, Silvio/D-3914-2011","Cavallaro, Federico/0000-0003-4341-3924; Nocera, Silvio/0000-0001-8891-6459",,,,,82,55,59,6,52,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

In a six-month randomized experiment among consumers that find it difficult to meet their savings needs, we find that such soft commitments can significantly increase initial savings relative to either a hard commitment account (that prevents withdrawals) or a traditional savings account. In addition, the soft commitments significantly increased final savings balances relative to no form of commitment and were particularly effective for impatient individuals. Despite the lower initial take-up, the hard commitment account proved most effective in building savings balances among our participants at the end of 6 months.","[Burke, Jeremy; Perez-Arce, Francisco] Univ Southern Calif, Ctr Econ & Social Res, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Luoto, Jill] RAND Labor & Populat, Santa Monica, CA USA",University of Southern California,"Burke, J (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Ctr Econ & Social Res, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",jeremyburke1@gmail.com; jluoto@rand.org; perezarc@usc.edu,,"Luoto, Jill/0000-0001-7231-9633",,,,,15,4,4,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

The transport benefits and financial costs of rival transport technologies have been significant issues in recent Australian state and territory elections. However, debate tends to focus on the appropriate solution for particular corridors. In practice all major Australian cities have made investments in both bus-serviced and rail-serviced corridors. If public transport services are to operate as a coherent network then successful integration must occur between these bus and rail corridors and this paper shows that, on the criteria suggested by the literature, most Australian cities have created integrated networks. Examining the barriers and facilitators of integration between buses with a higher level of service and rail can inform policy and help to reduce the heat in the debate between rail-based and bus-based rapid transit system.

We analyze a regulatory change implemented by the SEC in 2007 by examining its effect on a key market metric, the bid-ask spread, an investor cost, and find that the regulatory shift, indeed, disadvantages investors. We link the implementation of this change to a shift in the volume of trades from a low-cost venue to a high-cost venue. We argue that this outcome is predicted by the incentives of the venues, non-profit stock exchanges owned by different types of members. The less-volatile, lower-cost New York Stock Exchange was owned by underwriters and included a specialist system that is less vulnerable to HFT tactics that can disadvantage investors.

The combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis reveals the following main findings: open access competition is a tool to revitalise the passenger rail market; however, under the current market conditions, only a limited increase in competition within the next 10 years is expected. The factors showing the highest influence on open access competition are access to attractive train paths, market potential, presence of intermodal competitors, low profitability of the industry, and infrastructure costs. Analysing competition in different EU countries indicates that strength and type of influencing factors are not identical. The results imply that progress concerning market opening has been made; however, much needs to be done to offer a competitive environment and improve conditions for open access competition, e.g. by speeding up the technical harmonisation within the EU or by reconsidering the setting of rail access charges.","[Feuerstein, Lisa; Xu, Jingjing] Univ Plymouth, Fac Business, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Busacker, Torsten] Hsch Munchen, Fac Tourism, Schachenmeierstr 35, D-80636 Munich, Germany",University of Plymouth,"Feuerstein, L (通讯作者)，Univ Plymouth, Fac Business, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England.",lisa.feuerstein@plymouth.ac.uk; torsten.busacker@hm.edu; jingjing.xu@plymouth.ac.uk,,,,,,,58,8,8,0,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

Two Swedish case studies, Living lab Uddevalla and Guidelines for Regional BRT are analysed and compared concerning what kind of learning occurred and what lessons regarding informal collaboration to draw from the two cases. For both cases the analysis indicates that individual, single loop learning is the most striking type of learning among the participants. The voluntary approach of the two cases has advantages and drawbacks. Advantages include that participants were truly interested in the issues of collaboration, which created energy and contributed to building trust. The main drawback identified was that in both cases the voluntary enthusiasm of the participants collided with the formal requirements of planning and decision making. This has stifled the possibility of the informal collaboration processes to induce change in prevailing practices.","[Pettersson, Fredrik; Hansson, Joel] Lund Univ, Dept Technol & Soc, Transport & Rd, HS3, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Westerdahl, Stig] Malmo Univ, Dept Urban Studies, SE-20506 Malmo, Sweden; [Pettersson, Fredrik; Westerdahl, Stig; Hansson, Joel] K2, Lund, Sweden",Lund University; Malmo University,"Pettersson, F (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Transport & Rd, HS3, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.",fredrik.pettersson@tft.lth.se; stig.westerdahl@mah.se; joel.hansson@tft.lth.se,,"Westerdahl, Stig/0000-0001-7357-2665; Hansson, Joel/0000-0001-6478-0091; Pettersson-Lofstedt, Fredrik/0000-0002-4991-5100",,,,,38,6,6,2,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

As a result, policy makers have developed regulations intended to empower parents to manage their children's exposure to Internet advertising. However, prior research has not examined parental perceptions of these regulations. This article aims to identify (1) parents' regulatory preferences regarding children's exposure to Internet advertising and (2) whether (and how) parents' locus of control (LOC) drives their regulation preferences. Findings reveal that internal-LOC parents prefer parental responsibility while external-LOC parents prefer government regulations, parental responsibility, and involvement of independent organizations and firms. External-LOC parents' preference is mediated by their concerns about Internet advertising and their tendency to have faith in regulation. Policy makers can use the findings to develop guidelines that better assist parents in influencing their children's Internet use.","[Vijayalakshmi, Akshaya] Indian Inst Management Ahmedabad, Mkt, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India; [Lin, Meng-Hsien (Jenny)] Calif State Univ Monterey Bay, Mkt, Seaside, CA USA; [Laczniak, Russell N.] Iowa State Univ, Grad Programs & Res, Ames, IA USA; [Laczniak, Russell N.] Iowa State Univ, Business, Ames, IA USA; [Laczniak, Russell N.] Iowa State Univ, Mkt, Ames, IA USA",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad; California State University System; California State University Monterey Bay; Iowa State University; Iowa State University; Iowa State University,"Vijayalakshmi, A (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management Ahmedabad, Mkt, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India.",akshaya@alumni.iastate.edu; jelin@csumb.edu; laczniak@iastate.edu,,,,,,,73,9,9,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

First, the compensation is less than full. Second, the government is not a perfect agent of society. Once these features are taken into account, several claims in the existing literature do not hold. Our results question the fiscal illusion theory. We show that full compensation ensures efficiency neither of the takings nor of the investment decisions. Moreover, departure from efficiency can get worse with the tightening of budget constraints. However, undercompensation, combined with the provision of restitution, delivers a better outcome in terms of investment choices by the owners and the taking decisions and choice of projects by the government. Furthermore, we show that fixed-compensation schemes generally are not efficient even if the government is benevolent, but undercompensation can still deliver an outcome more efficient than full compensation.","[Schaefer, Hans-Bernd] Bucerius Law Sch, Hamburg, Germany; [Singh, Ram] Univ Delhi, Delhi, India",University of Delhi,"Schäfer, HB (通讯作者)，Bucerius Law Sch, Hamburg, Germany.",,,"Singh, Ram/0000-0003-2695-2467",interdisciplinary program for legal research of Bucerius Law School,interdisciplinary program for legal research of Bucerius Law School,"We are grateful to the referees and the editor for very helpful comments and suggestions.

We investigate this decline in rural areas, where the majority of Indian women reside. Using parametric and semi-parametric decomposition techniques, we show that changes in individual and household attributes fully account for the fall in women's labor force participation in 1987-1999 and account for more than half of the decline in 1999-2011. Our findings underscore increasing education levels among rural married women and the men in their households as the most prominent attributes contributing to this decline. We provide suggestive evidence that changes in more educated women's relative returns to home production compared with market production may have adversely affected female labor force participation in rural India.","[Afridi, Farzana] Indian Stat Inst, IZA, Delhi, India; [Afridi, Farzana] Indian Stat Inst, Econ & Planning Unit, Delhi, India; [Dinkelman, Taryn] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Dinkelman, Taryn] Dartmouth Coll, IZA, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Dinkelman, Taryn] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Econ, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Mahajan, Kanika] Ashoka Univ, Dept Econ, Sonepat, Haryana, India",Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Delhi; Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Delhi; National Bureau of Economic Research; Dartmouth College; Dartmouth College; Ashoka University,"Afridi, F (通讯作者)，Indian Stat Inst, IZA, Delhi, India.;Afridi, F (通讯作者)，Indian Stat Inst, Econ & Planning Unit, Delhi, India.",fafridi@isid.ac.in; taryn.l.dinkelman@dartmouth.edu; kanika.mahajan@ashoka.edu.in,,,IGC-India [1-VRA-VINC-VXXXX-89217]; PPRU project Women and Work in Rural India,IGC-India; PPRU project Women and Work in Rural India,"This study was funded by IGC-India, Project Code 1-VRA-VINC-VXXXX-89217 and PPRU project Women and Work in Rural India.",,42,60,67,2,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Assumptions about cars signifying status and income are problematised by an examination of the characteristics of those who adopt cars. We consider the possibility that, despite low incomes and financial problems, cars may be a necessity for some urban dwellers. Patterns of car ownership and adoption are analysed using cross-sectional and longitudinal survey data collected from communities in Glasgow, between 2006 and 2011, before, during and after the recession. Car ownership rates increased, as more people adopted a car than relinquished vehicles. The likelihood of household car adoption was influenced by changes in household size, increased financial difficulties in relation to housing costs, and where householders gained work. A small but growing proportion of households (up to 8.5% by 2011) are deemed 'forced car owners' by virtue of owning a car despite also reporting financial difficulties: three-quarters of this group maintain a car despite financial problems whilst a quarter adopt a car despite financial problems. Findings suggest that poor households are reluctant to relinquish their cars to ease money problems when under financial stress and that, for some, acquiring a car may be seen as necessary to better their circumstances. In neither case can we see evidence that the sustainable transport agenda is reaching disadvantaged communities and there are concerns that regeneration strategies are failing to promote mobility and accessibility for poor communities via transport policies.","[Curl, Angela; Clark, Julie; Kearns, Ade] Univ Glasgow, Urban Studies, 25 Bute Gardens, Glasgow G12 8RS, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,"Curl, A (通讯作者)，Univ Canterbury, Dept Geog, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand.",angela.curl@canterbury.ac.nz; julie.clark@uws.ac.uk; ade.kearns@glasgow.ac.uk,"Curl, Angela/J-5879-2019","Curl, Angela/0000-0002-8325-190X; Clark, Julie/0000-0002-2954-8550",Scottish Government; NHS Health Scotland; Glasgow Centre for Population Health; NHS Greater Glasgow Clyde; Glasgow Housing Association; University of Glasgow [16597-01],Scottish Government; NHS Health Scotland; Glasgow Centre for Population Health; NHS Greater Glasgow Clyde; Glasgow Housing Association; University of Glasgow,"The study received funding from Scottish Government, NHS Health Scotland, Glasgow Centre for Population Health, NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde, Glasgow Housing Association and University of Glasgow (Grant Number 16597-01).",,56,51,57,4,27,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Those educated women appear to experience greater autonomy in making decisions on receiving their own health care and visiting their family. Furthermore, educated women have lower fertility and use more maternal health care, and their children have better health outcomes than those of less-educated women.

The objective is to minimize the time necessary for transportation where the organ leaves its origin to reach a destination given a set of commercial flights. Then, given the origin and destination of the organ, the solution of the mathematical model shows the best flights to be taken, respecting important constraints such as the cold ischemia time, considering transportation of one organ at a time. This problem is important for countries which need to improve their transportation systems. In Brazil, for example, despite more than 99% of organ transports involving different states be performed by air, logistics problems are responsible for non-execution of 5% to 10% of organ donations in the country. Brazilian real cases with 32 airports and 1,855 commercial flights are considered and the results show that our model provides better solutions than the practical ones used. In Brazil and other countries there are not structured models that allow the use of the commercial network of domestic flights to transport organs.

Politicians intentionally activate the latent racial biases of both racial conservatives and center-left liberals without explicitly talking about race. Conservative positions on significant policy areas have shifted over time on the basis of coded racial appeals. Fundamental rights are coded as white rights. Government actions to aid the poor or reduce discrimination are coded as black threats. The racial dimension explains the changing positions of American conservatism on gun rights, crime and mass incarceration, immigration, the welfare state, federalism, and economic policy. White racial identity, mobilized by coded political talk, restrains the potential for cross-racial coalitions and perpetuates the political repression of nonwhite Americans. Language gets its power because it is defined relative to frames, prototypes, metaphors, narratives, images, and emotions. Part of its power comes from its unconscious aspects: we are not consciously aware of all that it evokes in us, but it is there, hidden, always at work. If we hear the same language over and over, we will think more and more in terms of the frames and metaphors activated by that language (Lakoff 2008: 15).","[Bennett, Dylan] Univ Wisconsin Waukesha, Polit Sci, Waukesha, WI 53188 USA; [Walker, Hannah] Rutgers State Univ, Polit Sci & Criminal Justice, New Brunswick, NJ USA",University of Wisconsin System; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Bennett, D (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin Waukesha, Polit Sci, Waukesha, WI 53188 USA.",dylan.bennett@uwc.edu; hlwalker@polisci.rutgers.edu,,,,,,,87,7,14,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

The formulae show that the optimal regulations require a combination of downward and upward adjustments to the market sizes of buildings within both the business zone and the condominium zone, followed by minimum lot size regulation in the housing zone. The outer boundaries of the condominium and housing zones should be regulated inward whereas the optimal business zone boundary regulation depends on the trade-off between agglomeration economies and traffic congestion costs.","[Kono, Tatsuhito] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Informat Sci, Aoba Ku, Aoba 09, Sendai, Miyagi 9800879, Japan; [Joshi, Kirti Kusum] Tribhuvan Univ, Inst Engn, Kirtipur, Nepal",Tohoku University; Tribhuvan University; Institute of Engineering (IOE) - Nepal,"Kono, T (通讯作者)，Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Informat Sci, Aoba Ku, Aoba 09, Sendai, Miyagi 9800879, Japan.",kono@plan.civil.tohoku.ac.jp,,"Kono, Tatsuhito/0000-0001-5932-020X; Joshi, Kirti Kusum/0000-0002-4256-8169","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Government of Japan; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17H01293, 16K04275, 17H02514] Funding Source: KAKEN","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Government of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This research was funded by grants from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Government of Japan (Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research).",,43,7,7,1,51,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

The walking school bus is one of the most used interventions aiming to reduce problems resulting from this trend. However, no studies have analysed the influence of a WSB service provided by professional monitors on a shift in modes of transportation. This study investigated a pioneer daily walking school bus service guided by paid staff implemented at a primary school in Cordoba, Spain. A mobile app is used to register the children's participation and to provide the parents with real-time information on the group's location and arrival at the destination. Collected data, including the families' responses to a questionnaire were used to assess participation and the shift in modes of transportation. During the pilot study, a high recurrence in the children's participation was found and 43.7% of the participants had completely or partially changed transportation modes. The families reported fewer problems in the children's daily school travel organization and an improvement in their pedestrian safety behaviours. Further, 92.1% of the participating families had less concern about their children's autonomous walking. Results indicate that a walking school bus service guided by paid monitors can be an effective way to increase active travel to school, especially for children who live further from it. The use of the mobile app can reduce parents' concerns and facilitate the management and evaluation of the method. Implications are discussed for future Active Travel to School interventions that focus on changes in modes of transportation.","[Perez-Martin, P.; Pedros, G.; Martinez-Jimenez, P.; Varo-Martinez, M.] Univ Cordoba, Higher Polytech Sch, Appl Phys Dept, Rabanales Campus,Albert Einstein Bldg,First Floor, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain",Universidad de Cordoba,"Varo-Martínez, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cordoba, Higher Polytech Sch, Appl Phys Dept, Rabanales Campus,Albert Einstein Bldg,First Floor, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain.",f72pemap@uco.es; fa1pepeg@uco.es; fa1majip@uco.es; fa2vamam@uco.es,"JIMENEZ, María-Pilar MARTINEZ/P-1550-2014; VARO-MARTINEZ, MARTA/F-9794-2016","JIMENEZ, María-Pilar MARTINEZ/0000-0002-8680-5250; VARO-MARTINEZ, MARTA/0000-0003-4867-5528",European Regional Development Fund of the European Union; Department for Housing and Development of the Regional Government of Andalusia [GGI3003/IDIC],European Regional Development Fund of the European Union(European Union (EU)); Department for Housing and Development of the Regional Government of Andalusia,"We are grateful to the European Regional Development Fund of the European Union for the fundings received for this study through Metodologia de Implantacion de Rutas Escolares a Pie Apoyadas en Una Herramienta Tecnologica y Su Aplicacion en Centros de Educacion Primaria (Implementation Methodology of Walking School Routes Supported by a Technological Tool and its Application in Primary Schools), framed in the Programa Operativo FEDER de Andalucia 2007-2013 of the Public Works Agency and the Department for Housing and Development of the Regional Government of Andalusia (GGI3003/IDIC).",,32,14,16,2,31,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Literature shows that the adoption of an integrated Lean Six Sigma tool can assist them to compete with the rest of the world in a manner where productivity, quality and operational costs reduction are crucial for economic success. Aim: This article investigates the integration of Lean and Six Sigma tools as a unified approach to continuous improvement and develops a Lean Six Sigma framework for selected automotive component manufacturing organisations in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa. Method: The quantitative methods of research were adopted. The target population (42) was organisations within the Durban Automotive Cluster of which five were used for the pilot work. An empirical study was conducted using a survey questionnaire in measurable format to gather practical information from the sample organisations on the status of their existing business improvement programmes and quality practices. Results: The results of the study demonstrated that the organisations had a very low success rate of Lean and Six Sigma adoption as standalone systems, as they found it difficult to maintain the transition from theory to practice. Conclusion: Hence the adoption of an integrated Lean Six Sigma approach was absent and it can be concluded that the proposed Lean Six Sigma framework affords the KZN automotive sector a unique opportunity to integrate and operate with both tools of quality that complement its management style and industry demands.","[Rathilall, Raveen; Singh, Shalini] Durban Univ Technol, Dept Operat & Qual Management, Fac Management Sci, Durban, South Africa",Durban University of Technology,"Rathilall, R (通讯作者)，Durban Univ Technol, Dept Operat & Qual Management, Fac Management Sci, Durban, South Africa.",raveenrzn@gmail.com,,"Rathilall, Raveen/0000-0003-0699-2293",,,,,50,12,15,0,46,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Family fixed effects models show a positive and robust effect of birth order on health at birth; firstborn children are less healthy at birth. During earlier pregnancies, women are more likely to smoke, receive more prenatal care, and are more likely to suffer a medical pregnancy complication, suggesting worse maternal health. We further show that the health disadvantage of firstborns persists in the first years of life, disappears by age seven, and becomes a health advantage in adolescence. In contrast, later-born children are throughout childhood more likely to suffer an injury. The results on health in adolescence are consistent with previous evidence of a firstborn advantage in education and with the hypothesis that postnatal investments differ between first- and later-born children.","[Brenoe, Anne Ardila] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Oster Farimagsgade 5, DK-1353 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Molitor, Ramona] Univ Passau, Dept Business Adm & Econ, Innstr 27, D-94032 Passau, Germany",University of Copenhagen; University of Passau,"Brenoe, AA (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Oster Farimagsgade 5, DK-1353 Copenhagen, Denmark.",aab@econ.ku.dk,,"Brenoe, Anne/0000-0002-8045-8032",,,,,59,23,27,0,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

The sample covers 11 OECD countries' exchange rates for the period from January 2004 to June 2014. In out-of-sample forecasting of monthly returns on exchange rates, our findings indicate that the Google Trends search query data do a better job than the structural models in predicting the true direction of changes in nominal exchange rates. We also observed that Google Trends-based forecasts are better at picking up the direction of the changes in the monthly nominal exchange rates after the Great Recession era (2008-2009). Based on the Clark and West inference procedure of equal predictive accuracy testing, we found that the relative performance of Google Trends-based exchange rate predictions against the null of a random walk model is no worse than the purchasing power parity model. On the other hand, although the monetary model fundamentals could beat the random walk null only in one out of 11 currency pairs, with Google Trends predictors we found evidence of better performance for five currency pairs. We believe that these findings necessitate further research in this area to investigate the extravalue one can get from Google search query data.","[Bulut, Levent] Valdosta State Univ, Harley Langdale Jr Coll Business Adm, Dept Econ & Finance, Valdosta, GA 31698 USA",University System of Georgia; Valdosta State University,"Bulut, L (通讯作者)，Valdosta State Univ, Harley Langdale Jr Coll Business Adm, Dept Econ & Finance, Valdosta, GA 31698 USA.",lbulut@valdosta.edu,"Bulut, Levent/K-4471-2019","Bulut, Levent/0000-0003-1662-2050",Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) [115C089],Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)),"The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK), Grant/Award Number: 115C089",,22,43,47,5,60,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

We show that the advertising agency faces a trade-off between demand-expansion and profit-dissipation: The former arises as targeting induces more entry and increases the demand for advertising; the latter refers to that targeting relaxes competition by inducing more differentiation. We show that perfect targeting is not optimal for the advertising agency.

This study is unique because it explores the linkage between aviation and tourism policies in a newly established market. Based on three distinct sets of time series data from 2009 to 2015, various statistics and vector autoregression methods are applied to examine the impacts of the changes on tourism as well as the relationships among scheduled services, charter services, and tourism flows. Our main findings are as follows: First, the changes have promoted scheduled services constantly and aggressively, which contributed to the transformation of cross-strait tourism into a thriving business. Second, through regulation, the changes have created a policy framework for charter flight business. Third, charter flights have become a supplement to scheduled flights in the tourism market. Our contribution is threefold. First, our study contributes to the literature on the effect of aviation policy regimes on the tourism market with respect to charter operations. Second, it provides practical guidance for regions with similar situations, such as the Korean Peninsula. Third, it has crucial policy implications for regulators and governments and provides advice for airlines in the cross-strait market.","[Wu, Chuntao; Jiang, Qiuyue] Sichuan Univ, Sch Tourism, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Hangjun] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Sichuan University; University of International Business & Economics,"Yang, HJ (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",hangjunyang@uibe.edu.cn,,"Wu, Chuntao/0000-0002-0038-5639",MOE Layout Foundation of Humanities and Social Sciences [17YJAZH090]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71401035]; Social Sciences Foundation of Sichuan Province [SC17TJ009]; Sichuan University [skqy201769],MOE Layout Foundation of Humanities and Social Sciences; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Social Sciences Foundation of Sichuan Province; Sichuan University(Sichuan University),"This study is a part of the project named Impacts of policy environment on Northeast Asian charter market', funded by the MOE Layout Foundation of Humanities and Social Sciences (17YJAZH090).

However, defense spending by the United States cannot legitimately be classified as a public good, since the primary purpose of those expenditures has been to project power in support of private business interests. Throughout the course of the 20(th) century, U.S. military spending has been largely devoted to protecting the overseas assets of multinational corporations that are based in the United States or allied nations. Companies extracting oil, mineral ores, timber, and other raw materials are the primary beneficiaries. The U.S. military provides its services by supporting compliant political leaders in developing countries and by punishing or deposing regimes that threaten the interests of U.S.-based corporations. The companies involved in this process generally have invested only a small amount of their own capital. Instead, the value of their overseas assets largely derives from the appreciation of oil and other raw materials in situ. Companies bought resource-rich lands cheaply, as early as the 1930s or 1940s, and then waited for decades to develop them. In order to make a profit on this long-range strategy, they formed cartels to limit global supply and relied on the U.S. military to help them maintain secure title over a period of decades. Those operations have required suppressing democratic impulses in dozens of nations. The global sprawl of extractive companies has been the catalyst of U.S. foreign policy for the past century. The U.S. Department of Defense provides a giant subsidy to companies operating overseas, and the cost is borne by the taxpayers of the United States, not by the corporate beneficiaries. Defining military spending as a public good has been a mistake with global ramifications, leading to patriotic support for imperialist behavior.","[Gaffney, Mason] Univ Calif Riverside, Econ Emeritus, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Gaffney, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Riverside, Econ Emeritus, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",m.gaffney@dslextreme.com,,,,,,,124,6,8,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

In practice, however, mismanagement and bad governance of public sector and some other infrastructural shortcomings have led this economy to its current inefficient situation in which we face with one of the highest misery index, MI, along with one of the lowest economic growth rate in the world. This article is investigating this subject. At, one hand it is analyzing the relationship between misery index, MI, and economic growth in Iran, and at the other hand it studies the impact of governance on MI for 1974-2011 periods. To achieve this goal, vector autoregressive model has been used. We have also used the government effectiveness as a proxy for good governance, which, we think, is meaningful in Iranian case. By using dickey-fuller test the stability of variables, has been examined. We also have applied the Granger causality and Johnson test for considering the convergence among variables. One finding of this paper is that, economic growth has had negative relation with MI. Another result is that there is a significant relationship between type of governance and MI. For instance, during recent administration (2005-2011), we are encountering with the worst good governance indexes, the lowest economic growth, and the highest MI as well.","[Dadgar, Yadollah] Beheshty Univ, Tehran, Iran; [Nazari, Rouhollah] Audit Court, Tehran, Iran",,"Dadgar, Y (通讯作者)，Beheshty Univ, Tehran, Iran.",y_dadgar@sbu.ac.ir; rnazari2004@yahoo.com,"dadgar, yadollah/AAO-8539-2021",,,,,,38,8,8,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Exploiting waves of randomized audits by the Internal Revenue Service from 2006 to 2009, we find three long-run responses by taxpayers. First, audits increase tax payments substantially in following years, but this effect is short-lived when third-party reporting is not available. Second, taxpayers with high income volatility revert to their preaudit behavior quickly. Third, sophisticated taxpayers are affected less by enforcement. These responses reveal how taxpayers perceive the enforcement risk and change their noncompliance according to the dynamics of the information barrier between them and the enforcement agency.","[DeBacker, Jason] Univ South Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Heim, Bradley T.; Anh Tran] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Yuskavage, Alexander] US Dept Treasury, Washington, DC 20226 USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; United States Department of the Treasury,"DeBacker, J (通讯作者)，Univ South Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",,,,,,,,45,19,22,0,19,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

Two Polish deprivation-ridden estates - one urban' and one rural' - were investigated. Having taken account of the residents' everyday lives in the socio-economic, material and discursive dimensions, our findings indicate that the notions of rurality and urbanity imbricate and leapfrog meaningful territories at the local level. Realising the danger of deploying stereotypes as beacons in governance, from this richly contextualised account we draw that many problems today are space-independent and cannot be attenuated by following development paths reinvented in the name of empirically questionable yet culturally sustained and politically ontologised spatialities. This, then, calls for rethinking both the discursivity and the elusiveness of rural-urban thinking in the context of deprivation.","[Dymitrow, Mirek] Univ Gothenburg, Sch Business Econ & Law, Dept Econ & Soc, Unit Human Geog, Viktoriagatan 13, SE-41125 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Bieganska, Jadwiga; Grzelak-Kostulska, Elzbieta] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Urban Studies & Reg Dev, Fac Earth Sci, Ul Lwowska 1, PL-87100 Torun, Poland",University of Gothenburg; Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Dymitrow, M (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Sch Business Econ & Law, Dept Econ & Soc, Unit Human Geog, Viktoriagatan 13, SE-41125 Gothenburg, Sweden.",mirek.dymitrow@geography.gu.se; jadwigab@umk.pl; grzelak@umk.pl,"Dymitrow, Mirek/AAC-9997-2020; Biegańska, Jadwiga/M-8547-2019; Grzelak-Kostulska, Elzbieta/G-5180-2014","Biegańska, Jadwiga/0000-0002-0586-089X; Grzelak-Kostulska, Elzbieta/0000-0002-5797-9366; Dymitrow, Mirek/0000-0002-6936-342X",,,,,92,15,16,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

In line with the stakeholder theory, Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) is a guideline, which has been developed to enhance residential construction project performance by fulfilling stakeholder needs and interests. In accordance to the literature review, studies which highlight the effects of guidelines on project performance are few and far in between. In investigating the association between this study's variables, a quantitative methodology, where cross-sectional survey method is involved, was applied. The collected data, which consisted of a random sample of 384 buyers and developers from the residential sectors of construction project in Iran, was categorized. Subsequently, the response rate generally amounted to 44.1%. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) technique was used through SmartPLS software to investigate the relationship of variables. Based on the results, the positive relation between project performance, stakeholder satisfaction, and project stakeholder management are prominent. It is also revealed by the results that positive project performance, buyers' satisfaction, and project stakeholder management is also prominent. Moreover, the results show that the implementation of PMBOK standard through the mediating variables of buyers' satisfaction provides a positive impact on project performance. Additionally, resource-based theory, along with resource dependence and stakeholder theories were incorporated in this study in order to create a new theoretical framework, where the significance of social capital in enhancing project performance is evident.","[Abolghasemi, Maryam; Ismail, Syuhaida; Sharif, Normawati Binti Mohd] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Razak Sch, Jalan Semarak, Kuala Lumpur 54100, Malaysia; [Kookhdan, Alireza Rezanezhad] Keshavarzi Bank Agribank, Cent Bldg,Jalal E Al Ahmad Highway 247, Tehran 9431614459, Iran; [Mardani, Abbas] UTM, Fac Management, Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Abolghasemi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Razak Sch, Jalan Semarak, Kuala Lumpur 54100, Malaysia.",abolghasmi.matyam@gmail.com; syuhaida_ismail@yahoo.com; mawa@ic.utm.my; ezanezhad.it@gmail.com; mabbas3@live.utm.my,"Mardani, Abbas/D-5700-2015; Ismail, Syuhaida/K-6892-2019","Mardani, Abbas/0000-0003-1010-3655; Ismail, Syuhaida/0000-0001-6058-7497",,,,,132,3,3,0,19,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The key findings permit the formulation of new hypotheses, which will be verified at the next stage of the conducted research: (1) the barriers to implementing ELCC depend on the awareness of an enterprise's managers; (2) preparing controlling departments with respect to environmental costs determines the form and complexity of ELCC; (3) shorter product life cycles constitute a barrier to implementing ELCC.","[Biernacki, Michal] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland; [Dobroszek, Justyna] Univ Lodz, Lodz, Poland; [Macuda, Malgorzata] Poznan Univ Econ, Poznan, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business; University of Lodz; Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Biernacki, M (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland.",michal.biernacki@ue.wroc.pl; justyna.dobroszek@uni.lodz.pl; malgorzata.macuda@ue.poznan.pl,"Macuda, Małgorzata/D-6647-2019; Biernacki, Michal/O-2699-2019","Biernacki, Michal/0000-0002-7269-8212",,,,,7,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,1283,1286,,,,,,4,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553202030,0
