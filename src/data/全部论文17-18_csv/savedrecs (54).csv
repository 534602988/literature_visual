Improving conditions for socio-economic development is a major contributor to building countries international competitive advantage in globalized economy. In addition to instruments to stimulate socio-economic development, an important element of this policy should be also instruments allowing for its measurement. Assessing the level of socio-economic development of a country relative to a selected group of countries, or assessing development at regional level, is a fundamental determinant of the overall economic policy of the state. It is therefore important to develop procedures for systematic monitoring of the level of economic development, both at national or regional level. The aim of this article is to evaluate the socio-economic development in Poland at NUTS 2 regional level in the years 2010-2015. Due to the fact that the phenomenon of socio-economic development can be treated as multidimensional, in the study TOPSIS method was used. Four key diagnostic variables were identified in the study, which enabled to assess a synthetic measure of socio-economic development for the country. In the research data provided by Central Statistical Office of Poland was used. Gross domestic product per capita, investments outlays per capita, relative poverty risk index, and participation of individuals in households benefiting from social welfare were included in the set of variables. The results showed that within six years there was an increase in the level of development for most voivodships.","[Pietrzak, Michal Bernard] Licolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Econ Sci & Management, Dept Econometr & Stat, Lublin, Poland; [Gajdos, Artur] Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, Dept Spatial Econometr, Lodz, Poland; [Arendt, Lukasz] Inst Labour & Social Studies, Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz; Institute of Labor & Social Affairs,"Gajdos, A (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, Dept Spatial Econometr, Lodz, Poland.",pietrzak@umk.pl; gajdos@uni.lodz.pl; larendt@uni.lodz.pl,"Pietrzak, Michal Bernard/I-4919-2014; Gajdos, Artur/T-2538-2018","Pietrzak, Michal Bernard/0000-0002-9263-4478;",,,,,25,3,3,1,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1951,1956,,,,,,6,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059203048,0

Different instruments are being sought to eliminate the negative impact of the crisis on the labour market, with the emphasis on alleviating the disadvantageous position of disadvantaged job seekers, facilitating and speeding up the transition of unemployed people to labour market. The Slovak labour market is struggling with serious structural problems that are a brake on the economic development of the country. Unemployment among young people, people over 50 years, large regional disparities and a huge share of long-term unemployment mean the untapped potential of the economy. At the same time, it is a social indicator associated with unfavourable social phenomena, unemployment means a loss of social status, people without work are at risk of poverty and social exclusion. It should be noted, that globalization also brings many opportunities, is a positive driving force for change. It opens up access to new technologies, cheaper goods and services, creates flexible jobs, new business areas and innovative forms of service. At present, the social economy and its social entrepreneurship tool are at the forefront of Slovak conditions. It is a hybrid business model that tackles the unemployment of disadvantaged job seekers, brings stable jobs and innovative forms of service delivery. This paper focuses on the analysis of the current situation on labour market in Slovakia in relation to the effects of globalization and with emphasis on its negative consequences and opportunities.","[Pongracz, Eva] Univ Econ Bratislava, Dolnozemska Cesta C 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Pongracz, E (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Dolnozemska Cesta C 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",eva.pongracz@euba.sk,"Pongrácz, Eva/AAC-2682-2022","Pongrácz, Eva/0000-0002-0563-8922",,,,,14,1,1,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2057,2063,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059203062,0

First of all, teachers should pay great attention to teaching cultures. While properly coping with the relationship between language ability and communicative competence, teachers should also focus on the comparison of similarities and differences between Chinese and western cultures, cultivating students' awareness of intercultural communication and sensitivity. Second, teachers must hold a correct view of the relationship between teaching and learning, and develop students' ability of self-learning and self-improvement by means of teaching English knowledge and improving language ability. If permitted, the background of foreign teachers can be efficiently used. Finally, strengthening students' cultural awareness of their native languages is very important, which can be of great help to promote their language and culture competence, thus to cultivate students' intercultural communication ability.","[Ren, Ling; Cui, Lihua] Anshan Normal Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Anshan, Peoples R China",Anshan Normal University,"Ren, L (通讯作者)，Anshan Normal Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Anshan, Peoples R China.",renling416@163.com; lihuacui0220@163.com,,,,,,,5,0,0,1,6,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-436-1,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2017,107.0,,,,,,133,137,,,,,,5,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BJ6OF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426885200035,0

Business logistics, under the influence of globalization and the rapid development of technology and systems, is transformed into modern logistics, which is a significant source of competitive advantage in the market. The process of globalization also has a significant impact on logistics itself, as logistics has globalization functions in international chain and flow of goods. This creates a relationship between globalization and logistics, with logistics being the strategic management of chains, with a view to customer satisfaction and synergy effect. Every company should reflect this fact, which should be flexibly adapted to market needs. The current dynamic time brings change, new challenges and tendencies in logistics itself. If a company wants to stand up to a competitive struggle, it must be subordinate to it, track its development, and integrate new ways, methods, techniques, approaches, and business logistics technologies into its genesis.

At the same time there has been a deepening of globalization through, for example, international value added chains. This influenced the development of macroeconomic indicators especially in small open countries, but the greatest attention of economists and wider public was attracted by the revision of Irish national accounts and balance of payments in July 2016. Consistent application of new rules for capturing economic transactions in combination with movement of several global companies with the whole balance sheets to Ireland caused unprecedented increase of Irish GDP.

There is a variety of food allergies or diseases requiring adherence to a specific diet regime. An important group is formed by people with gluten intolerance. Epidemiological studies conducted over the last decade have revealed the fact that celiac disease is one of the world's most widespread life-long illnesses. It is therefore possible to say that in the case of food allergies this is a global problem (globalization). Although drugs are being tested to supplement or even completely replace the gluten-free diet, to effectively deal with celiac disease is currently possible only by adhering to a gluten-free diet. These consumers must therefore look for foods that meet their health requirements in their composition. Distribution of food for gluten-free diet is subject to a number of different constraints. In general, groceries intended for special nutrition in the retail network of stores are difficult to access and expensive compared to conventional foods. The aim of the paper is to show the current level of gluten-free food. It also compares the availability of gluten-free food in the retail network compared to 2012 and 2016. Information about the assortment of offered gluten-free foods, including price levels were determined through field surveys in five selected types of retail outlets (hypermarket, supermarket, superretum, shop with service, e-commerce) in the whole country.","[Salkova, Daniela; Eichler, Michal] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Trade & Finance, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Salkova, D (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Trade & Finance, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521, Czech Republic.",salkova@pef.czu.cz; eichler@pef.czu.cz,"Šálková, Daniela/H-4401-2018",,Internal Grant Agency (IGA) FEM CULS in Prague [20171014],Internal Grant Agency (IGA) FEM CULS in Prague,"This article was supported by the Internal Grant Agency (IGA) FEM CULS in Prague, No. 20171014 - Optimizing the distribution of food intended for special nutrition with a focus on gluten-free products.",,17,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2260,2266,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059204022,0

The challenging for last mile of creating available electronic services is aimed to increasing the citizen's comfort, eliminating bureaucracy and increasing the efficiency of public administration, through the openness and cooperation of public authorities with the business sector. Results of negotiations are implemented to operational programs and reforms to create a pro-client-oriented public administration. Nordic countries, Estonia and UK serve as an example, well designed electronic public services. Although eGovernment offers great potential for increasing interaction between public administration and citizen, its implementation is dependent on several factors. The contribution points to existing barriers from the perspective of the public administration - in particular from the point of view of legislation, funding, or organization, and from citizens - in the form of digital literacy or fear of lack of support.

The importance of sport has also increased since European governments have begun to invest more in this sector for its positive role. These reasons change the character of the perception of sport as a new scientific discipline and hence of the industry that has its considerable economic power. At the same time, it is necessary to look at this industry from the managerial point of view, considering the specificities that are typical for the management of organizations operating in sport. The aim of this paper is to point out the new trends in management in sports industry in Slovakia and in the world under the influence of globalization.

An online survey with a sample of 500 Slovak and Czech consumers was carried out with the main goal to describe Nivea as a person, characterize the friends of the brand and suggest hobbies of the brand. In general, Nivea is seen as a sensitive, caring and kind person with strong connection to family, beauty and cosmetic. Slight differences were found when comparing the Slovak and Czech perception. The cultural differences result in differences of perception and attitude regarding brands. Therefore, it is beneficial to examine the global brands in national contexts.

Most countries have limited biomass resources and policy goals beyond carbon reduction. This can lead to policy incoherence. Previous studies tended to focus on one end-use sector or on optimising CO2 reduction. This study goes beyond optimisation approaches and investigates cross sector impacts of bioenergy policy proposals via simulation methods for policy proposals in Ireland. As an EU member with ambition for increased bioenergy use, Ireland is a useful case to examine trade-offs. Using the BioHEAT policy decision support tool (Durusut et al., 2018) we find policy in the heat and transport sector close the gap to Ireland's 2030 climate targets by 3%. Policy supporting co-firing of biomass with fossil-fuel to produce electricity increases emissions by 8.3 MtCO(2) overall and reduces the policy impact on national climate targets by 63%. Co-firing uses more of the available biomass resources and this limits renewable uptake in the heat sector. Coal conversions and the use of advanced biofuels are found to rely on high availability of imports. Policy supporting biomass use in the power sector may make national climate targets less achievable for EU countries.","[Clancy, John Matthew; O'Gallachoir, Brian] Univ Coll Cork, Environm Res Inst, MaREI Ctr Marine & Renewable Energy, Cork, Ireland; [Clancy, John Matthew; O'Gallachoir, Brian] Univ Coll Cork, Sch Engn, Cork, Ireland; [Clancy, John Matthew] Sustainable Energy Author Ireland, Wilton Pk House,Wilton Pl, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Curtis, John] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Curtis, John] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin 2, Ireland",University College Cork; University College Cork; Trinity College Dublin; Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI),"Clancy, JM (通讯作者)，Sustainable Energy Author Ireland, Wilton Pk House,Wilton Pl, Dublin 2, Ireland.",Matthew.clancy@seai.ie,"Curtis, John/Q-8539-2018; O Gallachoir, Brian O/AAX-3999-2021","Curtis, John/0000-0002-6957-5684; O Gallachoir, Brian/0000-0002-6608-5997; Clancy, Matthew/0000-0001-8399-8440",Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAL); Energy Policy Research Centre at the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI); Science Foundation Ireland [12/RC/2302],Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAL); Energy Policy Research Centre at the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI); Science Foundation Ireland(Science Foundation Ireland),Matthew Clancy's research at UCC is funded by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAL).

However, climate change is an urgent problem - emissions reductions must take place rapidly throughout the coming decades. This raises an important question: how long might it take for individual technologies to emerge from research, find market opportunities and make a tangible impact on emissions reductions? Here, we consider historical evidence for the time a range of energy supply and energy end-use technologies have taken to emerge from invention, diffuse into the market and reach widespread deployment. We find considerable variation, from 20 to almost 70 years. Our findings suggest that the time needed for new technologies to achieve widespread deployment should not be overlooked, and that innovation policy should focus on accelerating the deployment of existing technologies as well as research into new ones.","[Gross, Robert; Hanna, Richard; Heptonstall, Philip] Imperial Coll London, Imperial Coll Ctr Energy Policy & Technol, 16-18 Princes Gardens, London SW7 1NE, England; [Gambhir, Ajay] Imperial Coll London, Grantham Inst, Exhibit Rd, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Speirs, Jamie] Imperial Coll London, Sustainable Gas Inst, 10 Princes Gardens, London SW7 1NA, England",Imperial College London; Imperial College London; Imperial College London,"Hanna, R (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll London, Imperial Coll Ctr Energy Policy & Technol, 16-18 Princes Gardens, London SW7 1NE, England.",r.hanna@imperial.ac.uk,"Hanna, Richard/HCH-3014-2022; Speirs, Jamie/ABD-8770-2020","Speirs, Jamie/0000-0002-6729-9831; Gambhir, Ajay/0000-0002-5079-4537; Heptonstall, Philip/0000-0001-8411-6673",UK Research and Innovation Energy Programme [EP/L024756/1]; Committee on Climate Change; EPSRC [EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: UKRI,UK Research and Innovation Energy Programme; Committee on Climate Change; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"The research presented in this paper was undertaken as part of the research programme of the UK Energy Research Centre - Phase 3, which is funded by the UK Research and Innovation Energy Programme (Grant reference EP/L024756/1).

We combine detailed Dutch household survey data on media usage, inflation perceptions, and inflation expectations. We find no evidence that more-often informed members of the general public do better in understanding inflation. In fact, more frequent readership of popular newspapers is associated with slightly less accurate inflation perceptions. There is also no evidence that usage of non-print media leads to more accurate of views on inflation. One implication of these results is that central banks might need to consider more direct ways of engaging with the general public.","[Jansen, David-Jan] Nederlandsche Bank, Financial Stabil Div, NL-1000 AB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Neuenkirch, Matthias] Univ Trier, Fac Econ 4, D-54296 Trier, Germany; [Neuenkirch, Matthias] CESifo, Munich, Germany",European Central Bank; De Nederlandsche Bank NV; Universitat Trier; Ifo Institut,"Jansen, DJ (通讯作者)，Nederlandsche Bank, Financial Stabil Div, NL-1000 AB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",djansenresearch@gmail.com,,"Jansen, David-Jan/0000-0002-6397-6460",,,,,29,5,5,1,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

J,"Jefferson, M",,,,"Jefferson, Michael",,,Renewable and low carbon technologies policy,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Challenges; Transition; Need for realism; Costs,,"Over the past twenty years there has emerged widening interest in shifting to a lower carbon world. This has primarily been motivated by fears of human-induced climatic change, growing risks to sustainable development, concerns about the continuing availability and affordability of useful energy, and opportunities for investment gains. Promotion of renewable forms of energy, and related technologies, has been considered the way forward, for understandable reasons. But some major challenges have been overlooked, sidestepped, and/or sometimes denied on spurious grounds - examples can be noted in biomass, biofuel, wind, solar, and estuarine barrage or tidal lagoon schemes, for example. Technologies are proposed and discussed which may, and hopefully will, assist in meeting the various challenges, but such proposals and discussions often exhibit excessive optimism about likely transition times and scale of contribution. Already massive subsidies provided or supported by many industrialised country governments to foster renewable forms of energy have had major impacts on electricity prices, fuel poverty, and cut-offs of domestic supplies. Further down the line, the relatively low power densities of renewable forms of energy, their relatively poor energy returns on energy invested (EROI), and a tendency to overstate emissions reductions (by not including emissions 'embedded' in imports), will bring increased realisation that there may not be a fantastic evolution just ahead of our time, as has been claimed.","[Jefferson, Michael] ESCP Europe Business Sch, 527 Finchley Rd, London NW3 7BG, England",heSam Universite; ESCP Business School,"Jefferson, M (通讯作者)，ESCP Europe Business Sch, 527 Finchley Rd, London NW3 7BG, England.",mjefferson@escpeurope.eu,,,,,,,26,9,11,1,25,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2018,123.0,,,,,,367,372,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.07.039,0.0,,,6,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HE6FW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000453499700037,0

This paper identifies administrative factors and market barriers as the main causes of renewable curtailment. In 2017, the Northwest Power Grid (NWPG) successfully implemented a variety of approaches to reduce wind and solar curtailment. In this paper, we analyze the change in power generation, expansion of renewable energy delivery, and electricity-replacement projects across provinces that occurred in 2017. While acknowledging the practical results of the NWPG's efforts, we identify challenges that the northwest still faces in integrating renewable energy. We argue that trans-regional administrative barriers are preventing the effective utilization of renewable energy nationwide. To address those barriers, we explore market-based mechanisms for promoting the integration of large-scale renewable energy. In addition to long-term contracts for renewable energy across provinces, both spot-market and the ancillary service market would facilitate the uptake of renewable energy. In addition, price signals should be used to guide peak shaving. Market mechanisms will be insightful to dissolve barriers and enhance utilization of renewable energy throughout the country.","[Liu, Shiyu; Bie, Zhaohong; Wang, Xifan] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Smart Grid Key Lab Shaanxi Prov, State Key Lab Elect Insulat & Power Equipment, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Lin, Jiang] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lin, Jiang] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Xi'an Jiaotong University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Bie, ZH (通讯作者)，Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Smart Grid Key Lab Shaanxi Prov, State Key Lab Elect Insulat & Power Equipment, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",liushiyu982@stu.xjtu.edu.cn; zhbie@mail.xjtu.edu.cn; j_lin@lbl.gov; xfwang@xjtu.edu.cn,"liu, shiyu/JSL-3045-2023; liu, shiyu/HTR-8039-2023","Bie, Zhaohong/0000-0002-8458-0887","National Science Foundation of China [U1610122, 51577147]; Hewlett Foundation through the U.S. Department of Energy under Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; MJS",National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Hewlett Foundation through the U.S. Department of Energy under Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; MJS,"We appreciate National Science Foundation of China for supporting this study (U1610122, 51577147).

We analyze which US regions have benefited from air quality improvements realized since adoption of two Clean Air Act power plant rules, the transport and mercury rules, which have been targeted by lobbyists and national officials. For 20 coal states, we create a pre-regulatory emissions scenario for the current (2016) fleet of power plants. Using the US Environmental Protection Agency's CO-Benefits Risk Assessment screening model, we estimate the differences between the impacts of pre-regulatory emissions and current emissions on fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations and on public health. We compare those impacts with voting patterns in the 2016 presidential election and with demographic data. Among the air quality and public health gains of the current situation relative to the pre-regulatory scenario are that: annual average PM2.5 concentrations are lower by 1-5 mu g/m3; 17,176-39,291 premature mortalities are avoided for each year of lower emissions; coal mining counties and White, rural counties experience some of the best improvements in air quality; and, in several states, Trump counties benefit more than Clinton counties.

The paper proposes to fill this gap and to show that network analysis can explain clusters success, failure, and transition from one phase of the life cycle to another. In this perspective, we build and study the innovation networks of three clusters over a 10-year period. We find that clusters' growth is all but smooth and that low assortativity and preferential attachment among agents can constitute safeguards against clusters decline. These observations support contributions advocating for non-deterministic life cycles in which clusters can still grow, even after a period of pronounced decline.","[Desmarchelier, Benoit] Univ Lille, Lille, France; [Zhang, Linjia] Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Suzhou, Peoples R China",Universite de Lille; Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University,"Desmarchelier, B (通讯作者)，Univ Lille, Lille, France.",benoit.desmarchelier@univ-lille.fr,"zhang, linjia/R-1373-2019","zhang, linjia/0000-0002-4675-6511; Desmarchelier, Benoit/0000-0001-7981-192X",National Social Science Foundation of China [14BJY108],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),"This work benefited from the support of the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 14BJY108).

After entering into World Trade Organization in 2001, China has accelerated to become an extroverted economy through international openness. In the global specialization, a Global Value Chain (GVC) has been formed across economies. China has become an active player in this regard but stood in low value-added positions, which has been called the world's factory. Manufacturing products for the whole world leads to the explosive growth of China's energy consumption and CO2 emissions after 2003, but enterprises can also learn from developed countries due to diffusion of technology and managerial experience. By far, the precise role of China's moving-up GVC in its energy and environmental efficiency is still unknown. This paper conducts an empirical analysis on this issue by measuring the position of China's industries in GVC and their energy and environmental efficiency as well, and then setting up mixed simultaneous equations containing a Tobit model. The results show a positive feedback loop between GVC positions and energy and environmental efficiency. We further find rise in GVC positions accounts for 35% of energy and environmental efficiency improvement over the sample period.","[Liu, Hongxun; Li, Jianglong] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Long, Houyin] Ningde Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Ningde 352100, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhi] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, China Ctr Energy Econ Res, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Le, Canyu] Xiamen Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China",Xi'an Jiaotong University; Ningde Normal University; Xiamen University; Xiamen University,"Long, HY (通讯作者)，Ningde Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Ningde 352100, Fujian, Peoples R China.;Li, Z (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, China Ctr Energy Econ Res, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.",longhouyin1985@163.com; lzivy@xmu.edu.cn,"Liu, Hongxun/V-7500-2019; LIU, JIALIN/JXN-8034-2024; zhou, yang/JED-3951-2023",,National Social Science Foundation of China [17CJY071],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),This paper is supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 17CJY071).,,47,77,82,9,127,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2018,121.0,,,,,,175,184,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.06.024,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV3HA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445983800017,0

On the one hand, TSOs are accessing flexibility resources connected to the distribution grid. On the other hand, DSOs are actively managing distribution grid congestion, moving away from the conventional fit and forget approach. As a result, the need for DSO-TSO cooperation has become increasingly important. In this study, we first discuss market and grid operation issues related to different system states and the corresponding congestion management approaches, in the context of the European electricity market design and regulation. Second, we discuss viable solutions that are inspired by inter-TSO cooperation solutions as well as solutions that are being adopted by DSOs. Our findings show that the issues are rather similar both at transmission and distribution level; however, the need for cooperation and the solutions will depend on where structural congestion will occur and which borders will be managed. We also note that cooperation between DSOs as well as between DSOs and microgrids could become more important with the development of local energy markets in the long term.","[Hadush, Samson Yemane; Meeus, Leonardo] Vlerick Business Sch, Energy Ctr, Ghent, Belgium; [Meeus, Leonardo] European Univ Inst, Florence Sch Regulat, Fiesole, FI, Italy",Vlerick Business School; European University Institute,"Hadush, SY (通讯作者)，Vlerick Business Sch, Energy Ctr, Ghent, Belgium.",samson.hadush@gmail.com,"Meeus, Leonardo/GPP-4042-2022","Meeus, Leonardo/0000-0003-1490-816X",,,,,50,80,85,2,17,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2018,120.0,,,,,,610,621,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.065,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO6DC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440123300057,0

In spite of remarkable achievements, a number of issues still need to be addressed. By employing content analysis, this article codes policy texts and then analyzes the Chinese policies of targeted poverty alleviation using photovoltaic power from two points of view: the basic policy instruments and the project procedures. Results indicate that the government emphasizes three types of basic policy instruments; goal programming, financing support and infrastructure construction. Compared to the number of supply-type policies and environmental-type policies, there is a deficiency in demand-oriented policy instruments. In terms of the project procedures, the policies of photovoltaic-based targeted poverty alleviation are concentrated on project construction and electric power (agricultural product) sales, followed by photovoltaic income distribution. The study suggests four main policies: i) there should be a reduction in the use of policy instruments pertaining to goal programming and an increase in the use of economic policy instruments; ii) re-examine the identification policies for low-income families; iii) deem operation and maintenance policy instrument of photovoltaic project phases to be important and reinforce technical support; iv) perfect the formulation of performance assessment policies, and strengthen dynamic management of photovoltaic projects.","[Zhang, Huiming] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Huiming; Xu, Zhidong] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Sun, Chuanwang] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, China Ctr Energy Econ Res, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Elahi, Ehsan] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Xiamen University; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Zhang, HM (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Zhang, HM (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",hm.zhang_16@163.com,"Zhang, Huiming/HZH-4348-2023; Elahi, Ehsan/ABB-2791-2020; Zhang, Huiming/G-9083-2015; Sun, Chuanwang/JOZ-8733-2023","Sun, Chuanwang/0000-0002-1900-4699; Elahi, Ehsan/0000-0001-7848-8024",National Social Science Foundation of China [13CGL094]; Jiangsu Natural Science Foundation [BK20151527]; Top-notch Academic Programs Project of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; Jiangsu Qinglan Project; Six Talents Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province [2015-XNY-008]; Outstanding Team Building Project for Jiangsu Philosophy and Social Science of Universities [2015ZSTD006]; Key Projects for the Universities' Philosophy and Social Sciences in Jiangsu Province [2016ZDIXM019],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Jiangsu Natural Science Foundation(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); Top-notch Academic Programs Project of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; Jiangsu Qinglan Project; Six Talents Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province; Outstanding Team Building Project for Jiangsu Philosophy and Social Science of Universities; Key Projects for the Universities' Philosophy and Social Sciences in Jiangsu Province,"This study is funded by National Social Science Foundation of China (No. 13CGL094), Jiangsu Natural Science Foundation (No. BK20151527), Top-notch Academic Programs Project of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions, A Project Funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions, Jiangsu Qinglan Project, Six Talents Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province (2015-XNY-008), Outstanding Team Building Project for Jiangsu Philosophy and Social Science of Universities (2015ZSTD006), Key Projects for the Universities' Philosophy and Social Sciences in Jiangsu Province (2016ZDIXM019).",,43,82,86,14,212,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2018,120.0,,,,,,550,558,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.06.004,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO6DC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440123300051,0

Building on the results, we make a twofold contribution. First, we propose a novel stable money demand equation relying on two crucial factors: a speculative motive, represented by domestic and foreign price-earnings ratios, and a precautionary motive, measured by changes in unemployment. Second, we use the model to derive relevant policy implications for the ECB, since excess liquidity looks more useful for forecasting stock market busts than future inflation. Overall, this evidence points to (i) a possible evolution of the monetary pillar in the direction of pursuing financial stability and (ii) the exclusion of a sudden liquidity-driven inflationary burst after the exit from the prolonged period of unconventional monetary measures.","[Barigozzi, Matteo] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England; [Conti, Antonio M.] Banca Italia, Econ Outlook & Monetary Policy Dept, Rome, Italy; [Conti, Antonio M.] Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, Brussels, Belgium",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; European Central Bank; Bank of Italy; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Conti, AM (通讯作者)，Banca Italia, Econ Outlook & Monetary Policy Dept, Rome, Italy.;Conti, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, Brussels, Belgium.",antoniomaria.conti@bancaditalia.it,"Barigozzi, Matteo/B-7145-2017","Barigozzi, Matteo/0000-0001-9090-5708",,,,,69,6,6,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

Such systems may exhibit drastic changes in their dynamics known as bifurcations; one important being the so called blue sky catastrophe. Once reaching such a state, the slow system becomes unresponsive to the changes in the fast system. For the energy-policy nexus this translates into the energy system becoming unresponsive to policy interventions leading to a freeze in the system dynamics. Application of this result allows us to argue that caution is needed when updating economic policies to achieve a faster transition towards a low carbon energy supply structure. To avoid this risk the policy design should be aimed at long term incentive structures with less frequent but more consistent interventions.","[Bondarev, Anton; Weigt, Hannes] Univ Basel, Fac Business & Econ, Peter Merian Weg 6, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland",University of Basel,"Weigt, H (通讯作者)，Univ Basel, Fac Business & Econ, Peter Merian Weg 6, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.",anton.bondarev@unibas.ch; hannes.weigt@unibas.ch,"Bondarev, Anton/AAN-2622-2021; Bondarev, Anton/AAD-1506-2021","Bondarev, Anton/0000-0003-4572-2405; Weigt, Hannes/0000-0002-2036-9177",Swiss Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI) [KTI. 1155000154s],Swiss Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI),"This research is part of the activities of SCCER CREST (Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research), which is financially supported by the Swiss Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI) (Grant No. KTI. 1155000154s).

But such instances are not limited to the financial sector. We argue that if policymakers and regulators are not vigilant, a similar situation could occur in the electricity sector. So far this industry has only experienced occasional problems, but we can observe several precursory signals indicating that these problems might become more frequent. These include a tendency to globalisation in the absence of a supra-national regulator and the disruption caused by large amounts of renewable energies, resulting in companies being stranded with loss-making thermal generators. Still, these units are essential for the electricity supply security. We discuss several cases illustrating these trends. We conclude with a discussion of how electricity regulators and policymakers should approach the too big to fail problem, focussing both on preventive measures that can be taken to keep such a situation from occurring and on proactive actions aimed at avoiding a crisis once a system-critical company seems at risk of collapsing.","[Larsen, Erik R.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Management, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark; [van Ackere, Ann; Osorio, Sebastian] Univ Lausanne, HEC, Batiment Anthropole, CH-1015 Dorigny, Switzerland; [Osorio, Sebastian] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany",Aarhus University; University of Lausanne; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Osorio, S (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, HEC, Batiment Anthropole, CH-1015 Dorigny, Switzerland.;Osorio, S (通讯作者)，Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.",erik.larsen@mgmt.au.dk; ann.vanackere@unil.ch; sebastian.osorio@pik-potsdam.de,,"osorio, sebastian/0000-0002-1383-6195",Swiss National Science Foundation [100018_169376]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [100018_169376] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF),Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"We gratefully acknowledge support from the Swiss National Science Foundation, Grant 100018_169376, 2016-2019.",,59,6,6,0,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2018,119.0,,,,,,696,703,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.010,0.0,,,15,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO0XY,,"Green Accepted, hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439671200064,0

However, a lack of quantitative research has resulted in disagreements about the most suitable energy transition strategy for Korea. To evaluate the policy, we designed a quantitative analysis that simulates generation scheduling and settlement processes in the Korean power market. We then analyze the economic impacts, conflicts of interest, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the power system's market price sensitivity to the price of imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) in four energy transition scenarios: i) the government's new energy transition policy, ii) phase-out of nuclear energy, iii) phase-out of coal energy, and iv) simultaneous phase-out of nuclear and coal energy. Additionally, we evaluated the effects of coal taxation. Based on the power market simulation results, we conclude that phasing out nuclear energy with increasing taxation of coal, or only phasing out coal energy are two reasonable scenarios for energy transition in Korea. The simultaneous phase-out of nuclear and coal energy, which was originally pursued by the government, is inferior to the recommended scenarios in the aspects evaluated. Policymakers should consider these results when developing feasible energy transition scenarios.","[Song, Yong Hyun; Kim, Hyun Joong; Kim, Seung Wan; Yoon, Yong Tae] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Elect Power Network Econ Lab, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Kim, Seung Wan] Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Energy Policy Res Grp, Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England; [Jin, Young Gyu] Jeju Natl Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Power Syst Econ Lab, 102 Jejudaehak Ro, Jeju Isl 63243, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); University of Cambridge; Jeju National University,"Kim, SW (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Elect Power Network Econ Lab, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea.;Kim, SW (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Energy Policy Res Grp, Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England.",pc9873@snu.ac.kr,,"Kim, Seung Wan/0000-0002-9553-1722",,,,,20,8,8,1,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2018,119.0,,,,,,396,409,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.002,0.0,,,27,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO0XY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439671200037,0

It was found that these structural properties are mediated by migration dynamics and inter-area distance, and the patterns of varying structural properties across areas of different connectivity reveal the hub-and-spoke structure of the networks.

We argue that networks that are more integrated in the society of the host country can provide more accurate information to future migrants about job prospects. In a decision model with imperfect signalling, we show that migrants with access to a better network are more likely to make the right decision, that is, they migrate only if they gain. We test these predictions empirically using data on recent Mexican migrants to the United States. To instrument for the quality of networks, we exploit the settlement of immigrants who came during the Bracero program in the 1950s. The results are consistent with the model predictions, providing evidence that connections to a better integrated network lead to better outcomes after migration.","[Elsner, Benjamin] Inst Lab Econ IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Narciso, Gaia] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin, Ireland; [Thijssen, Jacco] Univ York, York Management Sch, York, N Yorkshire, England",IZA Institute Labor Economics; Trinity College Dublin; University of York - UK,"Elsner, B (通讯作者)，Inst Lab Econ IZA, Bonn, Germany.",elsner@iza.org; narcisog@tcd.ie; jacco.thijssen@york.ac.uk,"Narciso, Gaia/AAB-2955-2022","Thijssen, Jacco Johan Jacob/0000-0001-6207-5647; Narciso, Gaia/0000-0003-3532-6337",Irish Research Council for the Humanities & Social Sciences (IRCHSS),Irish Research Council for the Humanities & Social Sciences (IRCHSS),"We would like to thank the Editor, two anonymous referees, as well as Simone Bertoli, Herbert Brucker, Joanna Clifton-Sprigg, Tommaso Colussi, Margherita Comola, Christian Danne, Rachel Griffith, Joachim Jarreau, Julia Matz, Imran Rasul, Bas ter Weel, Mathis Wagner and seminar participants at IZA, University College Dublin, the University of Southern Denmark, as well as the conferences ISNE, TEMPO, IEA, ESEM, OECD immigration workshop, RES, NORFACE, ESPE, EALE, IZA/SOLE for helpful comments.

However, the technical characteristics of electricity transmission reduce the available cross-border capacity due to unscheduled flows in a zonal pricing framework. Using the detailed unit commitment and dispatch model stELMOD for the European system, we analyze the development of unscheduled flows under different market and network design scenarios for 2020. We apply ACER's flow definition to decompose commercial schedules and physical flows into unscheduled flows and its fractions, i.e. loop and unallocated flows. Our analysis reveals that unscheduled flows increase on average by 47% from 14.7 GW in 2013 to 21.7 GW in 2020 mainly driven by higher cross-border trade capacities and increasing renewable generation. These unscheduled flows, which affect adjacent countries through e.g. a reduction of tradeable cross-border capacity, can be effectively reduced through a delimitation of bidding zones or HVDC network expansion. Thus, even if a discussion of national impacts of national and European policies is inevitable, they can have substantial implications on adjacent regions through the interconnected electricity system. Therefore, a system-wide view should complement national perspectives to ensure an efficient system development with increasing shares of intermittent renewable generation.","[Kunz, Friedrich] German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Kunz, F (通讯作者)，German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",fkunz@diw.de,,,German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy; [03ET4028B],German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy;,"This work was carried out within the project LKD-EU - Long-term planning and short-term optimization of the electricity system in Germany (grant number 03ET4028B), the author gratefully acknowledges the financial support by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy.

This trend has been spurred on so as to reduce both carbon dioxide emissions and external energy dependency. One would expect the larger penetration of renewable energies to provoke a substitution effect of fossil fuels by renewable sources, in the electricity generation mix. However, this effect is far from evident in the literature. This paper thus contributes to clarifying whether the effect exists and, if so, the characteristics of the effect by source. Three approaches, generation, capacity and demand, were analysed jointly to accomplish the main aim of this study. An autoregressive distributed lag model was estimated using the Driscoll and Kraay estimator with fixed effects, to analyse ten European countries in a time-span from 1990 until 2014. The paper provides evidence for the substitution effect in solar PV and hydropower, but not in wind power sources. Indeed, the generation approach highlights the necessity for flexible and controllable electricity production from natural gas and hydropower to back up renewable sources. Moreover, the results prove that peaks of electricity have been an obstacle to the accommodation of intermittent renewable sources.","[Marques, Antonio Cardoso] Univ Beira Interior, Rua Marques dAvila e Bolama, P-6201001 Covilha, Portugal; NECE UBI Management & Econ Dept, Rua Marques dAvila e Bolama, P-6201001 Covilha, Portugal",Universidade da Beira Interior,"Marques, AC (通讯作者)，Univ Beira Interior, Rua Marques dAvila e Bolama, P-6201001 Covilha, Portugal.",amarques@ubi.pt,"Marques, António Cardoso/D-2235-2011; Fuinhas, José Alberto/P-1603-2017; Pereira, Diogo Santos/F-9545-2019","Marques, António Cardoso/0000-0002-9906-3874; Fuinhas, José Alberto/0000-0002-6937-5420; Pereira, Diogo Santos/0000-0001-8290-5505",NECE-UBI - Research Unit in Business Science and Economics - Portuguese Foundation for the Development of Science and Technology [UID/GES/04630/2013],NECE-UBI - Research Unit in Business Science and Economics - Portuguese Foundation for the Development of Science and Technology,"The financial support of the NECE-UBI - Research Unit in Business Science and Economics, project number UID/GES/04630/2013, sponsored by the Portuguese Foundation for the Development of Science and Technology is gratefully acknowledged.

However there is a significant financing gap and many policymakers are concerned that investment for the large-scale deployment of low-carbon technologies will not materialise quickly enough. State investment banks (SIBs) can play a key role in closing this finance gap and leverage additional private finance. Based on 52 interviews, this paper presents empirical evidence on the role of three SIBs in addressing the barriers to financing low-carbon energy projects; the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) in Australia, the Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (KfW) in Germany and the Green Investment Bank (GIB) in the UK. We investigate the activities and financial instruments offered by SIBs and compare these to the need for such from low-carbon developers when sourcing finance. Findings show that aside from capital provision and de-risking, SIBs take a much broader role in catalysing private investments into low-carbon investments, including enabling financial sector learning, creating trust for projects and taking a first or early mover role to help projects gain a track record.","[Geddes, Anna] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Climate Policy, Univ Str 22, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Geddes, Anna; Schmidt, Tobias S.; Steffen, Bjarne] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Energy Polit Grp, Dept Humanities Social & Polit Sci, Haldeneggsteig 4, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Geddes, A (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Climate Policy, Univ Str 22, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",anna.geddes@hotmail.co.uk,"Geddes, Anna/AAU-4867-2020","Schmidt, Tobias/0000-0002-7971-2187; Steffen, Bjarne/0000-0003-2219-1402","European Research Council [313553]; Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI) [16.0222]; European Union [730403]; European Research Council (ERC) [313553] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)","European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI); European Union(European Union (EU)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government)","We sincerely thank two anonymous reviewers for very constructive comments on a previous version of this manuscript.

Balancing demand and supply is a recurrent problem in the Nigerian electricity market. The aim of this work is to assess the technical and economic potential of Demand Side Management (DSM) in Nigeria given different future levels of industrialisation. The paper places industrialisation at the centrefold of the appraisal of DSM potential in Nigeria. It does so by designing industrialisation scenarios and consequently deriving different DSM penetration levels using a cost-optimisation model. Findings show that under the high industrialisation scenario by the year 2050 DSM could bring about 7 billion USD in cumulative savings thanks to deferred investment in new generation and full deployment of standby assets along with interruptible programmes for larger industrial users. The paper concludes by providing policy recommendations regarding financial mechanisms to increase DSM deployment in Nigeria. The focus on DSM serves to shift the policy debate on electricity in Nigeria from a static state versus market narrative on supply to an engagement with the agency and influence on industrial end-users.,"[Ikpe, Eka] Kings Coll London, African Leadership Ctr, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Torriti, Jacopo] Univ Reading, Sch Built Environm, Whiteknights Campus, Reading RG6 6AY, Berks, England",University of London; King's College London; University of Reading,"Torriti, J (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Sch Built Environm, Whiteknights Campus, Reading RG6 6AY, Berks, England.",j.torriti@reading.ac.uk,,"Torriti, Jacopo/0000-0003-0569-039X; Ikpe, Eka/0000-0002-4859-3592",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/P000630/1]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/P000630/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/P000630/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (grant number EP/P000630/1).,,58,18,18,1,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,APR,2018,115.0,,,,,,207,215,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.011,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GA1TH,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428099800021,0

The individual effects are allowed to be correlated with the regressors, and the comparison is carried out in terms of an exponent coefficient, , which measures the degree of pervasiveness of the FE in the panel. The use of allows us to distinguish between poolability of small N dimensional panels with large T from large N dimensional panels with small T. It is shown that the pooled estimator remains consistent so long as delta<1, and is asymptotically normally distributed if delta <1/2, for a fixed T and as N. It is further shown that when delta<1/2, the pooled estimator is more efficient than the FE estimator. We also propose a Hausman type diagnostic test of delta<1/2 as a simple test of poolability, and propose a pretest estimator that could be used in practice. Monte Carlo evidence supports the main theoretical findings and gives some indications of gains to be made from pooling when delta <1/2.","[Pesaran, M.

Notwithstanding the international character of the Great Recession, the different local structural features might have influenced the economic and social impact of the crisis, determining effects on the resilience and recovery chance. In this paper, we focus on the role of different territorial indicators by looking at how their relevance has changed during the recent crisis at provincial level. Our aim is threefold. First, we identify the strategic territorial elements which might be particularly relevant in ensuring a greater local absorption capacity. Second, we test whether the crisis has increased the role of specific local factors. In doing that, we use different measures of performance (GDP, exports and employment). Third, we control for macro-regional characteristics (i.e., North versus South) and local specific effects through a panel analysis of the dynamics of the performance variables in three sub-periods over the years 2000-2014. For that purpose, we use a multidimensional dataset for Italian provinces aiming at estimating the empirical relations between the set of territorial elements (i.e., the components of the so-called territorial capital) and the change in local performance. The results stress the role of some localized variables (i.e., human and cultural/natural/capital, agglomeration economies) over the whole period and the changing role of other territorial dimensions (material and non-material) according to the performance variable considered and during the crisis.","[Mazzola, Fabio; Lo Cascio, Iolanda; Epifanio, Rosalia] Univ Palermo, Dept Econ Business & Stat, Viale Sci,Bldg 13, I-90128 Palermo, Italy; [Di Giacomo, Giuseppe] Via 20 Settembre 97, I-00187 Rome, Italy",University of Palermo,"Mazzola, F (通讯作者)，Univ Palermo, Dept Econ Business & Stat, Viale Sci,Bldg 13, I-90128 Palermo, Italy.",fabio.mazzola@unipa.it; iolanda.locascio@unipa.it; rosalia.epifanio@unipa.it; giuseppe.digiacomo@tesoro.it,,"LO CASCIO, Iolanda/0000-0003-0131-2412","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR) [2008PP5E98]","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR)(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","This work was supported by the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR), Grant Project Number: 2008PP5E98.",,90,27,29,1,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

To evaluate how the transition to EVs can be achieved through fiscal policy incentives, a dynamic simulation modelling of the integrated energy -transport system with a detailed representation of energy technologies and vehicle fleets is implemented. The model is used for a scenario analysis by incorporating key fiscal parameters including different taxes and subsidies on vehicles and fuels. The fiscal policies to induce EVs, which are applied to both vehicle usage pattern and upfront purchase cost, include petroleum fuel tax levies, vehicle tax exemption, extra fees and subsidies. Five fiscal-induced scenarios to promote EVs, including different subsidy and feebate schemes coupled with fuel tax incentives, are compared with a BAU case.

In this regard, the electricity production sector deserves particular attention. The sector has the largest decarbonization potential and its share of the world's CO2 emissions from fuel combustion increased from 30% in 1990 to 36% in 2014. To better understand global trends, this study analyses the factors influencing changes in the global aggregate carbon intensity (ACI) of electricity, a measure of the level of CO2 emissions per unit of electricity produced, over the last 25 years using multidimensional index decomposition analysis. It finds that global ACI barely improved since 1990 because of a shift in electricity production from developed to developing countries with higher ACIs. This geographical shift offset consistent improvements to power generation efficiency worldwide and is likely to persist in the future. To keep the 2 degrees C target realisable, it is imperative to enhance international cooperation to lower the ACIs of emerging economies and deepen the penetration of renewables, which have thus far performed below expectations.","[Goh, Tian; Ang, B.

By contrast, loser industries, including most of the energy-intensive industries, are mainly affected by the changes of provincial and international markets. ROC region is mainly affected by the price effect. Suggestions about preferential developmental industries are offered to balance the environmental and economic concerns.","[Li, Zhaoling; Yabar, Helmut] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Life & Environm Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan; [Dai, Hancheng] Peking Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Sun, Lu] Univ Tokyo, Gradnnte Sch Frontier Sci, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778563, Japan; [Sun, Lu; Xie, Yang] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Xie, Yang] Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Social Engn, Tokyo 1528550, Japan; [Liu, Zhu] CALTECH, Resnick Sustainabil Inst, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Wang, Peng] Chinese Acad Sci, Guangzhou Inst Energy Convers, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China","University of Tsukuba; Peking University; University of Tokyo; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Tokyo Institute of Technology; California Institute of Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Guangzhou Institute of Energy Conversion, CAS","Dai, HC (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",dai.hancheng@pku.edu.cn,"Yabar, Helmut F./AAA-2912-2020; Liu, Zhu/A-4634-2013; WANG, Peng/GSN-5263-2022; 李, 照令/AAV-6307-2020; Sun, Lu/L-2238-2019; Xie, Yang/F-8522-2018; Dai, Hancheng/Y-8275-2019","Yabar, Helmut F./0000-0002-0093-8256; Liu, Zhu/0000-0002-8968-7050; 李, 照令/0000-0003-2944-3270; Sun, Lu/0000-0001-7356-7866; Xie, Yang/0000-0002-8864-960X; Dai, Hancheng/0000-0003-4251-4707","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71704005, 71603248]; Startup Research Fund of College of Environmental Science and Engineering at Peking University",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Startup Research Fund of College of Environmental Science and Engineering at Peking University,"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71704005, 71603248) and the Startup Research Fund of College of Environmental Science and Engineering at Peking University.",,54,56,57,8,142,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2018,113.0,,,,,,9,19,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.10.048,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FT2XO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423009500002,0

This study establishes the projected marginal abatement cost (MAC) curve of China's passenger car sector over the 2016-2030 period and conducts uncertainty modeling through Monte Carlo simulation. The impacts of uncertainties from oil price, electricity cost, energy-saving potential, incremental investment cost, and emission factor for electricity consumption on emission abatement costs of ESTs are analyzed separately and compared together. Results show that among the five uncertainties, oil price uncertainty has the largest impact on ESTs' emission abatement cost, but the impact does not differ significantly among different technology bundles. Uncertainties in electricity cost and in electricity emission factor affect significantly the MACs of new-energy paths. Compared with the above two uncertainties, uncertainties in energy-saving potential and in incremental investment cost have larger impacts on the MACs of traditional energy-saving paths. Among different vehicle types, the MACs of ESTs on small-displacement private cars are the least affected by various uncertainties.","[Peng, Bin-Bin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Peng, Bin-Bin; Xu, Jin-Hua] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Inst Sci & Dev, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Fan, Ying] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Beihang University","Xu, JH (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Inst Sci & Dev, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",binbinpeng2014@163.com; xujinhua111@163.com; yfan1123@buaa.edu.cn,"Xu, Jin-Hua/AFR-0895-2022","Xu, Jin-Hua/0000-0001-6663-2105","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673266, 71690245, 71210005, 71403263]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Supports from the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 71673266, No. 71690245, No. 71210005, and No. 71403263 are acknowledged.

The most important are the integrated management systems, social responsibility programs, communication strategies and methods for evaluating sustainable performance. The high variety of instruments and evaluating systems for sustainable performance led towards a debate on the need to merge them starting from the plurality of standards that influence the approach and quality of the information used for creating decisions. In this context, we analyzed these instruments in the idea of identifying the impact on society at the global level, in general and especially on businesses.

The argument builds on the position that although world-city network analysis deals with a very specific process both functionally and temporally, it can nonetheless be interpreted as a particular example of a generic practice of inter-city relations. Conceptually, this is achieved through discussions about the notion of central flow theory' and the position of the model in quantitative research on city networks. Empirically, this achieved through a comparison of connectivities of cities created by producer services firms, non-governmental organizations, maritime-producer services firms and global media firms. These multiple analyses represent a decomposition of the current global expression of central flow theory, and examining parallels and differences between these networks allows the stress testing of the model's more generic potential for assessing the increased salience of flows for cities across the world economy. Drawing on the observation that various cities are placed on and off the map' in relation to their specific interlocking to the world economy, we engage with two important critiques of the relevance of this research for understanding cities in globalization, i.e., the post-colonial critique formulated by Jennifer Robinson in 2002 and a denunciation for missing out the state by Goran Therborn in 2011. The paper concludes with a discussion of the ways in which our conceptual modelling and results might begin to be theoretically integrated into a wider theoretical framework centred on central flow theory'.","[Derudder, Ben] Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, Ghent, Belgium; [Taylor, Peter J.] Northumbria Univ, Dept Geog, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England",Ghent University; Northumbria University,"Derudder, B (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, Ghent, Belgium.",ben.derudder@ugent.be; crogfam@gmail.com,"Derudder, Ben/A-1616-2008; Derudder, Ben/ABH-5648-2020","Derudder, Ben/0000-0001-6195-8544",,,,,64,92,106,16,112,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

In lights of these facts, it is necessary to develop suitable algorithm and verify its correct dynamic behavior using simulation first, so this Toolbox can be used in advantage.

The analysis is based on the Slovak social accounting matrix with seven sectors: agriculture, mining and extraction, textiles and clothing, light manufacturing, heavy manufacturing, utilities and construction and services, account of one representative household, savings and investments account, general government and the rest of the world account. In this paper, the general formula for the constrained multiplier is derived. Moreover, the analysis allows choosing exogenous demand components among government, investments or rest of the world. The effect of globalization may be perceived as the unconstrained demand of the rest of the world sector toward the Slovak economy production. It is proved that the unconstrained SAM multipliers overstate the impacts of linkage effects in the economy. The limited supply reaction shows the greatest differences in the services, utilities and agricultures sectors. The research proves that the services sector has the highest multiplier value meaning that an exogenous shock in demand for services sector in volume of 1 mil. USD leads to a total increase of output by 2.75 mil. USD.

Especially airlines are under increasing pressure due to ambitious CO2 reduction targets. To reduce fleet emissions, airlines can purchase modern and fuel efficient aircraft or apply retrofits to the existing fleet (e.g., blended winglets). Decisions on these alternatives are part of airline fleet planning where the development of fleet size and composition is determined. Focusing on the transition towards energy-efficient aviation, this paper investigates the influence of emission thresholds and retrofit options on airline fleet planning by making use of an optimization model. Based on real-world data, the model is applied to two major European airlines for a planning horizon between 2016 and 2025. The results indicate that emission thresholds and retrofits can make a significant contribution to achieving short term emission targets. However, the potential is limited due to existing investment budget constraints and the fact that retrofits are only available for short- to medium-haul aircraft. This calls for the development and certification of further retrofit programs as well as the deployment of further measures such as bio-/electrofuels or hybrid electric aircraft.","[Mueller, Christoph; Kieckhaefer, Karsten; Spengler, Thomas S.] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Automot Management & Ind Prod, Muhlenpfordtstr 23, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany",Braunschweig University of Technology,"Müller, C (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Automot Management & Ind Prod, Muhlenpfordtstr 23, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany.",christ.mueller@tu-braunschweig.de,"Kieckhäfer, Karsten/AAG-8722-2019; sihite, janfry/B-2951-2015; Spengler, Thomas/AAF-6247-2020","Kieckhäfer, Karsten/0000-0002-8571-3805;",Ministry for Science and Culture of Lower Saxony the research project Energy System Transformation in Aviation in the initiative Niedersachsisches Vorab [VWZN3177],Ministry for Science and Culture of Lower Saxony the research project Energy System Transformation in Aviation in the initiative Niedersachsisches Vorab,We would like to acknowledge the support of the Ministry for Science and Culture of Lower Saxony (Grant No. VWZN3177) for funding the research project Energy System Transformation in Aviation in the initiative Niedersachsisches Vorab.,,43,31,33,2,29,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JAN,2018,112.0,,,,,,242,257,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.10.022,0.0,,,16,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FO2NK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416615800025,0

Currently growth process is not only dependent on traditional factors such as supply of labour force, availability of financial capital and level of technology, but intangible factors such as quality of human capital or level of entrepreneurship are becoming important drivers of international competitiveness. The current paper concentrates on this last factor in regard to Polish economy. The article is based on the assumption that the level of entrepreneurship is especially important for growth at regional level. Therefore, the main aim of the research is to analyse similarities between Polish NUTS 3 regions in this regard. In the research, data available in Statistic Poland (Local data bank) were applied. The research was done for the years 2010 and 2015. The period was restricted with the availability of data. In the analysis five diagnostic variables were applied, therefore the subject of the research was considered as a multiple-criteria problem. In the study, the Ward's clustering method was applied, which enabled to group the NUTS 3 regions into homogeneous classes. The research confirms significant disparities in the case of level of entrepreneurship at NUTS 3 level. It can be seen that these disparities are also stable in time, which can confirm relatively low effectiveness of regional policy that is aimed at reducing differences in regional growth potential.","[Rogalska, Elzbieta] Univ Warmia & Mazury, Dept Microecon, Olsztyn, Poland",University of Warmia & Mazury,"Rogalska, E (通讯作者)，Univ Warmia & Mazury, Dept Microecon, Olsztyn, Poland.",ela.n.rogalska@gmail.com,,"Rogalska, Elzbieta/0000-0003-4995-5791",,,,,30,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1308,1315,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300168,0

Organizations need instruments for risk management that would allow to integrate local and global aspects of the risks into the assessment process as well as other specifics of their businesses. At the same time, risk ranking process should adequately prioritize these risks. Compliance with such requirement is not trivial task due to different perception of the risk dimensions in different environments (i.e. on global and local levels). Moreover, managers often cannot specify the values of importance of each risk dimension, so the risk ranking in such conditions is a big challenge. In this article we use Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) for evaluation of the risks (managers may use other convenient approach for evaluation purposes) and Data envelopment analysis (DEA) to rank the risks even with no information on importance weights of the risk factors. We present a modification to the ranking approach so it could overcome some of the limitations of DEA. We compare the standard ranking approaches, used in FMEA and DEA with the modified approach. The proposed approach using Reference set impact (RSI) score has some advantages compared to the standard Reference set frequency (RSF) score: it has lower repeatability and higher precision. Due to the specifics of each approach we discuss their limitations - in particular cases the presented scores may over - or underestimate risks position in ranking list.","[Sheludko, Igor; Kirova, Milena] Univ Ruse Angel Kanchev, Ruse, Bulgaria",University of Ruse,"Sheludko, I (通讯作者)，Univ Ruse Angel Kanchev, Ruse, Bulgaria.",isheludko@uni-ruse.bg; mkirova@uni-ruse.bg,"Sheludko, Igor/HLG-7363-2023","Sheludko, Igor/0000-0001-9208-6689",University of Ruse Angel Kanchev [BG05M2OP001-2.009-0011-.01]; Operational Program Science and Education for Smart Growth 2014 2020 - European Social Fund of the European Union,University of Ruse Angel Kanchev; Operational Program Science and Education for Smart Growth 2014 2020 - European Social Fund of the European Union,"The study was supported by contract of University of Ruse Angel Kanchev,.

The main conclusions of the study are as follows: 1.The level of globalization of this group of countries has increased significantly; 2. The largest increase took place in countries where the level of globalization at the starting point was the lowest and the lowest in the most globalized countries; 3. As a result, the differences between individual countries were significantly diminished (we can see the convergence), 4. The current level of globalization of these countries is mainly the result of the combined action of both systemic transformation and the process of integration with the EU; 5. A small positive correlation exists between GDP per capita and the degree of globalization in this countries; 6. The positive impact of globalization on economic growth in the analyzed group of countries was also noted.","[Swadzba, Stanislaw] Univ Econ Katowice, Ul 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Swadzba, S (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Ul 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland.",stanislaw.swadzba@ue.katowice.pl,,"Swadzba, Stanislaw/0000-0002-9006-3595",,,,,14,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,2862,2869,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300366,0

This research paper is devoted to the simulations and their significant place while creating possible combinations and various alternatives scenarios, which were included within the model and can occur in reality. The first part is focused on core description of simulation as a measuring method of the health quality at the level of enterprise, region or globally. Specifically, there is outlined simulation as a dynamic model in which phenomena occur in the same sequence as in the model system. The essence of the simulation benefits methods for the field of operational research can be observed mainly in facilitating work with dynamics and complicated probable links. If it is possible to create an analytically solvable model that reflects the essential aspects of reality, it is necessary to prioritize it because it is usually more general, and its construction and solutions are less costly. The second part is concerned with initiatives and disadvantages outgoing from the utilizing simulation models. When performing simulation or creating a model, certain limitations must be recognized. Actual systems are very complex, and the details must be determined to be captured in the model. The last part is tackling by model example of simulation handled in Excel program.","[Zadnanova, Silvia; Hraskova, Dagmar] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Zadnanova, S (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",silvia.zadnanova@fpedas.uniza.sk; dagmar.hraskova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"zadnanova, silvia/O-9518-2016",,project Proposal for a methodology for measuring quality of life in a regional context [VEGA: 1/0696/16],project Proposal for a methodology for measuring quality of life in a regional context,This research was financially supported by the project VEGA: 1/0696/16 Proposal for a methodology for measuring quality of life in a regional context.,,29,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,2407,2413,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300308,0

The IAC program has assembled a wealth of data on these assessments, but the database does not include information about participants after the assessment or on non-participants. This study addresses that lack by creating a new linked dataset using the public IAC and non-public data at the Census Bureau. The IAC database excludes detail needed for an exact match, so the study developed a linking methodology to account for uncertainty in the matching process. Based on the linking approach, a difference in difference analysis for SME that received an assessment was done; plants that received an assessment improve their performance over time, relative to industry peers that did not.

Transport currently accounts for nearly half of global oil consumption and is the only field to be almost exclusively based upon a sole primary energy source. A possible evolution might be based on more oil independent vehicles, on a higher use of energy efficient transport modes, on the integration of them through Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). The answer to this partially global problem can be found both in transport and energy planning as well as in the adoption of new industrial and ICT technologies. Both energy strategy makers and transport planners need supporting tools for a better assessment of the impact of possible alternative policies and to set realistic targets for the transport sector.

Our objective is to provide new insights in the ongoing debate on policy measures to promote renewable energy sources. Italian wind auction design is examined by firstly investigating its overall outcomes in terms of cost efficiency and policy effectiveness. Determinants affecting awarded tariffs are then empirically analysed further to explore the role of project-related and firm-specific factors as well as different auction design elements. The extreme simplicity of the auction design undoubtedly has promoted competition, encouraging many project developers to bid and reducing support both in static and dynamic terms. Results provide evidence that localisation factors did not constitute a competitive constraint. From a policy perspective, the administratively setting of ceiling prices is a major issue when wind resources are widely available and auctioned capacity is not sufficiently high. While not limiting competition, the effects of pre-qualification criteria on the realisation rate deserve further analysis. However, doubts emerge on the policy effectiveness of the current support scheme which makes difficult to control the total amount of support provided thus likely causing stop and -go cycles of financing and potentially favouring distorted bidding behaviour.","[Cassetta, Ernesto] Univ Udine, Dept Econ & Stat, Via Tomadini 30-A, I-33100 Udine, Italy; [Monarca, Umberto] Univ Foggia, Dept Econ, Largo Papa Giovanni Paolo II 1, I-71121 Foggia, Italy; [Nava, Consuelo Rubina] Univ Turin, Dept Econ & Stat, Cognetti Martits, Lungo Dora Siena 100A, I-10135 Turin, Italy; [Meleo, Linda] Int Telemat Univ Uninettuno, Corso Vittorio Emanuele II 39, I-00186 Rome, Italy",University of Udine; University of Foggia; University of Turin; UNINETTUNO,"Cassetta, E (通讯作者)，Univ Udine, Dept Econ & Stat, Via Tomadini 30-A, I-33100 Udine, Italy.",ernesto.cassetta@uniud.it; umberto.monarca@unifg.it; cnava@unito.it; l.meleo@uninettunouniversity.net,"Nava, Consuelo/AAH-8788-2020","Nava, Consuelo/0000-0002-8046-8185; MONARCA, UMBERTO/0000-0002-1615-443X; CASSETTA, Ernesto/0000-0002-7876-4903",,,,,71,24,24,0,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2017,110.0,,,,,,662,674,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.08.055,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FP5LK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417660800066,0

In order to explain this phenomenon we conducted an experimental research based on an abductive procedure that has focused our attention on trust. Although trust has been mentioned by many scholars as important component of engagement processes, its multidimensionality has been presented in selective configurations. Drawing on interdisciplinary insights and empirical data, we develop the conceptual meaning of three dimensions of trust in grid extension projects: interpersonal, social and institutional; and we examine how they influence the stakeholder engagement process. Acknowledging diversified meanings of trust we suggest putting more attention to the informal aspects of stakeholder engagement.

A Critical Look at Expectations, Performance and Governance which assesses biofuels contribution to sustainability governance and upscaling. The issue aims to contribute to a more informed, evidence-based policy debate on the role of bioenergy for sustainable development. It comprises six review papers that share a solutions-oriented and policy-focused approach towards the assessment of sustainability. Bioenergy production and consumption is not evaluated as an isolated industry or additionality. Instead, it is assessed as an inherent component of the broader social-ecological system and history of which it forms a part. Synthesizing available empirical evidence on performance, and contextualizing the evidence in view of expectations and bioenergy governance in and over time, the papers address the role of biofuels for climate mitigation; their ability to deliver on socio-economic policy expectations; the actual performance in view of risk anticipation and mitigation; the role of state policy considering sector development and sustainability; and the ability of certification schemes to deliver on market conversion, and quality.

In this context, smart electricity grids have been proposed as a solution. A large number of pilots and experiments have been set up, but a key challenge remains how to upscale them. Upscaling is critically important to enable a wide scale integration of renewable energy sources. This paper mobilises literature on the strategic management of experimental niches to explore the upscaling of smart grids in the Netherlands. On the basis of existing literature, a typology of four different patterns of upscaling is proposed: growing, replication, accumulation, and transformation. The relevance of this typology to understanding upscaling of smart grids is explored in a comparative qualitative case study design. On this basis we argue that the building of broad and deep social networks is important for growing and replication; articulating and sharing expectations is important for replication; and broad and reflexive learning processes are critical to transformation and replication. The paper concludes by arguing that these findings can provide important guidelines for future energy innovation policies.","[Naber, Rolf] Hezelburcht, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Raven, Rob] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Kouw, Matthijs] SIM CI, The Hague, Netherlands; [Dassen, Ton] PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, The Hague, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Raven, R (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst, Utrecht, Netherlands.",rolfnaber@gmail.com; r.p.j.m.raven@uu.nl; matthijs.kouw@gmail.com; ton.dassen@pbl.nl,"Raven, Rob/GXG-2362-2022; Raven, Rob/C-3048-2017; Raven, Rob/V-5710-2019","Raven, Rob/0000-0002-6330-0831; Raven, Rob/0000-0002-6330-0831; Raven, Rob/0000-0002-6330-0831",,,,,55,82,84,0,19,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2017,110.0,,,,,,342,354,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.07.056,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FP5LK,,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417660800033,0

This study overcomes such shortcomings by converting a dataset of 525 firms covered by the South Korea ETS (SK-ETS) into a 28-sector database consistent with the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) classifications. We implement a simulation of the SK-ETS with a computational general equilibrium (CGE) model. Simulation results suggest that while SK-ETS has significant abatement effects (-2.56% from the base case), it only has mild negative impacts on GDP (0.41%) and household consumption (0.11%). Industry output on average falls by 0.54%, with the gas and air transport sectors most adversely affected. The most noticeable price changes are from the electricity sector, whose output price goes up by 3.75%. It is noteworthy that because of the export-oriented economy, many global business leaders and politicians have argued that the ETS will disadvantage exporting companies, while the simulation results showed a higher trade surplus based on enhanced competitiveness.","[Choi, Yongrok; Lee, Hyoungseok] Inha Univ, Global E Governance Dept, 100 Inha Ro, Incheon 22212, South Korea; [Liu, Yu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci & Dev, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yu] Wuhan Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Terr Sovereignty & Maritim, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yu] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Inha University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Wuhan University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Liu, Y (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci & Dev, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.;Liu, Y (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Terr Sovereignty & Maritim, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.;Liu, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",liuyu@casipm.ac.cn,"Choi, Yongrok/GRJ-6248-2022; Choi, Yongrok/AFN-7905-2022",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China Fund project A research on the operating mechanism and economic impact of the pilot regional carbon trading-based on the Term-Co2 model [71473242]; Ministry of Science and Technology of China National key R & D Project Social-economic costs of carbon emissions and mitigation [2016YFA0602500]; National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A5B1011422]; Institutes of Science and Development, Chinese Academy of Sciences Major Consulting Project A research on addressing climate change and low-carbon transition development [Y02015003]","National Natural Science Foundation of China Fund project A research on the operating mechanism and economic impact of the pilot regional carbon trading-based on the Term-Co2 model; Ministry of Science and Technology of China National key R & D Project Social-economic costs of carbon emissions and mitigation; National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government; Institutes of Science and Development, Chinese Academy of Sciences Major Consulting Project A research on addressing climate change and low-carbon transition development","This study is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China Fund project A research on the operating mechanism and economic impact of the pilot regional carbon trading-based on the Term-Co2 model (grant No. 71473242); Ministry of Science and Technology of China National key R & D Project Social-economic costs of carbon emissions and mitigation (grant No. 2016YFA0602500); National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2014S1A5B1011422); Institutes of Science and Development, Chinese Academy of Sciences Major Consulting Project A research on addressing climate change and low-carbon transition development (grant No. Y02015003).",,31,61,62,14,61,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,835,844,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.06.039,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400080,0

We use three alternative patterns of global socio-economic development (SSP1, SSP2 and SSP5) in conjunction with expected technological change coming from inherent yield improvements. Compared to other projections of blue water uses in crop production, the research provides a new perspective by using a multi-regional macro-economic approach. Freshwater requirements are calculated using a global Computable General Equilibrium framework with the induced pressure over renewable freshwater resources measured through the Irrigation Withdrawals to Availability (IWA) indicator. The RESCU-Water model employed distinguishes between rainfed and irrigated crop production. The model database also introduces an improved accounting method to derive the value of irrigation freshwater as a separate factor of production. The results show a positive relationship between socio-economic development and irrigation water use in most areas. Water-challenged regions continue to increase the pressure they exert over their renewable freshwater resources. Higher growth scenarios (SSP1 and SSP5) exacerbate these trends, leading to a more pronounced expansion of global blue water withdrawals. The obtained growth in freshwater requirements hints at continued unsustainable withdrawals in many regions and provides further evidence to support the SDG target 6.4 referring to the need for improved water-use efficiency.","[Nechifor, V.; Winning, M.] UCL, Inst Sustainable Resources, London, England",University of London; University College London,"Nechifor, V (通讯作者)，UCL, Inst Sustainable Resources, London, England.",victor.nechifor.13@ucl.ac.uk,"Winning, Matthew/ABH-9436-2020","Winning, Matthew/0000-0002-4299-3376; Nechifor, Victor/0000-0001-8034-4070",EPSRC [EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: researchfish,EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),,,57,17,18,1,21,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4284,,,WATER RESOUR ECON,Water Resour.

Is this evidence of China's coal peak or a temporary blip? In this paper, we use a time series model to explore if further China's coal consumption will be higher or lower than the level of 2014. Before the modeling, we undertake a comprehensive analysis of data reliability, because problems with the accuracy of Chinese data have posed the main challenge to calculating its energy use. Our results show that annual Chinese coal consumption during 2016-2020 will be lower than the level of 2014 if the annual average GDP growth rate is less than 8.2%/year. Given that Chinese economy has been adapting to a new normal (slower but higher-quality economic growth) since 2014, and GDP growth target of at least 6.5% during 2016-2020 set by 13th Five Year Plan, we conclude that Chinese coal consumption peaked in 2014, which could translate into a big change in the global coal consumption and carbon emission.","[Wang, Qiang; Li, Rongrong] China Univ Petr, Sch Econ & Management, Qingdao 266580, Peoples R China",China University of Petroleum,"Wang, Q (通讯作者)，China Univ Petr, Sch Econ & Management, Qingdao 266580, Peoples R China.",qiangwang7@outlook.com,"Wang, Qiang/F-4618-2011; Li, Rongrong/Q-5045-2016","Wang, Qiang/0000-0002-8751-8093; Li, Rongrong/0000-0002-8767-3026",Initial Founding of Scientific Research for the Introduction of Talents of China University of Petroleum (Huadong) [05Y16060020],Initial Founding of Scientific Research for the Introduction of Talents of China University of Petroleum (Huadong),The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful and constructive comments that greatly contributed to improving the final version of the paper.

District heating (DH) is a suitable technology to decarbonize the European heat sector. By contrast with most of nuclear non-electric applications, nuclear district heating (NDH) has already been implemented in Europe, thus providing us with some valuable empirical insights. This paper investigates the forces and obstacles to nuclear cogeneration by looking at the Loviisa 3 NDH project in Finland. The key forces are energy efficiency, decarbonization of the heat sector, operational competitiveness of future nuclear technologies, and synergies with renewable energies. The key obstacles are split incentives, electricity prices volatility, inexpediency of business models and regulatory frameworks, electioneering of local authorities and pessimist expectations with regards to project financing. Policy makers should recognize nuclear plants alongside other utilities generating large amounts of wasted heat. International cooperation programs involving both nuclear and heat stakeholders should be encouraged. EU28 Member States wanting to promote nuclear cogeneration may consider providing support for the electricity generated by high-efficiency plants.","[Leurent, Martin; Jasserand, Frederic] Univ Paris Saclay, CEA, I Tese, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Leurent, Martin] Univ Paris Saclay, Lab Genie Ind, Cent Supelec, F-92290 Chatenay Malabry, France; [Locatelli, Giorgio] Univ Leeds, Sch Civil Engn, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Palm, Jenny] Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies Technol & Social Change, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; [Rama, Miika] VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland, POB 1000, FI-02044 Espoo, Finland; [Trianni, Andrea] Politecn Milan, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy",CEA; Universite Paris Saclay; Universite Paris Saclay; University of Leeds; Linkoping University; VTT Technical Research Center Finland; Polytechnic University of Milan,"Leurent, M (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Saclay, CEA, I Tese, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France.",Martin.leurent@cea.fr; G.Locatelli@leeds.ac.uk; jenny.palm@liu.se; Miika.Rama@vtt.fi; andrea.trianni@polimi.it,"Palm, Jenny/F-2411-2014; Locatelli, Giorgio/AAG-8058-2020; Trianni, Andrea/C-5581-2018","Palm, Jenny/0000-0001-7694-7397; Locatelli, Giorgio/0000-0001-9986-2249; Trianni, Andrea/0000-0002-1699-7787; Rama, Miika/0000-0002-2476-7498",,,,,108,31,32,3,52,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2017,107.0,,,,,,138,150,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.04.025,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FA0WU,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405158200014,0

This study is a well-to-wheel assessment for the case of Lebanon and similar fuel-importing countries in the developing world where energy and transportation infrastructure are typically underdeveloped. The study considers the energy use, GHG and criteria pollutant emissions and economic costs for conventional and potentially feasible alternative fuel vehicle pathways for the Lebanese case in order to inform transition strategies to alternative fuels over the near, medium and long-terms. Results show that electric vehicles are beneficial for the long term as they require costly charging infrastructure and a clean electricity mix. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are attractive for the medium term, with gasoline or diesel hybrid electric vehicles the most feasible and beneficial technologies in the short-term. A sensitivity analysis showed that natural gas-based vehicles are competitive at high driving mileage, while locally produced biodiesel from waste cooking oil proved beneficial if emission controls are enforced.","[Mansour, Charbel J.; Haddad, Marc G.] Lebanese Amer Univ, Ind & Mech Engn Dept, New York, NY USA",Lebanese American University,"Mansour, CJ (通讯作者)，Lebanese Amer Univ, Sch Engn, Ind & Mech Engn Dept, 211 East 46th St, New York, NY 10017 USA.",charbel.mansour@lau.edu.lb; mhaddad@lau.edu.lb,"Haddad, Marc/H-2431-2017","Haddad, Marc/0000-0002-3010-4033",United Nations Development Program (UNDP); National Council for Scientific Research in Lebanon,United Nations Development Program (UNDP); National Council for Scientific Research in Lebanon,"This project has been funded by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) with support from the National Council for Scientific Research in Lebanon.

Fossil fuel extraction is often considered as 'unjust' and renewable energy as the 'just' alternative. At the same time renewable energy projects, such as wind parks, are often resisted because of the uneven impacts of its infrastructure. This paper analyses such ambiguous meanings of energy justice (social justice issues related to energy) along the lines of its three tenets: distributional, procedural and recognition justice, aiming to understand how energy justice is constructed from below. It does so on the basis of a case study in the Noordoostpolder (the Netherlands) where plans for extracting shale gas went together with both large-scale and small-scale renewable energy practices. The paper analyses how energy justice is 'made' by how people resist shale gas and engage in 'renewable energy practices' and as such produce new imaginations and normativities of energy justice. Such an ethnographic approach helps to understand energy justice as a process of co-construction of activists, policy makers and scholars and as such responds to recent calls for a human-centred approach to the study of energy transitions. The paper is based on two and a half years of ethnographic fieldwork in the Noordoostpolder.","[Rasch, Elisabet Dueholm; Kohne, Michiel] Wageningen Univ & Res, Sociol Dev & Change, POB 8130, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Rasch, ED (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ & Res, Sociol Dev & Change, POB 8130, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands.",elisabet.rasch@wur.nl,,,,,,,49,34,38,3,51,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2017,107.0,,,,,,607,614,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.03.037,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FA0WU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405158200059,0

The result confirms the feasibility of substituting non-fossil energy for fossil energy. We then divide the non-fossil energy into nuclear energy and renewable energy and find that nuclear energy is more suitable than renewable energy to substitute for fossil energy.

In addition to the subsidization of solar adopters by non-participants, we highlight the channels through which cross-subsidization of rate classes can arise in practice. The results of our study indicate that the fear of a utility death spiral may be exaggerated. Significant solar can be incorporated with only a 2% increase in non-participant bills. At high levels of penetration, distributed solar has the potential to alter the system peak hour which affects the allocation of costs across rate-classes. As the peak hour shifts to the evening when solar production diminishes, residential customers face higher distribution costs. Policy makers and utilities need to be aware of these challenges in designing the next generation of rates that are better aligned with cost causality.","[Johnson, Erik; Blackburn, Chris] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Econ, 221 Bobby Dodd Way, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Beppler, Ross; Staver, Benjamin; Brown, Marilyn; Matisoff, Daniel] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Publ Policy, 685 Cherry St NW, Atlanta, GA 30313 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Johnson, E (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Econ, 221 Bobby Dodd Way, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",erik.johnson@econ.gatech.edu,,"Matisoff, Daniel/0000-0003-4575-5282",National Electric Energy Testing Research and Applications Center,National Electric Energy Testing Research and Applications Center,"This work was in part supported through the National Electric Energy Testing Research and Applications Center.

This paper considers how different benefits have been used within the overall rationale for energy efficient retrofit policy in different contexts. We posit that different rationales may be used for the same policy response, and that the form of rationale used may affect the design, delivery or the level of policy support, with different rationales making it easier to account for different results. Considering retrofit policy in the contexts of the UK, Germany, New Zealand and Ireland, we characterise policy rationale in each case, assessing what the key perceived benefits have been, and, whether they have changed over time. The analysis identifies some marked differences between cases with the recognition of benefits and the ensuing policy rationale resulting from a complex mix of political, social and economic influences. We find that recognition of multiple benefits may not equate with multiplied policy support, and instead it is more likely that different rationales will have relevance at different times, for different audiences. The findings highlight that, alongside evidence for policy, it is important to also consider how the overall rationale for policy is eventually framed.","[Kerr, Niall] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Infrastruct Business Model Local Delivery I Build, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Gouldson, Andy] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, ESRC Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Barrett, John] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC); University of Leeds; University of Leeds,"Kerr, N (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Infrastruct Business Model Local Delivery I Build, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",n.kerr@leeds.ac.uk; a.gouldson@leeds.ac.uk; j.r.barrett@leeds.ac.uk,,"Barrett, John/0000-0002-4285-6849","EPSRC; School of Earth and Environment at the University of Leeds; EPSRC [EP/N022645/1, EP/K012398/1] Funding Source: UKRI; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/N022645/1, EP/K012398/1] Funding Source: researchfish",EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); School of Earth and Environment at the University of Leeds; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"The research presented in this paper is part of the I-Build project (Infrastructure Business Models for Local Delivery) which was funded by the EPSRC and the School of Earth and Environment at the University of Leeds.

Ubiquitous in real-world electricity markets, CRMs are introduced country by country in an ad hoc manner, lacking the theoretical legitimacy and the conceptual coherence enabling comparability and coordination. They are eyed with suspicion by a profession wedded to a theoretical benchmark model that argues that competitive energy-only markets with VOLL pricing provide adequate levels of capacity. While the benchmark model is a consistent starting point for discussions about electricity market design, it ignores the two market failures that make CRMs the practically appropriate and theoretically justified policy response to capacity issues. First, energy-only markets fail to internalize security-of-supply externalities as involuntary curbs on demand under scarcity pricing generate social costs beyond the private non-consumption of electricity. Second, when demand is inelastic and the potential capacity additions are discretely sized, investors face asymmetric incentives and will underinvest at the margin rather than overinvest. After presenting the key features of the theoretical benchmark model, this paper conceptualizes security of supply externalities and asymmetric investment incentives and concludes with some consideration regarding design of CRMs.","[Keppler, Jan Horst] Univ Paris 09, Pl Marechal Lattre Tassigny, F-75775 Paris 16, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine,"Keppler, JH (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, Pl Marechal Lattre Tassigny, F-75775 Paris 16, France.",jan-horst.keppler@dauphine.fr,,,Chaire European Electricity Markets (CEEM) of the Paris Dauphine Foundation; RTE; EDF; EPEX Spot; Caisse des Depots,Chaire European Electricity Markets (CEEM) of the Paris Dauphine Foundation; RTE; EDF(Electricite de France (EDF)); EPEX Spot; Caisse des Depots,"The author would like to thank Dominique Finon and Marc Bussieras for their helpful comments.

When and what level of CO2 emission peak China's primary aluminum industry will reach is in suspense. In this paper, a system dynamic model is established, with five subsystems of economy development, primary aluminum production, secondary aluminum production, CO2 emission intensity and policies making involved. The model is applied to examine potential CO2 emission trends of China's primary aluminum industry in next fifteen years with three scenarios of no new policies, 13th fiveyear plan and additional policies. Simulation results imply that: merely relying on rapid expansion of domestic scarps recycling and reuse could not mitigate CO2 emission continuously. Combination of energy saving technology application and electrolytic technology innovation, as well as promoting hydropower utilization in primary aluminum industry are necessary for long term low-carbon development. From a global prospective, enhancing international cooperation on new primary aluminum capacity construction in other countries, especially with rich low-carbon energy, could bring about essential CO2 emission for both China's and global primary aluminum industry.","[Li, Qiang; Zhang, Wenjuan; Li, Huiquan; He, Peng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Proc Engn Natl Engn, Lab Hydromet Cleaner Prod Technol, Key Lab Green Proc & Engn, 1 2nd North St, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Huiquan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, Beijing 100149, Peoples R China","Institute of Process Engineering, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Li, HQ (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Proc Engn Natl Engn, Lab Hydromet Cleaner Prod Technol, Key Lab Green Proc & Engn, 1 2nd North St, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Li, HQ (通讯作者)，Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, Beijing 100149, Peoples R China.",hqli@ipe.ac.cn,"zhang, wenjuan/A-9413-2011; Li, Huiquan/U-2227-2019; LI, Qiang/HLQ-6133-2023","Li, Huiquan/0000-0001-9552-2191; LI, Qiang/0000-0001-5568-2334",National key research and development program [2016YFF0201601],National key research and development program,This research is financially supported by the grant from National key research and development program (NO. 2016YFF0201601).,,22,38,42,20,144,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUN,2017,105.0,,,,,,225,235,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.02.046,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ET8EY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000400532900022,0

It lacks conventional energy resources and is alternative energy disadvantaged. In the past decade (2000-2010), its energy-related carbon emissions increased from 37.8 to 44.4 million tonnes of CO2. This paper analyses the city state's carbon emissions from the demand perspective using the input-output (I-O) method and investigate the drivers of emission changes using structural decomposition analysis (SDA). It is the first comprehensive analysis of Singapore's emissions using the I-O framework. The results obtained show that exports accounted for nearly two-thirds of its total emissions and growth in its emissions in the last decade was largely export -driven. Emissions increased as export-oriented industries and export volume expanded. Fuel switching and energy efficiency, however, helped to lower growth in emissions. Besides exports, household-related emissions accounted for about a quarter of Singapore's total emissions. The emissions related to different household groups remained fairly stable as increases in embodied (indirect) emissions were offset by decreases in direct emissions. The high-income household group registered the largest increase in direct emissions, while the middle-income household group registered the largest increase in embodied emissions. The policy implications of our findings are discussed.","[Su, Bin; Li, Yingzhu] Natl Univ Singapore, Energy Studies Inst, Singapore, Singapore; [Ang, B.

In this paper, factors that affect local community support for the rebuilding of an existing nuclear power plant are explored using a regression analysis model. It is based on a survey involving nearly 600 residents of twelve municipalities located in the vicinity of the Dukovany power plant in the Czech Republic. Nearly two thirds of local population support the rebuilding of the plant. The support for rebuilding is not directly affected by distance of residence from the power plant or perceptions of its local economic impacts, but is more influenced by general perceptions of pros of nuclear power. Work in the power plant, perception of nuclear power as a clean energy contributing to climate change mitigation and negative attitude to the renewable energy development are strongest predictors of the support. In terms of energy policy implications, it seems that the education of the public and awareness of nuclear power plants as a clean, safe and landscape compatible system of energy production are more important for increasing acceptance of rebuilding projects than spatial distribution of economic benefits to local communities.","[Frantal, Bohumil; Maly, Jiri] Czech Acad Sci, Dept Environm Geog, Inst Geon, Brno, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geonics of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Frantál, B (通讯作者)，Czech Acad Sci, Dept Environm Geog, Inst Geon, Brno, Czech Republic.",frantal@geonika.cz,"Frantal, Bohumil/H-4819-2011; Maly, Jiri/K-7554-2014","Frantal, Bohumil/0000-0003-3999-4447; Maly, Jiri/0000-0002-3431-8741","Exploring social-spatial diffusion of renewable energy projects in the Czech Republic: lessons for adaptive governance of energy transition [16-04483S]; Czech Science Foundation, Czech Republic; Institute of Geonics (RVO) [68145535]","Exploring social-spatial diffusion of renewable energy projects in the Czech Republic: lessons for adaptive governance of energy transition; Czech Science Foundation, Czech Republic(Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicCzech Republic Government); Institute of Geonics (RVO)","The paper was elaborated in the scope of the project Exploring social -spatial diffusion of renewable energy projects in the Czech Republic: lessons for adaptive governance of energy transition (No. 16-04483S) financed by the Czech Science Foundation, Czech Republic and the long-term institutional support from the Institute of Geonics (RVO: 68145535).

Comparing program administrator cost with the total cost of saved energy can indicate the degree to which programs leverage investment by participants. Based on reported total costs and savings information for U.S. utility efficiency programs from 2009 to 2013, we estimate the savings-weighted average total cost of saved electricity across 20 states at $0.046 per kilowatt-hour (kW h), comparing favorably with energy supply costs and retail rates. Programs targeted on the residential market averaged $0.030 per kW h compared to $0.053 per kW h for nonresidential programs. Lighting programs, with an average total cost of $0.018 per kW h, drove lower savings costs in the residential market. We provide estimates for the most common program types and find that program administrators and participants on average are splitting the costs of efficiency in half. More consistent, standardized and complete reporting on efficiency programs is needed. Differing definitions and quantification of costs, savings and savings lifetimes pose challenges for comparing program results. Reducing these uncertainties could increase confidence in efficiency as a resource among planners and policymakers.","[Hoffman, Ian M.; Goldman, Charles A.; Rybka, Gregory; Leventis, Greg; Schwartz, Lisa; Sanstad, Alan H.; Schiller, Steven] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,"Hoffman, IM (通讯作者)，Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",ihoffman@lbl.gov; gleventis@lbl.gov; greg.rybka@gmail.com; CAGoldman@lbl.gov; Icschwartz@lbl.gov; ahsanstad@lbl.gov; srschiller@lbl.gov,,"Goldman, Charles/0000-0003-3117-4014",National Electricity Delivery Division of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability; Office of Energy Policy and Systems Analysis under Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory [DE-AC02-05CH11231],National Electricity Delivery Division of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability; Office of Energy Policy and Systems Analysis under Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,"This work was funded by the National Electricity Delivery Division of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability and the Office of Energy Policy and Systems Analysis under Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Contract no.

First, we establish an upper bound on the estimation error of the scaled Lasso estimator of Lee, Seo, and Shin. This is a nontrivial task as the literature on high-dimensional models has focused almost exclusively on (1) and (2) estimation errors. We show that this sup-norm bound can be used to distinguish between zero and nonzero coefficients at a much finer scale than would have been possible using classical oracle inequalities. Thus, our sup-norm bound is tailored to consistent variable selection via thresholding. Our simulations show that thresholding the scaled Lasso yields substantial improvements in terms of variable selection. Finally, we use our estimator to shed further empirical light on the long-running debate on the relationship between the level of debt (public and private) and GDP growth.

Although we appreciate their focus on capital cost increases and overruns, we maintain in this critical appraisal that their study conceptualizes cost issues in a limiting way. Methodological choices in treating different cost categories by the authors mean that their conclusions are more narrowly applicable than they describe. We also argue that their study is factually incorrect in its criticism of the previous peer-reviewed literature. Earlier work, for instance, has compared historical construction costs for nuclear reactors with other energy sources, in many countries, and extending over several decades. Lastly, in failing to be transparent about the limitations of their own work, Lovering et al. have recourse to a selective choice of data, unbalanced analysis, and biased interpretation.

On the other hand, diverging national market designs pose a threat to the continuation of this process. Given the challenges to electricity market design in a multi-regional context, we analyze how different design aspects, namely cross-border congestion management and capacity mechanisms, affect welfare and generation adequacy in Europe. In doing so, we rely on an agent-based simulation model for electricity wholesale markets which we apply within several numerical, computational case studies for the region of Central Western Europe (2012-2030). Our results confirm the benefits of market coupling in terms of welfare as well as generation adequacy. Furthermore, we find indications that coordinating market designs across regions supports these targets. Therefore, we recommend that European energy policy forms a stable, transparent regulatory framework with cross-border market coupling as an integral component. In this context, energy policy targets should be clearly defined and operationalized, which also needs to consider potential conflicts between them. Finally, electricity market designs need to be coordinated among states to benefit most from a common European market.","[Ringler, Philipp; Keles, Dogan; Fichtner, Wolf] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Ind Prod, Hertzstr 16, D-76187 Karlsruhe, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Ringler, P (通讯作者)，Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Ind Prod, Hertzstr 16, D-76187 Karlsruhe, Germany.",philipp.ringler@ldt.edu,"Keles, Dogan/AEM-0654-2022","Keles, Dogan/0000-0002-9620-6294; Fichtner, Wolf/0000-0001-6013-4674",,,,,58,55,58,2,19,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2017,101.0,,,,,,629,643,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.11.011,0.0,,,15,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EI8PD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000392768800061,0

The policy routes are based on the decarbonised scenarios of the EU Energy Roadmap 2050 combining energy efficiency, renewables, nuclear or carbon capture and storage (CCS). A reference and seven decarbonised scenarios are modelled for EU28. We conclude on the importance of policy decisions for the configuration of the low carbon power sector, especially on nuclear acceptance and available sites for new RES plants. Differently from typical analysis focussing on technology portfolio for each route, we analyse the deployment of each technology across policy routes, for optimising technology R & D. R & D priority should be given to those less-policy-sensitive technologies that are in any case deployed rapidly across the modelled time horizon (e.g. PV), but also to those deployed up to their technical potentials and typically less sensitive to exogenous policy routes. For these 'no regret' technologies (e.g. geothermal), R & D efforts should focus on increasing their technical potential. For possibly cost-effective technologies very sensitive to the policy routes (e.g. CSP and marine), R & D efforts should be directed to improving their techno-economic performance.","[Simoes, Sofia; Nijs, Wouter; Ruiz, Pablo; Sgobbi, Alessandra; Thiel, Christian] European Commiss, Inst Energy & Transport, Joint Res Ctr, Westerduinweg 3, NL-1755 LE Petten, Netherlands; [Sgobbi, Alessandra] European Commiss, DG Climate Act, Ave Beaulieu 24, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Energy & Transport (IET),"Simoes, S (通讯作者)，Univ Nova Lisboa, CENSE, DCEA FCT NOVA, Campus Caparica, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal.",sgcs@fct.unl.pt,"Simoes, Sofia G./I-3367-2015","Simoes, Sofia G./0000-0003-4304-1411; Thiel, Christian/0000-0001-6439-5775",,,,,18,43,44,0,36,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2017,101.0,,,,,,353,365,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.10.006,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EI8PD,,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000392768800036,0

Results of the survey revealed that the level of saving among Lithuanian high school students is relatively high and similar to the levels of adolescent savings in the other countries. Most of Lithuanian high school students are irregular savers; their overall attitude towards saving is close to neutrality; their motivation to save may be viewed as moderate, despite their acknowledgment of necessity to save. The aggregate data revealed that the vast majority of the surveyed students tend to underestimate their saving behavior habits and skills.

Even though challenging economic conditions are making it difficult for governments to devote the necessary financial resources to handle expanding health care demands, in recent years most countries have made impressive progress in ensuring better health services - especially those services aimed towards improving infant health and towards increasing life expectancy. Evaluating the efficiency of healthcare systems is a very complex problem. There has been a long-lasting interest in the analysis of the efficiency of health care systems using nonparametric and parametric applications. This paper aims at global comparison of the efficiency of healthcare systems in WHO countries by applying data envelopment analysis (DEA). For this purpose, statistical data of 177 WHO countries for 2015 are used. One input (general government expenditure on health as a percentage of gross domestic product) and four outputs (life expectancy at birth, life expectancy at age 60, infant mortality rate, and neonatal mortality rate) are used for the analysis. In this paper we identify 10 efficient countries. In the second part of this paper we evaluate efficiency changes in the healthcare systems of selected countries during 2005, 2010, and 2015 by applying Malmquist index. The results of this study assert that the efficiency of healthcare systems has improved in 71 countries during 2005 - 2010 and in 21 countries during 2010 - 2015.","[Gazdikova, Jana] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Gazdíková, J (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",jana.gazdikova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Gazdikova, Jana/P-5077-2016","Gazdikova, Jana/0000-0001-6999-0880",,,,,19,1,1,0,5,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,495,502,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059200066,0

By means of properly targeting campaigns, it affects consumer behaviour across all age groups over the world. The current marketing communication of brands oriented primarily to the younger generation is from the point of view of media selection, but also the content of communication more courageous and closer to the target group. This also results from the international trend - high rate of internet consumption by the young generation (teenagers), which is connected almost continuously and can be traced almost anywhere. Brands through innovative campaigns and the use of the most advanced digital media and their forms (applications, games, POS materials, entertainment and viral content on social media) no longer only inform, but mainly entertain, are interactive, and have a significant share to consumer behaviour of the selected target group. They will become a lovebrand tag. For this reason, in recent years, higher demands are being made to develop the theory of branding, which today we do not have to perceive only as an economic factor but also as a factor deriving from the very idea of a communication campaign, positive attitudes, brand popularity, which should be part of a long-term brand strategy.

Empirical evidence was found about the existence of economies of scale, but social services do not seem to follow a luxury-goods pattern. Left-wing governments seem to spend more, while federal regulations work as constraints of regional autonomy. Finally, strong evidence that the foral' system of regional financing is creating horizontal inequalities in the access to essential public services was found, while the common regime seems to be working well enough.","[Herrero-Alcalde, Ana; Manuel Tranchez-Martin, Jose] UNED, Fac Derecho, Dept Econ Aplicada & Gest Publ, Off 4 17, Calle Obispo Trejo 2, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED),"Herrero-Alcalde, A (通讯作者)，UNED, Fac Derecho, Dept Econ Aplicada & Gest Publ, Off 4 17, Calle Obispo Trejo 2, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",aherrero@cee.uned.es; jtranchez@cee.uned.es,"Herrero-Alcalde, Ana/F-2881-2018","Herrero-Alcalde, Ana/0000-0002-9594-1967",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Innovation [CSO2011-27547],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Innovation(Spanish Government),This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Innovation [grant number CSO2011-27547].,,49,10,13,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Here we deal with the well-known problem of scheduling in several non-observable parallel single server queues with single Poisson incoming flow, when the broker (scheduler) does not observe neither the current states of the queues and servers, nor the size of the incoming jobs. The only available information is the job size distribution, server's speeds and job's inter-arrival time distribution. For this problem setting it is known that if the scheduler can memorize the sequence of its previous decisions, then a deterministic policy is much better than the probabilistic policy (with respect to the job's mean waiting and mean sojourn time). But if the broker can memorize its decision, it is also very natural to assume that it can also memorize the time instants at which these decisions are made. In this paper we address the following question: can the deterministic policy be improved if the broker, in addition to decisions made, utilizes also the information about the lengths of time between the decisions?

The annual report is an important document presenting the summary of the profit or loss of an accounting unit during the reference period. Czech Railways operates passenger rail transport in the Czech Republic. This transport is provided both at regional and national level, in cooperation with foreign carriers across the European continent too. The results show that the business of the company is improving, one of the reasons being the increasing number of transported passengers and hence increasing sales of services. Passenger rail transport represents one of Czech Railways basic activities. The long-term goal is to provide their customers with the best services in the field of transport at competitive prices.

However, recent contributions in the literature have demonstrated that care needs to be taken when choosing which variables to include in the model. A number of different approaches to determining these variables have been put forward. These are, however, often based on ad hoc procedures or abandon the underlying theoretical factor model. In this article, we will take a different approach to the problem by using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) as a variable selection method to choose between the possible variables and thus obtain sparse loadings from which factors or diffusion indexes can be formed. This allows us to build a more parsimonious factor model that is better suited for forecasting compared to the traditional principal components (PC) approach. We provide an asymptotic analysis of the estimator and illustrate its merits empirically in a forecasting experiment based on U.S. macroeconomic data. Overall we find that compared to PC we obtain improvements in forecasting accuracy and thus find it to be an important alternative to PC.

To get these innovation, open innovation system uses inbound marketing and new innovative forms of marketing communication that are already based on two-way communication within the information distribution among stakeholders. Inbound marketing enables direct connection with customers and its advantage relies in overcoming the borders.

In general, the aim of personnel marketing is to improve the marketing promotion of employer ' s activities in seeking and acquiring workforce in eyes of potential candidates. Nowadays, the personnel marketing is a separate discipline from personnel management. The primary reason for origin is that workforce belongs among significant factors of competitive advantage in the global economy. Personnel marketing focuses on the domestic and foreign labour market to find a potential workforce with required education and experience. At present traditional methods of gaining workforce are not attractive for potential candidates. The reason is the decrease of unemployment rate in European Union (EU) countries. It means that business entities are forced to apply an active approach in seeking, acquiring, motivating and convincing the workforce to increase the competitiveness of the enterprise in the global environment. Based on these facts, personnel marketing is an indispensable tool to increase competitiveness in relevant companies. The aim of the paper is to identify which of tools (product, price, promotion and place) of personnel marketing has the most significant influence on the decision-making on the selection of working position or employer based on a questionnaire. Based on the results of the survey, we find out which of the tools of the personnel marketing mix plays the most important role for potential candidates and suggest recommendations for business entities.","[Mazanec, Jaroslav; Bielikova, Alzbeta] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01001, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Mazanec, J (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01001, Slovakia.",jaroslav.mazanec@fpedas.uniza.sk; alzbeta.bielikova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Bielikova, Alzbeta/E-4974-2018; Mazanec, Jaroslav/O-9476-2016","Mazanec, Jaroslav/0000-0003-4723-7075","project VEGA [1/0696/16, 1/0244/16]",project VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This contribution was undertaken as parts of the research project VEGA 1/0696/16 and project VEGA 1/0244/16 Personnel marketing as a new approach of the ensuring and maintaining the skilled workforce in Slovak companies.,,24,0,0,0,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1533,1539,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059202061,0

And globalization is a necessary part of the global marketing process as marketers need to consider all global factors and customers preferences. It is said, that customers have changed and they require products that support their desire to health and sustainable lifestyle. There are hundreds of researches on sustainable customer behaviour. One thing is to carry out surveys about attitudes of customers, but on the other hand, categorize them into meaningful groups that describe and predict their buying behaviour. Then it is necessary to choose a group as an object to which a company creates a product and appropriate strategy for its placing on the market. However, creativity should be use within a framework of psychological laws and customer buying behaviour and preferences. It is only way how to build strong brand in the local or global market. When we talk about globalization, brand must be considered between top three brands in the segment, otherwise customers do not buy and brand does not grow. If the company is in top of mind, company is a brand, a leader, brand possess added value, and brand sets conditions. Every strong brand has clear vision and execution effectively as it gets.

Globalization trend strengthened during 20th century culminating in the 1990s, at the millennium turn, however, some contradictory tendencies appeared slowing down its pace. According to the author, two key reasons for the globalization mitigating can be pointed out, namely economic and political. The economic one has rather an objective character of spontaneous economic restructuring. It consists in partial return of manufacturing to domestic states, especially to developed countries in reaction to production cost changes as well as technology shifts; the return has been also reflected in the global trade growth weakening. The political reason can be seen in the effort of the developed states to respond to escalating social diversification when economic volatility and uncertainty project to the worsening of the middle-class position. Thus, the states try to maintain domestic manufacturing including higher employment and fair worker's income. The U.S. President Trump is the most significant supporter of the policy aimed at that direction. His administration and its supporters even try to revise the post-war trade model based on free trade and inspired by Ricardian theory. Nevertheless, in the author's opinion, most assumptions of Trump's economic policy aimed at stopping globalization are fallacious confronted with the world economy long-term development. In fact, even though globalization has changed its character or even reversed temporally, it will continue in a different mode regardless of individual state policy excesses.","[Neumann, Pavel] Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Neumann, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",neumann@vse.cz,,,,,,,23,1,1,1,6,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1694,1700,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059203015,0

Therefore, the examination of volunteering goes beyond the individual framework and concerns the socio-economic and organizational context in which it is located. In general, this context has changed in recent years. Social trends related to company modernization, such as demographic change, technological development, globalization, changes in civil society, and others, modify people's attitudes and attitudes towards volunteering. One of the most important social phenomena, which largely interferes with volunteering, is the process of individualisation. At present, volunteering is an important part of the lives of many people, organizations, and society as a whole. We expect this to be the case in the coming years, as volunteering is becoming more and more popular in Slovakia. This is certainly helped also by international business companies that pay attention to corporate volunteering. There is still insufficiently developed formal volunteerism in the territory of the Slovak Republic. Volunteering opportunities are not well known to the public. Volunteering is a social phenomenon whose importance to individuals as well as to society as a whole is also underlined in the context of public policies. It is highlighted many times that volunteering is a form of civic participation in terms of social significance. By building social capital, it acts as a factor of social inclusion and enhances social cohesion.","[Novakova, Michaela] Univ Econ Bratislava, Dept Social Dev & Labor, Fac Natl Econ, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Novakova, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Dept Social Dev & Labor, Fac Natl Econ, Bratislava, Slovakia.",michaela.novakova@euba.sk,"Nováková, Michaela/ISV-1217-2023","Nováková, Michaela/0000-0002-8324-4750",,,,,14,0,0,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1750,1756,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059203022,0

In some countries Directive 2006/12/EC of the European Parliament and of The Council of 5 April 2006 on waste has already been implemented and some countries are still implementing it. High international recycling and waste management requirements are imposed. It is important that changes of this nature are global and implemented around the world. Increasingly popular is the minimalism and zero waste lifestyle. Trends in more conscious choice of products in terms of their negative impact on the environment and minimizing the amount of packaging, have a significant impact on the reduction of waste in the world. However, not all citizens are willing to make such sacrifices. A compromise in this regard is the sustainability. It is important to minimize the amount of waste globally. If the waste is produced, it is important that they be properly developed, disposed of or recycled, which often has an international character. This article examines the EU countries in terms of diversification of municipal waste management. Very significant international differences can already be seen in the level of municipal waste produced per capita. Also examined levels of recovery of secondary raw materials in the EU countries and the recycling rates. The analyses of changes in sustainable development indicators related to municipal waste management in EU countries and their international comparisons are presented.","[Nowak, Stefan; Ulfik, Agnieszka] Jerzy Kukuczka Acad Phys Educ Katowice, Fac Sport & Tourism Management, Mikolowska 72A St, PL-40065 Katowice, Poland",Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Energy and economic growth in manufacturing and social well-being are mutually un-exclusive. A large population of over 160 million depends on less than 3000MW supply of electricity for industrial and socio-economic activities. And the power sector still faces high energy losses from generation to billing, management, insufficient cash collection and has pushed cost maintenance to government funding. As a result, only 10% of the rural households and less than 50% of the entire country's population have access to electricity. This management deficiency encourages the use of fossil fuel powered generators in all the homes and diesel generators for production, thereby causing serious environmental air pollutions, import of goods, and zero manufacturing innovation in the economy among others. This paper takes cognizance of the technical issues involved and suggests how sustainable development could reach its strategies if changes could occur soonest in the energy sector.

This difficult process is used to estimate prices based on individual library users' surveys. The benefits of public services provided by public libraries are attributed to the individual preferences and values of public library users. This article describes ways to determine the value of basic library services - book lending. The data for the calculations are based on the research of the Municipal Library in Prague, which takes place from 2012 until present.

This ticket control system uses a UNIQUE card reader connected to a PC. In systems that use RFID tags, serious problems make it relatively easy to copy such cards. Because of the lack of any more advanced security methods to copy your card, just read its serial number with the appropriate hardware. This problem does not occur in the presented system. Personal monthly tickets only serve to identify the passenger. The validity of the ticket is stored in a computer database. The current ticket information is displayed on the driver terminal. A picture is displayed on the terminal screen for verification. In the database system on the bus is a complete set of information about the passenger: personal data, photo, ticket validity. The updated database on the bus uses an encrypted WiFi connection, an update is made in the bus database at one of the bus stops.

The effects of globalization and internationalization processes in turbulent environments are becoming increasingly intense, creating a need to a fundamental change of corporate architecture, including the development of business strategy development plans. If an enterprise, as an organized system wants to be effective and sustainable, it must be competitive both at the local, regional and national level and worldwide. This brings a new challenge to the corporate area. In particular, the top management should bear the crucial responsibility for the corporate development and its possibilities as a tool of competitiveness and stable prosperity. The basis for this new direction is the creation of qualified corporate strategies.

The main goal of the strategy, as currently being developed, is to prepare the enterprise for the expected future development of the area and at the same time to develop the ability to react quickly to pre-precisely unspecified changes.

A good Chinese teacher should have a keen awareness of cultural self-consciousness and introspection; meanwhile he should have the ability to keep learning. So in the practice of teaching, he will not impart the Chinese language and culture mechanically, and will not blindly promote Chinese culture. He can organically combine language and culture with an open and equal attitude. Naturally, students are influenced by the silent way, imperceptibly students can actually perceive and understand Chinese culture, and deeply attracted to Chinese culture, and will also produce more strong desire to learn Chinese.

However, how environmental innovation may affect carbon emissions in China and whether the effect may differ among various environmental innovation variables remain to be investigated. Therefore, based on the panel data of China's 30 provinces during 2000-2013, we use a system generalized method of moments (SGMM) technique to estimate the effect of environmental innovation on carbon emissions in China. Also, we evaluate the effect on carbon emission reduction of China's initial carbon emissions trading (CET) scheme. Empirical results indicate that, most environmental innovation measures in China reduce carbon emissions effectively. Among the various environmental innovation factors, energy efficiency exerts the most evident effect on carbon emissions abatement in China; meanwhile, resources for innovation and knowledge innovation also play prominent roles in this regard. However, the impact of governmental environmental policies on curbing carbon emissions reduction suffers from a lag effect, which mainly occurred during 2006-2013. Finally, despite the short time of operation and incomplete market mechanism, the pilot CET in China has appeared relatively promising with regard to carbon emissions reduction.","[Zhang, Yue-Jun; Peng, Yu-Lu; Ma, Chao-Qun] Hunan Univ, Sch Business, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yue-Jun; Peng, Yu-Lu; Ma, Chao-Qun] Hunan Univ, Ctr Resource & Environm Management, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Shen, Bo] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Anal & Environm Impacts Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Hunan University; Hunan University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,"Zhang, YJ (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Sch Business, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China.",zyjmis@l26.com,"Zhang, Yue-Jun/A-8850-2012; Shen, Bo/AGE-1774-2022; zhang, yue/GQP-5565-2022","Zhang, Yue-Jun/0000-0001-7687-9267;","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71273028, 71322103, 71431008]; National Special Support Program for High-Level Personnel from the Central Government of China; Hunan Youth Talent Program",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Special Support Program for High-Level Personnel from the Central Government of China; Hunan Youth Talent Program,"We gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (nos. 71273028, 71322103 and 71431008), National Special Support Program for High-Level Personnel from the Central Government of China and Hunan Youth Talent Program.

Model-based forecasts are produced by a dynamic factor model (DFM). We consider as combination schemes the weighted average and the linear combination. Combining with subjective information delivers sizable gains in forecasting ability of statistical models for all countries except Japan, even when subjective forecasts are somewhat dated. Accuracy gains are much more pronounced in the volatile period after 2008 due to a marked improvement in predictive power of Consensus forecasts relative to the DFM. A possible explanation is that mechanical models may be more vulnerable to extreme observations in estimation samples. Consensus forecasts are superior at the moment of publication for most countries since 2008. For some countries forecast combinations can improve upon Consensus forecasts in between the quarterly release dates of the Consensus survey.","[Jansen, W.

Depending on the origin of the green waste, we specify an urban, a rural-urban, and a rural scenario. All scenarios combined can mitigate 70,511 metric tons (t) of carbon-dioxide equivalents (CO(2)e) per year. The carbon abatement costs reach 163 (sic)/t CO(2)e in the urban scenario, 76 (sic)/t CO(2)e in the rural-urban scenario, and 77 (sic)/t CO(2)e in the rural scenario. The lower abatement costs in the latter two scenarios are mainly due to HTC-coal co-firing in an existing power plant rather than constructing a new biomass power plant for HTC-coal mono-firing as in the urban scenario. While the abatement costs exceed the current carbon prices, they compare more favorably with commonly assumed damage costs of unmitigated climate change. Thus, the public support of HTC coal could be considered, with the primary policy focus on HTC-coal co-firing. HTC-coal co-firing could also lower the emissions of existing power plants during the fossil-fuel phase-out.","[Medick, Jakob; Teichmann, Isabel; Kemfert, Claudia] German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Kemfert, Claudia] Hertie Sch Governance HSoG, Friedrichstr 180, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Medick, Jakob] DWR Eco GmbH, Albrechtstr 22, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Hertie School,"Teichmann, I (通讯作者)，German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",medick@dwr-eco.com; iteichmann@diw.de; ckemfert@diw.de,,"Kemfert, Claudia/0000-0002-6742-0478",Leibniz Association [SAW-2012-ATB-3],Leibniz Association,"We are grateful to Wolfgang Bokelmann, Philip Grundmann, Andreas Meyer-Aurich, Jorn Richstein, Wolf-Peter Schill, and seminar participants at DIW Berlin and Humboldt University Berlin for their scientific support.

This means the formation and maintenance of numerous complex supply chains. These are emergent and include supply chains for things and supply chains for ideas. The former involve transactions; the latter can be via transactions and/or realized positive externalities. All supply chains have a geographic dimension which is also emergent. Firms carefully choose what to make vs what to buy and also where to sell or buy it, near or far. The whole system tends to be a pattern of locations that denote realized transactions (and transactions costs) as well as realized externalities. The city remains a competitive producer if these relationships are encouraged with the attendant costs contained. Cities are engines of growth. They offer attractive supply chain formation and management opportunities, including the various spatially situated supply chains for things and ideas. The latter are more complex than textbook discussions of non-rival goods suggest. People are keen to identify and acquire useful knowledge. Consider (1) the advantages of open-source knowledge sharing have been acknowledged; (2) ideas often denote complex tacit knowledge exchange, and (3) access to useful knowledge is priced in land markets and impacts location choice. Favorable networking and location opportunities are significant. Flexible land markets facilitate the availability of such opportunities. Access to pools of human capital is clearly beneficial, but the ability to tailor access to the peculiar requirements of the firm is even better. Detailed firm location data for various sectors for the Los Angeles metropolitan areas are analyzed to support our claims. We estimate Ripley k-functions and note differences by industry as well as firm size. There is agglomeration that is near as well as far. This finding complicates death of distance as well as clustering discussions.","[Gordon, Peter] Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Cho, John] Southern Calif Assoc Govt, Los Angeles, CA USA",University of Southern California,"Gordon, P (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA.",pgordon@usc.edu; joongkoo.cho@gmail.com,,,,,,,38,1,1,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

It distinguishes between several different forms of energy (renewable, non-renewable, final and primary), six sectors and up to a hundred activities. The use of energy in the AFS increased 10.2 fold during the period analysed, from 181 TJ to 1855 TJ, between 1960 and 2015. In the first stage, up to 1985, agriculture accounted for the majority of new consumption. However, from that date onwards, consumption in other sectors such as transport, packaging and homes grew at a faster rate. A decomposition analysis reveals that the increase in activity in the sector, in other words managed biomass, explains 46% of the increase in the use of energy, whereas the rest is explained by losses in efficiency, chiefly losses in efficiency within a sector that requires a greater amount of resources per biomass produced. The final energy consumption of the AFS over the total consumption of the economy represents 19.6%, suggesting a significant potential of agri-food policies as means of reducing the use of energy.","[Infante-Amate, Juan; Gonzalez de Molina, Manuel] Univ Pablo Olavide, Carretera Utrera,Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain; [Aguilera, Eduardo] Univ Cordoba, Campus Rabanales,Carretera Nacl 4,Km 396, Cordoba 14014, Spain",Universidad Pablo de Olavide; Universidad de Cordoba,"Infante-Amate, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pablo Olavide, Carretera Utrera,Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain.",jinfama@upo.es,"Infante-Amate, Juan/ABF-4144-2021; González-de-Molina, Manuel/H-4474-2015; Aguilera, Eduardo/H-4864-2015; Infante-Amate, Juan/H-4556-2015","Infante-Amate, Juan/0000-0003-1446-7181; González-de-Molina, Manuel/0000-0002-0253-6971; Aguilera, Eduardo/0000-0003-4382-124X; Infante-Amate, Juan/0000-0003-1446-7181",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [SSHRC 895-2011-1020]; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain [HAR2015-69620-C2-1-P],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain(Spanish Government),"This work was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [SSHRC 895-2011-1020], and the Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain [HAR2015-69620-C2-1-P].

Most of these countries, as well as some other countries (mostly developing countries, but one could argue that US gasoline prices do not account for external costs), distribute large subsidies. Subsidies that are offered for a long period, are not only inefficient, but also dangerous due to gradual increases in the energy demand. Low domestic prices have led to immense oil demand growth that cannot continue if these countries wish to continue exporting. Only very high price jumps can stop this development, but politically these price jumps are very costly, if not suicidal, for many governments. Indeed, we argue that the currently low oil prices not only harm oil and gas exporting countries, but also provide a unique opportunity to eliminate this costly subsidy policy at manageable political costs. This paper begins with theoretical, normative and positive explanations of low domestic energy prices, and then addresses how to phase out subsidies, again from a normative and positive perspective. Finally, we empirically address the obstacles that individual countries may face when attempting to eliminate subsidies by quantifying the factors (political, economic, and social) that influence the existing subsidies.","[Moghaddam, Hussein; Wirl, Franz] Univ Vienna, Fac Business Econ & Stat, Dept Ind Energy & Environm, Oscar Morgenstern Pl 1, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Moghaddam, H (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, Fac Business Econ & Stat, Dept Ind Energy & Environm, Oscar Morgenstern Pl 1, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",hussein.moghaddam@univie.ac.at; franz.wirl@univie.ac.at,"Wirl, Franz/P-2861-2019","Wirl, Franz/0000-0002-2168-8049",,,,,37,11,13,0,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2018,122.0,,,,,,409,420,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.07.045,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GX2UX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447576700038,0

There is a compelling need for a comprehensive evaluation criterion that is versatile enough to allow for exploring different possibilities and options. The inclusive wealth framework is a suitable tool for such a task, as it accounts for the changes in the three major capital assets -produced, human, and natural- that compose a nation's wealth. Here, we apply the inclusive wealth framework within a hybrid simulation model to evaluate energy infrastructure projects in terms of their impacts on different capital assets. We chose hybrid simulation as a technique that allows for a better realization of technologies, as well the economy as a whole. The developed model is generalized and can be applied to different economies as well as all types of energy projects. In addition to accounting for the capital assets, we also account for CO2 damages and health capital. We provide the simulation for different proposed projects representing different fuel cycles in Belgium and Egypt. The results show how the model can be used to demonstrate the changes brought to wealth by the different projects and how policymakers can change policies to make wealth take more favorable tracks.","[Aly, Ebrahim A.; Managi, Shunsuke] Kyushu Univ, Sch Engn, Urban Inst, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan; [Aly, Ebrahim A.; Managi, Shunsuke] Kyushu Univ, Sch Engn, Dept Urban & Environm Engn, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan; [Managi, Shunsuke] Econ Inst, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan",Kyushu University; Kyushu University,"Managi, S (通讯作者)，Kyushu Univ, Sch Engn, Urban Inst, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan.;Managi, S (通讯作者)，Kyushu Univ, Sch Engn, Dept Urban & Environm Engn, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan.;Managi, S (通讯作者)，Econ Inst, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan.",ebrahim.a.aly@gmail.com; managi@doc.kyushu-u.ac.jp,"Managi, Shunsuke/G-1740-2013","Managi, Shunsuke/0000-0001-7883-1427; Aly, Ebrahim/0000-0002-3167-5444",,,,,53,8,8,0,30,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2018,121.0,,,,,,1,12,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.070,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV3HA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445983800002,0

Challenges and opportunities are analyzed through nine multi-stakeholder workshops, held in two EU member states (Germany and Portugal) in 2016-2017, engaging distribution system operators, researchers, academics, and integrated utility companies. The results indicate considerable uncertainty for distribution system operators regarding the value of large-scale smart meter rollouts. Also, a corporate culture with resistance to change is observed, challenging the integration of novel technologies and processes. Traditional regulation is seen as a barrier to smart grid investments, and is associated with job losses and knowledge destruction.

This research examines four aspects of decision-making with respect to heating system upgrades: home-owner decisions on whether to upgrade, decisions on fuel choice, fuel switching patterns, and an examination of the reasons why home-owners make these decisions. Among the key findings are that proximity to energy infrastructure, e.g. gas network, is an important determinant of residential heating systems upgrades, including fuel choice. With one exception no clear trend emerges on the likelihood of a broad range of socio-demographic variables, including age, income, and working status on home-owner decisions. A cohort of home-owners defined across a few socio-demographic characteristics, including mortgage holders, are predisposed to investing in a heating system upgrade compared to their peers but for reasons unknown do not invest. We also find that environmental concerns, across a number of dimensions, are not an important determining factor in either the decision to upgrade or the subsequent choice of heating system. Information on heating system alternatives is critical for good decision-making but we find that home-owners do not always rely on independent energy consultants for guidance.","[Curtis, John; McCoy, Daire; Aravena, Claudia] Sir John Rogersons Quay, Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland; [Curtis, John] Univ Dublin, Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [McCoy, Daire] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England; [Aravena, Claudia] Heriot Watt Univ, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Heriot Watt University,"Curtis, J (通讯作者)，Sir John Rogersons Quay, Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland.",john.curtis@esri.ie,"Curtis, John/Q-8539-2018","Curtis, John/0000-0002-6957-5684; Aravena, Claudia/0009-0002-3905-9184",Science Foundation Ireland [12/RC/2302]; Gas Networks Ireland through the Gas Innovation Group [2015-SR-002]; Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) through MaREI - Marine Renewable Energy Ireland Research cluster; ESRI's Energy Policy Research Centre; Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment; ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy [ES/K006576/1],Science Foundation Ireland(Science Foundation Ireland); Gas Networks Ireland through the Gas Innovation Group; Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) through MaREI - Marine Renewable Energy Ireland Research cluster(Science Foundation Ireland); ESRI's Energy Policy Research Centre; Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment; ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This research is supported by Science Foundation Ireland under Grant No. 12/RC/2302.

By examining public submissions regarding a coal mining development in Lithgow, New South Wales, this paper identifies a relationship between coal mining and generational identity in this community. Acknowledging this relationship adds a useful perspective to energy transition discourse by highlighting the way in which hidden dimensions of loss can act to reinforce local support of extractive industry. We combine recent scholarship on the emotionality of the minescape (Ey & Sherval, 2016; Ey et al., 2017) with work on the ways in which place attachment can translate to feelings of loss in response to material change (Adger et al., 2013; Barnett et al., 2016; Tschakert et al., 2017) to suggest that factors of time and place can make community-level actors within the energy landscape either receptive, or resistant, to change. Applying this understanding to decarbonisation strategies can inform a more effective, and more just, energy transition in Australia.","[Della Bosca, Hannah; Gillespie, Josephine] Univ Sydney, Sch Geosci, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Sydney,"Della Bosca, H (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Geosci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",hannah.dellabosca@sydney.edu.au; josephine.gillespie@sydney.edu.au,,"Gillespie, Josephine/0000-0002-5103-3449",,,,,63,74,76,0,38,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2018,120.0,,,,,,734,740,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.032,0.0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO6DC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440123300067,0

The growing trend of logistics agglomeration in the USA has drawn significant attention from both researchers and policy makers, and its benefits are being widely recognized. However, understanding of logistics agglomeration is still limited. The purposes of this paper are to confirm and quantify productivity gains for the logistics industry from the trend of agglomeration, using the County Business Patterns dataset for the US counties from 2007 to 2014. Panel unit root and panel cointegration test results suggest that a long-run equilibrium relationship between logistics agglomeration and logistics industry productivity exists. We then apply the panel fully modified ordinary least squares regression to estimate the long-run elasticity, and model estimation shows that the elasticity between concentration of logistics activities and industry productivity is 0.039. The study thus provides empirical evidence of the economic benefits associated this phenomenon and suggests that in a long run logistics agglomeration gives rise to higher industry productivity with an elasticity of 4%. In addition, our study results provide justification for policy makers to further invest in logistics agglomeration.","[Sun, Bowen; Li, Haomin] Peking Univ, Guanghua Management Sch, Summer Palace Rd Haidian Dist, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Qiuyun] Peking Univ, Inst New Struct Econ, Summer Palace Rd Haidian Dist, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Peking University; Peking University,"Sun, BW (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Guanghua Management Sch, Summer Palace Rd Haidian Dist, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",lansebowen@pku.edu.cn; lihaomin@pku.edu.cn; qiuyunzhao@nsd.pku.edu.cn,"Molina, Nicholle/AAA-7370-2022; Sun, Bowen/M-6027-2018",,,,,,76,10,10,7,58,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Despite the overall effectiveness of feed-in tariffs, actual adoption rates have shown surprising regional differences, pointing to the presence of peer influence and regional spillover effects. For future diffusion of photovoltaics, understanding these social influences on the decision to adopt is key. Several studies have used revealed preference approaches to discern peer effects in PV adoption, proving their existence but leaving open questions about underlying psychological mechanisms. We close this gap by conducting a survey among potential PV adopters in one of the top three fastest-growing European solar markets and find that two types of social norms, descriptive and injunctive norms and their underlying interplay, play an important role in explaining PV adoption decision and diffusion patterns. Our findings have significant policy implications - as an alternative to following the shotgun approach of uniform nationwide incentives, policy makers should consider inducing snowball effects by facilitating the creation of regional hot spots. Such programs, which may be supported through co-investments between federal and local authorities, would effectively complement existing policy approaches.","[Curtius, Hans Christoph; Hille, Stefanie Lena; Wustenhagen, Rolf] Univ St Gallen, Inst Econ & Environm, Tigerbergstr 2, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland; [Berger, Christian] Univ St Gallen, Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Bahnhofstr 8, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland; [Berger, Christian] Zurich Univ Appl Sci, Sch Management & Law, Bahnhofpl 12, CH-8400 Winterthur, Switzerland; [Hahnel, Ulf Joachim Jonas] Univ Geneva, Dept Psychol, 40 Blvd Pont Arve, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland",University of St Gallen; University of St Gallen; Zurich University of Applied Sciences; University of Geneva,"Curtius, HC (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Inst Econ & Environm, Tigerbergstr 2, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",hans.curtius@unisg.ch,"Hahnel, Ulf J.J./HJY-8695-2023","Hahnel, Ulf J.J./0000-0002-0595-5899; Wustenhagen, Rolf/0009-0000-5306-3628",National Research Programme Energy Turnaround of the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [NRP 70]; Swiss Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI),National Research Programme Energy Turnaround of the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI),"This article is based on the interdisciplinary research project ACTIVE INTERFACES, which is part of the National Research Programme Energy Turnaround (NRP 70) of the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF).

Further, we apply Narayan and Popp (2010) two structure break test and find two break points, one in January 2002 and another one in November 2011 in case of crude oil price. Finally, the Structural VAR analysis depicts that there exists a negative and significant relation between crude oil price dummy and crude oil demand over the period. Further, the price elasticity shows that the percentage changes of crude oil demand response less as compare to the rise in crude oil price. This clearly suggests that crude oil price is moderately inelastic. This overall implies that global crude oil price fluctuation has not brought down India's crude oil import to a greater extent. In order to erase the bulging oil import bill, alternative strategies of producing methanol blended oil, revival of sick oil well production, and adoption of phase wise clean energy system could curb the import dependence of crude oil.","[Dash, Devi Prasad] IIT Ropar, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Rupnagar, India; [Sethi, Narayan] NIT Rourkela, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Rourkela, India; [Bal, Debi Prasad] NIT Sikkim, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Ravangla, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Ropar; National Institute of Technology (NIT System); National Institute of Technology Rourkela; National Institute of Technology (NIT System); National Institute of Technology Sikkim,"Dash, DP (通讯作者)，IIT Ropar, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Rupnagar, India.",devi100.dash@gmail.com; nsethinarayan@gmail.com; debiprasad.bal@gmail.com,"Sethi, Narayan/AAE-3534-2020; Bal, Debi/AAY-2950-2021; dash, devi prasad/AGG-7621-2022","Sethi, Narayan/0000-0003-4298-4928; dash, devi prasad/0000-0002-0380-8625",,,,,37,23,24,5,32,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2018,118.0,,,,,,552,558,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.001,0.0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ1TF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000435050000049,0

As concerns about climate change intensify, the Chinese government is poised to commit to a low carbon economy. These conditions make China a suitable case in which to study how emission policies impact on energy supply, welfare, and the environment. To achieve this purpose, we incorporate abatement technologies into the GTAP computable general equilibrium model and show that optimal taxes range between 0.03% for services and 2.02% for manufacturing. In most cases, simulated tax rates are by far higher than pollution taxes stipulated in the new Chinese environmental tax law. Furthermore, despite a decline in output of many sectors including the electricity sector, overall welfare gains exist from introducing carbon taxes. Moreover, these taxes reduce environmental pollution by approximately 62.5%. In general, carbon taxes are insufficient for mitigation in China, and due to a coal-dominant energy structure, implementing these taxes leads to a decline in power generation. Hence, the Chinese aggressive investment strategy for renewable electricity technologies as stipulated in its 13th Five-Year Plan is understandable.","[Wesseh, Presley K., Jr.; Lin, Boqiang] Xiamen Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, Sch Management, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China",Xiamen University,"Lin, BQ (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, Sch Management, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",presley@xmu.edu.cn; bqlin@xmu.edu.cn,"Wesseh, Presley Kaybe/L-9372-2018; Lin, Boqiang/G-3960-2010","Wesseh, Presley Kaybe/0000-0002-7821-686X; Lin, Boqiang/0000-0002-1308-400X",Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy [1260-Z0210011]; Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding [1260-Y07200]; China National Social Science Fund [17AZD013],Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy; Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding; China National Social Science Fund,"The paper is supported by the Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy (No: 1260-Z0210011), Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding (No:1260-Y07200) and China National Social Science Fund (No. 17AZD013).

Based on a two-level model, we analyze the impact of profit-maximizing merchant transmission investment as compared to both welfare-maximizing regulated transmission investment and the absence of enhanced (direct current) interconnection between different synchronous areas. We apply the model to the Baltic Sea region, which is historically subject to rapid interconnector development and would benefit from increased interconnection. We obtain stable results indicating that merchant investment may well positively contribute to overall welfare, but at the same time, the merchant takes it all, i.e. in many cases merchant profits are close to the overall efficiency gain. This implies that, depending on political objectives, building no interconnector may be superior to building a merchant interconnector if a regulated solution does not seem to be feasible, such as in a case of inter-jurisdictional coordination issues. This underlines that distributional aspects, beyond mere welfare arguments, should be taken into account when analyzing the impact of merchant transmission investment.","[Gerbaulet, C.; Weber, A.] Berlin Univ Technol, WIP, Str 17 Juni 135, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; [Gerbaulet, C.] German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Dept Energy, Transportat, Environm, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Berlin; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Weber, A (通讯作者)，Berlin Univ Technol, WIP, Str 17 Juni 135, D-10623 Berlin, Germany.",cfg@wip.tu-berlin.de; aw@wip.tu-berlin.de,,,Mercator foundation [11-426],Mercator foundation,The authors thank Christian von Hirschhausen and Daniel Huppmann for valuable comments and support.

Amidst these challenges, energy justice has emerged to conceptualize a world where all individuals, across all areas, have safe, affordable and sustainable energy that is, essentially, socially just. Simultaneously, new social and technological solutions to energy problems continually evolve, and interest in the concept of sociotechnical transitions has grown. However, an element often missing from such transitions frameworks is explicit engagement with energy justice frameworks. Despite the development of an embryonic set of literature around these themes, an obvious research gap has emerged: can energy justice and transitions frameworks be combined? This paper argues that they can. It does so through an exploration of the multi-level perspective on sociotechnical systems and an integration of energy justice at the model's niche, regime and landscape level. It presents the argument that it is within the overarching process of sociotechnical change that issues of energy justice emerge. Here, inattention to social justice issues can cause injustices, whereas attention to them can provide a means to examine and potential resolve them.","[Jenkins, Kirsten] Univ Sussex, Ctr Innovat & Energy Demand, Jubilee Bldg,Room 348, Falmer BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Univ Sussex, Ctr Innovat & Energy Demand, Jubilee Bldg,Room 367, Falmer BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Aarhus Univ, Ctr Energy Technol, Aarhus, Denmark; [McCauley, Darren] Univ St Andrews, Sch Geog & Sustainable Dev, Irvine Bldg,North St, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland",University of Sussex; University of Sussex; Aarhus University; University of St Andrews,"Jenkins, K (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Ctr Innovat & Energy Demand, Jubilee Bldg,Room 348, Falmer BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England.",k.e.jenkins@sussex.ac.uk; b.sovacool@sussex.ac.uk; dam7@st-andrews.ac.uk,"McCauley, Darren/GYJ-6924-2022; Sovacool, Benjamin/Y-2392-2019","Sovacool, Benjamin/0000-0002-4794-9403; McCauley, Darren/0000-0002-3951-1129; Jenkins, Kirsten/0000-0002-3681-647X","Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK) [EP/K011790/1]; ESRC [ES/1001425/1]; EPSRC [EP/I035390/1]; ESRC; EPSRC; EPSRC [EP/I035390/1, EP/K011790/1] Funding Source: UKRI; ESRC [ES/I001425/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I001425/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K011790/1, EP/I035390/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"The authors are appreciative to the Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK) Energy Program Grant EP/K011790/1 Centre on Innovation and Energy Demand, which has supported elements of the work reported here, as well as research grants from the ESRC (ES/1001425/1) and EPSRC (EP/I035390/1).

The analysis is carried out in the context of a new multi-sector, multi-household, dynamic general equilibrium model. Simulation results suggest that a permanent increase from 6% to 23% improves the public budget and, albeit marginally, CO2 emissions, but it leads to detrimental economic and distributional effects. As the economy in Portugal begins to recover after the Great Financial Crisis, and the budgetary situation becomes less constraining, pressure is mounting for this VAT increase to be reversed. This mixed bag of results is an important element for the debate. Reverting to a lower VAT is desirable, as it would improve economic performance and have positive distributional effects. The question is how to compensate for the loss of tax revenues. To offset the adverse budgetary effects of a lower VAT, we consider several revenue raising strategies. Our simulation results suggest that an offsetting increase in either the general VAT tax rate or the tax on petroleum products would yield more favorable effects from all relevant perspectives - economic, distributional, and environmental while mostly keeping intact the budgetary benefits.","[Pereira, Alfredo Marvao; Pereira, Rui Manuel] Coll William & Mary, Dept Econ, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA",William & Mary,"Pereira, AM (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Dept Econ, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA.",ampere@wm.edu,,,,,,,43,1,1,0,51,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUN,2018,117.0,,,,,,1,13,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.02.037,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GF4KU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431932600001,0

This paper introduces a new agent-based model which simulates this adoption by considering decision-making of individual households based on household income, social network, total capital cost of the PV system, and the payback period of the investment, where the final factor takes into account the economic effect of FiTs. After calibration using Approximate Bayesian Computation, the model successfully simulates observed cumulative and average capacity installed over the period 2010-2016 using historically accurate FiTs; setting different tariffs allows investigation of alternative policy scenarios. Model results show that using simple cost control measures, more installation by October 2016 could have been achieved at lower subsidy cost. The total cost of supporting capacity installed during the period 2010-2016, totalling 2.4 GW, is predicted to be (sic)14 billion, and costs to consumers significantly exceed predictions. The model is further used to project capacity installed up to 2022 for several PV cost, electricity price, and FiT policy scenarios, showing that current tariffs are too low to significantly impact adoption, and falling PV costs are the most important driver of installation.","[Pearce, Phoebe] Imperial Coll London, Dept Phys, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Slade, Raphael] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England",Imperial College London; Imperial College London,"Pearce, P (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll London, Dept Phys, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England.",phoebe.pearce15@imperial.ac.uk; r.slade@imperial.ac.uk,"Pearce, Phoebe/AFT-3579-2022","Pearce, Phoebe/0000-0001-9082-9506; Slade, Raphael/0000-0002-5297-4224","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, UK [EP/K036734/1]; EPSRC [EP/K036734/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, UK(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","Raphael Slade was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, UK, through the SUPER-GEN Bioenergy Hub project Bioenergy value chains: whole systems analysis and optimisation (EP/K036734/1).",,70,35,37,0,27,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2018,116.0,,,,,,95,111,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.060,0.0,,,17,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GD8JH,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430758200011,0

The time at risk increases with the value of the resource in the ground and decreases with the cost of expropriating the resource. When the risk of expropriation is internalized by the legitimate owner, in the absence of capacity constraints, the resource is depleted faster than it is socially optimal. Interestingly, a marginal improvement in the protection of property rights exacerbates the over-extraction of the resource. In the presence of endogenous capacity constraints, and when property rights are imperfectly protected, both under- and over-extraction are possible. If property rights are relatively strong the resource owner under-invests in extraction capacity and depletes the resource below the socially optimal rate. If property rights are relatively weak the owner over-invests and the resource is over-extracted. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Using environment Impact-GDP-Technology (IGT) decoupling model, we carry out a comparative study on the decoupling trends of economic growth and energy consumption for both developed and developing countries in past five decades (1965-2015). The results indicate that the decoupling indices of developed countries are superior to that of developing countries. The specific performances are: (1) The de coupling indices of developed countries are shown to be stable and tend to approximate absolute decoupling; (2) The decoupling indices of developing countries fluctuate in the relative decoupling interval. On this basis, this research employs grey relational analysis (GRA) to explore the reasons resulting in the difference of decoupling indices from the perspective of technical progress, industrial structure and economic growth pattern. The findings show that: in developed countries, technical progress factor exerts greatest influence on decoupling indices, followed by industrial structure and economic growth pattern; in developing countries, industrial structure and economic growth pattern have greater impact on decoupling indices than technical progress.

WBP is among the most promising additions to energy generation portfolios for reducing import dependency while at the same time providing economic opportunity to stimulate regional economies, especially in rural regions where economic development options are often limited. We use an input-output framework to assess WBP under three different pathways, fast pyrolysis, ethanol and coal biomass to liquids. We find that the proposed WBP will increase regional output by 0.5-1.3% of gross regional product; it will increase income by $17.32 to $51.31 million dollars each year, and regional employment by 218.1-1127.8 jobs, depending on the chosen pathway. Of these impacts, the direct portions are 63-77% of the total impact, depending on the chosen pathway. The economic analysis and the results from the accompanying environmental assessment show that only the ethanol pathway has both economic and environmental benefits. We conclude that because long-run economic development strategies in rural regions are limited and negative impacts do not alter dramatically the regional environmental profile, regional policymakers should include WBP among their development portfolio options.","[Jackson, Randall W.] West Virginia Univ, Reg Res Inst, 886 Chestnut Ridge Rd,POB 6825, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Ferreira Neto, Amir B.] West Virginia Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Reg Res Inst, 886 Chestnut Ridge Rd,POB 6825, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Erfanian, Elham] West Virginia Univ, Sch Nat Resources, Reg Res Inst, 886 Chestnut Ridge Rd,POB 6825, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",West Virginia University; West Virginia University; West Virginia University,"Jackson, RW (通讯作者)，West Virginia Univ, Reg Res Inst, 886 Chestnut Ridge Rd,POB 6825, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",randall.jackson@mail.wvu.edu; amneto@mix.wvu.edu; Elhamerfanian@mix.wvu.edu,"Jackson, Randall/G-9589-2014","Jackson, Randall/0000-0002-4765-3071","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture [2012-67009-19660]","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA))","This material is based upon work supported by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture, under award number 2012-67009-19660.",,64,31,31,3,21,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,APR,2018,115.0,,,,,,66,77,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.001,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GA1TH,,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428099800007,0

The model is empirically tested using questionnaire survey data collected from 320 households. The results indicate that personal moral norm, habit and positive anticipated emotion are important determinants of residents' intention to save electricity. Furthermore, it is find that habit is also positively associated with electricity saving behavior. However, positive anticipated emotion is negatively associated with electricity saving behavior, which means that residents who present more positive anticipated emotion about electricity conservation intend to save electricity in their daily lives but actually end up consuming more electricity. In addition, the results also suggest that residents with positive attitude towards saving electricity and greater senses of control have stronger intention to save electricity, while the role of subjective norm is not significant.

The CI reached the maximal value of 0.58 in 2001, and the minimal value of 0.37 in 2015. These values indicate the increase of natural gas supply security in Croatia in the considered period. A favorable CI of 0.30 could be achieved in the year 2019 with the precondition of an operational LNG terminal on the island of Krk in the North Adriatic.

The survey aims at getting insight of Chinese experiences of EPC and survey yielded information on profile, specificity and risk specifications of EPC in Chinese building sector. The key findings are that the existing EPC projects are mainly driven by policies and majority of first parties in EPC are owners of public buildings. The contract specificity is worryingly low, with underspecification prominent in the contract sections of renewal and change of the planned solutions, dispute resolution and compensation for personal and property damage. Insufficient risk specification was a major cause of contract failure and disputing. High risks are observed in not enough feasibility study, delay in completion, operational risks, delay in payment and uninsured loss. Most post EPC projects would be worryingly unsuccessful, given to the facts that many of them have not established their energy team, have no further investment and have no effective maintenance.

The burning of biomass is harmful to health and the environment and may cause preventable morbidity and mortality. It is important to investigate how households' fuel choices are linked to prices, so that governments can consider appropriate steps to enhance the consumption of clean fuels. Using three pooled cross-sectional surveys from Pakistan and applying the Linear Approximate Almost Ideal Demand System (LA-AIDS) model, we found that all fuel types except natural gas were price inelastic at the national level and for urban households. In rural areas, natural gas and LPG were found to be more price elastic compared to urban areas. Simple policy simulations based on our results suggest that in order to reduce indoor air pollution by encouraging the adoption of clean fuels (LPG and piped natural gas), governments should subsidies clean fuels rather than imposing taxes on solid fuels. Moreover, in the case of Pakistan a subsidy for LPG should be preferred over a subsidy for piped natural gas, as it produces a more cost-effective reduction in solid fuel use.","[Irfan, Muhammad; Cameron, Michael P.; Hassan, Gazi] Univ Waikato, Waikato Management Sch, Dept Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand",University of Waikato,"Irfan, M (通讯作者)，Univ Waikato, Waikato Management Sch, Dept Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand.",irfaneconomist786@gmail.com; mcam@waikato.ac.nz; gmhassan@waikato.ac.nz,"Irfan, Muhammad/ISU-8377-2023; Hassan, Gazi/AAI-3282-2020","Cameron, Michael/0000-0002-4296-3775; Hassan, Gazi/0000-0003-3861-8191; Irfan, Muhammad/0000-0002-3876-4941",,,,,49,21,22,1,25,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2018,113.0,,,,,,633,642,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.11.041,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FT2XO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423009500059,0

We observe that ME governance is complex, as development offshore involves engagement and may often result in conflict. This paper examines the Irish case, where offshore gas and oil remain relatively undeveloped, and yet have provoked extensive controversy. Moreover, Ireland exhibits very ambitious plans for MRE developments. Against a background, where ME development seems to have stalled, the objective of the paper is to analyse the Irish governance setup and its capacity to deliver ME and whether the current system is equipped to enable transition to MREs. Current governance systems lack efficacy in terms of policy integration and enforcement, government oversight, and public trust due to past failures. Although, management approaches have been developed to address some of the barriers, domains such as policy/regulation, industry development and public engagement are disconnected. Results presented may not simply be generalised, as each country context is different. An analysis of examples with similar issues must focus on studying the context of the governance setup and balances of power across domains.","[Lange, Marcus; O'Hagan, Anne Marie; Devoy, Robert R.

This study analyzed the driving forces of aggregate carbon intensity (ACI), a measure of CO2 emissions per unit of electricity generation, in China between 1995 and 2014, using the LMDI method incorporating geographical effects. Both the entire study period and individual 5-year periods were analyzed. The results show that the geographic distribution effect, utilization efficiency effect, and thermal power proportion effect were responsible for a decrease in ACI during this period, whereas the energy composition effect showed an inhibitory influence on reduction. The dominant factor was the utilization efficiency effect, and the thermal power proportion effect showed the largest growth. Geographic distribution is a non-negligible factor in the reduction of ACI, and the regional ACI can be reduced by redistributing electricity generation to areas with lower ACI through trans-regional policy guidance. For future policies on reduction of ACI from electricity generation, this study proposes focusing on the thermal power proportion and geographic distribution effects to the same extent as on the utilization efficiency effect.","[Wang, Junfeng; He, Shutong; Qiu, Ye; Liu, Nan] Nankai Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Tianjin 300500, Peoples R China; [Wang, Junfeng; He, Shutong; Qiu, Ye; Liu, Nan] Nankai Univ, Res Ctr Resource Energy & Environm Policy, Tianjin 300500, Peoples R China; [Li, Yongjian] Nankai Univ, Business Sch, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Dong, Zhanfeng] Chinese Acad Environm Planning, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China",Nankai University; Nankai University; Nankai University,"Wang, JF (通讯作者)，Nankai Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Tianjin 300500, Peoples R China.",,"Li, Yongjian/AAE-6685-2021; He, Shutong/KDF-5960-2024","He, Shutong/0000-0003-0172-1259","Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71373134, 71603134]; Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China [15JZD021]; University Special Fund from Tianjin government [C0291760]","Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China(Ministry of Education, China); University Special Fund from Tianjin government","This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, No. 71373134 and No. 71603134), Social science major projects of the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China (No. 15JZD021) and University Special Fund (No. C0291760) from Tianjin government.",,45,47,48,3,64,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2018,113.0,,,,,,249,257,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.11.009,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FT2XO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423009500024,0

Our estimator captures the average causal response to discrete policy interventions in a macrodynamic setting, without the need for assumptions about the process generating macroeconomic outcomes. The proposed estimation strategy, based on propensity score weighting, easily accommodates asymmetric and nonlinear responses. Using this estimator, we show that monetary tightening has clear effects on the yield curve and on economic activity. Monetary accommodation, however, appears to generate less pronounced responses from both. Estimates for recent financial crisis years display a similarly dampened response to monetary accommodation.","[Angrist, Joshua D.] MIT, Dept Econ, 50 Mem Dr Bldg E52,Room 436, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Angrist, Joshua D.] NBER, Dept Econ, E52-436 MIT 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Jorda, Oscar] Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA USA; [Jorda, Oscar] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA USA; [Kuersteiner, Guido M.] Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - San Francisco; University of California System; University of California Davis; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Angrist, JD (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, 50 Mem Dr Bldg E52,Room 436, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.;Angrist, JD (通讯作者)，NBER, Dept Econ, E52-436 MIT 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",angrist@mit.edu; oscar.jorda@sf.frb.org; kuersteiner@econ.umd.edu,"Angrist, Josh/ADL-8782-2022",,,,,,55,56,64,3,34,AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC,ALEXANDRIA,"732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

The primary conditions for transformation of consumer behaviour observed in the last decades in Poland are considered to be: globalisation of economies and markets, increase of the living standard and development of production and distribution of goods and services. The main aim of this article is to indicate how globalisation processes may influence the appearance of new consumption trends on the Polish market. The level and structure of consumption are closely related to the state of economy and prosperity, but mostly with the growth of society's wealth. Together with the growth of living standard and fulfilment of basic needs, occurs a change in structure of expenditures on particular kinds of purchased goods - the share of expenditures on consumer discretionary goods, including services, grows, but drops when it comes to consumer staples. The scale of aforementioned changes is indirectly dependent on the potential of resources appearing on the local labour markets. This article is dedicated to the analysis of dynamics of changes in employment structure in the basic sectors of economy connected with changes of the model of consumption, treated as an echo of globalisation processes. Additionally, the received and distributed income of the society will be analysed in the general context.

The recent research on measuring trade in terms of the value added to products has highlighted an even more significance of services in home economies as well as in international trade. It has also thrown a light on the growing interrelationship between services and manufacturing activities described in the term of 'servicification of manufacturing'. Essentially, the servicification of manufacturing can be defined as the fact that manufacturing companies increasingly buy, produce and sell services. All these activities could either be run at home or internationally. The main objective of the papers is the discussion of analytical frameworks for the international dimension of servicification as well as an overview of the previous research relating to this phenomenon. The analysis shows that measuring all constituents of international servicification encounters numerous limitations resulting from statistical data shortcomings. Nevertheless, the existing research clearly evidence the increasing level of international dimension of servicification. It points out that international trade in services goes beyond the scope of GATS modes of supplying services and in addition to cross-border transactions and rendering services through the movement of labor and capital, it encompasses services embodied in exported or imported goods which are traded indirectly across borders.","[Bombinska, Elzbieta] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Int Trade, Rakowicka 27 St, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Bombinska, E (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Int Trade, Rakowicka 27 St, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",bombinse@uek.krakow.pl,,,Faculty of Economics and International Relations of the Cracow University of Economics,Faculty of Economics and International Relations of the Cracow University of Economics,This paper has been financed from the funds allocated to the Faculty of Economics and International Relations of the Cracow University of Economics in the framework of grants for maintaining research potential.,,16,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1992,1999,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300254,0

However, the recently elected (2017) South Korean government has a policy committing them to a phase-out of nuclear and coal, offset by an increase in the share of variable renewables. However, the main component of the power transition is set to be liquefied natural gas (LNG), due to technical and economic barriers facing large-scale renewables. It is therefore critical for South Korea to develop an evidence-based perspective on the details of the transition, before any future energy policy is decided. Here we review: i) the national role of renewable sources given technical and economic limitations in South Korea; ii) potential environmental and economic issues with gas; and iii) potential barriers of and benefits to a nuclear pathway. Our conclusion is that, given the geographical and economic limitations facing South Korea, and the need to reduce carbon emissions cost effectively, a nuclear pathway coupled with a moderate renewable share offers the most viable policy, with a gas-focused energy future being neither environmentally friendly nor economic.","[Hong, Sanghyun; Brook, Barry W.] Univ Tasmania, Fac Sci Engn & Technol, Private Bag 55, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",University of Tasmania,"Hong, S (通讯作者)，Univ Tasmania, Fac Sci Engn & Technol, Private Bag 55, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",sanghyun.hong@utas.edu.au,"Brook, Barry W./G-2686-2011; Hong, Sanghyun/N-3599-2017","Brook, Barry W./0000-0002-2491-1517; Hong, Sanghyun/0000-0001-6754-2291",,,,,53,28,29,1,20,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JAN,2018,112.0,,,,,,67,73,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.10.012,0.0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FO2NK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416615800009,0

For the model estimation, we propose a semiparametric series generalized method of moments estimator. We establish that the proposed estimator is both consistent and asymptotically normal. As an empirical illustration, we apply the proposed model and method to Tokyo crime data to estimate how the existence of a neighborhood police substation (NPS) affects the household burglary rate. The results indicate that the presence of an NPS helps reduce household burglaries, and that the effects of some variables are heterogenous with respect to residential distribution patterns. Furthermore, we show that using a model that does not adjust for the endogeneity of NPS does not allow us to observe the significant relationship between NPS and the household burglary rate.

The variables, whose relevance and statistical accuracy were first verified, formed a basis for the classification of the countries according to the Internet usage by physical persons aged 16-74. A linear ordering method - the construction of a synthetic variable based on the measurement of distance to the reference standard by means of the general distance measure developed by M.

We illustrate MCA using 44 international stock markets sampled at weekly frequency from 1994 to 2014. We find that both the co-skewness and the co-kurtosis structures can be summarized with a small number of factors.

Comprehensive trade agreements between states or transnational corporations, which are relevant global players at the international business world, always contain some requirements for Human rights, labour rights, rule of law, environmental conditions or poverty alleviation. This approach follows the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (hereinafter only UDHR), which (in its Preamble) stipulates, that every individual and every organ of society should promote respect for these rights and freedoms and to secure their universal and effective recognition. Current trends in international law abandoned the classical concept of application of international principles only to governments towards wider concept to governments and companies. In this new trend, transnational company is understood to be an organ of society within the meaning of UDHR. Therefore, these parts of Human Rights became globally applicable and open markets require from the market players to observe them. The article deals with the transfer of responsibility for Human Rights observance from the States to private sector upon the globally applicable various United Nations initiatives on responsible business (e.g. UN Principles for Responsible Investment, UNEP Equator Principles, UNHCHR Business and Human Rights, UNODC Anti-corruption or UNCTAD Corporate Responsibility Reporting).

Products that cannot be bought at the home stores are ordered via the Internet or mobile device from anywhere in the world. In addition, the price and the quality of the goods can be quickly and efficiently compared and buyers can choose the best alternative, i.e. goods that meet all their requirements. Not to mention that a lot of information about products or new trends can be searched for through the Internet and we can communicate with people from all over the world. For this reason, globalization processes supported by internationalization, information technologies, top-level logistics systems and advanced communication have created a global market where there are almost no restrictions.

The research hypothesis assumes that the amount of the market risk premium significantly affects the level of the estimated probability of default of the company. The analysis was carried out on the example of the largest capital markets in the European Union and GFCI within the period from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2017. Time series of the 20 most important stock market indices of non-financial companies representing all continents were applied in the empirical study. The largest non-financial companies, with regard to assets held as of 1 January 2012, listed on particular capital markets and included in the analyzed stock indices, one for each index, were included in the study. The following research methods were applied: CAPM equilibrium model, Sharpe's market asset value ratio and the market value of the corporate equity. The empirical study used time series of the 20 most important stock market indices of non-financial companies representing the analyzed markets. The article consists of introduction, applied methodology of the study and the results of the research and issues for further analysis. As a result of the analysis, the following research conclusion was established: the final value of companies from the GFCI area does not prove any significant difference with regard to their value before considering the risk premium. In the case of the EU market, this difference is significant. This means that capital markets with weaker capital and poorer, less stable economic conditions are less able to face market risk.","[Pera, Jacek] Cracow Univ Econ, Fac Econ & Int Relat, Int Econ Dept, Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Pera, J (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Fac Econ & Int Relat, Int Econ Dept, Krakow, Poland.",peraj@uek.krakow.pl,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1755,1762,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300224,0

In the service industry, a new format of interaction between social groups and social actors is increasingly being formed. It is with this aspect in mind that services can be classified as a socio-cultural phenomenon embedded in culture. Max Weber interpreted consumer psychology in capitalist era and expressed the idea that buyers buy goods based on purely rational mechanisms of their consciousness, assessing the degree of necessity of these goods, consumer properties, the price/quality ratio, etc. This type of culture is dying. The process of saturation of the market with goods and services has an increasing impact on the emotional mechanism in the minds of people through a variety of incentives, and also through the symbolic values that control the imaginations of people. There is a formation of culture described as consumerism, which means wasteful spending. The motto of this culture is to have is to be. Even such social institutions as health and education are increasingly being presented to mass consciousness as a service industry that is subject to the same commercialization laws as the whole service sphere. The services today are tools for the development of spiritual needs, or perhaps, a means of spiritual decay. It depends on what spiritual and moral guidelines the society is guided by. This work is dedicated to the study of the impact of the sphere of services on the social sphere.","[Plotnikov, Vladimir A.] St Petersburg State Univ Econ, St Petersburg, Russia; [Volkova, Albina A.; Nikitin, Yury A.] Acad Mat & Tech Provis, St Petersburg, Russia",Saint-Petersburg State University of Economics,"Plotnikov, VA (通讯作者)，St Petersburg State Univ Econ, St Petersburg, Russia.",plotnikov_2000@mail.ru; albvolkova@yandex.ru; yunikiti@yandex.ru,"Plotnikov, Vladimir/A-4854-2014",,,,,,20,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,822,829,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300107,0

Firstly, it is emphasized, that working conditions for employees have barely improved and that production planning and control can achieve considerable progress in this field. The presented literature demonstrate, that only a few number of papers consider the social dimension at the context of production planning and control. Therefore this paper presents a linear optimization model for the Master Production Scheduling, which can be considered as a long-term employee utilization management system in order to reduce employee burdens. The special feature of this model is the link between aspects of personnel planning und production planning and control. The system consideres different employee utilization intervals and employee utilization specific processing times and it includes flexible capacities, so it is allowed to build and to reduce the available capacity. This model is used to examine a case study, with the aim to verify the need for the control of employee utilization. The results confirm previous results from short-term planning horizons, which underline, that maximizing the utilization of employees does not necessarily lead to optimal results. Finaly, further research questions can be derived from the analysis of the results.","[Trost, Marco] Tech Univ Dresden, Int Inst IHI Zittau, Markt 23, D-02763 Zittau, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden,"Trost, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Dresden, Int Inst IHI Zittau, Markt 23, D-02763 Zittau, Germany.",marco.trost@mailbox.tu-dresden.de,,"Trost, Marco/0000-0001-9185-3209",,,,,13,4,4,0,0,EUROPEAN COUNCIL MODELLING & SIMULATION,NOTTINGHAM,"SCHOOL COMPUTING & MATHEMATICS, NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV, BURTON STREET, NOTTINGHAM, NG1 4BU, ENGLAND",,,978-0-9932440-7-0,,,,2018,,,,,,,329,335,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Engineering, Industrial",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Engineering,BR5JS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000656119000049,0

The Malaysian government has shown strong intention to reduce energy subsidies recently, but face challenges to prepare policy instruments to manage the impact. This study develops a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model with breakdown of households by income level to evaluate the potential impacts of removing energy subsidies on the Malaysian economy. It is shown that removing petroleum and gas subsidy would improve economic efficiency and increase GDP up to 0.65%. Budget deficit would be largely reduced after removing the petroleum subsidies, especially when the saved subsidy cost is not budgeted for other expenditure. Households would be worse off in most scenarios due to higher price level, but some compensation policy could make the lowest income group no worse than baseline, without harm the economy. The reduction in carbon emissions ranges 1.84-6.63% in different scenarios. The simulation results suggest Malaysia to completely remove all fuel subsidies and use the saved funding to cut budget deficit or spend on education, health and other service sector. It is also necessary to set a compensation scheme to minimize public resistance and make sure such scheme is affordable.","[Li, Yingzhu; Shi, Xunpeng; Su, Bin] Natl Univ Singapore, Energy Studies Inst, Singapore, Singapore; [Shi, Xunpeng] Univ Technol Sydney, Australia China Relat Inst, Sydney, NSW, Australia",National University of Singapore; University of Technology Sydney,"Li, YZ (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Energy Studies Inst, Singapore, Singapore.",li.yingzhu@nus.edu.sg,"Xunpeng, Roc Shi/I-5486-2019; SU, BIN/B-7990-2011; Li, Yingzhu/R-6631-2019","Xunpeng, Roc Shi/0000-0001-9653-7395; SU, BIN/0000-0003-4273-7054; Li, Yingzhu/0000-0003-3542-6274",Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) from its project on Institutional Strategy and Economic Impacts by Energy Subsidy Removals in EAS region,Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) from its project on Institutional Strategy and Economic Impacts by Energy Subsidy Removals in EAS region,"Work on this paper benefited from the financial support of the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) from its project on Institutional Strategy and Economic Impacts by Energy Subsidy Removals in EAS region.

We employ a profit-maximizing mixed-integer linear programming optimization to solve for development of natural gas refueling infrastructure incorporating spatial and temporal considerations and estimate the associated expansion in natural gas fuel demand in California. We investigate whether renewable fuel and carbon pollution credit markets create sufficient incentive to promote shifting to renewable natural gas fuel to replace vehicular natural gas demand.

To enhance our understanding of such crowding effects, we investigated two comparative study cases with contrasting state support for photovoltaic investments: high financial support in the province of Bolzano/South Tyrol (Italy) versus lower financial support in the province of Styria (Austria). We surveyed individual and collective investors, and as a control group, households who had not invested in photovoltaics at the time of data collection. We first compared crowding effects of diverging PV policies, and afterwards individual and collective socio-psychological patterns to grasp their role for photovoltaic adoption in general. Protecting the environment was found to be the strongest driver for photovoltaic investments. Generous state support in Italy widened demographics, crowded in economic considerations and persons with an anthropocentric relationship towards nature. However, Italy's high-incentivized photovoltaic policy crowded-out the motivations for collective energy projects and could not sufficiently encourage a sustainable diffusion of photovoltaics, as investments collapsed once state funding was stopped.","[Braito, Michael; Penker, Marianne; Vogel, Stefan] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna, Dept Sustainable Econ Dev, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Flint, Courtney] Utah State Univ, Dept Sociol Social Work & Anthropol, 0730 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Muhar, Andreas] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna, Dept Landscape Spatial & Infrastruct Sci, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Braito, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna, Dept Sustainable Econ Dev, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.",michael.braito@boku.ac.at; courtney.flint@usu.edu; andreas.muhar@boku.ac.at; marianne.penker@boku.ac.at; stefan.vogel@boku.ac.at,"Muhar, Andreas/HZJ-4539-2023; Vogel, Stefan/ABA-4508-2020; Penker, Marianne/IVV-5492-2023","Vogel, Stefan/0000-0001-8629-0659; Penker, Marianne/0000-0002-5185-9558; Muhar, Andreas/0000-0001-7623-5859; Flint, Courtney/0000-0003-2938-3765","BOKU University; Austrian Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy; Federal State of Vienna; Federal State of Lower Austria; Federal State of BILLA","BOKU University; Austrian Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy; Federal State of Vienna; Federal State of Lower Austria; Federal State of BILLA","The research leading to this paper was conducted within the Doctoral School Sustainable Development (dokNE) at BOKU Vienna, jointly funded by BOKU University, the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy, the Federal States of Vienna and Lower Austria, and BILLA.

This paper examines the pros and cons of strengthening demand-side options in strategies to reduce carbon emissions from the U.S. electricity sector. To date, demand-side management in the U.S. power sector has received overly simplistic treatment in energy models. To help fill this gap, we develop a customized version of the National Energy Modeling System to assess a range of demand-and supply-side policy scenarios. This enables four research hypotheses to be tested, related to mitigation costs, investment in new natural gas plants, carbon leakage, and local air pollution. We conclude that the clean power transformation can be made more affordable by improving the efficiency of energy utilization. By downscaling the expansion of natural gas plants, energy efficiency can also avoid legacy impacts. While strong energy-efficiency policies lower overall CO2 emissions, coal plant retirements can be delayed, postponing associated local air quality benefits. Thus, we illustrate a limitation of single-pollutant policies while also demonstrating the value of co-optimizing demand-and supply-side carbon mitigation options.","[Brown, Marilyn A.; Kim, Gyungwon; Smith, Alexander M.] Georgia Inst Technol, 685 Cherry St, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Southworth, Katie] EMV Energy Solut, Nashville, TN 37215 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Brown, MA (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, 685 Cherry St, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",,,"Kim, Gyungwon/0000-0002-9773-7337",Georgia Institute of Technology's Strategic Energy Institute; Brook Byers Institute of Sustainable Systems,Georgia Institute of Technology's Strategic Energy Institute; Brook Byers Institute of Sustainable Systems,"This research received support from the Georgia Institute of Technology's Strategic Energy Institute and the Brook Byers Institute of Sustainable Systems.

Paradoxically it has one of the lowest rates of electricity consumption in Latin America. Hence, a carefully crafted energy transition policy aimed at maximizing its energy resources could be the cornerstone of the country's long-term development strategy. The process of crafting public policy, particularly for emerging countries, entails an intricate decision problem involving several policy options with the potential to influence the country's welfare and all dimensions of socioeconomic development. Thus, we present a policy-making tool applied to the multi-criteria decision energy policy problem in Paraguay, based on an Analytic Hierarchy Process model, which can aid in the crafting of more nuanced decisions. Here, four policy options are considered based on economic, technical, social, environmental and political criteria. Our findings are significant for the on-going policy debate on the surplus question in Paraguay and suggest that, considering the model employed, a policy oriented at directing the surplus to leverage the industrial cluster development is the best option. Additionally, we believe the proposed model could benefit other emerging economies for addressing similar policy dilemmas.","[Blanco, G.; Amarilla, R.; Martinez, A.; Llamosas, C.; Oxilia, V.] Natl Univ Asuncion, Polytech Fac, San Lorenzo, Paraguay",Universidad Nacional de Asuncion,"Blanco, G (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Asuncion, Fac Politecn, Campus Univ San Lorenzo, San Lorenzo 2111, Paraguay.",gblanco@pol.una.py,"Blanco, Gerardo/AAR-4221-2021","Llamosas, Cecilia/0000-0001-6591-9745","Paraguayan National Council of Science and Technology (CONACyT) [14-INV-290, 14-POS-032]; PRONII program",Paraguayan National Council of Science and Technology (CONACyT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); PRONII program,"The authors are very grateful to the Paraguayan National Council of Science and Technology (CONACyT) for financial support through the projects 14-INV-290, 14-POS-032 and the PRONII program.

We analyze inequality in electricity outage duration at the census block group level using data from the U.S. Census, the U.S. Geological Survey, and a U.S. electrical utility's database of power outages from 2002 to 2004. Our intersectional approach identifies a factor variable of American Indian disadvantage as a correlate of average outage duration suggesting possible support for an institutional bias hypothesis. However, spatial error regression models demonstrate that unequal resilience within our study area is most consistently explained by proximity to priority assets (i.e., hospitals), average downstream customers affected by outages, and environmental conditions (i.e., the seasonality of outages). These results are consistent with existing research on utilities' response to power outages, and more broadly with the bureaucratic decision rules perspective on service inequalities.

It is estimated that annual investments of 48 billion USD are required to meet the target of the Sustainable Development Goals of providing universal electricity access by 2030. The need for private investments to meet this target is evident, but small-scale electrification projects are often unattractive for private investors due to unfavourable risk-return profiles and small investment volumes. Both issues can potentially be addressed by aggregating projects into diversified portfolios an approach commonly used by investors in several contexts, but little investigated in the context of rural electrification. This paper addresses the question of how spatial diversity in a portfolio can be used to reduce investment risks and increase investment volumes through a mixed-method approach involving three steps: (i) identification and classification of investment risks for renewable energy mini-grid projects, (ii) qualitative analysis of the correlations between investment risks for different projects through interviews, and (iii) quantitative estimation of the cost of capital and derisking effects of spatial diversification strategies for an experimental portfolio in India. We discuss the implications for policymakers in promoting and facilitating the ability of private sector investors to aggregate small-scale electrification investments.","[Malhotra, Abhishek; Schmidt, Tobias S.; Haelg, Leonore] ETH Zuric, Dept Human Social & Polit Sci, Energy Polit Grp, Haldeneggsteig 4, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Waissbein, Oliver] United Nations Dev Programme, 304 E 45th St,FF-924, New York, NY 10017 USA",,"Malhotra, A (通讯作者)，ETH Zuric, Dept Human Social & Polit Sci, Energy Polit Grp, Haldeneggsteig 4, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",abmalhot@ethz.ch,"Malhotra, Abhishek/AAH-2924-2021; Malhotra, Abhishek/AAW-8292-2021","Malhotra, Abhishek/0000-0002-3376-8871; Schmidt, Tobias/0000-0002-7971-2187; Haelg, Leonore/0000-0002-8036-5987",,,,,75,30,33,0,29,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2017,108.0,,,,,,657,672,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.06.037,0.0,,,16,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FC3FZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406725800061,0

Using a unique data set that values a wide array of solar incentives including cash incentives, tax credits, and solar renewable energy credits, we evaluate and compare the impact of incentives using a standardized net present value of each incentive. We pair these data the amount of new residential solar installations within each state and year to examine the relationship between incentive type and new residential PV installations. We find that each additional dollar of incentives has led to on average, an additional 500 W of additional installed capacity per thousand residential electric customers. This effect is enabled by the presence of net metering and financing availability. Direct cash incentives, when coupled with financing initiatives and net metering, drive much of the impact on installations. Results are consistent with research that shows that incentive salience may drive variation in effectiveness. Results suggest that approximately 67% of state and utility incentives, up to $1.9 billion over 11 years, were likely spent on incentives that did not increase residential solar PV installations.","[Matisoff, Daniel C.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Publ Policy, 685 Cherry St NW, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Johnson, Erik P.] Carthage Coll, Dept Econ, Kenosha, WI 53140 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Matisoff, DC (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Publ Policy, 685 Cherry St NW, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",,,"Matisoff, Daniel/0000-0003-4575-5282",Georgia Institute of Technology's College of Liberal Arts; NSF [1069138],Georgia Institute of Technology's College of Liberal Arts; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Funding for this research was provided by the Georgia Institute of Technology's College of Liberal Arts, and was supported in part by NSF Grant #1069138.

In addition, markets are affected by the volatile prices of primary energy carriers, e.g. gas and coal. The development of these different factors led to a decline of German wholesale electricity prices of almost 40% - from about 51 (sic)/MWil in 2011 to 31 (sic)/MWh in 2015. The goal of this study is to analyze the contribution of different price drivers to this decline. Thus, an agent based modeling and a regression approach are applied to investigate the effect of price drivers and to verify model results by comparing both approaches. Our results show that, against the public perception, the impact of carbon and coal prices on German electricity prices has been twice as high as the renewable expansion between 2011 and 2015. Furthermore, if carbon and coal prices do not recover to at least the level of 2011, electricity prices will remain on the current low level complicating the economic operation of gas power plants.","[Bublitz, Andreas; Keles, Dogan; Fichtner, Wolf] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Chair Energy Econ, Hertzstr 16, D-76187 Karlsruhe, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Bublitz, A (通讯作者)，Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Chair Energy Econ, Hertzstr 16, D-76187 Karlsruhe, Germany.",andreas.bublitz@kit.edu,"Keles, Dogan/AEM-0654-2022","Keles, Dogan/0000-0002-9620-6294; Fichtner, Wolf/0000-0001-6013-4674",Stiftung Energieforschung Baden-Wurttemberg,Stiftung Energieforschung Baden-Wurttemberg,"The authors are grateful to Markus Gremmelmaier for the technical assistance in the implementation of the regression models.

Learning-by-doing relates historical cost decreases to accumulation of experience. A learning investment is the amount of subsidy that is required to reach cost parity between a new technology and a conventional technology. We use learning investments to compare the relative impacts of two stylized types of R & D. We define curve-following R & D to be R & D that lowers costs by producing knowledge that would have otherwise been gained through learning-by-doing. We define curve-shifting R & D to be R & D that lowers costs by producing innovations that would not have occurred through learning-by-doing. We show that if an equal investment in curve-following or curve-shifting R & D would produce the same reduction in cost, the curve shifting R & D would be more effective at reducing the learning investment needed to make the technology competitive. The relative benefit of curve-shifting over curve-following R & D is greater with a high starting cost and low learning rate. Our analysis suggests that, other things equal, investments in curve-shifting R & D have large benefits relative to curve-following R & D. In setting research policy, governments should consider the greater benefits of cost reductions brought about by transformational rather than incremental change.","[Shayegh, Soheil] FEEM, Milan, Italy; [Shayegh, Soheil; Sanchez, Daniel L.; Caldeira, Ken] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA USA; [Sanchez, Daniel L.] Near Zero, Stanford, CA USA",Fondazione Mattei; Carnegie Institution for Science,"Shayegh, S (通讯作者)，FEEM, Milan, Italy.",soheil.shayegh@feem.it,"Caldeira, Ken/E-7914-2011","Caldeira, Ken/0000-0002-4591-643X; Shayegh, Soheil/0000-0002-8960-8244; Sanchez, Daniel/0000-0001-9281-5685",,,,,40,32,33,5,29,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2017,107.0,,,,,,532,538,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.05.029,0.0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FA0WU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405158200052,0

However, the current investment trend is showing signs of power supply inadequacy. Hence, many countries have embraced energy efficiency as a partial solution to looming energy problems. In reality, many people are not replacing their household appliances with energy-efficient ones. The use of energy efficient products in Malaysia is still at unsatisfactory level. Hence, this study aims at closing the gap by applying the moral extension of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to examine the determinants of consumers' purchase intention for energy-efficient household appliances. A survey using self-administered questionnaires was administered to 210 consumers in Penang, Malaysia, and Partial Least Square (PLS) regression was used to test the hypotheses. The findings show that consumer' more-favorable attitudes toward energy-efficient household appliances and perceived behavioral control significantly influence consumers' purchase intention for such products. This study also proved the extension of moral norm in the classic theory of planned behavior to be a significant predictor for consumers' purchase intention. Policy implications like creating awareness for Energy Star Labelling, enhancing Minimum Energy Performance Standard (MEPS) and the role of education in nurturing younger generations are addressed.","[Tan, Chin-Seang; Ooi, Hooi-Yin; Goh, Yen-Nee] Univ Sains Malaysia, Grad Sch Business, Gelugor 11800, Penang, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia,"Goh, YN (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, Grad Sch Business, Gelugor 11800, Penang, Malaysia.",yngoh@usm.my,,,,,,,68,194,206,17,203,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2017,107.0,,,,,,459,471,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.05.027,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FA0WU,,,Y,N,2024-03-10,WOS:000405158200043,0

This requires a large number of actors including individuals, companies and other organizations to adopt RETs. Policies will most likely be needed to induce adoption, but there is limited knowledge about what motivates RET adoption. The purpose of this paper is to complement and expand the available empirical evidence regarding motives to adopt RETs through a survey to over 600 RET adopters in Sweden. The main finding of the study is that there are many different motives to adopt RETs and that RET adopters are a heterogeneous group with regard to motives. Although environmental concerns, interest in the technology, access to an RE resource and prospects to generate economic revenues are important motives in general, adopters differ with regard to how large importance they attach to the same motive and each adopter can also have several different motives to adopt. There are also differences in motives between adopter categories (especially independent power producers vs. individuals and diversified companies) and between RETs (especially wind power vs. solar power). This implies that a variety of policy instruments might be needed to induce further adoption of a variety of RETs by a variety of adopter categories.","[Bergek, Anna; Mignon, Ingrid] Linkoping Univ, Dept Management & Engn, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; [Bergek, Anna] Chalmers, Environm & Energy Dept, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden",Linkoping University; Chalmers University of Technology,"Bergek, A (通讯作者)，Chalmers, Environm & Energy Dept, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden.",anna.bergek@chalmers.se; ingrid.mignon@liu.se,"Bergek, Anna/O-2064-2016; Mignon, Ingrid/AAW-5496-2020; Bergek, Anna/A-3279-2009","Bergek, Anna/0000-0003-1952-902X; Mignon, Ingrid/0000-0002-3134-4442; Bergek, Anna/0000-0003-1952-902X",Swedish Energy Agency [33685-1],Swedish Energy Agency(Swedish Energy Agency),This work was supported by the Swedish Energy Agency [grant number 33685-1].,,43,52,56,1,39,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2017,106.0,,,,,,547,559,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.04.016,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EW2RL,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402343600052,0

However, the innovation studies literature sees innovation as an interactive process, emphasising the role of knowledge exchange for successful innovation. Furthermore, it is increasingly accepted that co-location is not sufficient for knowledge exchange to occur. Consequently, there is also a need to assess the effectiveness of policy measures to promote knowledge exchange between co-located actors. The objective of this paper is to narrow this gap by exploring the outcome of an indirect policy in stimulating coordination and networking. The paper analyses policies for increased networking in a mechatronics district located in the peripheral and less innovative region Apulia (Southern Italy). The success of the coordination and networking action is examined by adopting a longitudinal approach. In order to assess the association of the policy with the overall network structure, social network analysis is used to analyse the data. We compare characteristics of the network in the early and later phase of the district across five dimensions of knowledge exchange, identifying a large increase in the use of partnerships as the main effect of the policy.","[Calignano, Giuseppe; Fitjar, Rune Dahl] Univ Stavanger, UiS Business Sch, Ctr Innovat Res, Stavanger, Norway",Universitetet i Stavanger,"Calignano, G (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, UiS Business Sch, Ctr Innovat Res, Stavanger, Norway.",giuseppe.calignano@uis.no; rune.d.fitjar@uis.no,"Fitjar, Rune Dahl/C-2580-2013; Calignano, Giuseppe/L-2054-2019","Fitjar, Rune Dahl/0000-0001-5333-2701; Calignano, Giuseppe/0000-0002-6885-768X",,,,,108,6,6,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Since then, coal-fired boilers have had to choose among three main compliance alternatives: purchase pollution permits; switch to an alternative lower-sulfur coal; or adopt a scrubber. This decision problem is driven by the evolution of several economic variables and is revised when significant changes (to prices, quality of inputs, output level, technology, transport costs, regulations, among others) occur. Using a structural dynamic discrete choice model, I recover cost parameters and use them to evaluate two different counterfactual policies. The results confirm there is a trade-off between fuel switching and scrubbing costs (with the latter having a higher investment cost and a lower variable cost), and also the existence of regional heterogeneity. Finally, the ARP implied cost savings of approximately $4.7 billions if compared to a uniform emission rate standard and $14.8 billions if compared to compulsory scrubbing for the 1995-2005 period.","[Hancevic, Pedro Ignacio] Ctr Invest & Docencia Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

Applying this framework to the drafting of new energy legislation in Chile, we trace how perceived shortcomings in equity and distributional justice were turned into market failures, able to be resolved by market-based mechanisms. This case highlights the dangers implicit in the uncritical economization of energy justice claims, in which ethical considerations regarding the distribution of risks and benefits of energy production and provision are reduced to a redistribution of payments among consumers - something that limits the possibilities for structural reform.","[Alvial-Palavicino, Carla; Ureta, Sebastian] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Dept Sociol, Nucleo Milenio Invest Energia & Soc, Santiago, Chile",Universidad Alberto Hurtado,"Alvial-Palavicino, C (通讯作者)，Univ Alberto Hurtado, Dept Sociol, Nucleo Milenio Invest Energia & Soc, Santiago, Chile.",carla.alvial@gmail.com,,"Ureta, Sebastian/0000-0003-3169-4992; Alvial Palavicino, Carla/0000-0002-6098-0501","Iniciativa Cientifica Milenio, Nucleo Milenio de Investigation en Energia y Sociedad NS of the Government of Chile [130024]","Iniciativa Cientifica Milenio, Nucleo Milenio de Investigation en Energia y Sociedad NS of the Government of Chile","This research was funded by Iniciativa Cientifica Milenio, Nucleo Milenio de Investigation en Energia y Sociedad NS 130024 of the Government of Chile.",,37,21,22,0,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUN,2017,105.0,,,,,,642,647,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.02.013,0.0,,,6,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ET8EY,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000400532900062,0

It uses a dynamic multi-sector, mixed-complementarity model. Continuing existing policies results in a power system still fueled completely by hydrocarbons. The alternative policies result in a transition to a more efficient energy system where nuclear and renewable technologies become cost-effective and produce 70% of the electricity in 2032. Introducing the alternative policies can reduce the consumption of oil and natural gas by up to 2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2032, with cumulative savings between 6.3 and 9.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The energy system sees a net economic gain up to half a trillion 2014 USD from increased oil exports, even with investments in nuclear and renewables.

This method groups units that have similar technology for better comparison. Under this scheme, there are two implicit assumptions: First, that each class reflects a unique technology where its elements are not outliers. Second, classes are assumed to be stationary and fixed. If this assumption is violated, the classification is transient and time-dependent, inadequate for the regulatory use suggested in the seminal papers. We apply latent class models to classify Swedish electricity distributors under different specifications. In most of the models, we identify one large class with approximately 78.4% of the DMU's and two small classes with 7.4% and 14.2% respectively. Moreover, most of small classes elements switch between categories. We contrast our parametric results with nonparametric outlier detector methods and find a relationship between identified outliers and the elements of smaller residual classes. We believe that our work is an important caveat to the adoption of latent class modelling as an alternative or remedy for conventional models, relying on a homogeneous reference set.","[Agrell, Per J.] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, Louvain Sch Management, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Brea-Solis, Humberto] Univ Cote Azur, SKEMA, Ave Willy Brandt, F-59777 Lille, France",Universite Catholique Louvain; SKEMA Business School; Universite Cote d'Azur,"Agrell, PJ (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, Louvain Sch Management, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",per.agrell@uclouvain.be; humberto.breasolis@skema.edu,"Solis, Humberto Brea/ABB-3050-2020","AGRELL, Per/0000-0002-3835-2365",FNRS FRFC project 'Beyond incentive regulation' [14603726],FNRS FRFC project 'Beyond incentive regulation'(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS),Constructive comments on a previous version by the Associate Editor and two anonymous referees are gratefully acknowledged.

According to the Open Innovation (DI) paradigm, key stakeholders like utilities, vendors, laboratories, universities etc. should take advantage of external knowledge to improve their innovation performance. Several studies have demonstrated that firms adopting the DI paradigm are more likely to innovate. Despite the interest of P &E firms in enhancing their innovation capabilities, surprisingly few articles (usually case studies) described the implementation of the OI paradigm in P & E firms. This article fills the gap by identifying the key drivers that encourage a firm in the P & E sector to embrace the OI paradigm. The authors adopt a hybrid research approach collecting evidence from the literature and through a multiple case-study analysis involving seven British firms and universities operating in the P & E industry.

Regional Studies. This paper reports on a case study in an ex-coal-mining area in northern France that faces different socio-economic problems along with a limited public transportation system. Over the last decades it has undergone several regeneration strategies. The study analyses transport behaviour, the impact of major potential regeneration projects and residents' needs. The research is based on qualitative analysis and focuses on those population groups with limited transportation availability or at risk of social exclusion. The results show that many different transport policy measures are needed in order to achieve successful regeneration.","[Mahieux, Aurelie] Univ Sci & Technol Lille, IESEG Sch Management, Fac Econ & Social Sci, CNRS,UMR 9221,LEM, Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Mahieux, Aurelie; Mejia-Dorantes, Lucia] IFSTTAR, Dept Transport Econ & Sociol AME, Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Mejia-Dorantes, Lucia] Fraunhofer Inst Syst & Innovat Res ISI, Dept Sustainabil & Infrastruct Syst, Karlsruhe, Germany",IESEG School of Management; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Lille - ISITE; Universite de Lille; Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Fraunhofer Gesellschaft,"Mahieux, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sci & Technol Lille, IESEG Sch Management, Fac Econ & Social Sci, CNRS,UMR 9221,LEM, Villeneuve Dascq, France.;Mahieux, A (通讯作者)，IFSTTAR, Dept Transport Econ & Sociol AME, Villeneuve Dascq, France.",aurelie.mahieux@orange.fr; lucia.mejia-dorantes@isi.fraunhofer.de,"Dorantes, Lucia Mejia/ABA-4327-2020","Mejia Dorantes, Lucia/0000-0002-9244-0251",Nord-Pas-de-Calais Region; French Environment and Energy Management Agency (ADEME) within the research project SUIM,Nord-Pas-de-Calais Region(Region Hauts-de-France); French Environment and Energy Management Agency (ADEME) within the research project SUIM,This research was funded by the Nord-Pas-de-Calais Region and the French Environment and Energy Management Agency (ADEME) within the research project SUIM.

Given Russia is a key supplier of fossil fuels, a major greenhouse gas emitter, and climate impacts on its vast territory likely to have far-reaching consequences, this contextual research shows that the country's current policies fall woefully short of what is required to implement the Paris Agreement. To support Russia in developing informed, internally consistent and scientifically literate energy policies, this paper presents low-carbon emission trajectories commensurate with the 2 degrees C goal, using stakeholder-informed backcasting. The results illustrate that even if Russia's CO2 emissions peak in 2017, a reduction rate of at least 9% per year between 2020 and 2030 is required to meet a 2 degrees C budget constraint. These sustained rates are in excess of anything achieved globally or, indeed, deemed possible within most studies. Such emission reductions would involve unprecedented material changes to Russia's energy system, including both rapidly cutting energy demand and building extensive low-carbon infrastructures. Nevertheless, failure to transform Russia's existing policies will likely have global repercussions for achieving the Paris Agreement's goals.","[Sharmina, Maria] Univ Manchester, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, H Floor,Pariser Bldg,Sackville St, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Sharmina, M (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, H Floor,Pariser Bldg,Sackville St, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",maria.sharmina@manchester.ac.uk,"Sharmina, Maria/GWC-2144-2022",,,,,,95,24,25,1,35,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2017,104.0,,,,,,303,315,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.02.009,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP7HS,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397549500030,0

As well as confirming that local socio-economic factors, including wealth, housing type and population density are found to be important in explaining uptake of this policy, local green attitudes measured in three different ways are shown not to be important. Existing local technical expertise, proxied for using data on small-scale renewable electricity devices in each area prior to the introduction of FIT, is an important factor in explaining subsequent adoption. Critically, we also find that there are spatial (i.e. between neighbourhood) processes explaining the uptake of these technologies. Taken together, our results suggest that, as currently designed, FIT policy may be regressive in income and could exacerbate spatial economic inequalities.","[Allan, Grant J.; McIntyre, Stuart G.] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Econ, Sir William Duncan Bldg,130 Rottenrow, Glasgow G4 0GE, Lanark, Scotland",University of Strathclyde,"Allan, GJ (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Dept Econ, Sir William Duncan Bldg,130 Rottenrow, Glasgow G4 0GE, Lanark, Scotland.",grant.j.allan@strath.ac.uk; s.mcintyre@strath.ac.uk,,"Allan, Grant/0000-0002-1404-2768; McIntyre, Stuart/0000-0002-0640-7544",ClimateXChange; Scottish Government,ClimateXChange; Scottish Government,"The authors are very grateful for the helpful comments of two anonymous referees.

This goal is based on the fact that EVs produce zero tailpipe emissioon the associated carbon emissins. However, the generation and transmission of the charge electricity produce emissions that are not explicitly accounted by current measurement metrics for EV greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and as such, the notion of environmental cleanliness of EVs becomes questionable. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive metric to quantify the actual environmental impacts of EVs. The new metric that we call the electric vehicle emissions index (EVEI) captures CO2 emissions in the electricity production to consumption stages. Our metric is the first that provides transparency in the comparison of total emissions among various EV models, as well as in the side-by-side comparison of an EV with a gasoline vehicle (GV). Illustrative results indicate that the actual environmental impacts of an EV may show wide spatial variations and in some case, these impacts may be even greater than that of GV. Such insights that the EVEI provides may be useful in a wide range of applications, particularly in policy and incentive formulation.","[Manjunath, Archana; Gross, George] Univ Illinois, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Manjunath, A (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",amanjun2@illinois.edu; gross@illinois.edu,,"EVISE(R), George/0000-0002-9158-7753",,,,,30,43,49,5,56,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2017,102.0,,,,,,423,429,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.12.003,0.0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP4NM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397357200040,0

Using official expenditure data from 1993 to 2008, we estimate an expenditure elasticity for electricity of 0.3988 and of 0.4055 for space heating. The own price elasticity for electricity is 0.4310 and 0.5008 in the case of space heating. Disaggregation of households by expenditure and socio-economic composition reveals that the behavioural response to energy price changes is weaker (stronger) for low-income (top -income) households. There are considerable economies of scale in residential energy use but scale effects are not well approximated by the new OECD equivalence scale. Real increases in energy prices show a regressive pattern of incidence, implying that the welfare consequences of direct energy taxation are larger for low income households. The application of zero-elasticities in assessments of welfare consequences of energy taxation strongly underestimates potential welfare effects. The increase in inequality is 22% smaller when compared to the application of disaggregated price and income elasticities as estimated in this paper.","[Schulte, Isabella] Heidelberg Univ, Heidelberg, Germany; [Heindl, Peter] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW L7 1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Heindl, P (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res ZEW L7 1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany.",heindl@zew.de,,,German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [01UN1204A]; Sozialpolitische Konsequenzen der Energiewende in Deutschland; project Integrierte Analyse einer grunen Transformation [01UT1411A],German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Sozialpolitische Konsequenzen der Energiewende in Deutschland; project Integrierte Analyse einer grunen Transformation,"We thank Miguel Angel Tovar Reanos and three anonymous referees for helpful comments and advise.

The empirical results indicate that most UK inefficiency comes from the reallocation effect, while most Chinese inefficiency is attributable to lack of best practices; quality explains more of the expenditure variations in the UK relative to China.

For the creation of the spatial concept of macroeconomic imbalances detection and for the evaluation of their development synchronisation the Cluster Analysis Method has been used. Based on the comparison it has been proven that in the course of the observed eleven years in the area of macroeconomic imbalances synchronisation no clearly positive development occurred. In the observed period, countries outside the Eurozonc responded to economic shocks with a higher degree of similarity and a lower degree of volatility than the Eurozone countries, and at the same time in these countries the remedy in the post-crisis period was faster and more intensive.","[Bednarova, Pavla; Valentova, Vladimira Hovorkova] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Voronezska 13, Liberec 46002 2, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Bednarová, P (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Voronezska 13, Liberec 46002 2, Czech Republic.",pavla.bednarova@tul.cz; vladimira.valentova@tul.cz,"Bednářová, Pavla/HLP-4977-2023; Hovorkova Valentova, Vladimira/M-1370-2018","Hovorkova Valentova, Vladimira/0000-0001-5718-315X",,,,,20,0,0,0,0,UNIV SOCIAL & ADM AFFAIRS,HAVIROV,"VITEZSLAVA NEZVALA 801-1, HAVIROV, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87291-20-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,25,34,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Public Administration",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations; Public Administration,BP4JR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000552892500003,0

As a consequence of globalization, cities have to solve more problems, public funds need to be better targeted and natural resources need to be explored consciously and responsibly. Digital revolution brought possibility to use technology as a driver to solve old problems by new ways. Moreover, it also brought new options how to enhance sustainable development. Smart City initiatives can be viewed as an innovation as it align new technologies with new processes, new participatory policy, and new management methods. In sum, Smart City represents changes in governance and daily life. In our article we conceptualize Smart City as socio-technical system with focus on the social part. We use traditional socio-technical model, proposed by Leavitt in 1965. We also consider approaches to evaluation of the success of Smart Cities initiatives with possible metrics.

To describe the physical and mechanical properties of corn ears and its connections to the corn stalk, laboratorial and in-situ tests and observations were conducted. During an iteration process the mechanical model of the corn ear and the connection between the corn ear and the corn stalk were validated. There has been a good match between the numerical results and the experimental data.

If the same export target countries are chosen at different levels, it is possible to enhance the overall results. In Latvia the collaboration in the selection process of the export target countries is ensured by the memorandum of understanding. However, 3 criteria stated in the main export facilitation planning document are not enough to provide the best results. Therefore the research aims to identify more optimal choice of the factors. Based on the Latvian exporting companies', export related institutions' and other partnership's opinion, the results show that the main criterions, which have to be considered for the selection of the export target countries, are important export market for Latvia; economic indicators; quality of infrastructure; stable and secure banking and financial markets; national security; political stability; perception of corruption; geographical proximity; membership of international organizations; import volume.

With the purpose of reflecting the comprehensive influence of urbanization on the ecosystem, we choose the ecological footprint to represent the ecosystem's integrated change and distinguish low-income, middle-income and high-income countries to reflect the nonlinear impact. This paper uses both static and dynamic STIRPAT (Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology) models to analyze 72 countries at different income levels during the 1980-2008 period. The results show that the overall ecological elasticity of urbanization at the global level is negative. Specifically, results suggest urbanization, associated to increased income, to have eco-friendly potential in terms of decreased ecological footprint. To explain such results, this paper answers two questions: Why does urbanization show ecological protection effects? Why does a more pronounced protection effect seem associated to increased income levels? Improved market mechanism, increased resource use efficiency as well as increased environmental awareness in urban areas associated to increased income levels are likely to support an eco-friendly urbanization process. Burden-shift to low-income countries also needs to be taken into account, in order to avoid policies that increase wellbeing locally at the expenses of far-away areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The changing economic conditions, as well as the effects of competition, impose on transport companies both the search for new forms of operation and the optimization of operating costs. Due to the above, the undertaking of certain projects should be linked to a strategic business plan that will take achieving satisfactory profit. Due to this, running a business is not so easy. It is connected with continuing global market turbulence and also forces entrepreneurs to constantly seek and acquire valuable information that influences the company's development. These actions translate directly into savings and allow to develop schemes that in the long run will allow to rationalize costs and avoid their unjustified occurrence, which will translate into increased business value on the EU market. Doing business in the examined European dimension requires proper cash management - so owning, acquiring, i.e. disposing of capital is crucial to your business. Thus, the quintessence of long-term operation of the company on the European market results primarily from the maximization of benefits, which is synonymous with increasing the value of the enterprise. In the article, the authors have presented an analysis of the costs of the transport company.

From the point of view of consumer buying behavior free market with almost unlimited opportunities is the consequence of globalization. Products that cannot be bought at the home stores are ordered via the Internet or mobile device from anywhere in the world. In addition, the price and the quality of the goods can be quickly and efficiently compared and buyers can choose the best alternative, i.e. goods that meet all their requirements. Not to mention that a lot of information about products or new trends can be searched for through the Interneta and we can communicate with people from all over the world. For this reason, globalization processes supported by internationalization, information technologies, top-level logistics systems and advanced communication have created a global market where there are almost no restrictions. The products and services offered by domestic and foreign companies are being constantly improved and upgraded because of consumers whose demands and needs grow from year to year. The aim of the paper is to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of globalization that have an impact on the consumer behavior of particular generations, whereas attention will be paid to online shopping, trends and communication.","[Malikova, Iveta] Univ SS Cyril & Methodius Trnava, Fac Mass Media Commun, J Herdu Sq 2, Trnava 91701, Slovakia",University of SS Cyril & Methodius Trnava,"Maliková, I (通讯作者)，Univ SS Cyril & Methodius Trnava, Fac Mass Media Commun, J Herdu Sq 2, Trnava 91701, Slovakia.",iveta@pauma.sk,,,VEGA project [1/0283/15],VEGA project(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),"This contribution is a partial output of the VEGA project No. 1/0283/15,Aspects of marketing communication in the process of creating customer value in the B2C market in the context of maximizing the market share in descending retail sales.",,21,0,0,1,5,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1486,1493,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059202055,0

Regional Studies. The links between financial deregulation and economic performance are evaluated in a European context. Specifically, the study analyses the relaxation of bank branching restrictions in Spain, which triggered a remarkable interregional expansion of savings banks that coincided with an unprecedented period of sustained economic expansion. Although related questions have been widely investigated for the United States, experiences in Europe have received far less research attention. An additional contribution of the paper lies in its use of quantile regression, which enables the investigation of the possibility of economic effects taking into account the degree of regional development. The potential endogeneity of some of the regressors is also explicitly considered. Results do not support the case for a positive effect of bank branch deregulation in Spain. Out-of-region entry, in particular, does not seem to have had any specific positive effect on regional development, and this result is quite homogeneous across provinces regardless of their relative wealth.","[Manuel Pastor, Jose; Serrano, Lorenzo] Univ Valencia, Dept Anal Econ, Campus Tarongers, Valencia, Spain; [Manuel Pastor, Jose; Serrano, Lorenzo; Tortosa-Ausina, Emili] Ivie, Valencia, Spain; [Pavia, Jose M.] Univ Valencia, Dept Econ Aplicada, Campus Tarongers, Valencia, Spain; [Tortosa-Ausina, Emili] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Campus Riu Sec, Castellon de La Plana, Spain",University of Valencia; University of Valencia; Universitat Jaume I,"Tortosa-Ausina, E (通讯作者)，Ivie, Valencia, Spain.;Tortosa-Ausina, E (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Campus Riu Sec, Castellon de La Plana, Spain.",jose.m.pastor@uv.es; jose.m.pavia@uv.es; Lorenzo.Serrano@uv.es; tortosa@uji.es,"Pavia, Jose M.

Research conducted in case of Republic of Serbia investigates several barriers which are classified in four main categories: goods, logistics, infrastructure, framework conditions. Framework conditions barriers are further subdivided and classified in four subcategories: political/legal, environment, economy, technology. Results indicate that the most significant negative influence on the further development of the inland waterway transport in Serbia comes from the political/legal barriers. This result implies that the government need to pay more attention to development of inland waterway transport, as well as to make more effort to enhance the cooperation with stakeholders.","[Mircetic, Dejan; Nikolicic, Svetlana; Bojic, Sanja; Maslaric, Marinko] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Tech Sci, Trg D Obradovica 6, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia",University of Novi Sad,"Mircetic, D (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Fac Tech Sci, Trg D Obradovica 6, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia.",dejanmircetic@gmail.com,"maslaric, marinko/ABE-6364-2020; Mircetic, Dejan/AAI-3593-2021; maslaric, marinko/HJY-5996-2023","Mircetic, Dejan/0000-0002-1602-7908; Bojic, Sanja/0000-0003-0030-4525; Maslaric, Marinko/0000-0002-4696-5188","Danube Transnational Programme and Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, Provincial Secretariat of Finance [DTP1-050-3.1]; research project From horse-drawn railway to intermodal transport within Visegrad Fund","Danube Transnational Programme and Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, Provincial Secretariat of Finance; research project From horse-drawn railway to intermodal transport within Visegrad Fund","This research was supported by Danube Transnational Programme and Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, Provincial Secretariat of Finance, through project: Regional and Transport Development in the Danube-Black Sea Region towards a Transnational Multiport Gateway Region (DBS Gateway Region), number: DTP1-050-3.1.r This paper is supported by the research project From horse-drawn railway to intermodal transport within Visegrad Fund.",,6,5,5,0,7,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2261-236X,,,MATEC WEB CONF,,,2017,134.0,,,,,,,,39.0,10.1051/matecconf/201713400039,0.0,,,6,Business; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BJ5ZQ,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426430600039,0

Simulation studies using a two-tank systems show that, if the deadband value is known a priori, the Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) can effectively improve the closed-loop performance in the presence of valve stiction.","[Novak, Jakub; Chalupa, Petr] Tomas Bata Univ, Fac Appl Informat, Ctr Secur Informat & Adv Technol, Nam TGM 5555, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Novak, J (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ, Fac Appl Informat, Ctr Secur Informat & Adv Technol, Nam TGM 5555, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic.",jnovak@fai.utb.cz,"Chalupa, Petr/ADO-4918-2022; Chalupa, Petr/H-6609-2012; Novák, Jakub/H-6378-2012","Chalupa, Petr/0000-0002-9229-7483; Chalupa, Petr/0000-0002-9229-7483;","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic within the National Sustainability Programme [LO1303, MSMT-7778/2014]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic within the National Sustainability Programme","This work was supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic within the National Sustainability Programme project No. LO1303 (MSMT-7778/2014).",,10,2,2,0,2,EUROPEAN COUNCIL MODELLING & SIMULATION,NOTTINGHAM,"SCHOOL COMPUTING & MATHEMATICS, NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV, BURTON STREET, NOTTINGHAM, NG1 4BU, ENGLAND",,,978-0-9932440-4-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,379,383,,,,,,5,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Economics; Engineering, Industrial",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Engineering,BH9XI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404420000057,0

Motivation is measured in terms of the income received by self-employed persons or by the attainment of the transition between being selfemployed, employed and unemployed. One of the prerequisites for determining the degree of motivation to remain self-employed is the conviction that individuals always decide for the status that provides him/her with the highest level of profit or income. In order to most accurately determine the intensity of motivation, model calculations were performed of alternative income, especially social benefits, for individuals living in selected cities in the Usti nad Labem (Ustecky) and Vysocina regions; the selection of these regions was based on the unemployment rate and the number of self-employed persons respectively. It was determined that the intensity of motivation to pursue entrepreneurial activity is largely influenced by active employment policy and other fiscal policy measures that are not directly related to entrepreneurial activity.","[Rihova, Lenka] Res Inst Labour & Social Affairs RILSA, Delnicka 213-12, Prague 17000 7, Czech Republic",,"Rihová, L (通讯作者)，Res Inst Labour & Social Affairs RILSA, Delnicka 213-12, Prague 17000 7, Czech Republic.",lenka.rihova01@gmail.com,"Farkačová, Lenka Říhová/AAP-5216-2021","Farkačová, Lenka Říhová/0000-0002-5692-1103",,,,,22,0,0,1,1,UNIV SOCIAL & ADM AFFAIRS,HAVIROV,"VITEZSLAVA NEZVALA 801-1, HAVIROV, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87291-20-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,277,292,,,,,,16,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Public Administration",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations; Public Administration,BP4JR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000552892500023,0

The article shows, how important and powerful the brand is in the continuity of global value chains. It points to the phenomenon of the global brand in the context of benefits, reputation and success for the company and consumers. The internationalization of human resources and the current political and economic problems indicate new forms and possibilities of management and dynamics of entrepreneurial subjects. The analyzed company has a clearly defined vision of its ethics in all parts of the established value chain in its business, which differs significantly from others who deal marginally with ethical and environmental issues.

Companies and their stakeholders often face the need for valuation of assets, no matter whether tangible or intangible. The valuation, in general, is influenced by purpose of valuation, choice of a method and, of course, by valuator's subjectivity. Valuation of identifiable intangible asset, in addition, is affected by their specific features. Therefore it is more difficult to estimate its value than estimate the value of tangible asset or the value of firm as a whole. For instance, intangibles are non-rivalrous in use with international reach; the economic benefit generated by intangibles is less predictable, more risky and quite often not generated by the asset itself, but in interaction with other business assets. Aim of this paper is to provide an overview of current globally used financial methods of valuation and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. In general, intangible assets valuation methods are based either on comparability, costs or income approach, however results obtained from various methods may differ quite significantly. This paper also presents a case study demonstrating application of chosen methods for valuation of a patent. The aim of presented case study is to compare several value estimations obtained by different methods and identify the key value determinants.","[Stefankova, Stanislava] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Dept Finance, Kolejni 2906-4, Brno 61200, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,"Stefankova, S (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Dept Finance, Kolejni 2906-4, Brno 61200, Czech Republic.",vyletelova@fbm.vutbr.cz,,,,,,,24,0,0,1,7,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2486,2493,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059204051,0

This study investigates the key factors that contributes in electricity theft through structured questionnaires from residential electricity consumers of IESCO in the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad. A sample size comprise of both rural and urban respondents. The demographic profile and descriptive statistics are discussed. Most of the respondents agree that electricity price hike is the main contributor in rising theft. The crime is taking place with the connivance of bribe accepting utility employees. The correlation analysis is carried out and the data is further used for the empirical estimation of the model. The regression analysis employed key variables such as the conduct of utility employee, consumers' satisfaction with the service, monitoring, overall consumer perception and the monthly expenses on electricity consumption. The results suggest that monitoring, conduct and monthly expenses variables are significant in explaining electricity theft.

This article provides empirical insight into factors influencing the decision of German small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to adopt GE. Potentially relevant factors are identified through a review of the previous literature and investigated using logit model analyses based on a large-scale survey of German SMEs regarding GE adoption. We find that German SME decision-makers who have consciously decided to adopt GE characteristically have a high level of perceived environmental responsibility. The results also show that an SME's decision to adopt GE is influenced by decision-makers' perceptions of the sustainability, continual availability and price premium of GE. While investigating firms' characteristics, we found evidence that the likelihood of adoption is increased in microenterprises that have displayed pro-environmental behavior (other than GE adoption) in the past. Further, in considering an SME's sales market, customer appreciation of GE is a central determinant of adoption.

We argue that the level of trust affects the relative strength of industry- and environmental lobby groups, and therefore the effect of corruption on the stringency of environmental policies. We use a novel index of the level of corruption in each state which uses Associated Press (AP) news wires. We find that higher corruption reduces the stringency of environmental policies when the level of trust is low, but the effect declines and even becomes positive at higher levels of trust.

Through 21 expert interviews we establish the current state of DSR, and expectations for its development. Whilst non-domestic DSR appears healthy, if fragile, domestic DSR is considered to be currently unviable, it's future success dependant on market innovations. In following how that situation is expected to change, we highlight key assumptions about prospective end users. These assumptions are shaping the efforts of the industry actors tasked with delivering DSR. We identify two visions of the user, one passive whilst technologies automate on their behalf, the other integrated to the point of themselves being an automaton. We detail a series of concerns about the limitations of these user visions, and the ability of industry to reach beyond them towards a more differentiated view. We conclude with a call to broaden the institutional landscape tasked with delivering DSR, in order to foster a greater diversity of end user roles, and ultimately greater demand responsiveness from a broader user base.","[Goulden, Murray; Spence, Alexa; Wardman, Jamie; Leygue, Caroline] Univ Nottingham, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Leygue, Caroline] Tajin 380, Mexico City 03020, DF, Mexico",University of Nottingham,"Goulden, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",murray.goulden@nottingham.ac.uk,"Spence, Alexa/D-3646-2009","Spence, Alexa/0000-0003-4014-0430; Wardman, Jamie/0000-0002-3609-7591; Goulden, Murray/0000-0003-4005-8752","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council through the Horizon Digital Economy grant [EP/M02315X/1]; Nottingham Research Fellowship; EPSRC [EP/M02315X/1, EP/K002589/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/M02315X/1, EP/K002589/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council through the Horizon Digital Economy grant(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Nottingham Research Fellowship; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [grant number EP/M02315X/1] through the Horizon Digital Economy grant and by a Nottingham Research Fellowship.,,65,51,53,0,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2018,122.0,,,,,,176,185,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.07.013,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GX2UX,,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447576700017,0

However, the necessary space for power generation infrastructure can be in conflict with other uses of available land and different perspectives on how the development of renewable electricity should occur can lead to stakeholder oppositions. In an explorative study, I used Q methodology to inquire how affected stakeholders perceived the development of a photovoltaic solar park in Switzerland. This allowed me to identify possible ways to alleviate conflicts between designating land for agricultural use and renewable electricity development. The results show that while most identified worldviews among stakeholders agreed large roof surfaces should be prioritized for solar panels, remaining divergences explain tensions that threatened the realization of the solar park. Two perspectives were in conflict: on one side, actors defending a strict protection of agricultural land; on the other, actors who considered it appropriate to build solar panels on fields. The results also suggest that renewable energy expansion should preserve a balance between large-scale and small-scale photovoltaic power development to be socially acceptable amongst a broad spectrum of stakeholders.","[Spaeth, Leonhard] Swiss Fed Inst Technol Zurich ETH Zurich, Inst Environm Decis, Climate Policy Grp, Univ Str 22 CHN J70, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Späth, L (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol Zurich ETH Zurich, Inst Environm Decis, Climate Policy Grp, Univ Str 22 CHN J70, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",leonhard.spaeth@usys.ethz.ch,,"Spath, Leonhard/0000-0002-8333-0632",Swiss National Science Foundation [153974],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"This paper is based on research carried out within the National Research Program Energy Turnaround (NRP 70, grant number 153974), funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation.

The results show that 60% of the irrigation farmers and 46% of the dry land farmers were food secure. Adoption of irrigation has a positive effect on food security. Other variables explaining food security are education, informal training, credit, extension services, use of improved seed, fertilizer and herbicide application, farm and off-farm income.

The results reveal that standalone sustainability reporting, firm age, and auditor type are the main factors in the dissemination of sustainability information in the Russian context. The findings suggest that companies with a share of foreign ownership disclose more transparent sustainability information than companies owned only by local investors. Additionally, companies that prepare sustainability reports only in Russian provide more valuable sustainability information than companies that publish reports in both English and Russian.

Differentiated from the existing literature which rarely considers services trade and exchange rate, this paper uses the proportion of services trade to measure trade structure, and exchange rate as one of the independent variables. Firstly, the stability of each variable is tested by ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) and NP (Ng-Perron) test. Then, ARDL bound test is used to test the cointegration of the variables as it has better properties than traditional cointegration methods and is more suitable for the model in this paper. Thirdly, Error Correction Model is used to analyze the long-term and short-term dynamic relationship between the variables. Fourthly, the Granger causality test based on the VAR is performed. It is found that during the study period EKC hypothesis was valid for China, and that whilst the impacts of both services trade and exchange rate on China's carbon emissions were negative, the impacts of FDI inflows were positive.

These forecasts are an important input to integrated resource planning (IRP) processes involving utilities, regulators, and other stake-holders. Despite their importance, however, there has been little analysis of long term utility load forecasting accuracy. We conduct a retrospective analysis of long term load forecasts on twelve Western U. S. electric utilities in the mid-2000s to find that most overestimated both energy consumption and peak demand growth. A key reason for this was the use of assumptions that led to an overestimation of economic growth. We find that the complexity of forecast methods and the accuracy of these forecasts are mildly correlated. In addition, sensitivity and risk analysis of load growth and its implications for capacity expansion were not well integrated with subsequent implementation. We review changes in the utilities load forecasting methods over the subsequent decade, and discuss the policy implications of long term load forecast inaccuracy and its underlying causes.","[Carvallo, Juan Pablo; Larsen, Peter H.; Sanstad, Alan H.; Goldman, Charles A.] Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, MS, 1 Cyclotron Rd,90R4000, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,"Carvallo, JP (通讯作者)，Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, MS, 1 Cyclotron Rd,90R4000, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",jpcarvallo@lbl.gov,"Larsen, Peter H./AAD-2874-2019; Carvallo, Juan Pablo/ABH-3869-2020","Goldman, Charles/0000-0003-3117-4014",National Electricity Delivery Division of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Electricity (OE) Delivery and Energy Reliability under Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory [DE-AC02-05CH11231],National Electricity Delivery Division of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Electricity (OE) Delivery and Energy Reliability under Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),The work described in this article was funded by the National Electricity Delivery Division of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Electricity (OE) Delivery and Energy Reliability under Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231.,,38,40,45,3,29,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2018,119.0,,,,,,410,422,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.060,0.0,,,25,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO0XY,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439671200038,0

With incentivizing policies (a (sic)5,000 subsidy and a (sic)400 parking and access fee annual savings), currently in place in a limited number of Italian Regions and cities, electric cars perform in monetary terms better than hybrid electric cars and some diesel cars, especially if they are charged at home. However, electric cars are expected to gain market share in the year 2025 if fuel prices follow past trends, even without subsidies.

How do the two trends affect PM2.5 emission? This paper quantitatively analyzes the socioeconomic drivers of PM2.5 through assessment on Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology (STRIPAT), based on the panel data of 79 developing countries over 2001-2010. The average levels of PM2.5 pollution are calculated using remote sensing data, overcoming the difficulties that developing countries are in lack of PM2.5 monitors and that point data cannot reflect the overall level of PM2.5 pollution on a large scale. Squared terms of income and urbanization and their cross term are included in the regression models respectively to analyze the possible heterogeneous impacts on PM2.5 emissions in different development stages. The results show that income, urbanization and service sector have significant impact on PM2.5 pollution. Income has a positive effect on PM2.5 all the time but the effect decreases as the level of urbanization or income goes up.

We propose a multi-stage equilibrium model incorporating endogenous determination of generation capacity investment, network expansion and redispatch based on the model introduced by Grimm et al. (2016), including flexibilization of industrial electricity consumption. The model allows to investigate incentives for flexibilization and the impact of flexible industrial electricity consumers on the system. An application to the German electricity market reveals that flexible industrial electricity consumption can be profitable for firms. If the share of flexible electricity consumers is high, price fluctuations are mitigated, which lowers the individual cost savings from demand flexibility. Comparing different market designs, positive impacts of flexible electricity demand on the system are observed in both the system optimum and the market equilibrium. In scenarios with flexible industrial electricity consumption, welfare is considerably higher than in those without. This is due to lower electricity costs of industrial consumers, but more importantly due to less investment in conventional power generation as well as a reduced transmission network expansion. However, a comparison of nodal and uniform pricing underlines the importance of regional price signals with respect to an efficient allocation of flexible industrial demand.","[Ambrosius, Mirjam; Grimm, Veronika] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Chair Econ Theory, Lange Gasse 20, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany; [Soelch, Christian; Zoettl, Gregor] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Chair Ind Econ & Energy Markets, Lange Gasse 20, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg; University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Ambrosius, M (通讯作者)，Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Chair Econ Theory, Lange Gasse 20, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany.",mirjam.ambrosius@fau.de; veronika.grimm@fau.de; christian.soelch@fau.de; gregor.zoettl@fau.de,,"Zoettl, Gregor/0000-0002-2729-1173; Solch, Christian/0000-0001-5880-1300",Bavarian State Government; Emerging Field Initiative (EFI) of the Friedrich-Alexander Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg [2_RW_05]; DFG [TRR 154],Bavarian State Government; Emerging Field Initiative (EFI) of the Friedrich-Alexander Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg; DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This research has been performed as part of the Energie Campus Nurnberg and is supported by funding of the Bavarian State Government and the Emerging Field Initiative (EFI) (2_RW_05) of the Friedrich-Alexander Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg through the project Sustainable Business Models in Energy Markets.

First, data on pioneers and early adopters are biased towards specific performance characteristics of the product and the socio-demographic characteristics of the consumers. Second, surveys on the intention to buy under perform in detecting movements of those who do not intend to buy, who are the majority in the case of new products. Probabilistic choice models try to overcome these issues. By using survey data on electric vehicles, we theoretically contribute to this stream of literature and empirically estimate the impact of specific performance improvements and price reduction on the probability of consumers switching from non-intention to buy to intention to buy. Results show that price reduction is the most important triggering factor for the diffusion of electric vehicles, as it determines more than other factors the transition of consumers from the non-intention to the intention to buy an electric vehicle. The improvement in the driving range constitutes the second most important factor for low initial values of the stated intention to buy, while the possibility of recharging at home matters significantly more for consumers with high initial values of the stated intention to buy.","[Cecere, Grazia] Telecom Ecole Management, Inst Mines Telecom, 9 Rue Charles Fourier, F-91011 Evry, France; [Cecere, Grazia] Univ Paris Sud, RITM, Orsay, France; [Corrocher, Nicoletta] Bocconi Univ, ICRIOS, Via Sarfatti 25, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Guerzoni, Marco] Dipartimento Econ & Stat Cognetti de Martiis, Campus Luigi Einaudi,Lungo Dora Siena 100 A, I-10153 Turin, Italy",Universite Paris Saclay; Bocconi University,"Corrocher, N (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, ICRIOS, Via Sarfatti 25, I-20136 Milan, Italy.",grazia.cecere@telecom-em.eu; nicoletta.corrocher@unibocconi.it; marco.guerzoni@unito.it,"guerzoni, marco/AAB-3416-2021","guerzoni, marco/0000-0001-7415-0771; Corrocher, Nicoletta/0000-0003-2642-8227",,,,,70,47,47,5,53,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2018,118.0,,,,,,19,32,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.03.034,0.0,,,14,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ1TF,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000435050000003,0

We predict that, with an entirely electric fleet, the UK power generation capacity would need to increase by 1/3. We show that it is possible to completely mitigate this with controlled charging, although substantial infrastructure would be required. However, we propose a simple scheme which could largely avoid the negative effect and does not require the creation of new infrastructure.

The results of the conditional logistic model show that the location choice for Japanese frozen food companies is affected not only by the penetration rate of refrigerators, but also by traditional cost-reduction factors, such as wages and investment promotion policies in the host country.

In a theory-guided analysis this paper examines empirically which structural 'handicaps' affect regional transition rates from school to training and how regional training markets may be classified according to these structural factors. To this end, a new method is applied which combines regression and cluster analysis to avoid arbitrariness in the selection of classification variables. It generates a well-interpretable classification of vocational education markets, which is of broad use in research and labour market policy.

To take full advantage of agglomeration economies that come with urban concentration, infrastructure plays a key role. For a long time development policies have focused on the provision of infrastructure. In this work, we analyse: first how urban concentration and infrastructure interact with each other for encouraging economic growth; and second whether policies promoting infrastructure have considered the spatial distribution of economic activity. As a case study, we focus on the European Investment Bank (EIB) projects financing infrastructures, for both the European Union and the EU neighbourhood. We perform panel data analysis considering different measures of infrastructure, and we also analyse the EIB projects. Our results suggest a relevant role of connectivity infrastructure (i.e. transport and communications) for agglomeration benefits to take place in European Neighbouring Policy countries. Our results also suggest that EIB funding in ENP countries is mostly country specific and displays no spatial dimension.","[Castells-Quintana, David] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ Aplicada, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Castells-Quintana, David; Royuela, Vicente] Univ Barcelona, AQR IREA Res Grp, Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona,"Royuela, V (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, AQR IREA Res Grp, Barcelona, Spain.",David.Castells.Quintana@uab.cat; vroyuela@ub.edu,"Castells-Quintana, David/Z-2511-2019; Royuela, Vicente/A-4162-2009","Castells-Quintana, David/0000-0002-0250-7214; Royuela, Vicente/0000-0002-7647-0063","European Community [FP7/2010-2.2-1, 266834]; [ECO2013-41022R]",European Community;,The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2010-2.2-1) under Grant Agreement No. 266834.

Most household water consumption is used for the production of services (e.g. bathing, laundry and irrigation of landscaping), typically using capital goods (e.g. showers, appliances and irrigation systems) to combine time, water and sometimes energy. The likelihood households will face rationing depends at least in part on the success of the other demand management strategies, such as pricing. The household choice of time allocation, planned water use, and water and time augmenting conservation capital investment, is modeled as a household production problem in an environment with a risk of water use restrictions. A utility manages the levels at which restrictions are imposed, and equilibria are identified where these restriction trigger levels are consistent with household planned water use. When conservation capital is water augmenting, demand for capital is decreasing in the price of water and in the likelihood of restrictions being applied. If water demand is decreasing in water price, then increasing water prices reduces the likelihood of restrictions being applied, and can reverse the relationship between water price and the demand for conservation capital. Empirical investigations into household investment in conservation capital should account for the likelihood that households face water use restrictions, and practitioners should be aware that the effectiveness of campaigns to encourage greater investment in conservation capital may depend on both how water is priced and how it is rationed.","[Janmaat, John] Univ British Columbia, IK Barber Sch Arts & Sci, Econ Unit 8, 3187 Univ Way, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Janmaat, J (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, IK Barber Sch Arts & Sci, Econ Unit 8, 3187 Univ Way, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada.",john.janmaat@ubc.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; University of British Columbia,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); University of British Columbia,"Funding for collecting the data reported in this paper was provided by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, and by the University of British Columbia.

Brexit is among several influences on the future of the policy, whose evolution is part of a wider reshaping of the principles and practice of regional policy in Europe. In the context of emerging policy challenges and recent contributions to the regional policy literature, the article highlights innovation, human capital and effective institutions as three crucial dimensions of future policy. It argues that a shift in regional policy priorities, governance and territorial focus is underway - partly influenced by place-based policy thinking - at EU level under Cohesion Policy as well as under national regional policies in the EU27 and the UK.","[Bachtler, John] Univ Strathclyde, European Policies Res Ctr, 40 George St, Glasgow G1 1QE, Lanark, Scotland; [Begg, Iain] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, European Inst, London, England",University of Strathclyde; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Bachtler, J (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, European Policies Res Ctr, 40 George St, Glasgow G1 1QE, Lanark, Scotland.",john.bachtler@strath.ac.uk,,"Bachtler, John/0000-0002-0706-597X","European Regional Policy Research Consortium; European Commission's Horizon 2020, Firstrun Project [649261]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [649261] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme","European Regional Policy Research Consortium; European Commission's Horizon 2020, Firstrun Project; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme)","European Regional Policy Research Consortium; European Commission's Horizon 2020, Firstrun Project, Grant/Award Number: 649261",,82,26,26,2,52,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

First, this paper outlines the measurement of fuel poverty using the Low Income High Costs indicator (LIHC) and examines the main characteristics of fuel poor households in France based on multidimensional statistical analysis using a new micro-level survey data. It then explores the salient determinants of fuel poverty risk using logistic regression. About 3.18 million households are estimated to be in fuel poverty, representing 12% of all French households. The hierarchical classification suggested four distinct profiles, which shed light on the main features of fuel poor households. Additionally, results show that the risk of being fuel poor and the depth of fuel poverty increase significantly with lower EPC rating house and confirm the existence of a social gradient in fuel poverty. Recognition of this aspect can be helpful for developing economically efficient policies to address fuel poverty. This study does not aim to be exhaustive in policy implications terms, but rather to present a new way of thinking about fuel poverty solutions by targeting different household groups.","[Belaid, Fateh] Univ Paris Est, Sci & Tech Ctr Bldg, 14 Blvd Newton, F-77447 Marne La Vallee 2, France",Universite Gustave-Eiffel,"Belaïd, F (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Est, Sci & Tech Ctr Bldg, 14 Blvd Newton, F-77447 Marne La Vallee 2, France.",fateh.belaid@cstb.fr,"BELAID, Fateh/AAO-6406-2020","BELAID, Fateh/0000-0002-1077-2798",,,,,51,70,71,4,28,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2018,114.0,,,,,,189,200,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.12.005,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FW0DY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424962800019,0

An extensive analysis is performed of a comprehensive, simulation-based dataset of feasible vehicle characteristics, performance and cost as projected to 2045 by Argonne National Laboratory. Two economic metrics, the net present value and total cost of ownership, are projected. An advanced HEV would require 3-4 times less fuel per km driven in urban driving than today's ICEV, and 2-3 times less in highway driving. Advanced PHEVs in electric mode and advanced BEVs would require about 10% the energy (as electricity) per km that today's ICEVs use (as fuel). HEVs are close to cost competitive today while PHEVs and BEVs require large subsidies. Rather than subsidizing or mandating the early market uptake of PHEVs and HEVs, a better strategy would be to rapidly increase automobile fuel efficiency standards to that which can be achieved only with HEVs, with modest support for PHEVs, followed by the support for energy efficient fuel cell-PHEVs and/or BEVs if technological developments necessary for century time-scale sustainability are achieved.","[Harvey, L.

The Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) of Fiji targets 81% of renewable energy share in grid electricity supply by 2020 and 100% by 2030. A model is developed to determine possible energy transitions to achieve those targets. The model uses installed capacities, capacity factors and electricity generated for each technology and calculates direct CO2 emissions, the Global Warming Potential and the Levelised Cost of Electricity. Eight energy mixes were assessed for electricity supply adequacy and the ability to achieve the NDC. The results demonstrate few realistic energy future options; a sole focus just on renewable energy generation is unlikely to be successful. Specifically, meeting the 2020 and 2030 NDC targets would require the installation of significant new renewable energy capacity accompanied by phasing out of fossil fuel plants, addition of baseload technology (e.g. geothermal, Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion), technological improvements (e.g. capacity factor) and minimizing electricity demand through energy savings and efficiency. All those determinants mean that there is a vital need for improved energy modelling and strategic planning, if NDCs are to be achieved in Fiji and other PSIDS.","[Michalena, Evanthie; Hills, Jeremy M.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sustainabil Res Ctr, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia; [Kouloumpis, Viktor] OSTRACON Ltd, Crown House,27 Old Gloucester St, London WC1N 3AX, England; [Hills, Jeremy M.] Univ South Pacific, Inst Marine Resources, Private Bag,Laucala Campus, Suva, Fiji; [Michalena, Evanthie] 186 Alkiviadou St, Piraeus 18536, Greece",University of the Sunshine Coast; University of the South Pacific,"Michalena, E (通讯作者)，Univ Sunshine Coast, Sustainabil Res Ctr, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia.",michalena@hotmail.com; viktor.kouloumpis@overallsustainability.com; jeremy.hills@usp.ac.fj,"Kouloumpis, Viktor/I-4405-2012","Kouloumpis, Victor/0000-0003-3699-7335",,,,,68,16,16,2,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2018,114.0,,,,,,508,518,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.12.022,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FW0DY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424962800047,0

We propose an enhanced role for investing in transmission capacity for inter-regional trade to allow effective fuel switching among countries through a physically connected market. We develop a conceptual framework of Regional Energy Hubs and propose a cost minimization model in support of a transmission investment strategy that integrates: (i) a key geopolitical parameter for countries that are geographically close in a region but under different political jurisdictions, judged as stable and receptive to firm trading arrangements, (ii) an economic parameter related to the fuel mix where the differences in a country's supply and demand characteristics are significant enough for allow mutual benefits to be realized through cost reduction, (iii) an environmental parameter linked to a country's carbon intensity that could benefit from the resources of a neighboring jurisdiction with lower intensities, and (iv) a financial parameter for each country within a region capable of attracting investment capital.

There is an inherent arbitrariness in the choice of the cut-off defining low and high frequencies, which calls for a careful characterization of the implied optimal (for forecasting) degree of smoothing of the key macroeconomic indicatorswe analyse. We document interesting patterns that emerge: for most variables the optimal choice amounts to disregarding fluctuationswell belowthe standard business cycle cut-off of 32 quarters while generally increasing with the forecast horizon; for inflation and variables related to housing this cut-off lies around 32 quarters for all horizons, which is below the optimal level for federal government spending.","[Valle e Azevedo, Joao; Pereira, Ana] Banco Portugal, Ave Almirante Reis 71,6th Floor, P-1150012 Lisbon, Portugal; [Valle e Azevedo, Joao] Nova Sch Business & Econ, Campus Campolide, P-1099032 Lisbon, Portugal; [Pereira, Ana] Inst Super Econ & Gestao, Rua Quelhas 6, P-1200781 Lisbon, Portugal",Banco de Portugal; Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa,"Azevedo, JVE (通讯作者)，Banco Portugal, Ave Almirante Reis 71,6th Floor, P-1150012 Lisbon, Portugal.;Azevedo, JVE (通讯作者)，Nova Sch Business & Econ, Campus Campolide, P-1099032 Lisbon, Portugal.",azevedojv@gmail.com; ana.regina.pereira@gmail.com,,"Valle e Azevedo, Joao/0000-0002-3538-3860",,,,,0,2,2,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

The industry is highly turbulent and has faced severe changes in the recent decade where clients expect more service-oriented approach by major manufacturer as well as by other stakeholders involved in the automotive value chain. Thus, stakeholders have to innovate constantly to keep clients satisfied.

The manifestation of considerable globalization is the liberalization of trade and the integration of entities into larger entities with a significantly international environment of internal culture. If the firm wants to maintain its long-term competitiveness, it cannot trust only its current performance, but needs to systematically look for new opportunities to increase its position on the market. One of the possibilities is to evaluate the performance of firm through the results of time series analysis of financial indicators. Financial analysis can be used to identify key factors that affect the performance of firms in international business. The aim of the article is to evaluate changes in the structure and financial performance of firms in the Slovak Republic in relation to the chosen legal form of business in the period 2011-2016. The basis for the analysis was selected business entities divided by SK-NACE. The analysis as well as the results are presented in the form of outputs of mutual comparison. For evaluation of the financial performance of firms, we chose some indicators, focusing on assessing the ability to meet short-term liabilities and for expressing revenue and profit generation. In order to verify the assumption of the relationship between the financial results of the firms and the chosen legal form of business, we apply the combination of the adjusted methods. The results of the analysis show that the legal form of the business entity and its financial position are very closely related.","[Dvorak, Marek] FEM CULS Prague, Dept Management, Prague, Czech Republic; [Mach, Jiri] FEM CULS Prague, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Hoskova, Pavla] FEM CULS Prague, Dept Stat, Prague, Czech Republic",,"Dvorák, M (通讯作者)，FEM CULS Prague, Dept Management, Prague, Czech Republic.",Dvorak.post@gmail.com; mach@pef.czu.cz; hoskova@pef.czu.cz,"Dvořák, Marek/H-4582-2018; Mach, Jiri/H-4657-2018","Dvořák, Marek/0000-0003-3731-2633; Mach, Jiri/0000-0002-0526-4246",,,,,21,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1552,1559,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300198,0

One of the positive effects of this process is the creation of better conditions to fulfill consumers' needs, which are favorable to the improvement of the standard of living. The standard of living, understood as a level of needs fulfillment, is a result of interactions between various determinants. The globalization is one of them. Its influence, although it is obvious, is defined as indirect, postponed in time and difficult to measure. The present paper is to indicate the connections between globalization of consumption and the standard of living. This will be the background to the presentation of changes occurring in Polish standard of living. Undoubtedly, the globalization and integration processes, which took place in Europe from 2004-2016, influenced the present image of the standard of living in Poland. This influence was of multidirectional nature, whereas the particular significance for the level of Polish needs fulfillment can be assigned to the changes, which took place in the market of consumer goods and services and in the labor market. Based on the consumption indicators analysis, it is possible to state the opinion that Polish standard of living reached higher level in the end of researched period than in 2004. It is proven by positive pace of increase of individual consumption in the household sector, as well as the increase of free choice expenditures and the decrease of food index value.","[Grzega, Urszula] Univ Econ Katowice, 1Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Grzega, U (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, 1Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland.",ugrzega@ue.katowice.pl,"Grzega, Urszula/T-7312-2018","Grzega, Urszula/0000-0002-1220-7880",,,,,18,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1087,1094,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300141,0

Unfortunately, the development has been in many cases environmentally, economically and socially unsustainable. The globalized economy has made some countries richer than ever, but the development has not been equal. The unsustainable utilization of natural resources and human labour has created an unsustainable world with unprecedented wealth and well-being in rich industrial countries and serious environmental problems, corruption, inequality and human rights violations in many developing countries. Everybody can see the challenges of environmental sustainability, but those are in most cases caused by the challenges of social and economic sustainability. While the gap between poor and rich becomes ever bigger, the economic sustainability challenge cannot be overlooked. When a person, a company or a country is struggling economically, the aspects of environmental and social sustainability are easily overlooked or neglected. In addition, the social unsustainability which can be seen in corruption, lack of democracy and all forms of racism must be dealt with. In this paper, the existing sustainability challenges will be researched in the viewpoint of a rich developed country like Finland.

The conventional procedure is found to be markedly undersized in terms of yielding empirical coverage probabilities lower than the nominal level, especially when the serial correlation is strong. An example from macroeconomic forecasting demonstrates the importance of accounting for serial correlation when the probability forecasts for real GDP declines are evaluated using ROC.

The hypothesis about dissimilarity of the assessment of a financial condition has been proven by the analysis of the correlation between the accrual and cash results The analysis of a financial situation based on cash flows led to a conclusion that a financial situation is more complete, reliable and not affected by balance and tax policy, but there are also differences between the assessment based on financial ratios calculated on the basis of accrual data (the balance sheet and the profit and loss account) and the financial situation of the studied companies based on cash data The article uses the method of economic analysis, descriptive statistics and correlation analysis.","[Mioduchowska-Jaroszewicz, Edyta] Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ & Management, Szczecin, Poland",University of Szczecin,"Mioduchowska-Jaroszewicz, E (通讯作者)，Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ & Management, Szczecin, Poland.",edyta.mioduchowska-jaroszewicz@usz.edu.pl,"Mioduchowska-Jaroszewicz, Edyta Anna/ABB-9036-2021",,,,,,30,0,0,1,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-67913-6,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2018,8.0,1.0,,,,,89,103,,10.1007/978-3-319-67913-6_6,0.0,,,15,"Business; Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BR9PT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000679398800006,0

Also, it is important for the existing supplier's customers to have a sustainable delivery quality in order to increase their quality and optimize their costs for the future. We can divide the distribution channel from a quality point of view into several categories. The first is the quality of the work done by the employees in the given positions and which greatly affects the overall delivery quality. The second important part is the distribution and planning of the distribution routes and the optimization of their design in order to reduce the time of vehicle transfer and reduce the total costs associated with the distribution. In this paper we will deal with the second mentioned part, which is the optimization of the distribution route, and specifically we will focus on its proposal of the introduction of new distribution centers of the selected company.

The competitive struggle in the global environment is mainly due to significant and wide availability of information and the use of the global market for the purchase and sale of products from around the world, for example through e-commerce and internationalisation. In terms of corporate identity, online marketing is an important mean to compete for a customer on the global market. The corporate identity is the process of identifying a company. Tools and means through which the enterprise can be identified at global level include, among other things, corporate identity along with its components. The main reason why it is important for managers to focus on constantly building corporate identity is that it offers space and the ability to differentiate in a variety of ways from the competition.

For the above purposes, the different barracks were analysed in three main industrial areas: municipalities, industrial settlements or colonies, and agricultural sites.

It is possible to say that the employees that take part in any section of the organization are interested in such activities. Within this context, the political behavior, which can be named as manipulative behaviors exhibited deliberatively by individuals in order to actualize their expectations, is only a small part of the organizational politics fact. The political behaviors are explicitly exhibited in certain organizations, while they develop esoterically in other organizations. Therefore, an individual starts to exhibit political behaviors once he/she realizes that the organization is political, and then this turns into a cyclical action due to the interactions among the employees. In this context, it can be clearly set forth that the organizational politics fact redounds up the personal behaviors in an individual's life.

These aspects become, to a certain extent, also the factor influencing the civil and political climate in the localities. The current use of social business as a possible partner in the regional development takes place not always in a coordinated way and not always with the support of the regions. The objectives of the contribution are oriented to the proposal of social business as the factor of the region development with the aim of the sustainable development while respecting regional policy principles.","[Varvazovska, Pavia] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Humanities, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic; [Kucirkova, Lenka] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Languages, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Varvazovska, P (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Humanities, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic.",varvazovska@pef.czu.cz; kucirkova@pef.czu.cz,,,"Internal Grant Agency (IGA), Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague [20171028]","Internal Grant Agency (IGA), Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague","The information introduced in this paper resulted from the solution of a project of the Internal Grant Agency (IGA) No. 20171028, Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague, Civic interests and their projection into the political life.

It also qualitatively investigates supply chain bottlenecks and their impact in terms of access toward markets for small producers in rural areas. The analysis of supply-chain bottlenecks is focusing on the breakdown of costs (production, post-harvest, and logistics (transport)) within the supply chain. The location study is in South Konawe-, Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia which is known as one of the largest citrus producer in Indonesia. The results show that the formation of the price of oranges is formed with the following characteristics: 1) cost at the farm level is made up of costs for production activities and processing activities are not done because orange is sold in the form of raw materials, 2) factors that affect the cost at the trade level is the infrastructure condition, mileage and processes during delivery, and 3) the selling price is determined by the trader in accordance with market demand. Merchants were indicated to have the power to determine the prices are a big trader in Java, with implications for the pricing down to the farm level. The condition of infrastructure is an important aspect in the formation of prices. Badly damaged roads often cause farmers cannot sell their production to other regions because of the high risk of damage to goods due mired vehicles on the road, as well as a long time transporting. Another issue that arises is related to inadequate governance in the Port of Kendari, Southeast Sulawesi which caused the cost of transportation by the port to be expensive. The existence of interests of the parties that play a role in making the port of unloading handling process becomes inefficient. High price made by the association of workers unloading for example, makes the high cost of handling goods. Not to mention the imbalance in the flow of goods in and out of the Port of Kendari, mainly from Java, which caused the vessel operator must take into account the condition of empty when the ship returned in Java. Another condition is a problem with the transport of goods is the last priority given to freight transport compared to passenger transport. This often makes long waiting times at the port, which will affect the transported goods, especially perishables goods such as fruits. Generally this indicates inefficient trading patterns oranges in South Konawe requiring further intervention of the various parties concerned.","[Widodo, Kuncoro Harto] Gadjah Mada Univ, Fac Agr Technol, Dept Agraind Technol, Jl Flora 1, Bulaksumur 55281, Indonesia; [Kurniawan, Dwi Ardianta] Gadjah Mada Univ, Ctr Transportat & Logist Studies, Jl Kemuning M-3, Sleman 55281, Diy, Indonesia",Gadjah Mada University; Gadjah Mada University,"Widodo, KH (通讯作者)，Gadjah Mada Univ, Fac Agr Technol, Dept Agraind Technol, Jl Flora 1, Bulaksumur 55281, Indonesia.",kuncorohw@yahoo.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,1,6,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2413-0877,,,KNE LIFE SCI,,,2018,,,,,,,170,178,,10.18502/kls.v4i2.1669,0.0,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BL1IO,,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447763100019,0

Spatial lag models are used to measure interdependency between dependent variables. If there are no missing data, it is easy to interpret this spatial autocorrelation process. Very sparsely sampled data are sometimes used in empirical studies. For such data, we observe only a small part of a population containing possible mutual dependencies. Simulation studies based on artificial data confirm the relation between the sampling rate and selection ratio of spatial and non-spatial models. Our findings include the following: (1) Negative spatial autocorrelation of the data-generating process (DGP) may not be observed. (2) Positive spatial autocorrelation of the DGP may be observed, but it is downward-biased. (3) We obtain less-biased estimates if we use a non-row-standardized weight matrix.

Distance-preference data are collected from beach visitors and analyzed in part by adapting a duration model, where time is modeled as distance at which utility-indifference occurs. The results show that the public consists of two highly-contrasting groups one large group that views wind turbines as a substantial disamenity while another large group views them as an amenity. When pooled, these groups tend to wash out their impacts, revealing that average preference results suggesting that wind turbines might not be amenities or disamenities. However, when viewed in this new model, one fords that policy is much more complicated and no single siting strategy (far or close) will satisfy the public because the two main groups have largely irreconcilable preferences.","[Fooks, Jacob R.] USDA, ERS, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Messer, Kent D.; Duke, Joshua M.] Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Johnson, Janet B.] Univ Delaware, Polit Sci & Int Relat, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Parsons, George R.] Univ Delaware, Sch Marine Sci & Policy, Newark, DE 19716 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); University of Delaware; University of Delaware; University of Delaware,"Messer, KD (通讯作者)，Dept Appl Econ & Stat, 531 South Coll Ave 226, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",messer@udel.edu,"Messer, Kent/AAK-8811-2020; Duke, Joshua/ABB-9392-2021","Duke, Joshua/0000-0002-9895-1191",NSF EPSCoR [0814251],NSF EPSCoR(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)NSF - Office of Integrative Activities (OIA)),This work received funding support from NSF EPSCoR ID#0814251.,,43,3,5,0,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2017,110.0,,,,,,288,302,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.08.005,0.0,,,15,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FP5LK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417660800028,0

The linkages between human capital and migration have also found a fertile ground in recent years especially in Europe where many studies have focused on interregional migration of graduates and highly skilled individuals. However, the literature on this phenomenon in the USA is less developed. Using the SESTAT database from NSF, this paper aims at contributing to the understanding of inter-state migration behavior of graduates in the USA and its effects on their career outcomes. It builds on the existing literature not only by focusing specifically on the US context, but also incorporating into the empirical model a correction for the possible selection bias that arises from the dual relationship between migration propensity and human capital endowment. Our estimated Mincerian earning equations, corrected for migrant self-selectivity, show that indeed repeat migration is associated with higher average salaries, while late migration is associated with a salary penalty. As for the other control variables, our results are consistent with what has been found in the labor economics literature. Female workers suffer from a salary penalty, while experience, level of education and employer size are all associated with higher average salaries. The labor market also rewards different fields of study differently.","[Kazakis, Pantelis; Faggian, Alessandra] Ohio State Univ, Agr Environm & Dev Econ AEDE Dept, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Faggian, A (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Agr Environm & Dev Econ AEDE Dept, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",kazaqi.1@osu.edu; faggian.1@osu.edu,"Kazakis, Pantelis/HTO-5342-2023; Faggian, Alessandra/K-8548-2019; Faggian, Alessandra/B-5332-2012","Kazakis, Pantelis/0000-0002-1526-1225; Faggian, Alessandra/0000-0002-2479-2933;",,,,,57,21,23,2,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Economic reasoning suggests subsidizing carbon storage, but empirical models show that this may easily more than double stand-level bare land values. Subsidization may thus be expensive, as it requires paying for all storage, including what would otherwise be obtained for free. To limit the consumption of public funds, the regulator may apply an additionality principle and solely subsidize storage exceeding a baseline level. We show that the commonly applied stand-level analysis suggests that the additionality principle could be applied to optimal rotation decisions without distortions. However, applying a forest vintage model with endogenous prices and land allocation decisions shows that similar application of the additionality principle causes distortions to both land allocation and optimal forest rotation. Nevertheless, subsidizing carbon storage by forest site productivity tax may still be preferable among the second-best policies. The distortions can be avoided by eliminating excessive subsidies by general land taxation irrespective of whether the land is used for forestry or agriculture. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Energy renovations in dwellings offer unique opportunities to reduce both energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. In this article, the renovation rates for the non-profit housing stock of the Netherlands are presented, based on the changes in the energy performance of 856,252 dwellings for the period of 2010-2014. The data necessary are drawn from a monitoring system that contains information about the energy performance of approximately 60% of all dwellings in the sector. The method used follows the changes of the dwellings' physical properties and reported energy performance. The results show that although many energy improvements have been realized, they result in small changes of the energy efficiency of the dwellings. Deep energy renovation rates are very low. If this pace continues, the progress is too little to reach national and international policy targets.

While recent scholarship has presented detailed scenarios for consideration, further analysis is needed into their implications and the scale of social, institutional, and policy changes that will be necessary for implementation. This communication examines one component of a transition to an energy system based on solar power: the scale and pace of land use change that would be necessary to realize the widespread use of utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) technology envisioned in these scenarios. How much land would be required to deploy the proposed generating capacities for utility-scale solar PV, under a uniform set of assumptions? How does the envisioned change to solar land-use compare to historical episodes of rural settlement? By answering these questions, we focus attention on policies that permitted earlier changes to occur, and the possibilities for similar measures to be adopted in a solar transition.","[Shum, Robert Y.] SUNY Coll Brockport, Dept Polit Sci & Int Studies, 350 New Campus Dr, Brockport, NY 14420 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Brockport,"Shum, RY (通讯作者)，SUNY Coll Brockport, Dept Polit Sci & Int Studies, 350 New Campus Dr, Brockport, NY 14420 USA.",rshum@brockport.edu,,,,,,,11,12,15,5,15,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,460,462,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.07.014,0.0,,,3,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400043,0

The cumulative oil consumption from 2010 to the point when zero oil demand is achieved is compared with a recent oil supply-marginal cost curve. Assuming that oil is consumed in order of increasing extraction cost, the price of oil need not rise significantly above $25-35/bbl. Even substantially less-aggressive efforts to reduce CO2 emissions need not see oil rise substantially above $50/bbl. Under aggressive climate policies, the peak in oil demand occurs before the supply-constrained peak in oil production would occur. This would render expensive oil (> $50/bbl) permanently uneconomic. This includes oil from the Canadian tar sands (currently costing $65-95/bbl for new greenfield developments) and most shale oil (with current average oil-play costs of $48-65/bbl). This in turn implies that governments should not be promoting or permitting development of high cost oil, and also provides a clear warning to private and institutional investors.","[Harvey, L. D.

Biofuels are not only expected to mitigate climate change or foster domestic energy security, but also to generate employment, provide opportunities to smallholders and support decentralized energy systems. This paper interrogates the expectations attached to biofuels. We begin by examining how policies in consumer and producer countries articulate a series of expectations for biofuels that are bundled with the promise of cleaner energy, using the rationales behind these expectations to derive criteria for success. We then review evidence from the published literature on biofuel outcomes against these criteria to assess whether the most prevalent assumptions have been met. We find that policy expectations for biofuels are often expressed in narrow terms, failing to capture important potential impacts for example focusing on new jobs in the formal sector rather than job quality or whether employment offsets livelihood costs associated with biofuel investments. Some expectations have proven elusive irrespective of the metrics employed, for example using biofuels to improve energy access in remote rural areas. The paper concludes by discussing implications for policy and practice.","[Hunsberger, Carol] Univ Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada; [German, Laura] Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Goet, Ariane] Inst Adv Sustainabil Studies, Potsdam, Germany",Western University (University of Western Ontario); University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Hunsberger, C (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada.",chunsber@uwo.ca,"German, Laura/AAM-9934-2020","German, Laura/0000-0003-4943-4515; Hunsberger, Carol/0000-0002-2761-1333; Goetz, Ariane/0009-0003-4984-5258",Institute of Advanced Sustainability Studies,Institute of Advanced Sustainability Studies,"This paper grew out of the workshop Bioenergy: Status quo, trends and sustainability governance, held in Berlin in October 2015, organized and funded by the Institute of Advanced Sustainability Studies.

As a result, the UK has developed a (now delayed) strategy to deliver around 16 GW of new nuclear power by 2030. This policy context provides an opportunity to reflect not only on the material infrastructure needed to meet transition targets, but also on who is responsible for the energy justice implications of these decisions. Using data collected from 26 semi-structured interviews with NGO and policy representatives, this paper presents a case study of energy justice concerns surrounding the Hinkley Point Nuclear Complex in Somerset, focusing particularly on the highly controversial Hinkley Point C developments. The results emphasise the importance of considering not only instances of energy justice or injustice, but of attributing responsibility for them, a concept that has been largely overlooked in the energy justice literature. NGOs, government and business allocate responsibility differently in nuclear energy decision making. We find that perceptions of responsibility are highly dependent upon the level of transparency in decision-making.

The reaction of such firms to changes in their relevant output prices is tested econometrically for five metals using a panel representing more than 100 mines across the time period 1991-2005. The estimation strategy is drawn from joint production theory, namely a flexible form, dual revenue approach with seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR) estimation. The results indicate that multi-product mines respond (in the short run) to higher prices of a particular metal by reducing output of that metal (indicative of low-grading behavior) and increasing and/or decreasing output of joint metal products (indicative of substitutes and complements in supply). The price responses are not readily explained by a metal's classification as a by-product or main product based on revenue. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

While these studies generally find evidence for traditional amenities and disamenities in developed countries, there remains little research on how characteristics such as violence affect the equilibrium in less developed countries. This article explores violence and other local characteristics as an amenity or disamenity for Mexico and employs the hedonic wage and rent theory proposed by Roback. This research uses a multilevel estimation technique using data from the Mexican Household Income and Expenditure Survey, along with other information from the municipal and state levels. This article finds evidence to suggest that illegal earning opportunities outweigh crime disamenity by inhabitants of some traditional drug-trafficking regions, because such crime appears to be the modus vivendi in those regions in a way that does not reduce economic performance.","[Nunez, Hector M.; Garduno-Rivera, Rafael] Ctr Invest & Docencia Econ, Dept Econ, Circuito Tecnopolo Norte 117, Aguascalientes 20313, Ags, Mexico; [Paredes, Dusan] Univ Catolica Norte, Dept Econ, Antofagasta, Chile",Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

Market and regulatory failures such as the well known missing money (see Joskow, (2006)) but also normal market features such as risk, possibly also affected by market failures like market incompleteness are mentioned as common causes for the situation. This paper discusses incomplete risk trading and its impact on investment. The analysis applies computable stochastic equilibrium models on a simple market model of the Energy Only type. The paper first compares the cases of complete and fully incomplete markets (full risk trading and no risk trading). It continues by testing the impact of different risk trading contracts on both welfare and investment. We successively consider Contracts for Difference, Reliability Options with and without physical back up that we add to our Energy Only market model. We test the impact of market liquidity on the results. Finally, we compare these methods to a Forward Capacity Market that we also add to the energy only model.

This demand shift increases the relative price of non-tradables and thereby causes real exchange rates to appreciate. We claim that the change in demand affects prices via imperfect intersectoral factor mobility. Using a sample of 15 OECD countries, we estimate a robust increase of relative prices. According to our main estimate, up to one fifth of the average increase in relative prices between 1970 and 2009 can be attributed to population ageing. Further findings confirm the relevance of imperfect factor mobility: Countries with more rigid labour markets experience stronger price effects.","[Groneck, Max] Stockholm Sch Econ, Dept Econ, POB 6501, SE-11383 Stockholm, Sweden; [Groneck, Max] Netspar, POB 6501, SE-11383 Stockholm, Sweden; [Kaufmann, Christoph] Univ Cologne, CMR, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany",Stockholm School of Economics; University of Cologne,"Groneck, M (通讯作者)，Stockholm Sch Econ, Dept Econ, POB 6501, SE-11383 Stockholm, Sweden.;Groneck, M (通讯作者)，Netspar, POB 6501, SE-11383 Stockholm, Sweden.",max.groneck@hhs.se; c.kaufmann@wiso.uni-koeln.de,"Kaufmann, Christoph/IYS-7423-2023","Kaufmann, Christoph/0000-0002-2328-8401",,,,,59,6,7,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

The pathways combine two main dimensions: degrees of harmonisation and instruments and design elements. A quantitative model-based analysis with the Green-X model is provided. The results of the simulations show that there are small differences between the evaluated cases regarding effectiveness. All the policy pathways score similarly with respect to RESE deployment, i.e., with different degrees of harmonisation and whether using a feed-in tariff, a feed-in premium, a quota system with banding or a quota without banding scheme. In contrast, the policy costs clearly differ across the pathways, but the differences can mostly be attributed to the instruments rather than to the degrees of harmonisation. This is also the case with other criteria (static and dynamic efficiency and the socioeconomic and environmental benefits in terms of CO2 emissions and fossil fuels avoided). Both the degree of harmonisation and the choice of instrument influence the distribution of support costs across countries. Finally, our findings suggest that keeping strengthened national support leads to similar results to other policy pathways.","[del Rio, Pablo] CSIC, Inst Publ Policies & Goods, C Albasanz 26-28, Madrid 28037, Spain; [Resch, Gustav; Ortner, Andre; Liebmann, Lukas; Busch, Sebastian] Tech Univ Wien, Energy Econ Grp, Vienna, Austria; [Busch, Sebastian] IIASA, Laxenburg, Austria; [Panzer, Christian] CPE Thinktank, Vienna, Austria",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Politicas y Bienes Publicos (IPP); Technische Universitat Wien; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA),"del Río, P (通讯作者)，CSIC, Inst Publ Policies & Goods, C Albasanz 26-28, Madrid 28037, Spain.",pablo.delrio@csic.es,"Resch, Gustav/JXN-3361-2024","Resch, Gustav/0000-0001-6122-4081; Busch, Sebastian/0000-0002-5864-1244; Liebmann, Lukas/0000-0001-9101-4317",Intelligent Energy - Europe (IEE) programme of the European Commission [IEE/13/826/SI2.674882],Intelligent Energy - Europe (IEE) programme of the European Commission,"This paper is based on work carried out under the beyond2020 project.17 This initiative could be established thanks to the financial and intellectual support offered by the Intelligent Energy - Europe (IEE) programme of the European Commission, operated by the Executive Agency for Competitiveness and Innovation (Grapnt number: IEE/13/826/SI2.674882).",,34,33,34,2,17,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2017,104.0,,,,,,484,493,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.01.028,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP7HS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397549500049,0

Given energy scarcity, environmental pollution, energy security and energy cost constraints, energy conservation will be the major strategy in China's transition to a low-carbon economy. Since the metallurgy industry is a main sector of energy consumption, the efficiency of energy conservation in this industry will affect the future prospects of energy savings. This paper analyzes the energy conservation potential of China's metallurgy industry. First, seemingly unrelated regression method is applied to investigate the relationship between energy relative price, R & D input, enterprise ownership structure, enterprise scale and energy intensity of the metallurgy industry. Then, based on the SUR results, we use the scenario analysis method to predict energy consumption and savings potential in the industry in different scenarios. This paper provides references for China's government and metallurgy industry in formulating relevant energy conservation policies.","[Lin, Boqiang] Xiamen Univ, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Sch Management, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Du, Zhili] Xiamen Univ, China Ctr Energy Econ Res, Sch Econ, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; Xiamen University,"Lin, BQ (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Sch Management, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",bqlin@xmu.edu.cn; duzhili910@126.com,"Lin, Boqiang/G-3960-2010","Lin, Boqiang/0000-0002-1308-400X; Du, Zhili/0000-0001-5152-737X",Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy [1260-Z0210011]; Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding [1260-Y07200]; Newcastle University Joint Strategic Partnership Fund,Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy; Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding; Newcastle University Joint Strategic Partnership Fund,"The paper is supported by the Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy (No: 1260-Z0210011), Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding (No:1260-Y07200), and Newcastle University Joint Strategic Partnership Fund.",,34,50,51,6,98,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2017,104.0,,,,,,285,294,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.02.005,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP7HS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397549500028,0

These challenges are related to the requirements set on the sector to meet a wide range of social demands associated with the three traditional dimensions of a sustainable energy system, i.e., environmental sustainability, security of energy supply and economic sustainability. In particular, the environmental pillar has gained ground after the Paris Agreement, which has reinforced the requirement of a low-carbon transformation of the sector. A main challenge is to balance trade-offs among competing goals when designing energy and environmental policies. Although making the energy sector greener is a common aspiration of governments, and many countries are indeed being successful in this regard, the success comes at a price in terms of the other, non-environmental dimensions, of a sustainable energy system.

It is also shown that individuals would suffer from an increase in state-level wage-income tax, dividend tax or sales tax, while they would benefit from an increase in property taxes.

We compare the public and private ownership cases, both subject to the same regulatory (revenue cap) mechanism. The theoretical analysis is supported by a calibration and simulation exercise. The incentive to invest is affected by ownership, financial structure and revenue cap. Overinvestment results in private firms as the cost of capital is accounted differently. In public firms: (i) the effect of the revenue cap is diluted and investments distortions with respect to a benevolent social planner are negligible; (ii) information rents are valued according to the marginal cost of public funds; (iii) the distortionary taxation and a price inelastic demand drive local politicians to maximize water revenues to finance investments and to increase municipal fiscal gains.

We analyze the business model for one mode of decentralization microgrids and quantify the economics for self-supply of electricity and thermal energy and explicitly resolve technological as well as policy variables. We offer a tool, based on the Distributed Energy Resources Customer Adoption Model (DER-CAM) modeling framework, that determines the cost-minimal capacity and operation of distributed energy resources in a microgrid, and apply it in southern California to three iconic microgrid types which represent typical commercial adopters: a large commercial building, critical infrastructure, and campus. We find that optimal investment leads to some deployment of renewables but that natural gas technologies underpin the most robust business cases due in part to relatively cheap gas and high electricity rates. This finding contrasts sharply with most policy advocacy, which has focused on the potentials for decentralization of the grid to encourage deployment of renewables. Decentralization could radically reduce customer energy costs, but without the right policy framework it could create large numbers of small decentralized sources of gas-based carbon emissions that will be difficult to control if policy makers want to achieve deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.","[Hanna, Ryan; Ghonima, Mohamed; Kleissl, Jan] Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Renewable Resource Integrat, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Hanna, Ryan; Kleissl, Jan; Tynan, George; Victor, David G.] Univ Calif San Diego, Deep Decarbonizat Initiat, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Kleissl, Jan; Tynan, George; Victor, David G.] Univ Calif San Diego, Energy Res Ctr, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Victor, David G.] Univ Calif San Diego, Lab Int Law & Regulat, Sch Global Policy & Strategy, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Victor, David G.] Brookings Inst, 1775 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Brookings Institution,"Hanna, R (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Renewable Resource Integrat, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",rehanna@ucsd.edu,"Tynan, George/AAG-1507-2019","Tynan, George/0000-0001-7461-4871; Kleissl, Jan/0000-0003-4364-0211","EPRI; Norwegian Research Foundation; University of California, San Diego","EPRI; Norwegian Research Foundation; University of California, San Diego(University of California System)","The authors acknowledge and thank Michael Stadler and Goncalo Cardoso from the Grid Integration Group at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory for providing the DER-CAM model and consultation; Lukas Nonnenmacher, Bill Torre, Byron Washom, John Dilliot, and other team members at the University of California, San Diego for their comments and for providing data to aid the modeling process; a large California utility for providing real interconnection data; and numerous individuals at local utilities, the California Public Utilities Commission, and the California Independent System Operator, who contributed insightful guidance in the early stages of this work.

In this paper, we propose the use of an auxiliary (first stage) model of perceived quality as a function of objective quality to recover unbiased and microconsistent estimates of marginal willingness to pay for the provision of the public good. The approach can be applied when people have well-formed perceptions of the quality of the good, a prerequisite for the averting expenditures method, and when objective quality of provision is plausibly exogenous. We illustrate the approach with data on averting expenditures for two qualitative aspects of household tap water networks: water hardness and aesthetic quality in terms of taste and odor.

The new test can be applied when the cointegrating vector is unknown and when weak exogeneity fails. The asymptotic null distribution of the new test is derived, critical values are tabulated and finite-sample properties are examined. In particular, the new test is shown to have good size, so the bootstrap is not required. The new test is illustrated using the long-term and short-term interest rates. We show that the system-equation model can shed light on both asymmetric adjustment speeds and asymmetric adjustment roles.

Up to now, there are theoretical dilemmas in identifying of the quality of life and the standard of living; even some authors do not see differences between them. From our perspective, the standard of living is one of the subcategories of the quality of life. In the methodological field, we can find a rich elaboration of methods of measurement, of both: globalization and the quality of life, respectively of the standard of living. There exist the different forms of indexes that allow quantify not only the situation within a country but also to compare with the situation of other countries. In our paper, we focus, besides theory and methodology, on an empirical analysis of the relations between globalization and the standard of living in the Slovak Republic. At the same time, we focus on a certain field of the standard of living, and that on consumption.

We use monthly arrest data from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reports to estimate the effects of welfare reform implementation on drug-related arrests among 15- to 17-year-old teens exposed to welfare reform. The findings, based on numerous different model specifications, suggest that welfare reform had no statistically significant effect on teen drug arrests.

The market of railway transport services in the EU and Slovak Republic had to adapt to globalization trends in the different areas. One of these areas is charging of railway infrastructure. The basic principles of charging are governed by the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council which establishing a single European railway area. However, it is used different charging railway infrastructure models in European countries. The models differ in method of fixed costs financing of railway infrastructure manager, i.e. the costs which are not related to train ride directly. In The Four Railway Package The Commission is proposing to amend the Directive establishing SERA to ensure that infrastructure managers can perform all functions needed to run the infrastructure in an optimised, efficient and non-discriminatory manner. Inasmuch as it is needed to establish such a system of charging railway infrastructure which will increase competitiveness of railway transport as well as will use public resources effectively. The paper deals with proposal of minimal and optimal determinants of charging railway infrastructure which could contribute to increasing of competitiveness of railway transport in the transport market by using different charging elements (such as rates, coefficients, bonus-malus system).

Regional Studies. The concept of uneven and combined development (U&CD) interprets dynamic historical change and comparative geographical differentiation in terms of the co-existence of tendencies towards differentiation and equalization of the conditions of production, consumption, distribution and exchange, deriving from capital accumulation and political multiplicity. U&CD entails a conception of the global system as a constellation of interdependent, national institutional configurations and interests that shape international/national/regional trends. To explain geographies of industrialization and urbanization and current trends towards a pluri-centric world, U&CD requires, however, a specification of the underlying causal mechanisms, examined in economic geography, international relations and developmental state theories.","[Dunford, Michael; Liu, Weidong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Dunford, Michael] Univ Sussex, Sch Global Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; University of Sussex","Dunford, M (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Dunford, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Sch Global Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",m.f.dunford@sussex.ac.uk; liuwd@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Dunford, Michael/J-8306-2019","Dunford, Michael/0000-0002-0028-3130",National Natural Science Foundation of China [NSFC] [41530751]; Leverhulme Trust,National Natural Science Foundation of China [NSFC](National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),The authors acknowledge the support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [NSFC grant number 41530751] and The Leverhulme Trust Emeritus Fellowship.,,59,46,52,4,56,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The reasons in fact were the high prices of lead in London, the depreciation of the peseta, the prices imposed to the mining companies as a consequence of the oligopolistic type of the minerals demand and also frauds to the miners by the Cartagena factories.

However, depending on the users movement, the SIR of an ative connection is expected to drastically fluctuate. In this work we develop an analytical framework allowing to predict the channel quality between two moving entities in a filed of moving interfering stations. Assuming users movement driven by Fokker-Planck equation we obtain the empirical probability density function of SIR.

Identifying those backbones in a deterministic manner is at least as hard as solving the original problem to optimality because all optimal solutions to the problem have to be known. A number of different algorithms have been proposed which use heuristically determined backbones to speed up discrete combinatorial optimization algorithms by eliminating these backbones and thus reducing the dimensionality of the optimization problem to be solved in each step. In this paper we extend the concept of backbones to real-valued optimization. We propose a definition of such backbones and introduce means to identify them and determine their value by the use of a genetic algorithm. We compare the performance of the resulting algorithm with an ordinary optimization procedure on a widely used nonlinear and unconstrained optimization benchmark. We observe that our backbone strategy is superior in terms of both convergence speed and quality of the resulting solutions.

The impact of globalization on health can be assessed in two main dimensions: health services (in structure and availability) and social determinants of health. Economic globalization significantly affects social determinants in health, increases the role of the market in healthcare, reduces the role of the state and the public sector, supports the modernization of the healthcare sector through corporatisation and privatization, influenced by international actors etc. Absence of monitoring of these impacts and underestimating the risks of globalization to population health can cause an increase of chronic illness, following by a loss of economic competitiveness and widening of health disparities. The aim of the paper is to point out the impact of economic globalization on population health at the national and international level. We will focus on assessing the impact of an unbalanced health policy approach, where is underrated the role and support of public health, insufficient investment in healthcare etc. In the analytical section of paper, we evaluate the development of avoidable as well as amenable mortality in Slovakia and EU in the years 2002 - 2014. We also quantify the avoidable and amenable mortality in relation to economic and health categories and we evaluate their development in this period.

One of the most established arguments in regional studies is that knowledge dynamics shape the geography of economic activities and, more specifically, that knowledge-intensive activities benefit from collocation due to knowledge spillovers, local buzz and access to labour. There are, however, competing arguments that knowledge-intensive firms also suffer from negative spillovers and are less dependent on local knowledge sources than often presumed. Using Swedish micro-data from 2005-11, this paper shows that firms with weak internal knowledge grow faster in knowledge-intensive regions.

The main task in this paper is to compare the core loss of different magnetic material, to analyze the influence of transformer structure, winding arrangement and wire structure on the characteristics of magnetic component. Then another task is to select suitable magnetic material, structure and wire in order to reduce the loss and volume of magnetic components. Based on the above outcome, the optimization design process of transformer and dc reactor are proposed in chopper plasma cutting power supply with a lot of solutions.

The considerations have been embedded in the evolutionary developmental research, and the regional resilience concept has been adopted as a theoretical frame for analyzing the title relationship. The study covers the dynamics of housing development in the Polish regions in the years 2004-2016 by employing time series regression modelling. The results allow the authors to distinguish three separate reaction types of the regional housing markets to recessionary shocks: (1) enhanced path (positive response), (2) inferior path and (3) recession path.","[Kisiala, Wojciech; Suszynska, Katarzyna] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Dept Investment & Real Estate, Fac Management, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Suszynska, K (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Dept Investment & Real Estate, Fac Management, Poznan, Poland.",wojciech.kisiala@u.poznan.pl; katarzyna.suszynska@ue.poznan.pl,,,,,,,22,1,1,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,937,944,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059201055,0

It can be seen that the development of badminton plays a profound significance and a huge role in promoting the physical exercise in colleges and universities. Through the investigation and analysis of the status of badminton developed in Guizhou Normal College, this paper provides a reliable theoretical basis for the development of badminton in the normal colleges. By using the methods of logical analysis, mathematical statistics and questionnaire, a preliminary investigation on the status of badminton in Guizhou Normal College has been carried out. The results show that the most students in Guizhou Normal College are interested in badminton. The activities related to badminton are carried out in general good. However, the site facilities of badminton are relatively insufficient, the students' satisfaction is not high, and the utilization rate of indoor and outdoor venues is low. Besides these, one big problem for the students in Guizhou Normal College is that they have little chances to participate the badminton competitions at the provincial and municipal levels.","[Liu, Xiao-Fang; Xie, Zu-Hua; Feng, Ying; Yao, Teng-Fei; Li, Jiang-Hua] Jiangxi Normal Univ, Inst Phys Educ, Key Lab Training Monitoring & Intervent Aquat Spo, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",Jiangxi Normal University,"Liu, XF (通讯作者)，Jiangxi Normal Univ, Inst Phys Educ, Key Lab Training Monitoring & Intervent Aquat Spo, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",,"li, jianghua/GXG-4735-2022",,"Open Project Program of Key Lab of Training, Monitoring and Intervention of Aquatic Sports of General Administration of Sport of China, Jiangxi Normal University [201604]","Open Project Program of Key Lab of Training, Monitoring and Intervention of Aquatic Sports of General Administration of Sport of China, Jiangxi Normal University","This work was supported by the Open Project Program of Key Lab of Training, Monitoring and Intervention of Aquatic Sports of General Administration of Sport of China, Jiangxi Normal University (NO. 201604).",,5,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-436-1,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2017,107.0,,,,,,77,80,,,,,,4,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BJ6OF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426885200021,0

As for the high voltage side, the transfer function about over-voltage can be formed in order to analyse the characteristics about high frequency over-voltage. As for the low voltage side, a three-phase equivalent model for secondary circuit of PT with the parallel arrangement at the A, B and C phases may be built for simulating the current distribution of the low voltage fuses in the situation of high frequency voltage and current. The results show that the maximum allowable current of fuse might be reduced greatly in the high-frequency circumstance due to skin effect and proximity effect, in comparison with nominal frequency condition.","[Ma, X.

One of the most important factors facilitating and accelerating the economic globalization process is technical progress, including modern information and communication technologies. The industrial revolution brings many profits, but it is also a source of many risks related to nuclear power stations, chemical industries and transport. Ensuring technical safety plays more and more important role in the economic globalization process. One distinguishes four basic categories of accidents' causes: human factors, organizational factors, technical factors and environmental factors. Statistical data indicate that the main source of accidents and disasters are mistakes made by humans, which means that the human factor plays a crucial role in ensuring technical safety. That is why the knowledge regarding human reliability is being developed by research facilities all over the world. This article brings up the issue of human reliability where it comes to ensuring technical safety. The notion of human reliability has been defined, the classification of mistakes made by humans in man-technical object system has been provided and an analysis of the mentioned mistakes has been performed.

There is a growing recognition of the importance of these functions and work is being done to restore urban drains and create fully functioning wetland ecosystems (living streams). Such restoration work involves substantial cost, and it is important to know if the benefits generated from living streams are greater than restoration costs. This paper presents a detailed economic analysis of an urban drain restoration project in Perth, Western Australia. Controlling for other factors, we find homes within 200 m of the restoration site increased in value by 4.7% once the restored area became fully established. When we compare benefits to cost we find that, with real discount rates of 5%, 7%, and 9%, project benefit-cost ratios are 3.0, 2.8 and 2.6, respectively. We then show that current institutional arrangements in Western Australia make it difficult to implement urban drain restoration projects, even when project benefits are greater than project costs. The paper concludes by identifying changes to institutional and governance arrangements that would make it easier for restoration projects to proceed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The popularity of the IPW method is due to its simplicity. However, it is often being criticized for being inefficient because most of the information from the incomplete observations is not used. Alternatively, the regression method is known to be efficient but is nonrobust to the misspecification of the regression function. In this article, we propose a novel way of optimally combining the propensity score function and the regression model. The resulting estimating equation enjoys the properties of robustness against misspecification of either the propensity score or the regression function, as well as being locally semiparametric efficient. We demonstrate analytically situations where our method leads to a more efficient estimator than some of its competitors. In a simulation study, we show the new method compares favorably with its competitors in finite samples.

There exist two opposing views on the issue. The functional method operates on a presumption that all societies face similar problems and the main aim of law is to respond to them, it follows that jurisdictions can be comparatively evaluated and conclusions drawn as to which rules deal better with the problems, thus, drawing inspiration for national law and ultimately unification of law. On the other end of the spectrum, the cultural method presumes that a given country's body of law is a manifestation of its general culture, acknowledging that different legal cultures are deemed worthy of protection and views unification and comparative evaluation as impossible and unnecessary. The paper set out to evaluate the current usage of comparative law in the UK and draw normative conclusions about its benefits and drawbacks. To achieve this goal the paper is based on the analysis of a survey on the use of comparative material in the UK highest court, as well as case law and academic literature. Comparing the different bodies of law in the UK, a common law jurisdiction, and France and Germany, both civilian countries, develops a platform for inductive conclusions on harmonization of law as a potential direction in the future.","[Sina, Inga; AlfejeVa, Jelena; Sina, Ruta] Kings Coll London, Univ Econ & Culture, London, England",University of London; King's College London,"Sina, I (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Univ Econ & Culture, London, England.",inga.shina@gmail.com; alfejeva@inbox.lv; ruta.shina@gmail.com,"shina, inga/GPS-3354-2022",,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2385,2392,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059204038,0

Language and culture are closely tied, so are language teaching and the teaching of culture. Nowadays, with the development of globalization, different cultures of different countries conflict with each other much more, so English learning becomes more important than anytime before. At the same time, the relations of the countries in the world are becoming increasingly closer, and cultural conflicts increasingly fiercer; different races, different languages, and different cultures provide different scope of studying to learners, which inject new blood into English learning and also integrate language and culture much more. Under this background, it is necessary to combine language with culture in college English teaching, and to improve the personal comprehensive ability of English teachers. As an efficient way to experience the culture of other countries, short-term overseas exchange has become an important way for many college English teachers to improve their own abilities. Starting from the connotation of multicultural sensitivity, the writer of this thesis tries to discuss the influence of short-term overseas exchange on college English teachers. To cultivate the multicultural sensitivity of college English teachers is not only the objective requirement of the new curricular standard, but also the necessary appeal of the current situations of economy and politics. It lets English teachers practice better personal abilities and get in touch with more different cultures; it requires all-round improvement of English teachers' professional qualities and comprehensive abilities. English teachers can get to constant self-improvement and increase their competitive advantage. English teaching is not a kind of simple language teaching that teaches words and grammars to students, but also an important way of allowing students to understand different cultures, understanding very well about the circumstances of different countries, experiencing the baptism of other excellent cultures, and feeling the charm of multiculturalism. Overseas investigation trip and short-term study aboard could have English teachers directly feel the charm of different countries and enhance their multicultural sensitivities, and get their teaching abilities improved.","[Zong, Yani] Xian Int Univ, Xian 710077, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",,"Zong, YN (通讯作者)，Xian Int Univ, Xian 710077, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-452-1,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2017,179.0,,,,,,246,249,,,,,,4,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BJ6MO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426854700051,0

By utilising techno-economic scenario analysis, this research assists policymakers to understand the impacts of their decisions on future energy market relationships between the customer and utilities. Two case studies are presented, firstly to evaluate the influence of annual increases in usage charges, and secondly the level of feed-in tariff compensation on customer PV and battery investment over a 15-year forecast period located in Perth, Australia. The findings indicate that even without annual increases in usage charges, the falling installation costs of PV and battery technologies will make customer PV-battery systems financially viable within the 15-year forecast period. Additionally, the removal of the feed-in tariff leads to greater reductions in eventual grid consumption. By the end of the forecast period, customer PV-battery systems with the highest financial performance are able to reduce grid consumption above 90% resulting in significant energy resources being transferred out of the energy market. This necessitates the market integration of customer energy resources and provides an opportunity to leverage a combination of customer and utility energy resources for the renewable energy transition.","[Say, Kelvin; John, Michele] Curtin Univ, Sustainable Engn Grp, Kent St, Bentley, WA 6102, Australia; [Dargaville, Roger] Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Wills, Raymond T.] Univ Western Australia, Perth, WA 6009, Australia",Curtin University; Monash University; University of Western Australia,"Say, K (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Sustainable Engn Grp, Kent St, Bentley, WA 6102, Australia.",kelvin.say@curtin.edu.au,,"Say, Kelvin/0000-0002-2162-8126; Rosano, Michele/0000-0002-8487-6602",Australian Government; Government of Western Australia,Australian Government(Australian Government); Government of Western Australia,This work was supported by resources provided by The Pawsey Supercomputing Centre with funding from the Australian Government and the Government of Western Australia.

In this paper we estimate these household and urban economies in CO2 emissions using detailed household expenditure data for the United States. We then decompose these economies into their primary sources and investigate any potential rebound effects, or diseconomies. The results show that the bulk of household and urban economies come from reductions in emissions from residential energy use and private vehicle transportation. We also find some evidence of rebound effects, with both residential density and multi-person households increasing expenditures on air travel and restaurant meals in particular. These effects are small in comparison to the size of total net economies, suggesting that fears of large rebound effects or backfire effects may be overstated. These results further suggest that policies targeted at the provision of social and technological infrastructure, such as public transportation, mixed-use zoning, and public Internet may be most effective in reducing the rural-urban divide in private vehicle emissions.","[Underwood, Anthony] Dickinson Coll, Econ Dept, POB 1773, Carlisle, PA 17013 USA; [Fremstad, Anders] Colorado State Univ, Econ Dept, 1771 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Dickinson College; Colorado State University,"Underwood, A (通讯作者)，Dickinson Coll, Econ Dept, POB 1773, Carlisle, PA 17013 USA.",underwoa@dickinson.edu; anders.fremstad@colostate.edu,,,,,,,52,27,29,2,37,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2018,123.0,,,,,,404,413,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.09.012,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HE6FW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000453499700040,0

The aim of this paper is to analyze through a discrete choice experiment (DCE) the preferences of shellfish gatherers with respect to a proposed recovery program; assessing the role of time preferences and the impact of illegal harvesting. In terms of time preferences, results show that shellfish gatherers are quite impatient with regards to their extraction levels (with a discount rate between 7 and 11% for a period of 12 months, depending on the conservation scenario considered). These results can be a consequence of the risky environment in which fishers operate. Furthermore, it was found that the concerns about illegal harvesters increase the shellfish gatherers' discount rates. These results imply that sustainability of the resources is in danger.

However, the implications are not worked through into energy policy nor into most analyses of energy demand. Instead, energy service demand is usually isolated from its dynamic and varied socio-cultural basis, rendering it inappropriately static and neglecting the core quality of usefulness that definitions of 'energy service' share. To address these limitations, this paper revisits and extends a sociological conceptualisation of services, referred to here as meta-services. These are composite and cross-cutting formations of convention, expectation and experience and the means of achieving them. Meta-services are more-than-energy services and are shaped not only through energy consumption, provision and governance but also by a range of other non-energy providers and organisations. This calls for demand reduction policies to engage wider coalitions of service 'stakeholders'. In addition, because energy-services co-constitute meta-services, aspirations to deliver the same levels of service but more efficiently risk entrenching, rather than reducing, levels of service demand. Implications for service based business models (servicizing) and policies are discussed.","[Morley, Janine] Univ Lancaster, DEMAND Ctr, Sociol, D10,FASS Bldg, Lancaster LA1 4YD, England",Lancaster University,"Morley, J (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, DEMAND Ctr, Sociol, D10,FASS Bldg, Lancaster LA1 4YD, England.",j.morley@lancaster.ac.uk,,"Morley, Janine/0000-0003-0255-4720","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), United Kingdom, Research Councils UK (RCUK) Energy Programme [EP/K011723/1]; EDF, R&D ECLEER Programme; EPSRC [EP/K011723/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), United Kingdom, Research Councils UK (RCUK) Energy Programme(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EDF, R&D ECLEER Programme; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","The author would like to thank colleagues at the Dynamics of Energy, Mobility and Demand (DEMAND) Centre for discussions and comments on earlier versions of this paper.

There is a growing body of literature evaluating the extent of this corresponding price reduction, termed 'incentive pass-through', typically finding nearly complete path-through for host-owned systems. However, few studies hitherto had the data to reliably estimate path-through for third-party owned systems, which comprise most of new installations over this period. This study evaluates incentive pass-through for third-party owned systems in California between 2010 and 2014. The estimation results show path-through rate is around 62%, suggesting that unlike host-owned systems, a portion of the incentive reduced the contract price of the system and the rest of the incentive was retained by the installer. This study has important implications for future subsidy program design in the presence of different ownership types in the market.","[Li, Yumin] Shanghai Univ, SILC Business Sch, Dept Econ & Finance, Shanghai 201899, Peoples R China; [Li, Yumin] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Golden, CO 80401 USA",Shanghai University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA,"Li, YM (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ, SILC Business Sch, Dept Econ & Finance, Shanghai 201899, Peoples R China.",yuminli@shu.edu.cn,"lu, qian/IUN-7445-2023",,Department of Energy Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy,Department of Energy Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"The author would like to thank Changgui Dong, Zhuoxin Li, Shiyuan Li, Ben Sigrin, Daniel Steinberg, Carolyn Pino, Ruxiao Wang and Jarret Zuboy for their review and input on the study.

In the natural gas sector, the Republic of Serbia is strongly dependent on Russian gas. Import dependency is almost 80% and gas is imported via a single supply route. In order to evaluate the security of the natural gas supply in Serbia and vulnerability to possible interruptions in international supply chains, three possible scenarios for natural gas infrastructure development and two scenarios of natural gas consumption by 2025, are discussed in this paper. This combination of infrastructure and demand scenarios projects six possible futures for the Serbian natural gas system, assessed by N-1 index. This paper presents a methodology for determining maximal daily consumption for households and district heating (with a probability of once in 20 years) based on degree-days.

Some countries have promoted this form of generation, whereas others have lagged behind. This is the case of Spain, where PV-DSG has not taken-off. The aim of this paper is to provide a critical overview of the Spanish regulation for PV-DSG, approved in 2015, and its impact on demand-side generation in this country. The impacts of the new regulation on PV-DSG are calculated with real data from a household PV installation. It is found out that the current regulation is highly unfavourable for the adoption of PV-DSG, given the small savings for investors (consumers) for the adoption of PV-DSG compared to buying the electricity from the grid.","[Mir-Artigues, Pere] Univ Barcelona, UdL, Energy Sustainabil Res Grp, John Maynard Keynes 1-11, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [del Rio, Pablo] CSIC, Inst Publ Policies & Goods IPP, C Albasanz 26-28, Madrid 28037, Spain; [Cerda, Emilio] Univ Complutense Madrid, ICEI, Madrid, Spain",University of Barcelona; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Politicas y Bienes Publicos (IPP); Complutense University of Madrid,"del Río, P (通讯作者)，CSIC, Inst Publ Policies & Goods IPP, C Albasanz 26-28, Madrid 28037, Spain.",peremirartigues@gmail.com; pablo.delrio@csic.es; ecerdate@ccee.ucm.es,,"Mir-Artigues, Pere/0000-0002-4157-8090","Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness [ECO2015-69107-R, ECO2015-70349-P]",Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness,"The authors are grateful to the non-profit company Ecooo (http://ecooo.es) for the provision of the real data used in the simulation.

The likely mechanism is increased electricity usage from measures taken to protect oneself against high outdoor air pollution. Relative to clean ('blue sky') conditions, nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions from power stations increased by about 14.6%, 27%, and 59.2% when outdoor air quality reaches moderate, severe, and hazardous level respectively; SO2 emissions increased by a lower magnitude of 6.6% and 18.6% for severe and hazardous level respectively. We also find that these increases differ according to different periods of the day, signifying different patterns in avoidance behaviors. These findings potentially present a dilemma and challenge to policymakers as private actions taken to protect oneself from public harm may in fact, further exacerbate the problem.","[Tan-Soo, Jie-Sheng] Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Singapore, Singapore; [Qin, Ping; Zhang, Xiao-Bing] Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",National University of Singapore; Renmin University of China,"Qin, P (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",pingqin@ruc.edu.cn,"Zhang, Xiao-Bing/IAQ-6426-2023","Zhang, Xiao-Bing/0000-0001-8155-5769",Singapore Ministry of Education start-up grant [R603000237133],"Singapore Ministry of Education start-up grant(Ministry of Education, Singapore)","We are grateful to the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, a non-profit environmental research organization for making the emissions data available.

Hence, governments and energy actors are interested in the determining factors behind the consumer choice of conventional versus high efficiency labelled appliances. This study employs empirical survey data from the Danish Energy Agency to model influential factors behind Danish consumer choice of energy efficient appliances. To estimate consumer propensities, we use a logistic regression model over a set of socioeconomic, demographic, and behavioural variables. The study regresses over this unique combination of end-use behavioural variables by creating an energy efficiency index. Statistical results show that housing type, quantity of inhabitants, age, and end-use behaviour are strong predictors for choosing energy efficient appliances. Interestingly, income is a weaker predictor. Despite a relatively wealthy national income and well-educated population, information campaigns have been largely ineffective in driving high efficiency investments. In light of this study's results and exogenous factors such as urbanising demographics and shifting Danish housing stock towards apartments, the study suggests improved information campaigns by targeting key demographics.","[Baldini, Mattia; Trivella, Alessio; Wente, Jordan William] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Management Engn, Prod Storvet 426, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark,"Baldini, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Management Engn, Prod Storvet 426, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",mbal@dtu.dk; atri@dtu.dk; jowhw@dtu.dk,"Trivella, Alessio/AAC-8916-2019","Trivella, Alessio/0000-0002-2614-5051; Baldini, Mattia/0000-0002-5181-7083",Innovation Fund Denmark under the research project SAVE-E [4106-00009B],Innovation Fund Denmark under the research project SAVE-E,"The research has been financed by Innovation Fund Denmark under the research project SAVE-E [grant no. 4106-00009B].

A growing body of literature has suggested that governments play a core role in promotion of green utilization. The extant research of green utilization behavior is focused primarily on consumer preferences. So far, in-depth quantitative research of the government's role in the connection between green utilization and production is absent. Unlike previous research of green utilization behavior, this study established a dynamic adjustment mechanism for the government's subsidy policy for electric vehicles through the case study of Taiwan's electric motorcycle, so that the government's finite budget can be effectively allocated. Results indicate that emerging energy technologies reach the market competition conditions of economies of scale through government subsidy, subsidy policies should gradually phase out the market and transfer finite budgets to other emerging energy technologies that need to break through economies of scale. Therefore, the incentives phase-out mechanism of the electric motorcycle in this study will be helpful in the decision-making thinking of government and quantitative evaluation for the promotion of emerging energy technologies in the future.","[Huang, Shihping Kevin; Chou, Kuei-Lan] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Management Technol, 1001 Univ Rd, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan; [Kuo, Lopin] Tamkang Univ, Dept Accounting, 151 Yingzhuan Rd, New Taipei 25137, Taiwan; [Chou, Kuei-Lan] Ind Technol Res Inst, Green Energy & Environm Res Labs, 195,Sec 4,Chung Hsing Rd, Hsinchu 31040, Taiwan",National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; Tamkang University; Industrial Technology Research Institute - Taiwan,"Huang, SK (通讯作者)，Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Management Technol, 1001 Univ Rd, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.",ksph@nctu.edu.tw; lopinkuo@gmail.com; Kelly@itri.org.tw,,,"Bureau of Energy, ROC [555A70134/H455CG4100]; Industrial Technology Research Institute in Taiwan","Bureau of Energy, ROC; Industrial Technology Research Institute in Taiwan","The authors would like to acknowledge the support from the Bureau of Energy, ROC (Grant number 555A70134/H455CG4100) and Industrial Technology Research Institute in Taiwan.",,62,28,29,2,48,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2018,119.0,,,,,,473,486,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.061,0.0,,,27,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO0XY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439671200043,0

The conventional oil resource base is still very large, but there are doubts about how much is economically recoverable. Increasing attention is given to unconventional oil. The purpose of the article is to assess whether fundamental conditions for sustainable, profitable production of unconventional oil are in place. Compared to the successful development of unconventional oil in the USA, Russia has several disadvantages. The Russian oil sector is dominated by big companies without the flexibility in methods and decision-making required in very heterogeneous unconventional projects. Infrastructure is less accessible in Russia than in most American projects. On a more fundamental level the relatively poor condition of geological data collections is a serious cost increasing factor, and the system for development and dispersion of new technologies has critical shortcomings. Russia lacks appreciation of risk taking and a corresponding regulatory framework, as well as relevant financial mechanisms. Nevertheless, government documents almost exclusively focus on technology as such as well as on taxation and tax benefits as preconditions for successful development. Without addressing the fundamental institutional problems, the potential for exploiting the resources base will be limited.","[Kryukov, Valeriy] Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Div, Inst Econ & Ind Engn, Academician Lavrentyev Ave 17, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia; [Moe, Arild] Fridtjof Nansen Inst Polhogda, POB 326, N-1326 Lysaker, Norway",Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Economics & Industrial Engineering of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences,"Moe, A (通讯作者)，Fridtjof Nansen Inst Polhogda, POB 326, N-1326 Lysaker, Norway.",kryukov@ieie.nsc.ru; amoe@fni.no,"Kryukov, Valeriy A./H-8725-2015",,Petrosam 2 program of the Research Council of Norway [237687],Petrosam 2 program of the Research Council of Norway,"This article is a product of the research project RusChange - Russian oil and gas: Institutional adaptation or resistance? financed by the Petrosam 2 program of the Research Council of Norway, grant No. 237687.

Providing IHDs, which enables households to see a graph of their half-hourly electricity consumption in real time, is a promising policy intervention that corrects for biases associated with inattention and limited information-processing capacity by promoting salience and learning. The immediate effect of providing an IHD is heightened household attention to information on consumption, and the repetition of attention is expected to improve households' capacity to process information. The estimation results of a simultaneous equation model with discrete choice of hourly IHD usage and continuous hourly consumption of electricity of 501 households living in a southern area of Kyoto, Japan, over 36 days in summer 2012 provide evidence on the effects of real-time information feedback over time. The cumulative usage of IHDs reduced hourly electricity consumption of energy-using households whose electricity consumption before the experiment had been far higher than other households. Contrary to the energy-conservation literature, the cumulative usage of IHDs raised electricity consumption of energy-saving households whose electricity consumption had been relatively modest before the experiment. This may be due to a boomerang effect, which raised electricity usage of well-informed households whose electricity saving had exceeded the optimal saving before obtaining information about their actual usage.

We use a three-stage game where firms invest in a green technology with spillover effects in the first stage, the regulator sets the emission fee in the second stage, and production of the polluting good occurs in the third stage. We analyze two different regulatory regimes: (1) each firm faces the same emission fee (uniform fee), and (2) each firm faces an emission fee dependent on the investment in green technology (type-dependent fee). Firms can differ through their costs of investing in the abatement technology (asymmetric efficiency). We obtain that social welfare is unambiguously higher under the type-dependent regime than otherwise. In addition, we find that the asymmetry in efficiency of investment affects firms' profits, identifying that efficient (inefficient) firms favor type-dependent (uniform) policy regimes.

In this article, we follow another approach that uses individual-level statistical analysis to predict the number of exits out of unemployment insurance claims. We present a comparative study of econometric, actuarial and statistical methodologies that base on different data structures. The results with records of the German unemployment insurance suggest that prediction based on individual-level statistical duration analysis constitutes an interesting alternative to aggregate data-based forecasting. In particular, forecasts of up to six months ahead are surprisingly precise and are found to be more precise than considered time series forecasts.","[Wilke, Ralf A.] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Econ, Porcelaenshaven 16A, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Wilke, RA (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Econ, Porcelaenshaven 16A, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",rw.eco@cbs.dk,,,,,,,26,4,5,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

This paper presents a novel approach to quantify policy impacts of NDCs, by combining a set of technology-rich country-level models for major economies with an economy-wide global CGE model. The methodology enhances the credibility of global model-based scenarios, by complementing it with detailed representation of country-level policy priorities and structural heterogeneities, captured by national-level models. It also improves the consistency between national short-to-medium term policy plans with global long-term climate objectives. Results indicate that energy efficiency improvements and increased penetration of RES are the main contributors to emission reduction induced by NDCs. The role of emission reduction options differentiates by country, depending on national socio-economic objectives, energy resource endowment and climate policy ambition. The Paris pledges are found to be consistent with robust economic growth both in developed and in emerging economies. NDCs result in a more labour-intensive economy driven by RES expansion, while major clean energy manufacturers (EU, China) have the potential to improve their balance of trade.","[Fragkos, Panagiotis; Fragkiadakis, Kostas; Paroussos, Leonidas] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Lab E3M, Zografou Campus,9 Iroon Politechniou St, Athens 15773, Greece; [Pierfederici, Roberta] Inst Sustainable Dev & Int Relat IDDRI, 41 Rue Four, F-75006 Paris, France; [Vishwanathan, Saritha S.] Indian Inst Management Ahmedabad, Publ Syst Grp, Ahmadabad 380015, Gujarat, India; [Koberle, Alexandre C.] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Grad Sch Engn, Energy Planning Program, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Iyer, Gokul] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Joint Global Change Res Inst, 5825 Univ Res Court,Suite 3500, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [He, Chen-Min] Peking Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Oshiro, Ken] Mizuho Informat & Res Inst Inc, Environm & Energy Div 1, Chiyoda Ku, 2-3 Kanda Nishikicho, Tokyo, Japan","National Technical University of Athens; Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; Peking University; Mizuho Research & Technologies, Ltd.","Fragkos, P (通讯作者)，Natl Tech Univ Athens, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Lab E3M, Zografou Campus,9 Iroon Politechniou St, Athens 15773, Greece.",panagfragkos@gmail.com,"Fragkos, Panagiotis/AAF-6123-2020; Fragkiadakis, Kostas/AAG-9660-2020; Iyer, Gokul/JKI-1504-2023; Koberle, Alexandre/AAN-1104-2021; Oshiro, Ken/W-9746-2018","Fragkiadakis, Kostas/0000-0002-1129-0360; Iyer, Gokul/0000-0002-3565-7526; Oshiro, Ken/0000-0001-6720-409X; Paroussos, Leonidas/0000-0001-8251-7270; Fragkos, Panagiotis/0000-0003-3596-0661; Vishwanathan, Saritha/0000-0002-1117-1812","European Commission via the MILES project (Modelling and Informing Low Emission Strategies) - Directorate General Climate Action (DG CLIMA), [21.0104/2014/684427/SER/ CLIMA.A.4]; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency [2-1702]","European Commission via the MILES project (Modelling and Informing Low Emission Strategies) - Directorate General Climate Action (DG CLIMA),; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency","This study benefited from the financial support of the European Commission via the MILES project (Modelling and Informing Low Emission Strategies), financed by Directorate General Climate Action (DG CLIMA), under contract to DG CLIMA (No. 21.0104/2014/684427/SER/ CLIMA.A.4).

However, a danger of this approach is that the low salience of regulatory issues among the median voter could allow for regulatory capture, where regulated firms use their influence to extract favorable outcomes. Although the role that institutional design plays in influencing capture has been evaluated by comparing appointed and elected regulators, evidence of the capture of elected regulators remains scant, and we know little about the conditions that may mitigate such capture. Here, we study electricity rate making by Arizona's elected public utilities commission to determine how the economy, citizen complaints, and industry and interest group lobbying affect rate decisions. Leveraging original quantitative and interview data, we find that commissioners respond to voters and set pro-consumer electricity prices when inflation rises and when citizen complaints increase. We do not find that industry and interest group lobbying influence rate making. We argue that commissioners are pro-behavior because prices are salient, and commissioners desire reelection. The result suggests that the electoral mechanism reduces chances of regulatory capture, although the matter of electoral pandering remains unresolved.","[Parinandi, Srinivas] Univ Colorado, Dept Polit Sci, 128 Ketchum, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Hitt, Matthew P.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, C342 Clark Bldg, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Colorado State University,"Parinandi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Dept Polit Sci, 128 Ketchum, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",Srinivas.Parinandi@colorado.edu; Matthew.Hitt@colostate.edu,"Hitt, Matthew P./P-8474-2019","Hitt, Matthew P./0000-0003-0762-1929",,,,,46,10,12,1,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2018,118.0,,,,,,77,87,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.03.044,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ1TF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000435050000008,0

One of these is the wind farm co-ownership scheme, OPSS. In this study, we explore local perceptions of OPSS via survey-data collected during the Danish near-shore bid for tender in 2015 from almost 2000 respondents. Empirical evidence suggests that demographic facts, such as gender and age, influence the general appeal of the scheme, and as engagement in wind-projects via OPSS presupposes investment liquidity, OPSS is not equal for all. Furthermore, most potential OPSS-investors already support the planned wind farm projects, and many project opponents will not engage themselves in something they are against in principle. Finally, economic benefits potentially gained via OPSS do not appear to compensate for values feared violated by wind farms by many wind farm project stakeholders. While OPSS is a very positive policy attempt at creating local engagement via wind farm co-ownership, it is clear that the scheme alone will not adequately compensate for local wind farm related grievances.

However, recent studies provide evidence of a nonlinear relationship between trade and energy consumption. Unlike previous studies, we employ a panel framework with allowance for heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence to investigate the trade-energy consumption nexus for OECD countries for the period 1990-2015. Our results show that the impact of trade on energy consumption exhibits an inverted U-shaped pattern and the nonlinear relationship is robust to estimation methods. On the other hand, the results from linear specifications reveal the importance of cross-sectional dependence in explaining the positive role of trade on energy consumption. In addition, these impacts are consistent across different measures of trade.","[Topcu, Mert] Nevsehir Haci Bektas Veli Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Nevsehir, Turkey; [Payne, James E.] Benedictine Univ, Off Acad Affairs, 5700 Coll Rd, Lisle, IL 60532 USA",Nevsehir Haci Bektas Veli University,"Payne, JE (通讯作者)，Benedictine Univ, Off Acad Affairs, 5700 Coll Rd, Lisle, IL 60532 USA.",merttopcu@nevsehir.edu.tr; jpayne@ben.edu,"Topcu, Mert/K-2121-2019; Payne, James/Q-9569-2019; Payne, James/IZQ-1848-2023","Topcu, Mert/0000-0001-8236-9810;",,,,,45,38,38,2,21,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUN,2018,117.0,,,,,,160,165,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.03.007,0.0,,,6,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GF4KU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431932600016,0

The present paper aims to design a novel decision support system in order to facilitate clean neighbourhood energy planning with the involvement of multiple stakeholders, initiated by a local authority. In our study the cornerstones of a multi-stakeholder decision support system, containing data, models, tools, and a design process are presented so as to assist local authorities in preparing an energy plan for reaching pre-set climate goals. The decision support system was tested in a pilot case in the city of The Hague, The Netherlands. This new policy instrument is helpful for effective energy planning by introducing stakeholders and sharing and learning from different perspectives. The explicit recognition of boundary conditions specified by stakeholders turns out to enrich a purely 'technical' energy optimisation plan and to generate a much broader support for new energy initiatives. By making a location-specific plan stakeholders are able to conic up with useful information and recommendations. Furthermore, a facilitator present during the design process was necessary to guide the discussion and provide explanations about the data.","[Hettinga, Sanne; Scholten, Henk] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Nijkamp, Peter] Tinbergen Inst, Gustav Mahlerpl 117, NL-1082 MS Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Nijkamp, Peter] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland; [Nijkamp, Peter] Jheronimus Acad Data Sci, Sint Janssingel 92, NL-5211 DA Shertogenbosch, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; Adam Mickiewicz University,"Hettinga, S (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",s.hettinga@vu.nl,,"Nijkamp, Peter/0000-0002-4068-8132; Hettinga, Sanne/0009-0009-7529-7762; kourtit, karima/0000-0002-7171-994X",TKI Gebouwde Omgeving [TICIGB01012]; project 3D4EM in the programme Maps4Society [13740]; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO); Ministry of Economic Affairs,TKI Gebouwde Omgeving; project 3D4EM in the programme Maps4Society; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); Ministry of Economic Affairs,"The authors wish to express their appreciation to the partners in the PICO project for giving their knowledge and time.

Because many pollutants are regulated separately, designing inter-pollutant markets requires considering pre-existing regulatory constraints. We examine the optimal choices of inter-and intra-pollutant trade ratios when (i) some firms generate multiple pollutants affecting different media and (ii) permit caps are sub-optimal, having been exogenously specified by prior regulations. While the first-best outcome is unobtainable in this setting, we find inter-pollutant trading enhances efficiency by offering an additional policy instrument: the inter-pollutant trade ratio. Moreover, adjustments to intra-pollutant trade ratios reflecting the joint production of dis-similar pollutants can enhance efficiency. We also find realistic cases where inter-pollutant trading may universally improve environmental quality, easing concerns that trading across environmental media may harm one medium. An example of nitrogen trading in Pennsylvania's Susquehanna River Basin illustrates our results.(C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Taking China's Eight Economic Regions as an example, we explore how to optimize energy price policy to promote regional carbon reduction by combining the GWR model, quantile regression and scenario analysis. The study finds that (1)the energy prices can promote or suppress carbon emissions and carbon intensity through five variables, including economic development, industrial structure, energy efficiency, energy investment and energy consumption etc.(2) the current energy investment and consumption structure lead to a high level of carbon emissions, while such effect from economic development is relatively limited, and the influence direction and level of industrial structure and energy efficiency on carbon emissions are regionally different. (3) with the exception of the energy consumption structure, four other factors have varying restraining effects on carbon intensity, and (4) scenario analysis shows that optimizing industrial and energy consumption structure are crucial to reduce carbon emissions, and optimizing industrial structure helps to reduce carbon intensity.

Using data from the 2009 Residential Energy Consumption Survey, I present empirical evidence that this underinvestment occurs in multiple categories of residential energy efficiency: space-heating, water-heating, window thickness, insulation, and weatherization. Because these landlords did not invest at the same rate as homeowners and landlords who pay the energy bill, their tenants' energy bill was higher by nearly 2%. When combined with other researchers' estimations for appliances (Davis, 2010), insulation, and thermostat responsiveness for tenants (Gillingham et al., 2012), our results imply that renters use approximately 2.7% more energy overall due to the landlord-tenant split incentive issue.","[Melvin, Jesse] Univ Delaware, Dept Econ, 20 Orchard Rd, Newark, DE 19716 USA",University of Delaware,"Melvin, J (通讯作者)，Univ Delaware, Dept Econ, 20 Orchard Rd, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",jmelvin@udel.edu,,,,,,,18,63,66,0,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,APR,2018,115.0,,,,,,342,352,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.11.069,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GA1TH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428099800034,0

Nevertheless, renewable energy options and natural gas are paving the way for coal retirement. Alternatively, it is possible to reduce the emissions (especially SO2 and NO) associated with coal combustion through technology retrofits focused on desulphurisation and denitrification in line with the EU Industrial Emissions Directive. Within a context of low coal and CO2 prices, lifetime extension of coal-fired plants emerges as an option for power plant owners. This article prospectively evaluates the announced retrofit for 3560 MW of the Spanish coal power capacity under three alternative energy scenarios. In addition to prospective electricity production mixes, the evolution of key life-cycle sustainability indicators (climate change, human health, energy security) is assessed with time horizon 2050 using an enhanced energy systems optimisation model of power generation. When compared to the reference scenario, the results show that coal extension could favour the penetration of renewables in the long term. Notwithstanding, this would come at the expense of undesirable increases in climate change and human health impacts. Consequently, the implementation of the sustainability dimension in energy plans could avoid a coal conundrum situation in Spain.","[Garcia-Gusano, Diego; Iribarren, Diego; Dufour, Javier] Inst IMDEA Energia, Syst Anal Unit, Mostoles 28935, Spain; [Dufour, Javier] Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Chem & Environm Engn Grp, Mostoles 28933, Spain",IMDEA Energy; Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"García-Gusano, D (通讯作者)，Inst IMDEA Energia, Syst Anal Unit, Mostoles 28935, Spain.",diego.garcia@imdea.org,"Dufour, Javier/A-7079-2010; Garcia-Gusano, Diego/L-5994-2014","Garcia-Gusano, Diego/0000-0002-9493-0422; Dufour, Javier/0000-0003-2497-7310",,,,,44,23,24,1,34,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2018,114.0,,,,,,413,421,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.12.038,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FW0DY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424962800038,0

These utilities are technically and economically inefficient and face large financial losses that prevent further development of the networks. The reforms are introduced to unbundle the vertically integrated utilities and introduce private investment and management, but these efforts often fail due to poorly designed market and incentive models. Focusing on the electricity distribution in developing countries, we propose a business model based on organizing the utilities into distinct activities and businesses. In many developing countries political economy and weak investment conditions do not favour full privatization of utilities. However, in some activities 'competition for the market' and 'management contracts' can provide a partial role for the private actors. The model is based on the concepts of enterprise innovation, emphasizing external collaboration and partnerships and can be operationalized via specialization, where some specific tasks are outsourced. The proposed model can also be applied to developed countries as the energy sectors of both developing and developed countries are undergoing transformation due to new technologies such as communications, distributed generation (DGs), and active demand response.","[Jamasb, Tooraj] Univ Durham, Business Sch, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England; [Thakur, Tripta] NIT Bhopal, Bhopal, India; [Bag, Baidyanath] NIT Kurukshetra, Kurukshetra, Haryana, India",Durham University; National Institute of Technology (NIT System); Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology Bhopal; National Institute of Technology (NIT System); National Institute of Technology Kurukshetra,"Jamasb, T (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Business Sch, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England.",tooraj.jamasb@durham.ac.uk,,,,,,,47,24,26,2,34,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2018,114.0,,,,,,22,29,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.11.068,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FW0DY,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424962800003,0

Drawing on a national survey of 2065 Canadian residents, we identify the determinants of technology adoption intention with the exemplary case of rooftop solar. Using a combination of latent and observed variables within a non-linear structural equation model, our analysis quantifies how a set of individual and community level factors affect adoption intention. Analysis reveals that the visibility of solar technology has a particularly strong effect on intention, lending support to social learning and social network theories of diffusion of innovation. Our findings also show that the perceived knowledge of energy systems and being publicly engaged in energy issues significantly increases adoption intention.

The first objective of the paper is to analyze the complex concept of regional resilience, adopting a systemic and holistic approach. Using a multidimensional methodology, regional resilience is described by outcome and driver variables, with focus on sustainability of local systems, broken down into the three pillars of economy, society and environment, whereby the holistic approach means that each dimension of territorial sustainable development is partly determined by its relations with the other dimensions. The second aim of the paper is then to test the relations between determinants and outcome of regional resilience. This framework is different compared to previous empirical studies, which primarily focus on economic performance in terms of income or employment dynamics. The model is applied to the case of European regions, to get a map of regional resilience in its different dimensions.","[Rizzi, Paolo] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Social & Econ Sci, Piacenza, Italy; [Graziano, Paola; Dallara, Antonio] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Local Econ Lab, Piacenza, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Rizzi, P (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Social & Econ Sci, Piacenza, Italy.",paolo.rizzi@unicatt.it; paola.graziano@unicatt.it; antonio.dallara@unicatt.it,,"RIZZI, Paolo/0000-0001-9410-3649",,,,,88,54,57,4,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The analysis identifies factors important for how a deliberate transfer process may unfold. It is based on monitoring a case of South-South transfer of experiences with village-level solar power supply models from India to Kenya. This research shows that it is not so much stable technical solutions which travel between different spatial and cultural contexts, but that experiences with sustainable technologies in one country can provide important inspiration and knowledge for the development of new socio-technical designs based on local needs in a new socio-spatial context in a different country. Such learning processes can be especially effective between countries with similar problem situations, such as poverty and lacking access to electricity in rural areas. To achieve a successful transfer, strong emphasis must be put on mutual learning and exchange of knowledge, socio-technical experimentation, adaptation and social embedding. Learning from promising, innovative infrastructures in other geographical areas needs to capture the micro-level interactions between people, technology and socio-cultural contexts, while also taking into account larger processes of system innovation and emerging transitions.","[Ulsrud, Kirsten] Univ Oslo, Dept Sociol & Human Geog, Postboks 1096, N-0317 Oslo, Norway; [Rohracher, Harald] Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies Technol & Social Change, Campus Valla, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; [Muchunku, Charles] POB 76406-00508, Nairobi, Kenya",University of Oslo; Linkoping University,"Rohracher, H (通讯作者)，Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies Technol & Social Change, Campus Valla, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.",kirsten.ulsrud@sosgeo.uio.no; harald.rohracher@liu.se; muchunku@yahoo.com,"Rohracher, Harald/JUV-4337-2023","Rohracher, Harald/0000-0003-3945-0183; Muchunku, Charles/0000-0002-1526-4311","Research Council of Norway [190138, 217137]",Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"We want to thank the Research Council of Norway for funding two subsequent trans-disciplinary and international research projects that enabled the practical and academic learning process described above and the analysis of the process.

We find evidence that increasing embeddedness in EU funded R&D networks leads to positive immediate impacts on regional knowledge production, and that regions with lower levels of own knowledge endowments more likely exploit the positive effects.

The empirical results confirm the existence of an N-shaped relationship between economic growth and CO2 emissions in the EU-5 countries. We incorporate additional variables such as renewable electricity consumption, trade openness, natural resource abundance, and energy innovation to augment the carbon emission function. Renewable electricity consumption, natural resources, and energy innovation improve environmental quality, while trade openness and the interaction between economic growth and renewable electricity consumption exert a positive impact on CO2 emissions. This study is novel in that it presents an interaction between economic growth and renewable electricity consumption. We also confirm the need for renewable energy regulations related to increasing renewable sources and promoting energy innovation to reduce the negative effects of energy and fossil energy resources on environmental degradation.","[Balsalobre-Lorente, Daniel] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Polit Econ & Publ Finance, Econ & Business Stat & Econ Policy, Ciudad Real, Spain; [Shahbaz, Muhammad; Roubaud, David] Montpellier Business Sch, Energy & Sustainable Dev, Montpellier, France; [Farhani, Sahbi] Univ Sousse, ISG Sousse, LAMIDED, Sousse 4000, Tunisia; [Farhani, Sahbi] Private Univ Sousse, Private High Sch Econ & Management Sousse, Sousse, Tunisia",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Montpellier Business School; Universite de Sousse,"Roubaud, D (通讯作者)，2300 Ave Moulins, F-34000 Montpellier, France.",daniel.balsalobre@uclm.es; muhdshahbaz77@gmail.com; d.roubaud@montpellier-bs.com; sahbi.farhani@ups.ens.tn,"ROUBAUD, DAVID/ABA-8123-2020; Farhani, Sahbi/HII-4766-2022; Balsalobre-Lorente, Daniel/AAB-4817-2019; Shahbaz, Muhammad/AAD-9038-2019; Shahbaz, Muhammad/AAS-6190-2021","ROUBAUD, DAVID/0000-0003-3827-6187; Balsalobre-Lorente, Daniel/0000-0002-6099-7899; Shahbaz, Muhammad/0000-0003-2391-6997; Farhani, Sahbi/0000-0002-0107-2263",,,,,131,857,868,28,370,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2018,113.0,,,,,,356,367,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.10.050,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FT2XO,,Green Submitted,Y,N,2024-03-10,WOS:000423009500035,0

There is a strong interconnection between Spain's and Portugal's transmission systems, resulting in common prices in both countries. However, Portuguese and Spanish producers receive the incentives for producing wind-based electricity that are specified in their own national policies, resulting in different costs to rate-payers. In this paper, we estimate the costs to Portuguese rate-payers associated with the current market design and policy incentives. To do so, we regress hourly spot electricity market prices as a function of hourly wind generation, and estimate the resulting feed-in-tariff costs distributional effects over the various rate-payer categories. Total costs for rate payer are at the minimum level if joint wind generation in Portugal and Spain increases by 5.5% from what it is today. If wind generation increases much further, then the costs increase due to the FiT overcost increase. If wind generation decreases from current levels, then costs also increase due to the merit-order effect. Furthermore, we find that rate-payer categories will endure different portions of the costs, with an increase in wind generation penalizing predominantly <= 20.7 kVA rate-payers.","[Prata, Ricardo; Carvalho, Pedro M.

However, network constraints impose limits on cross-border reserve coordination. Transmission capacity allocation in the reserve market is a complex problem, as it happens under uncertainty and interferes with transmission capacity allocation in energy markets. This paper studies network constraints in the reserve procurement phase, by means of a simulation model and scenario analysis. Three different approaches are proposed and evaluated based on a case study of the Central Western European electricity system. Towards this aim, a dedicated model is developed to simulate the day-ahead energy market, the day-ahead reserve procurement and the real-time reserve activation. In a case study of the Central Western European power system, we show that the best reserve market outcome weighing cost-efficiency and system reliability is obtained when reserve activation scenarios are considered in the procurement phase. Policy makers should design, in close cooperation with regulators and system operators, efficient and robust transmission capacity allocation procedures for cross-border reserve markets. This paper can help them to do so as it demonstrates the impact of transmission capacity allocation on cross-border reserve markets.","[Van den Bergh, Kenneth; Bruninx, Kenneth; Delarue, Erik] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 300 Box 2421, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium; [Bruninx, Kenneth] VITO, Boerentang 200, B-2400 Mol, Belgium; [Bruninx, Kenneth; Delarue, Erik] EnergyVille, Thor Pk 8310, B-3600 Genk, Belgium",KU Leuven; VITO,"Delarue, E (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 300 Box 2421, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium.",erik.delarue@kuleuven.be,"Bruninx, Kenneth/T-4486-2019; Delarue, Erik/G-9722-2012","Bruninx, Kenneth/0000-0003-0838-5139; Delarue, Erik/0000-0003-1798-1274",,,,,44,18,19,5,16,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2018,113.0,,,,,,193,205,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.10.053,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FT2XO,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423009500019,0

In the midst of this economic phenomenon, there is a trend of increasing greenhouse gas emissions with attendant economic, health, and environmental consequences. This paper examines the causal interdependence between energy consumption, economic growth, and CO2 emissions in Ghana from 1960 to 2015 by using the Toda-Yamamoto and Granger causality tests. The Johansen and Johansen-Juselius cointegration approach and the Autoregressive Distributed Lag bounds-test approach are employed to test for cointegration relationship. The results show that the variables are cointegrated. The causality tests reveal that there is feedback Granger causality between energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Since there is a causal link between energy consumption and economic growth with its concomitant effect on CO2 emissions, any energy conservation-oriented policy not derived from energy efficiency and technological progress may hurt the Ghanaian-economy. In effect, more effort should be aimed at improving energy efficiency through technological progress, and investment should be made in renewable energy to reduce over-reliance on fossil fuels.","[Appiah, Michael Owusu] City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Energy & Environm, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Appiah, Michael Owusu] Univ Cape Coast, Sch Business, Cape Coast, Ghana",City University of Hong Kong; University of Cape Coast,"Appiah, MO (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Energy & Environm, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",mowusuapp2-c@my.cityu.edu.hk,"Appiah, Michael Owusu/AAO-1854-2021","Owusu Appiah, Michael/0000-0002-2624-7672; Owusu Appiah, Michael/0000-0003-1444-3876",,,,,63,134,143,6,89,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JAN,2018,112.0,,,,,,198,208,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.10.017,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FO2NK,,,Y,N,2024-03-10,WOS:000416615800021,0

Moreover, reported probabilities may be rounded and thus not equal to true beliefs. Using survival expectations elicited from a representative sample from the Netherlands, we investigate what can be learned if we take these two sources of missing information into account and expectations are therefore only partially identified. We find novel evidence for rounding by checking whether reported expectations are consistent with a hazard of death that increases weakly with age. Only 39% of reported beliefs are consistent with this under the assumption that all probabilities are reported precisely, while 92% are if we allow for rounding. Using the available information to construct bounds on subjective life expectancy, we show that the data alone are not sufficiently informative to allow for useful inference in partially identified linear models, even in the absence of rounding. We propose to improve precision by interpolation between rounded probabilities. Interpolation in combination with a limited amount of rounding does yield informative intervals.","[Bissonnette, L.] Univ Laval, Dept Econ, 1025 Ave Sci Humaines, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [de Bresser, J.] Tilburg Univ, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",Laval University; Tilburg University,"Bissonnette, L (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Dept Econ, 1025 Ave Sci Humaines, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",luc.bissonnette@ecn.ulaval.ca; j.r.debresser@uvt.nl,,"de Bresser, Jochem/0000-0001-9213-1929; Bissonnette, Luc/0000-0002-4684-508X",,,,,19,4,4,0,1,AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC,ALEXANDRIA,"732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

In the process of globalization, the unification of standards of ethical business conduct has become a must with compliance programs being a powerful element to support business ethics. The idea to establish such formal programs in organizations has its roots in the US. The American approach has started to be replicated by both firms and legislative bodies across the world. In addition, in order to ensure that the American companies are not disadvantaged for behaving ethically on the global market, the US as one of the most important global players has also put pressure on other countries to apply similarly rigorous legal rules to fight against corruption and other unethical business practices. In Slovakia, the Act on Criminal Liability of Legal Persons was adopted in 2016 based on the international obligations. With this act in place, the Slovak State has interfered in the economic processes by defining that a legal entity can commit a crime and by determining sanctions for breaching the law by companies. The implementation of a compliance program can help firms protect their reputation and avoid severe penalties. Acting in accordance with all applicable laws, i.e. following strictly a compliance program, contributes to a fairer market competition, which in turn brings advantages for the society.","[Bohinska, Alexandra] Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava 82005, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Bohinská, A (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava 82005, Slovakia.",alexandra.bohinska@fm.uniba.sk,,,,,,,23,1,1,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,476,483,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300063,0

Factormodel, themost popular latentmodel, explains the continuous observed variables in a smaller set of latent variables (factors) in a matter of linear relationship. However, complex data often simultaneously display asymmetric dependence, asymptotic dependence, and positive (negative) dependence between random variables, which linearity and Gaussian distributions and many other extant distributions are not capable of modeling. This article proposes a nonlinear factor model that can model the above-mentioned variable dependence features but still possesses a simple form of factor structure. The random variables, marginally distributed as unit Frechet distributions, are decomposed into max linear functions of underlying Frechet idiosyncratic risks, transformed from Gaussian copula, and independent shared external Frechet risks. By allowing the random variables to share underlying (latent) pervasive risks with random impact parameters, various dependence structures are created. This innovates a new promising technique to generate families of distributions with simple interpretations. We dive in the multivariate extreme value properties of the proposed model and investigate maximum composite likelihood methods for the impact parameters of the latent risks. The estimates are shown to be consistent. The estimation schemes are illustrated on several sets of simulated data, where comparisons of performance are addressed. We employ a bootstrap method to obtain standard errors in real data analysis. Real application to financial data reveals inherent dependencies that previous work has not disclosed and demonstrates the model's interpretability to real data.

Many control systems use fuzzy logic and as a result applying compare operators to fuzzy numbers. The article deals with the issue of comparing fuzzy numbers. The similarity relation is most probably the most frequently used and the most difficult to precisely determine the convergence measure. Analysis of the similarity of two objects is a basic assessment tool and constitutes the basis for reasoning by analogy. It also directly affects the energy effectiveness of the universe that it controls. This article presents the methods for determining the similarity used in fuzzy logic. Many of these methods were dedicated only to fuzzy triangular or trapezoidal numbers (Dobrosielski et al. 2017, Chi-Tsuen Yeh 2017, Abbasbandy and Hajjar 2009).

Since the mitigation of systemic risks and preventing their contagion on the international financial markets became a priority for the national and international financial authorities, a number of macro-prudential policies were considered to achieve the financial stability that, on a long run, trigger positive externalities for the entire society. The hypothesis of the research is that there is an appropriate time to implement counter-cyclical measures when the trajectories of the cycles converge to the asymptotically stable equilibrium point. If the system reacts with a time delay than the oscillations in the system persist. The envisaged results show that risks can be controlled to a certain extent, but there is also a residual risk that cannot be controlled because of behavioural factors, noise, rumours, etc. Financial cycles are approached from a theoretical perspective using a mathematical model that involves the occurrence value, the analyzed value and the controlled value of the risk in the current state of market. The time delay is introduced and based on Hopf bifurcation theory, the conditions for stability and bifurcations are given. Numerical simulations verify the theoretical findings and the conclusions outline a future possible continuation of the research.","[Donath, Liliana Eva; Neamtu, Mihaela; Mircea, Gabriela] West Univ Timisoara, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Timisoara, Romania",West University of Timisoara,"Neamtu, M (通讯作者)，West Univ Timisoara, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Timisoara, Romania.",liliana.donath@e-uvt.ro; mihaela.neamtu@e-uvt.ro; gabriela.mircea@e-uvt.ro,"MIRCEA, Gabriela/IUQ-7160-2023","Donath, Liliana/0000-0003-1386-1830",,,,,17,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1536,1543,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300196,0

The success of gender-equality objectives is often analyzed by counting the number of men and women taking part in the projects. However, the extent to which this will enhance regional development is unclear and regional agents at a range of organizational levels express uncertainty about the most effective objectives and implementation measures.

The article deals with the possibilities of financing the forest ecosystem services and the green growth measuring and recording through accounting. However, in this case globalization has brought new opportunities for investments. The article classifies the forest ecosystem services from a commercial, economic and financial aspect, and points to the specifics of financing ecosystem services in condition of globalization on the example of the state owned enterprise Lesy SR. Based on the achieved results, in the article are formulated main recommendations with aim to support ecosystem services. It is in particular focused on providing sufficient financial sources in form of the refundable and non-refundable foreign sources of financing, a consistent recording of the costs incurred to secure ecosystem services, as well as a requirement for their subsequent financial compensation. The proposed solutions include the creation of a system of assessing the positive impact of forest ecosystem services on population health as well as a system for measuring the extent of their utilization. At the same time, it is necessary to secure their financing by non-repayable financial sources, the volume of which will depend on the area and on the quality of forest ecosystem services implementation.","[Hajduchova, Iveta; Giertliova, Blanka; Sulek, Rastislav] Tech Univ Zvolen, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Econ & Management, TG Masaryka 24, SK-96053 Zvolen, Slovakia",Technical University Zvolen,"Giertliova, B (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Zvolen, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Econ & Management, TG Masaryka 24, SK-96053 Zvolen, Slovakia.",hajduchova@tuzvo.sk; giertliova@tuzvo.sk; sulek@tuzvo.sk,"Sulek, Rastislav/V-6732-2017","Sulek, Rastislav/0000-0001-5947-4305","Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic; Slovak Academy of Sciences [1/0688/16, KEGA 013TU Z-4/2018]","Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic; Slovak Academy of Sciences(Slovak Academy of Sciences)","The authors are grateful for the support of the Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic, and the Slovak Academy of Sciences, VEGA No. 1/0688/16 Economic and legal conditions of sustainable public access to forests, and KEGA 013TU Z-4/2018 Innovation methods in Teaching of Financial Management",,17,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1583,1590,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300202,0

However, the small businesses find themselves in a difficult situation to succeed in today's globalized market environment. The goal of this paper is to analyse how the regional label of Vysocina regionalni produkt (Vysocina Regional Product) operates and to present proposals for developing this label using suitable marketing tools in the globalized environment. Labels have many important functions, for example, they help customers identify a product manufacturer or can provide positive or negative motivation to purchase a product, etc. The corporate goal is to represent a specific quality of products and services by the brand, causing return of satisfied customers, and thus ensure further business. Currently, there are dozens of regional labels in the Czech Republic; VYSOCINA regionalni produkt (R), is one of them. Compared to a number of other regional products, this brand also faces numerous problems, as these mostly small companies do not have sufficient funds and therefore are not able to promote their products. In this paper, a comparison of selected regional brands was conducted, including a customer questionnaire and a proposal for the use of marketing tools to ensure further development of the Vysocina regional product label.","[Kozena, Marcela; Brodsky, Martin] Univ Pardubice, Fac Business & Adm, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Kozená, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Business & Adm, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",marcela.kozena@upce.cz; martin.brodsky@seznam.cz,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,632,639,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300083,0

We estimated an extended Mincer wage equation using OLS and the Heckman correction for self-selection to employment. We drew on data from three waves of the Human Capital Balance survey (2012-2014), where information on computer and internet skills, both general and specific, was self-reported by respondents. By using this database, we managed to control for a wide range of individuals' characteristics, including several different skills, thus reducing the endogeneity bias. Our analysis shows that after controling for several individuals' skills and a variety of other individual characteristics, the wage premium from general computer and internet skills amounts to 12-17% in case of individuals residing in Poland.

Regional Studies. This paper investigates the role of regional factors in innovation performance, controlling for firms' absorptive capacity and other sources of firm heterogeneity. The findings for a sample of firms in Spain support the hypothesis that regional determinants matter, though their role is subtler than is frequently assumed. Rather than exerting a direct influence on firms' innovation, the regional context moderates the effect of internal determinants, particularly of the firms' absorptive capacity. The results indicate that the type of relevant interactions differs for product and process innovation and that they only operate for small and medium-sized enterprises, being negligible for large firms.

In diesem Beitrag untersuchen wir die Rolle von regionalen Faktoren fur die Innovationsleistung unter Berucksichtigung der absorptiven Kapazitat und anderer Quellen der Heterogenitat von Firmen. Die Ergebnisse fur eine Stichprobe von Firmen in Spanien bestatigen die Hypothese, dass regionale Determinanten von Bedeutung sind, wobei ihre Rolle freilich subtiler ist als haufig angenommen. Statt einen direkten Einfluss auf die Innovation der Firmen auszuuben, ma ss igt der regionale Kontext die Auswirkung von internen Determinanten, insbesondere der absorptiven Kapazitat der Firmen. Aus den Ergebnissen geht hervor, dass die Art der relevanten Wechselwirkungen fur Produkt- und Verfahrensinnovation unterschiedlich ausfallt und dass die Wechselwirkungen nur auf kleine und mittelstandische Unternehmen zutreffen, wahrend sie fur gro ss ere Firmen vernachlassigbar sind.

Los resultados obtenidos a partir de una muestra de empresas espanolas apoyan la hipotesis de la relevancia de los determinantes regionales, aunque su efecto es mas sutil de lo considerado habitualmente. Mas que influir directamente en la innovacion, el contexto regional determina el efecto de los factores internos, particularmente de la capacidad de absorcion de la empresa. La evidencia indica que el tipo de interacciones relevantes es distinto para la innovacion del producto y el proceso, y que solo actuan para las pymes, siendo insignificante en empresas mas grandes.","[Lopez-Bazo, Enrique; Motellon, Elisabet] Univ Barcelona, Reg Quantitat Anal Res Grp AQR, Barcelona, Spain; [Motellon, Elisabet] Univ Oberta Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona; UOC Universitat Oberta de Catalunya,"López-Bazo, E (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Reg Quantitat Anal Res Grp AQR, Barcelona, Spain.",elopez@ub.edu; emotellon@uoc.edu,"Lopez-Bazo, Enrique/AAY-3187-2020; Motellon, Elisabet/L-2352-2014","Lopez-Bazo, Enrique/0000-0002-4654-8237; Motellon, Elisabet/0000-0002-5461-2825",Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2014-59493-R]; project 'Redes de colaboracion tecnologica e innovacion.

These changes relate to different quality, quantity, and intensity. Among other things, management rules are changing. In view of this, the effect of globalization on the managers themselves is increasing. In terms of development, globalization is inevitable. It can, however, meet our expectations if based on ethical behavior and ethically and globally respected goals. The problem of ethical behavior of managers is a sensitive, and not a very evident issue. Ethical behavior manifests in relation to the external environment of an enterprise, but also within the enterprise, towards the people who work there. Enterprises are constantly facing problems and conflicts, which managers solve with empathy, being sensitive to specific situations. Globalization is connected with permanent search for new ways of developing and maintaining interpersonal relations - ways of management, which are based on humanistic behavior, respect for human dignity, and responsible actions. The paper deals with the ethical behavior of managers in selected Slovak enterprises. Character and attributes of managers are essential for ethical behavior, which is an important and at the same time the least costly way of building trust in an enterprise. For a leader, being virtuous and honest is not only a matter of surviving, but also a matter of ethics. Employees in enterprises seek and demand such leaders that can be trusted. Leaders of the global enterprises must be masters of interpersonal relations.","[Minarova, Martina] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Dept Corp Econ & Management, Tajoyskeho 10, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia; [Bencikova, Dana] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Dept Language Commun Business, Tajoyskeho 10, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia",Matej Bel University; Matej Bel University,"Benciková, D (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Dept Language Commun Business, Tajoyskeho 10, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia.",martina.minarova@umb.sk; dana.bencikova@umb.sk,"Minárová, Martina/GZG-3836-2022","Minárová, Martina/0000-0001-5795-8496",project VEGA [1/0934/16],project VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This paper is an output of the science project VEGA 1/0934/16 -Cultural intelligence as an essential prerequisite for competitiveness of Slovakia in global environment.,,20,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,746,754,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300097,0

International Financial Reporting Standards may not only improve access of investment funds to foreign markets, but also globally accepted set of accounting standards may encourage investors to look for investment opportunities at foreign markets. Investors can benefit from uniform reporting standards and funds can more easily benchmark with peers and competitors on the global market. The aim of the study is to survey the level of harmonisation of financial reporting standards in investment funds in Europe and evaluate future possibilities in this respect. The study describes the main advantages of accounting harmonisation and mentions some disadvantages.

The growth rate of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the level of unemployment (UNE) are some of the key indicators of estimation of countries macro economy progress. The subject of UNE is a challenge in developing countries and with the globalization it becomes the topic for developed countries as well as it was seen during the global economic crises and subsequent recovery that created turbulences on employment market in all countries. Employment rate is one of the economy indicators the local governments are keeping an eye on and is very sensitively perceived by media and public that has the effects on value of the country on globalized market from foreign investors' point of view. During the time of the economy growth, the UNE rate could estimate the effectiveness of government and its policies in the use of local labour resources. The relationship between GDP and UNE rate for any chosen country is evident. When UNE decreases, effectiveness of the use of labour force rises thus the output of economy rises as well. In the paper, we investigate the relation between growth of GDP and UNE rate on basis of testing the validity of Okun's law for several chosen countries and comparing the effect of global economic crises on parameters of Okun's law before and after recession.

The aim of the article is to analyse the impact of globalization on the world of work, to identify new challenges and to set new competencies and recommendations in the field of managerial work in line with new management trends.","[Viera, Sukalova; Pavel, Ceniga] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Viera, S (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",viera.sukalova@fpedas.uniza.sk; pavel.ceniga@fpedas.uniza.sk,,,"VEGA [1/0244/16, 1/0696/16]",VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This paper is an output of the science project VEGA 1/0244/16 Personnel marketing as a new approach of the ensuring and maintaining the skilled workforce in Slovak companies and project VEGA 1/0696/16 Design of methodology for measuring quality of life in a regional context.,,22,0,0,0,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,900,907,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300117,0

As a better alternative, we propose a gradient tree-boosting algorithm and apply it to Tweedie compound Poisson models for pure premiums. We use a profile likelihood approach to estimate the index and dispersion parameters. Our method is capable of fitting a flexible nonlinear Tweedie model and capturing complex interactions among predictors. A simulation study confirms the excellent prediction performance of our method. As an application, we apply our method to an auto-insurance claim data and show that the new method is superior to the existing methods in the sense that it generates more accurate premium predictions, thus helping solve the adverse selection issue.

From the methodological point of view, our study combines an input-output approach with a comprehensive bottom-up analytical model in which detailed product information from external trade statistics is used to account for imports. Although during the period under consideration Italy experienced an expansion in RES capacity that went beyond the rosiest expectations, it appears that the resulting demand for plant components was met to a very significant extent by imports. We find that the contribution to sectoral value added and employment was not as large as envisioned by ex-ante analyses. In net terms, the resources absorbed by RES plants in the construction, installation and manufacturing phase seem to have made a smaller contribution to the domestic economy than they would have in several counterfactual scenarios. The opposite is true for the resources used in the subsequent operation and management phase. Finally, our results suggest that variation in domestic content of manufactured products may limit the portability of RES employment and value added factor estimates across countries.","[Cai, Mattia] Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Fac Econ & Management, Bolzano, Italy; [Cai, Mattia; Cusumano, Niccolo; Lorenzoni, Arturo; Pontoni, Federico] Bocconi Univ, IEFE Ctr Res Energy & Environm Econ & Policy, Milan, Italy; [Cusumano, Niccolo] SDA Bocconi Sch Management, Milan, Italy; [Lorenzoni, Arturo] Univ Padua, Dept Ind Engn, Padua, Italy",Free University of Bozen-Bolzano; Bocconi University; Bocconi University; University of Padua,"Cai, M (通讯作者)，Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Fac Econ & Management, Bolzano, Italy.",mattia.cai@unibz.it,"Cai, Mattia/GWV-9996-2022; Lorenzoni, Arturo/A-2703-2019","Pontoni, Federico/0000-0001-7258-4381; Cusumano, Niccolo/0000-0003-3737-5028; Lorenzoni, Arturo/0000-0002-4935-8236",GSE - Gestore dei Servizi Energetici SpA,GSE - Gestore dei Servizi Energetici SpA,"The authors would like to thank two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions to improve the quality of the paper.

In this market environment driven by persistently low natural gas prices and stagnant electricity demand, we estimate that about two thirds of the 102 GW nuclear capacity are uncompetitive over the next few years under the current trajectory. Among those, 18 GW are retiring or are merchant plants at high risk of retiring prematurely. The potential consequences of the hypothetical withdrawal of 20 GW of nuclear capacity include: 1) a similar to 3.2% increase in carbon emissions of the power sector if replaced by gas-fired units or 2) a significant increase in cost if replaced by renewables. Without a carbon price, out-of-the-market payments would be needed to effectively maintain merchant nuclear capacity. Filling the revenue gap would come at a fleet-average cost of $3.5-5.5/MWh for these plants, which is much lower than the cost of subsidizing wind power. The policy support could take the form of direct zero-emission credits, renewable portfolio standard expansion, or clean capacity market mechanisms. As a last resort, the exercise of a new mothballing status could prevent the irreversible retirement of nuclear power assets.","[Haratyk, Geoffrey] MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Haratyk, G (通讯作者)，MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",gharatyk@mit.edu,,,U.S. Department of Energy,U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"I would like to warmly thank my thesis advisors, Professors R.

The types of contamination covered include level shifts (changes in mean) and monotone or smooth time trends, both of which have been shown to bias parameter estimates toward regions of persistence in a variety of contexts. The estimators presented here minimize trimmed frequency domain quasi-maximum likelihood (FDQML) objective functions without requiring specification of the low-frequency contaminating component. When proper sample size-dependent trimmings are used, the FDQML estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal, asymptotically eliminating the presence of any spurious persistence. These asymptotic results also hold in the absence of additive low-frequency contamination, enabling the practitioner to robustly estimate model parameters without prior knowledge of whether contamination is present. Popular time series models that fit into the framework of this article include autoregressive moving average (ARMA), stochastic volatility, generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH), and autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) models. We explore the finite sample properties of the trimmed FDQML estimators of the parameters of some of these models, providing practical guidance on trimming choice. Empirical estimation results suggest that a large portion of the apparent persistence in certain volatility time series may indeed be spurious.

That is, the barrels whose production responds to changes in demand. If the countries dominating the production of the marginal barrels are relatively unstable, policies to reduce world oil consumption or boost oil production from stable suppliers will provide the additional benefit of reducing the contribution of unstable producers to the world oil market. If the countries dominating the marginal barrel are relatively stable, however, policies to reduce world oil consumption or boost oil production from stable suppliers will be less effective in promoting oil market stability. Typically, we think of the highest cost producers as supplying the marginal barrel of oil, but our assessment finds it quite likely that OPEC dominates production of the marginal barrel of world oil. Moreover, OPEC members have been among the more unstable producers on a historical basis. Hence, reducing world oil consumption and promoting oil production in stable non-OPEC countries will enhance world oil security. Policies to promote stability in OPEC countries also would enhance world oil security.","[Brown, Stephen P.

Observing hydropower development in Italian Eastern Alps, we show how visibility and invisibility were purposely used to hide spatial, social and environmental injustices. These strategies, often supported also by environmental and landscape policies, actually limit any possible collaborative 'making' of energy landscapes, which should be based on the transparency of objectives and actions. Among several public policies and private actions, it is possible to identify ten strategies (masking, burying, camouflaging, removing, distracting, staging, digging up, prefiguring, mapping, storytelling) adopted to increase acceptability and prevent conflicts or, on the contrary, to expose the problem, revealing opaque processes and unfair spatial effects. Hiding/showing strategies - and their not directly evident relevant consequences - testify the complexity of the socio-spatial context involved in the process of energy landscape making, which deeply affects social acceptance. This paper sollicits a deeper awareness of the matter of visibility and invisibility in energy policies, which allows to unveil what is mendacious and misleading, and drives towards a more sustainable and fairer collaborative making of European landscapes.","[Ferrario, Viviana] Univ Venezia, Santa Croce 191 Tolentini, I-30125 Venice, Italy; [Castiglioni, Benedetta] Univ Padua, Via Santo 26, I-35126 Padua, Italy",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; University of Padua,"Ferrario, V (通讯作者)，Univ Venezia, Santa Croce 191 Tolentini, I-30125 Venice, Italy.",viviana.ferrario@iuav.it; etta.castiglioni@unipd.it,"Ferrario, Viviana/HKO-1431-2023","Ferrario, Viviana/0000-0002-5155-3268; CASTIGLIONI, BENEDETTA/0000-0002-2263-5774",,,,,45,14,15,1,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2017,108.0,,,,,,829,835,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.05.012,0.0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FC3FZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406725800076,0

Using multinomial logit models, this paper finds that the labor market status of an individual (part-time worker, unemployed and not in labor force) serves as an important factor for out-migration decision during a recession. The pushing effects of labor market status among the at-risk population in devastated labor markets are the largest for movers to intrastate destinations beyond metropolitan borders. The effects of labor market status for interstate out-migration are still significant but largely limited, due to higher moving costs and growing uncertainty. For the at-risk population with lower socioeconomic status, depressing labor market status triggers speculative migration; however, the speculative behavior among the overall at-risk population continuously slowed during the Great Recession, as the rather risk-aversive wait and see attitude had increased.","[Lim, Jaewon] Univ Nevada, Sch Publ Policy & Leadership, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas,"Lim, J (通讯作者)，Univ Nevada, Sch Publ Policy & Leadership, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA.",jaewon.lim@unlv.edu,"Lim, Jaewon/AAL-6804-2020","Lim, Jaewon/0000-0002-0224-6448",,,,,53,3,3,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The model describes relevant feedback mechanisms between technological evolution, the interbank market and the electricity sector. Analysis with it shows that energy policies affect interbank connectivity and hence the likelihood of cascades of bank failures. This effect has not been studied before in the literature. In particular, we find that investments in renewable energy reduce interbank connectivity, increasing the probability of bank failures, while raising taxes on energy has an opposite effect. Increasing the share of renewable energy in electricity production initially increases the price of electricity, and thus improves profits and the ability to re-pay debts of incumbent power plants. However, when the share of renewable energy increases too quickly, financial stability may be at stake as the burden of financing investments in renewable energy offsets the improved profitability of existing power stations. All in all, this study provides a unique and novel perspective on the relationship between renewable energy investments and financial stability.","[Safarzynska, Karolina] Warsaw Univ, Fac Econ Sci, Dluga 44-50, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland; [van den Bergh, Jeroen C.

Alternative fuels are energy to fill in the gap for transportation. The types of the alternative transportation fuels include electricity, gaseous, liquid, and solid energy carriers. Understanding what type of alternative fuels will dominate alternative transportation fuel market is critical for policy-makers to make sound decisions to develop alternative fuels. The purpose of the paper is to analyze the general trend of alternative fuel market by applying principles that govern the biological and technological evolutions. Existing transportation infrastructure favors liquid alternative fuels over electricity and hydrogen. The human nature of satisfying their needs with least effort also favors liquid fuels over electricity and hydrogen.

This article presents a comprehensive overview of the ESCO industry in EU Member States and neighbouring countries based on a large-scale expert survey, focused on market development between 2010 and 2013. Drivers and barriers are analysed, recommendations on additional measures to further promote the national and EU ESCO markets are suggested. The previously characteristic growing trend continued, and most of the markets were getting stronger during the period. Germany, France, Austria, the Czech Republic and the UK were the most active markets in 2013, and only Cyprus, Estonia and Malta remain without ESCO activity. The size of the EU market was estimated at (sic)2.4 billion in ESCO revenue in 2015. ESCO markets were found to be driven as much by market forces (i.e. increasing energy costs, growing awareness, development of partnerships), as by dedicated policy measures, regulations and financial solutions. Interestingly the list of drivers is similar in many countries, but the leveraging success factors and the leading barriers are diverse.","[Bertoldi, Paolo] EC, JRC, Rome, Italy; [Boza-Kiss, Benigna] CEU, 3CSEP, GDI, Budapest, Hungary",Central European University,"Boza-Kiss, B (通讯作者)，CEU, 3CSEP, GDI, Budapest, Hungary.",benigna@greendependent.org,"bertoldi, Paolo/AAT-6177-2020","Boza-Kiss, Benigna/0000-0003-4005-2481",,,,,42,85,86,2,44,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2017,107.0,,,,,,345,355,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.04.023,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FA0WU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405158200032,0

We show that TML and RML estimators are solutions to a cubic first-order condition in the autoregressive parameter. Furthermore, in finite samples both likelihood estimators might lead to a negative estimate of the variance of the individual-specific effects. We consider different approaches taking into account the non-negativity restriction for the variance. We show that these approaches may lead to a solution different from the unique global unconstrained maximum. In an extensive Monte Carlo study we find that this issue is non-negligible for small values of T and that different approaches might lead to different finite sample properties. Furthermore, we find that the Likelihood Ratio statistic provides size control in small samples, albeit with low power due to the flatness of the log-likelihood function. We illustrate these issues modelling US state level unemployment dynamics.","[Bun, Maurice J.

However, whilst calls for greater energy justice have grown, fleeting attention has been paid to the role and agency of the very people at the heart of this agenda. Clearly, given the increasing prevalence of local energy initiatives, such projects warrant more sustained focus both to explore how energy justice is constructed between settings and to prompt greater consideration of its associated outcomes. This paper seeks to address this gap by using energy justice to assess local ownership of small scale energy generation through a study of the community energy sector in Wales. In so doing, it aids greater understanding of the energy equity dimension, understood in terms of accessibility and affordability, of the energy trilemma. From a conceptual standpoint, the research examines how energy justice is negotiated and contested at community-scale through a focus on issues of distributive and procedural justice. From a policy standpoint, the research shows that community energy is often involved in a wide range of local objectives and directs attention to how best to support such initiatives to further stimulate local action and deliver more widespread equity gains.","[Forman, Alister] Cardiff Univ, Sustainable Places Res Inst, 33 Pk Pl, Cardiff CF10 3BA, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University,"Forman, A (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Sustainable Places Res Inst, 33 Pk Pl, Cardiff CF10 3BA, S Glam, Wales.",FormanAK@cardiff.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J500197/1]; Welsh Government; Economic and Social Research Council [1368238] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Welsh Government; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This research was conducted as part of a three-year PhD award collaboratively funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (Grant number: ES/J500197/1) and Welsh Government.

The results show that the networks are expanding to include more and more countries and relationships, and scale of the networks is larger than ever. A tripartite confrontational renewable energy trading system has been forming and is strengthening. Europe, the USA, China and other Asian countries are the main players, and China has overtaken the USA and Europe as the leading player. Inequality and 'small-world' characteristics appear in renewable energy trade. Solar energy trade presents a triadic community structure with Europe, the USA and China as the dominant players, while hydro energy trade presents a smaller and more dispersed structure. The core periphery structure strongly suggests a trade dependency between hubs and peripheral elements in renewable energy trade.

To illustrate the identification issues, we consider the Vietnam War draft risk as instrument either for veteran status or education to evaluate the effects of these variables on labour market and health outcomes.

Hydraulic fracturing technology, or fracking, as well as new directional drilling techniques, played key roles in this shale gas revolution, by allowing for extraction of natural gas from previously unviable shale resources. Although hydraulic fracturing technology had been around for decades, it only recently became commercially attractive for large-scale implementation. As the production of shale gas rapidly increased in the US over the past decade, the wellhead price of natural gas dropped substantially. In this paper we express the relationship between wellhead price and cumulative natural gas output in terms of an experience curve, and obtain a learning rate of 13% for the industry using hydraulic fracturing technology. This learning rate represents a measure for the know-how and skills accumulated thus far by the US shale gas industry. The use of experience curves for renewable energy options such as solar and wind power has allowed analysts, practitioners, and policy makers to assess potential price reductions, and underlying cost decreases, for these technologies in the future. The reasons for price reductions of hydraulic fracturing are fundamentally different from those behind renewable energy technologies hence they cannot be directly compared and hydraulic fracturing may soon reach, or maybe has already attained, a lower bound for further price reductions, for instance as a result of its water requirements or environmental footprint. Yet, understanding learning-by-doing phenomena as expressed by an industry-wide experience curve for shale gas production can be useful for strategic planning in the gas sector, as well as assist environmental policy design, and serve more broadly as input for projections of energy system developments.","[Fukui, Rokuhei; Greenfield, Carl; Pogue, Katie; van der Zwaan, Bob] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Adv Int Studies, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [van der Zwaan, Bob] Energy Res Ctr Netherlands, Policy Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van der Zwaan, Bob] Univ Amsterdam, Fac Sci, Vant Hoff Inst Mol Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Johns Hopkins University; University of Amsterdam,"van der Zwaan, B (通讯作者)，Energy Res Ctr Netherlands, Policy Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",vanderzwaan@ecn.nl,"van der Zwaan, Bob CC/F-4070-2015",,,,,,23,30,34,3,38,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUN,2017,105.0,,,,,,263,268,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.02.027,0.0,,,6,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ET8EY,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000400532900026,0

Government financial support present within previous policy regimes was reduced and private industry was enlisted to provide finance, delivery mechanisms and management schemes for national domestic low carbon retrofit. Consequently, the Energy Efficiency Retrofit Services (EERS) sector needed to grow capacity and deliver retrofit at a larger scale. This research focuses on assessing the present EERS sector industry and its strategy to increase retrofit activity. This paper provides findings from on the ground interviews with UK EERS sector practitioners with relation to their experience of working with the Green Deal, and also their suggested strategies progressing forward now the Green Deal is no longer operational. Key findings suggest that UK EERS sector practitioners were unprepared to professionally deal with the expectation of the Green Deal, in terms of business administration and also dealing with the policy itself. Moving forward an emphasis is suggested which focused on training, to enable an increase in EERS sector capabilities, and to also enable an improvement of the quality and variety of work completed. Additionally, findings detail the requirement for enhanced communication between clients and policy administrators, to increase clarity in policy implementation and stakeholder expectation.","[Gooding, Luke; Gul, Mehreen S.] Heriot Watt Univ, Royal Acad Engn, Ctr Excellence Sustainable Bldg Design, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",Heriot Watt University,"Gooding, L (通讯作者)，Heriot Watt Univ, Royal Acad Engn, Ctr Excellence Sustainable Bldg Design, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",lmg31@hw.ac.uk,,"Gul, Mehreen/0000-0002-9118-4946",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [1428927] Funding Source: researchfish,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),,,57,17,18,3,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUN,2017,105.0,,,,,,173,182,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.02.042,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ET8EY,,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000400532900017,0

We can reveal how this is emerging in practice due to the significant uptake of solar photovoltaics (solar PV) and now battery storage in Perth, Australia. The high cost of electricity, high radiant energy levels and easy access to cheap Chinese technology, has led to dramatic buying during Perth's recent boomtown years. The traditional uni-directional power system is rapidly disrupting and this paper assesses where this may lead and what it means for the grid. Results of detailed monitoring in a solar powered house along with the impact of a battery storage system show the impact on the traditional grid is substantial but it will still be needed and must therefore adapt to the new distributed, bi-directional energy system. Surveys and price trajectories reveal how the trends to solar power storage will continue and how a citizen utility paradigm will emerge as the future grid building block using new blockchain support systems. Responses from utilities are then see to be fight, flight or innovate.","[Green, Jemma; Newman, Peter] Curtin Univ, Sustainabil Policy Inst, Bldg 209,Level 1, Bentley, WA 6845, Australia",Curtin University,"Green, J (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Sustainabil Policy Inst, Bldg 209,Level 1, Bentley, WA 6845, Australia.",jemma.green@curtin.edu.au,,"Newman, Peter/0000-0002-8668-2764",CRC; CSIRO; West Australian Government,"CRC(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme); CSIRO(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)); West Australian Government","Funding for this research was provided by the CRC for Low Carbon Living RP2006, with additional funding supplied by CSIRO and the West Australian Government.

The second is intentional sorting, where people do consider partisanship directly. We argue that the accumulating political biases visible in many neighborhoods can be the effect of some mixture of these two mechanisms. Because residential relocation often involves practical constraints and neighborhood racial composition is more important than partisanship, there is less partisan segregation across the USA than there could be based on residential preference alone.","[Gimpel, James G.] Univ Maryland, Dept Govt, 3140 Tydings Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Hui, Iris] Stanford Univ, Bill Lane Ctr Amer West, 473 Via Ortega,First Floor, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Stanford University,"Gimpel, JG (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Govt, 3140 Tydings Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",jgimpel@umd.edu; iris.s.hui@gmail.com,,,,,,,81,20,28,1,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

However there are several reasons why the Report cannot be regarded as having established these claims, mainly to do with the very few sources referred to on the crucial cost issues, the problems evident in those sources, and difficulties encountered when investment sums allocated to various sectors are examined. An exploration of the possible investment required by the renewable energy sector indicates that the costs associated with achieving desired emissions targets would be very high. This strengthens the case that effective policies for dealing with climate and other global problems cannot be achieved unless there is transition from consumer societies committed to affluence and growth.","[Trainer, Ted] 54 Dryandra St, Wadalba, NSW 2259, Australia",,"Trainer, T (通讯作者)，54 Dryandra St, Wadalba, NSW 2259, Australia.",tedtrainertsw@gmail.com,,,,,,,34,8,8,2,33,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2017,104.0,,,,,,214,220,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.01.047,0.0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP7HS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397549500021,0

The procedure first transforms multiple-threshold detection to a regression variable selection problem, and then employs a group orthogonal greedy algorithm to obtain the threshold estimates. Desirable theoretical results are derived to lend support to the proposed methodology. Simulation experiments are conducted to illustrate the empirical performances of the method.

However, its construction is a learning-by-doing process, and needs consistent regulatory updates in order to deliver optimal effects. This paper uses the event study method to assess the impacts of different policy adjustments on the EUA returns in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) since 2005. Comparing to existing studies that focus on the impact of a single policy, this paper provides a complementary reference on if and to what extent policy adjustments can impact the carbon prices by classifying all regulatory update events into six categories. Its key findings are as follows. First, aggregate impacts of total 50 events studied are low while impacts of events having underlying negative impacts are higher than those having underlying positive impacts. Second, 24 events have significant impacts on EUA returns and are coherent to their theoretical impacts (except one event). Third, events having negligible impact on EUA returns are those that are announced not for the first time or those having no impact on CO2 quotas supply and demand. Finally, there are different impact patterns: some events have different impacts on short-end and long-end carbon prices.","[Fan, Ying] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Jia, Jun-Jun; Xu, Jin-Hua] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Management, Anhua 230026, Peoples R China; [Jia, Jun-Jun; Xu, Jin-Hua] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Policy & Management, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xin] IDDRI, Sci Po 27 rue St Guillaume, F-75337 Paris 07, France","Beihang University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; CAS Institutes of Science & Development","Xu, JH (通讯作者)，Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Management, Anhua 230026, Peoples R China.",xujinhua111@l63.com,"Xu, Jin-Hua/AFR-0895-2022","Xu, Jin-Hua/0000-0001-6663-2105; Jia, Jun-Jun/0000-0002-5461-234X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71133005, 71673266, 71303229]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [9152019]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation),"Supports from the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 71133005, No. 71673266, No. 71303229 and Beijing Natural Science Foundation under Grant No. 9152019 are acknowledged.

In this paper, we derive single-factor technical energy efficiency (abbreviated as energy efficiency) in China from multi-factor efficiency estimated by means of a translog production function and a stochastic frontier model on the basis of panel data on 29 Chinese provinces over the period 2003-2011. We find that average energy efficiency has been increasing over the research period and that the provinces with the highest energy efficiency are at the east coast and the ones with the lowest in the west, with an intermediate corridor in between. In the analysis of the determinants of energy efficiency by means of a spatial Durbin error model both factors in the own province and in first-order neighboring provinces are considered. Per capita income in the own province has a positive effect. Furthermore, foreign direct investment and population density in the own province and in neighboring provinces have positive effects, whereas the share of state-owned enterprises in Gross Provincial Product in the own province and in neighboring provinces has negative effects. From the analysis it follows that inflow of foreign direct investment and reform of state-owned enterprises are important policy handles.","[Jiang, Lei] Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Lei; Folmer, Henk] Univ Groningen, Dept Econ Geog, Fac Spatial Sci, Landleven 1, NL-9747 AD Groningen, Netherlands; [Folmer, Henk] Northwest A&F Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Coll Econ & Management, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Ji, Minhe] East China Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Tang, Jianjun] Queens Univ Belfast, Ctr Publ Hlth, Belfast BT12 6BJ, Antrim, North Ireland",Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics; University of Groningen; Northwest A&F University - China; East China Normal University; Queens University Belfast,"Jiang, L (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.;Jiang, L (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Dept Econ Geog, Fac Spatial Sci, Landleven 1, NL-9747 AD Groningen, Netherlands.",L.Jiang@rug.nl,"Jianjun, Tang/AAF-6942-2019; Zhao, YiAn/JFK-5881-2023; jiang, lei/IWE-1124-2023","Jianjun, Tang/0000-0002-6994-2093;",Medical Research Council [MC_CF023241] Funding Source: researchfish,Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),,,98,34,37,4,44,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The paper argues that the project embodies a particular, engineering-heavy approach to water management; that, even so, it poses fundamental challenges to existing regional structures of governance; and that it promises continuing detrimental environmental impacts in source regions even as it invites similar future interventions in China's hydrological environment.","[Webber, Michael] Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Crow-Miller, Britt] Arizona State Univ, Sch Future Innovat Soc, Tempe, AZ USA; [Rogers, Sarah] Univ Melbourne, Sidney Myer Asia Ctr, Ctr Contemporary Chinese Studies, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of Melbourne,"Webber, M (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",mjwebber@unimelb.edu.au; rogerssm@unimelb.edu.au,,,Australian Research Council [DP170104138],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),This work was supported by the Australian Research Council [Discovery Project number DP170104138].,,103,61,66,12,105,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

By considering biomass and carbon-free energy sources along with fossil fuels, we are able to shed light on the effects of past and present energy transitions on CO2 emissions. We find that at low levels of income per capita, fuel switching from biomass to fossil fuels is the main contributing factor to emissions growth. As income levels increase, scale effects, especially income effects, become dominant. Technological change proves to be the main offsetting factor in the long run. Particularly in the last decades, technological change and fuel switching have become important contributors to the decrease in emissions in Europe. Our results also contrast the differentiated historical paths of CO2 emissions taken by these countries.","[Henriques, Sofia Teives] Lund Univ, Dept Econ Hist, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Borowiecki, Karol J.] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, Odense, Denmark",Lund University; University of Southern Denmark,"Henriques, ST (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ Hist, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",sofiathenriques@gmail.com; kjb@sam.sdu.dk,"Teives Henriques, Sofia/HNT-0686-2023; Borowiecki, Karol J./ABE-1387-2021","Teives Henriques, Sofia/0000-0002-3175-8370; Borowiecki, Karol J./0000-0003-4959-181X",Carlsberg Foundation,Carlsberg Foundation(Carlsberg Foundation),"We thank Zeus Guevara, Luis Oliveira and Paul Sharp for helpful suggestions and Ben Gales for providing us with data for the Netherlands.

Simulated results reveal that renewable energy promotion policy underlies the necessity for capacity expansion of inter-or intra-regional power transmission lines in Japan in order to realize economical power system operation.

Zoning ordinances are the most common growth control policy at the local level and are hypothesized to be one of the most important factors in determining the likelihood of residential development. We investigate the role of minimum lot size zoning by taking advantage of plausibly exogenous changes in zoning policies that altered the developable status of some rural land parcels in an exurban county of Ohio. A discrete-choice econometric model of land use conversion is estimated with a parcel-level temporal dataset, using conditional maximum likelihood estimation to account for the panel structure of the data and fixed effects to control for unobserved heterogeneity. Empirical evidence indicates that minimum lot size zoning has a negative effect on the likelihood of rural land conversion and that this effect is large in magnitude. Specifically, we find that a parcel that is subject to a minimum lot size zoning is between 4.4 and 6.4% less likely to be converted to residential land use. In comparison, results from a pooled model, in which the unobserved heterogeneity is left uncontrolled, suggest that minimum lot size zoning has a relatively small negative effect on the conversion probability of undeveloped land parcels. Thus, estimates that do not control for unobserved heterogeneity are likely biased toward zero.","[Carrion-Flores, Carmen] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, POB 6000, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA; [Irwin, Elena G.] Ohio State Univ, Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Carrión-Flores, C (通讯作者)，SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, POB 6000, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.",ccarrion@binghamton.edu,,"Carrion-Flores, Carmen/0000-0001-6794-2260; Irwin, Elena/0000-0001-7908-5964",,,,,26,6,8,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Regional Studies. The European Union promotes development strategies aimed at producing growth with a strong emphasis on job creation and poverty reduction'. However, whether the economic conditions in place in European Union regions are ideal for the generation of high- and low-skilled employment and labour market inclusion is unclear. This paper assesses how the key factors behind European Union growth strategies - infrastructure, human capital, innovation, quality of government - condition employment generation and labour market exclusion in European regions. The findings indicate that the dynamics of employment and social exclusion vary depending on the conditions in place in a region. While higher innovation and education contribute to overall employment generation in some regional contexts, low-skilled employment grows the most in regions with a better quality of government. Regional public institutions, together with the endowment of human capital, emerge as the main factors for the reduction of labour market exclusion - particularly in the less developed regions - and the promotion of inclusive employment growth across Europe.","[Di Cataldo, Marco; Rodriguez-Pose, Andres] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Rodríguez-Pose, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England.",m.di-cataldo@lse.ac.uk; a.rodriguez-pose@lse.ac.uk,"Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/B-8746-2008; Di Cataldo, Marco/AAK-8373-2020","Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/0000-0002-8041-0856; Di Cataldo, Marco/0000-0002-2808-1776",European Research Council under the European Union [269868]; European Research Council (ERC) [269868] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),This research was made possible thanks to the financial support of the European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)/ERC [grant agreement number 269868].,,95,44,46,1,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

This paper study statistical data gathered from wind turbines located on the territory of the Republic of Poland. The research is aimed to construct the stochastic model that predicts the change of wind speed with time. Purpose. The purpose of this work is to find the optimal distribution for the approximation of available statistical data on wind speed. Methods. We consider four distributions of a random variable: Log-Normal, Weibull, Gamma and Beta. In order to evaluate the parameters of distributions we use method of maximum likelihood. To assess the the results of approximation we use a quantile-quantile plot. Results. All the considered distributions properly approximate the available data. The Weibull distribution shows the best results for the extreme values of the wind speed. Conclusions. The results of the analysis are consistent with the common practice of using the Weibull distribution for wind speed modeling. In the future we plan to compare the results obtained with a much larger data set as well as to build a stochastic model of the evolution of the wind speed depending on time.","[Gevorkyan, Migran N.; Demidova, Anastasiya V.; Zaryadov, Ivan S.; Korolkova, Anna V.; Kulyabov, Dmitry S.; Sevastianov, Leonid A.] RUDN Univ, Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, Dept Appl Probabil & Informat, 6 Miklukho Maldaya Str, Moscow 117198, Russia; [Zaryadov, Ivan S.] IPI FRC CSC RAS, FRC CSC RAS, Inst Informat Problems, 44-2 Vavilova Str, Moscow 119333, Russia; [Sobolewski, Robert A.] Bialystok Tech Univ, Dept Power Engn Foton & Lighting Technol, 45D Wiejska Str, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland; [Kulyabov, Dmitry S.] Joint Inst Nucl Res, Lab Informat Technol, 6 Joliot Curie, Dubna 141980, Moscow Region, Russia; [Sevastianov, Leonid A.] Joint Inst Nucl Res, Bogoliubov Lab Theoret Phys, 6 Joliot Curie, Dubna 141980, Moscow Region, Russia",Peoples Friendship University of Russia; Federal Research Center Computer Science & Control of RAS; Institute of Informatics Problems of Russian Academy of Sciences; Bialystok University of Technology; Joint Institute for Nuclear Research - Russia; Joint Institute for Nuclear Research - Russia,"Gevorkyan, MN (通讯作者)，RUDN Univ, Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, Dept Appl Probabil & Informat, 6 Miklukho Maldaya Str, Moscow 117198, Russia.",gevorkyan_mn@rudn.university; demidova_av@rudn.university; zaryadov_is@rudn.university; r.sobolewski@pb.edu.pl; korolkova_av@rudn.university; kulyabov_ds@rudn.university; sevastianov_la@rudn.university,"Korolkova, Anna/I-3191-2013; Demidova, Anastasia/AAD-2214-2019; Zaryadov, Ivan S./N-3489-2019; Kulyabov, Dmitry Sergeevich/I-3183-2013; Gevorkyan, Migran/E-9214-2016; Sevastianov, Leonid A/B-8497-2016; Korolkova, Anna/ABA-7740-2021; Demidova, Tatiana/AAD-7266-2019; Zaryadov, Ivan/B-8154-2018","Korolkova, Anna/0000-0001-7141-7610; Demidova, Anastasia/0000-0003-1000-9650; Zaryadov, Ivan S./0000-0002-7909-6396; Kulyabov, Dmitry Sergeevich/0000-0002-0877-7063; Gevorkyan, Migran/0000-0002-4834-4895; Demidova, Tatiana/0000-0001-6076-1619; Zaryadov, Ivan/0000-0002-7909-6396; Sobolewski, Robert/0000-0003-3559-6644",,,,,15,1,1,0,12,EUROPEAN COUNCIL MODELLING & SIMULATION,NOTTINGHAM,"SCHOOL COMPUTING & MATHEMATICS, NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV, BURTON STREET, NOTTINGHAM, NG1 4BU, ENGLAND",,,978-0-9932440-4-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,622,627,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Economics; Engineering, Industrial",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Engineering,BH9XI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404420000092,0

The main priorities were the creation of new jobs (increase in demand for work), education and training for the labour market (improving the quality of job offers). The main labour market problems are mainly long-term youth unemployment, unemployment by gender and regional disparities. The Lisbon Strategy has contributed significantly to the increase of employment in the Slovak Republic. The one of whose goals was to achieve a 70 % employment rate. Achieving a high level of employment is conditional on a successful implementation of the strategy as a whole, yet it is important to highlight a number of key actions that can significantly affect the specific area of employment. The aim of the paper is comparison of unemployment by chosen age group of the population at the individual districts of Slovakia in 2004, 2009 and 2015 and the subsequent identification of possible impacts of the global economic crisis on the development of unemployment of these groups in the context of the current economic development in Slovakia. The object of the research was specific unemployment rates of men and women in the chosen age groups in the 79 districts of Slovakia. Mathematical and statistical methods, such as cluster analysis, have been used for the study. The results of cluster analysis show differences between the districts of Slovakia.","[Greganova, Radomira Hornyak; Orszaghova, Dana] Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Math, Fac Econ & Management, Trieda Andreja Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia; [Pietrikova, Miriam] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Trieda Andreja Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Gregánová, RH (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Math, Fac Econ & Management, Trieda Andreja Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",radomira.greganova@uniag.sk; dana.orszaghova@uniag.sk; miriam.piertikova@uniag.sk,"Hornyak Greganova, Radomira/ABA-8584-2021","Hornyak Greganova, Radomira/0000-0001-7433-2014","VEGA [1/0806/15, 1/0930/15]",VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),The paper was financially supported by the scientific grant projects VEGA 1/0806/15: Financial markets and access to credit in agricultural sector and VEGA 1/0930/15: Impact of Agricultural Subsidies on Productivity of Farms and Food Security.,,20,3,3,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,701,708,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059201025,0

It is necessary to bring the significance of liquidity management also to small businesses' attention. Liquidity constitutes an ability of a business to meet its short-term obligations whereas insolvency is not always caused by a business itself but it can also be a consequence of insufficient liquidity of subjects in its environment. The submitted paper Significance of liquidity management in tourism businesses in the era of globalization examines the mutual interrelation between liquidity and selected activity ratios, namely the average settlement period for debtors and average settlement period for creditors. Within the scope of liquidity ratios, three ratios are calculated - the cash ratio, quick ratio and current ratio. Appropriate liquidity management is to ensure an adequate relation between business's liquidity and activity ratios. The aim of the submitted paper is to verify the relationship between financial liquidity and activity ratios and identify strength of their mutual relationship by means of coefficients of correlation. The sample consists of 72 micro-enterprises operating in tourism (SK NACE 55 - Accommodation) based in the Presov municipality. The input data for the sample compilation come from the database of the portal indexpodnikatela.sk . The results of the realized research can help to identify potential problems resulting from liquidity management. In the conclusion, some possible areas of solutions to the identified problems are outlined.","[Hiadlovsky, Vladimir; Gundova, Petra; Rybovicova, Ivana; Vinczeova, Miroslava] Univ Mateja Bela, Ekon Fak, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Gundová, P (通讯作者)，Univ Mateja Bela, Ekon Fak, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia.",vladimir.hiadlovsky@umb.sk; petra.gundova@umb.sk; ivana.rybovicova@umb.sk; miroslava.vinczeova@umb.sk,"Gundova, Petra/HKO-6336-2023",,,,,,22,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,661,668,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059201020,0

How to achieve this goal, though, is far from clear. Specifically, the temporal spacing between adjacent births has been shown to affect educational outcomes. While many of these studies have produced substantial and statistically significant results, these results have been relatively narrow in their application due to data limitations. Using Colorado birth certificates matched to schooling outcomes, we investigate the relationship between birth spacing and educational attainment. We instrument birth spacing with a previous pregnancy that did not result in a live birth. We find no overall effect of spacing on either the first or second children's grade 3-10 test scores. Stratifying by the sexes of the children, we find that when the first child is a boy and the second a girl, an extra year of spacing increases the first child's math, reading, and writing test scores by 0.07-0.08 SD, while there is no impact on the second child. This is the first study to do such an analysis using matched large-scale birth and elementary to high school administrative data, and to leverage a very large dataset to stratify our results by the sexes of the children.","[Hill, Elaine L.] Univ Rochester, Sch Med & Dent, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, 601 Elmwood Ave, Rochester, NY 14642 USA; [Slusky, David J.

Preparing financial statements under IFRS make them more transparent and suitable for analysis by potential foreign lenders and investors who can provide the company with the capital it needs for further development. This adds to the already strong scientific and practical interest in improving the conceptual and methodological framework of analysis of financial statements prepared under IFRS. The improvements should increase the information value of the analysis results that gives a more accurate idea of the company's financial performance and financial standing, thus enabling interested users of analytical financial information (potential lenders and investors in the first place) to make management decisions. To solve the above problem, the authors systematize international and Russian practices and propose an original conceptual approach to analyzing financial statements prepared under IFRS that considerably improves the results of such analysis as regards the financial performance and financial position of companies. The approach proposes breaking down the analysis procedure into four consecutive stages: preparatory stage, interpretation, calculations and analysis, and forecasting.","[Ilysheva, Nina; Krylov, Sergey] Ural Fed Univ, Acad Dept Accounting Anal & Audit, Mira 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia",Ural Federal University,"Krylov, S (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, Acad Dept Accounting Anal & Audit, Mira 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia.",19016708@rambler.ru; zali6770@yandex.ru,"Krylov, Sergey Ivanovich/C-1814-2013",,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,764,770,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059201033,0

The purpose of the study is in the scientific substantiation of Human Capital, as well as identifying the major trends in the qualitative transformation of Human Capital in the context of globalization. The transformational model developed and proposed explains at theoretical level that investment aimed at developing a specific unit of human resource, while individual being involved in the labor process, contributes to the transition of potential into capital, turning a simple benefit into capital one. Visibly demonstrating mutual conversion of money into knowledge, then the knowledge into money, the transformation model allows us to evaluate the monetary value of accumulated human assets, commensurate costs of the ability in the future to generate income. The undoubted advantage of the author's model is also represented by the visualized step-bystep mechanism of circulation of Human Capital and its reproduction in conditions of globalization.","[Khabibullina, Zenfira] Kazan Cooperat Inst, Fac Econ, Ershova 58, Kazan 420081, Russia",,"Khabibullina, Z (通讯作者)，Kazan Cooperat Inst, Fac Econ, Ershova 58, Kazan 420081, Russia.",ruzen7@mail.ru,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,898,905,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059201050,0

The positive impacts of ICT on productivity, economic growth and increasing quality of life are commonly recognized. But in addition to those positive outcomes, new threats are emerging due to unequal access to information (e.g. deepening of existing or emergence of new social and economic inequalities). Actions related to the use of ICT taken by the state administration at all levels, are important for both the achievement of potential benefits and counteracting potential threats. A comprehensive ICT policy should address a number of issues related to the development, management and integration of new technologies in all possible areas. In the case of European Union Members the national ICT policy depends on the recommendation concerning the development of the information society and wider use of ICT prepared at EU level. The aim of this article is to analyze EU strategies and documents dealing with the development of the information society and the widespread application of ICT using the framework proposed by Jorgenson & Vu (2016).

Although it is generally agreed that spillovers are present in models that explain government expenditures, their type-whether endogenous, exogenous or residual-and sign-whether positive or negative-remain ambiguous. In most cases, a subjective process is used to select the type of spatial regression model used in analysis, with mixed results. Per capita expenditures of ten subprogrammes (Security, Housing, Welfare, Environment, Social services, Employment promotion, Health, Education, Culture and Sport) are analysed for all Spanish municipalities with more than 5000 inhabitants in the 2010-2012 period. A Spatial Seemingly Unrelated Regression methodology in a panel framework is used to incorporate correlation between different subprogrammes and spatial dependence. Our results show that the three types of spatial effects are present.

The decrease in employment in agriculture is a result of technological progress, changes in individual family preferences and low income in comparison to other sectors of economy. In Slovakia also history of large farms plays an important role. In countries with dominating small family farms the decrease in employment is significantly lower than in countries with large farms.

It translates these strategies into tie formations: explorative tie formation produces structural holes as a source of good ideas, while exploitative tie formation closes structural holes to facilitate the mobilization of resources to move ideas into products. Using the example of co-inventors in information and communication technology in Research Triangle region during the dot-com bubble, explorative tie formation during the bubble and exploitative tie formations after its burst were expected. Stochastic actor-oriented models did not clearly support our assumptions. It was found that the emergence of venture capital led to a large variance in connection patterns during the bubble, probably resulting from overlapping institutional effects.

Economic strategy of the transport organization - from defining its mission, developing business profile and throughout the life-cycle period - should be focused on maintaining a competitive advantage, preventing the threat of bankruptcy, ensuring the long-term prosperity in globalization context. Because of limited resources the choice of main strategic aims, providing the greatest productivity of their use, is a fundamental management decision. Currently the concept of value-based management is being widespread which considers as a main strategic goal of the commercial organization in the process of making ongoing and strategic decisions - increase the company's value instead of maximizing profits.

In order to improve the quality of life of the population, all countries have to positively influence these indicators. This increases the living standards of the population and greater satisfaction with their life. However, in the present world the quality of life indicators are in many ways influenced by globalization. Besides a number of positives, globalization also brings negatives in the form of a deterioration in the security situation, increased crime, threats of terrorism, and so on. All these security threats negatively affect not only the quality of life of the population, but they influence also other indicators of quality of life. The aim of the paper is to analyse the development of selected indicators of the quality of life of the population in selected European Union countries with a focus on security.

However, in automotive part industry, many parts are produced in sequential flow shop containing more than one machines in each production stage. This circumstance cannot apply the existing method of flow shop scheduling. The objective of this research is to schedule the production process of automotive parts. The feature production is hybrid flow shop which consists of two-stages. In each stage, there are several manufacturing machines and each machine can produce more than one product. Thus, production scheduling is a complex problem. This paper, therefore, develops mathematical model to solve the hybrid flow shop production scheduling under different constraints of each machine. The setup time and production time of each machine can be different for each part.

Distributional models for these bot session features were developed using regression analysis and validated through graphical comparisons of histograms for the empirical data and simulated values. As a result, interarrival times of bot sessions and interarrival times of requests in bot sessions were modeled by a Weibull and a Pareto distribution, respectively, and the numbers of requests in session were modeled by a function being a combination of a sigmoid and exponential distributions.

So the competitiveness is often about price decreasing. Low prices implies decreasing price level and it causes deflation. Deflation was not common part of economics during several last decades. The central banks are alarmed by this,new situation. They try to fight with this new situation by standard monetary policy instruments. But it is not very effective fight. We have to ask: Why the price level decrease. Is the reason at the side of competitiveness (companies price strategies) or is the worldwide production too high (AS moves right) or is it the problem of low consumers spendings (for example thanks to unemployement, AD moves left)?

In addition, an important development in the Nordic market relates to increasing thrust on household solar photo-voltaic (PV) panels. In view of the potential for interaction between dynamic pricing-driven and PV generation-driven load changes, an analysis of the combined effects in relation to the system profile is important, not least because this can affect the nature of benefits to households and to the grid. Using a unique and detailed dataset on household electricity consumption, in combination with simulated solar panel micro-generation data, these aspects are explored here using a demand framework drawn from the previous literature. Our findings indicate that even with low price responsiveness, household response to dynamic pricing can lead to load changes with sizeable benefits. In addition, the introduction of PV panels appear to be beneficial to the electric grid, largely due to the time pattern of winter PV generation. Overall, our findings provide tentative support to the hypothesis that dynamic pricing, by incentivizing households to provide demand response at appropriate times, can aid in integration of renewables.","[Krishnamurthy, Chandra Kiran B.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Forest Econ, Umea, Sweden; [Krishnamurthy, Chandra Kiran B.; Vesterberg, Mattias] CERE, Umea, Sweden; [Vesterberg, Mattias] Umea Univ, Dept Econ, USBE, Umea, Sweden; [Book, Herman; Lindfors, Anders V.] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Helsinki, Finland; [Svento, Rauli] Oulu Univ, Oulu Business Sch, Dept Econ, Oulu, Finland",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Umea University; Finnish Meteorological Institute; University of Oulu,"Krishnamurthy, CKB (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Forest Econ, Umea, Sweden.",chandra.kiran@slu.se; mattias.vesterberg@umu.se; herman.book@fmi.fi; anderslindfors@fmi.fi; rauli.svento@oulu.fi,"Lindfors, Anders Vilhelm/C-6727-2012","Lindfors, Anders Vilhelm/0000-0001-9305-0864; Krishnamurthy, Chandra Kiran/0000-0002-9494-6467",Academy of Finland Strategic Research Council Project BC-DC [AKA292854]; Academy of Finland Project Regulation and Dynamic Pricing for Energy Systems REDYFLEZ [288957]; Swedish Enegy Agency's Research and Innovation Program SamspEL [44340-1]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [288957] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),Academy of Finland Strategic Research Council Project BC-DC; Academy of Finland Project Regulation and Dynamic Pricing for Energy Systems REDYFLEZ; Swedish Enegy Agency's Research and Innovation Program SamspEL; Academy of Finland (AKA),This work was supported by the Academy of Finland Strategic Research Council Project BC-DC (AKA292854); the Academy of Finland Project Regulation and Dynamic Pricing for Energy Systems REDYFLEZ (288957); and by the Swedish Enegy Agency's Research and Innovation Program SamspEL (Grant no. 44340-1).

Effective tariff designs that incentivize electricity savings among consumers can contribute to fulfilling these goals. Prior research suggests that penalties are more effective in promoting behavior change, which can be explained by insights from behavioral economics: Loss aversion describes that people react more strongly to losses (penalties) than to rewards of the same magnitude and go greater lengths to avoid them. However, in markets where consumers freely choose their preferred tariff, it remains a major challenge to persuade consumers to voluntarily subscribe to penalizing tariffs. The present study employed a choice experiment using choice-based conjoint analysis to examine consumer preferences for electricity tariffs that apply a combination of rewards and/or penalties for electricity consumption. Results from a representative sample of Swiss electricity consumers show that consumers prefer tariffs that reward decreases in electricity consumption, rather than tariffs that penalize increases in consumption, but that tariffs combining rewards and penalties achieve substantial potential market acceptance.

By a simple two-period model of such system with banking and borrowing, we examine how emission reduction technological changes affect the cap in three cases (i.e. pure flow externality, pure stock externality and mixed externality), and identify the efficiency properties in such system with banking and borrowing. We show that the effects of technological changes on cap are negative in both pure flow and pure stock externality cases. In the mixed externality case, the effects are uncertain, which depend on the decayed rate of CO2 stock, the discounted rate and functions of marginal abatement costs and marginal damage. In general cases, the social optimum is not attainable via the cap-and-trade system, since firms sub-optimally distribute emissions across periods. In a particular case if the ratio of marginal damage in Period 1 to the discounted marginal damage in Period 2 is exactly equal to the decayed rate, the decentralized emissions of firms will lead to the social optimum. Finally, a hybrid quantity-price policy is proposed to rectify the paths of firms to be socially desirable with an effective quantity control.","[Jiang, Minxing; Zhu, Bangzhu] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci Technol, Sch Business, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Bangzhu] Jinan Univ, Sch Management, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wei, Yi-Ming] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Chevallier, Julien] IPAG Business Sch, IPAG Lab, 184 Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France; [He, Kaijian] Hunan Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Xiangtan 411201, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Jinan University; Beijing Institute of Technology; IPAG Business School; Hunan University of Science & Technology,"Zhu, BZ (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Informat Sci Technol, Sch Business, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Zhu, BZ (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Sch Management, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",wpzbz@126.com,"Jiang, Minxing/HLQ-5718-2023; Chevallier, Julien/AAY-9567-2020","Chevallier, Julien/0000-0002-4423-9502; He, Kaijian/0000-0001-8097-4435","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71771105, 71473180, 71303076, 71673083, 71671013]; Guangdong Young Zhujiang Scholar (Yue Jiaoshi) [[2016]95]; Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Talents of Guangdong [2014A030306031]; Education Ministry of China [16YJC790026]; Guangdong key base of humanities and social science Enterprise Development Research Institute","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangdong Young Zhujiang Scholar (Yue Jiaoshi); Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Talents of Guangdong; Education Ministry of China(Ministry of Education, China); Guangdong key base of humanities and social science Enterprise Development Research Institute","Our heartfelt thanks should also be given to the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (71771105, 71473180, 71303076, 71673083, and 71671013), Guangdong Young Zhujiang Scholar (Yue Jiaoshi [2016]95), Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Talents of Guangdong (2014A030306031), Education Ministry of China (No. 16YJC790026), and Guangdong key base of humanities and social science Enterprise Development Research Institute for funding supports.",,28,11,12,3,64,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2018,122.0,,,,,,152,161,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.07.025,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GX2UX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447576700014,0

However, these studies pay little attention to interpreting the findings, and therefore, little is known about how and why households respond to energy prices. This paper provide an example of an interpretation of the impact of energy prices on consumption from a social practice theoretical perspective. This paper investigates the impact of district heating price level on energy used for space heating and hot water by Danish households living in single-family detached houses. The results show a moderately negative effect of the price level on consumption, which is stronger in newer, presumably more energy-efficient, houses and for higher-income households. However, the effect varies across years, which suggests that the price responsiveness is more a matter of changing everyday practices (short-term response) than being able to afford energy improvements (long-term response). In a practice theoretical perspective, the results indicate that price differences have an impact on everyday practices, where for example the aspect of energy in everyday practices is perceived as more valuable to practitioners in expensive areas compared to cheaper areas, and that the meaning of price in practices is influenced by the social and material contexts.","[Hansen, Anders Rhiger] Aalborg Univ, Danish Bldg Res Inst, AC Meyers Voenge 15, DK-2450 Copenhagen SV, Denmark",Aalborg University,"Hansen, AR (通讯作者)，Aalborg Univ, Danish Bldg Res Inst, AC Meyers Voenge 15, DK-2450 Copenhagen SV, Denmark.",arh@sbi.aau.dk,"Hansen, Anders Rhiger/X-1855-2019; Hansen, Anders Rhiger/AAH-2605-2021","Hansen, Anders Rhiger/0000-0003-2771-062X;",Innovation Fund Denmark,Innovation Fund Denmark,"This research formed part of my Ph.D. dissertation as part of the UserTEC project (http://sbi.dk/usertec), which is financed by Innovation Fund Denmark.

At the regional level, industrial restructuring and industrial transfer from eastern China to western China have caused a significant difference in pollutant emissions among various cities. This paper analyzes per capita industrial pollutant emissions across 285 prefecture-level cities from 2003 to 2015, aiming to reveal how industrial transfer affects the formation of convergence clubs. Whether industrial pollutant emissions across heterogeneous cities converge to a unique steady-state equilibrium is first identified based on the concept of club convergence. Logit regression analysis is then applied to assess the effects of industrial transfer on the observed clubs. The log t-test highlights four convergence clubs for industrial SO2 emissions and three clubs for industrial soot emissions. The regression analysis results reveal that the effects of industrial transfer can lead to multiple steady-state equilibria, suggesting region-specific environmental policies and execution strategies. In addition, accelerating the development of clean energy technologies in emission-intense regions should be further emphasized.","[Liu, Chang; Li, Huaifeng; Wang, Lili] Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Hong, Tao] Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Dept Syst Engn & Engn Management, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA",Dongbei University of Finance & Economics; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Hong, T (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Dept Syst Engn & Engn Management, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",chang.liu2000@hotmail.com; hongtao01@gmail.com; lihuaifeng1277@126.com; wanglili9347@outlook.com,"wang, lili/HDL-7210-2022",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673040, 71420107028]; Ministry of Education [15YJC790073]; Social Science Foundation [15ZDA011]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education; Social Science Foundation,"The authors acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71673040, 71420107028), Ministry of Education (15YJC790073), and Social Science Foundation (15ZDA011).",,44,86,89,6,89,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2018,121.0,,,,,,300,313,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.06.039,0.0,,,14,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV3HA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445983800031,0

Due to a dearth of associated engineering practices and business activities, there are currently no broadly viable business models for the large-scale deployment of CCUS technology. Evaluations at the business model level are essential to consider external factors, particularly for projects with a long industry chain and complex relationships among stakeholders, such as CCUS projects. This paper fills a gap in CCUS research by introducing four business models based on the different stakeholders involved in CCUS projects and their varying degrees of integration. Using Monte Carlo simulation, the distributions of return for each stakeholder under the four business models were obtained. The results show that the vertical integration model is the most appropriate choice for CCUS deployment in China during the early demonstration stages due to its lower interest rates and transaction costs. Based on the current cost level of CCUS, subsidy for storage is recommended in the early stage, and reasonable and stable carbon pricing policies (e.g., carbon tax) are conductive to large-scale deployment of CCUS in the long term.","[Yao, Xing] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Yao, Xing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci & Dev, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Zhong, Ping; Zhang, Xian] Minist Sci & Technol, Adm Ctr Chinas Agenda 21, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Lei] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Beihang University","Zhang, X (通讯作者)，Minist Sci & Technol, Adm Ctr Chinas Agenda 21, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China.;Zhu, L (通讯作者)，Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",zhangxian@acca21.org.cn; lions85509050@gmail.com,"Zhang, Xian/JJE-3540-2023","Zhang, Xian/0000-0002-5841-6899; Zhu, Lei/0000-0002-7501-4904","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673019, 71203008, 71690245, 71210005, 71503242, 71273253]; Clean Development Mechanism Fund [2014075]; Financial Roadmap for CCUS in China [2021502400005]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Clean Development Mechanism Fund; Financial Roadmap for CCUS in China,"The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Nos. 71673019, 71203008, 71690245, 71210005, 71503242, 71273253, the Clean Development Mechanism Fund (2014075), and the Financial Roadmap for CCUS in China (2021502400005).

At the same time, growing demand for energy globally is associated with an expansion of welfare. To avoid undesired environmental and social implications of energy developments in the long run, a systemic understanding of the dynamics promoting or preventing sustainable energy development is needed. Departing from Daly's steady state economics theory, this study conceptualizes a sustainable energy system using a systems thinking approach. Efficiency increase, the central element of Daly's theory, defined as the service/throughput ratio, is put in the center of a conceptual analysis of a sustainable energy system and is carefully scrutinized. Meadows' leverage points concept is used to facilitate an analysis of different policies that aim at promoting sustainable energy system development. This study concludes that energy policies always need to be explored as part of the broader causality structure into which they are embedded. Otherwise, their impacts on other variables in the system may be overlooked, such as in the case of efficiency increase, which is shown to have undesired side effects for the development of a sustainable energy system.","[Gladkykh, Ganna; Spittler, Nathalie; Diemer, Arnaud] Univ Clermont Auvergne, Clermont Ferrand, France; [Gladkykh, Ganna; Spittler, Nathalie; Davidsdottir, Brynhildur] Univ Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland",Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); University of Iceland,"Gladkykh, G (通讯作者)，50 Ave Pasteur, F-63400 Chamalieres, France.",ganna.gladkykh@uca.fr,,"Davidsdottir, Brynhildur/0000-0001-9783-9942; Spittler, Nathalie/0000-0003-3493-965X",European Union [675153]; Marie Curie Actions (MSCA) [675153] Funding Source: Marie Curie Actions (MSCA),European Union(European Union (EU)); Marie Curie Actions (MSCA)(Marie Curie Actions),This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No 675153.,,73,9,10,2,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2018,120.0,,,,,,121,131,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.070,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO6DC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440123300012,0

A better understanding of the key determinants of energy efficient retrofit investments in the residential sector is therefore crucial for the design of effective policies aimed at reducing energy demand and CO2 emissions. This article uses combined data from English Housing surveys and employs a probit model in order to investigate the dwelling-related and households characteristics influencing energy efficient retrofit investments in the English residential sector. The results show that couples with independent child(ren) living in detached or semi-detached houses built before 1990 and with a length of residence higher than 1 year are more likely to invest in retrofits measures; compared to households living in the North East region, households living in London are less likely to invest. While there is empirical evidence supporting the landlord-tenant problem, households that have taken out a mortgage are more likely to invest in energy efficient retrofit measures than outright owners. To maximise their impact and effectiveness, future energy efficiency policies should target specific household groups with the lowest rate of retrofit uptake.","[Trotta, Gianluca] Univ Vaasa, Fac Business Studies Econ & Business Law, Dept Econ, Econ, Wolffintie 34, Vaasa 65200, Finland",University of Vaasa,"Trotta, G (通讯作者)，Univ Vaasa, Fac Business Studies Econ & Business Law, Dept Econ, Econ, Wolffintie 34, Vaasa 65200, Finland.",Gianluca.Trotta@uva.fi,"Trotta, Gianluca/GOK-1321-2022","Trotta, Gianluca/0000-0003-0734-9857",Academy of Finland [Akatemia/Kalmi/2700041011],Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland),This work has been partially supported by the Academy of Finland under the project Grant Akatemia/Kalmi/2700041011.

To date, consumption based studies have either focused on households' overall use of electricity at the national or specific group level, or analyzed specific socio-spatial consumption shaping factors. Studies that followed the first approach can signal the magnitude of electricity consumption, analyze trends and explore the contribution of advancing various measures. Studies that followed the latter approach can be used as a base for advancing consumption behavioral changes based on specific circumstances. This manuscript integrates both approaches for the case of the state of Israel, it therefore allows examining the effect of different variables on electricity consumption of the entire population. The manuscript presents an analysis of electricity consumption of 30,000 households. By quantifying the overall use of electricity by households influenced by different socio-spatial shaping factors, the manuscript identifies the share of specific types of households and various lifestyles (e.g., young families, wealthy households) out of the overall national use of electricity. Such analysis can then support policy measures by aiming to the socio-spatial characteristics of specific types of households, which can contribute the most to advancing the overall national energy efficiency efforts and can also identify future scenarios of household electricity demand which can then be addressed in the future.","[Damari, Yuval; Kissinger, Meidad] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Geog & Environm Dev, Beer Sheva, Israel",Ben Gurion University,"Kissinger, M (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Geog & Environm Dev, Beer Sheva, Israel.",meidadk@bgu.ac.il,"Damari, Yuval/JAN-8430-2023","DAMARI, YUVAL/0009-0000-3623-9505",,,,,43,22,24,1,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2018,119.0,,,,,,51,58,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.010,0.0,,,15,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO0XY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439671200005,0

Some emerging research presents gas network decarbonisation options as a tractable alternative to 'all-electric' scenarios that use electric appliances to deliver the traditional gas services such as heating and cooking. However, there is some uncertainty as to the technical feasibility, cost and carbon emissions of gas network decarbonisation options. In response to this debate the Sustainable Gas Institute at Imperial College London has conducted a rigorous systematic review of the evidence surrounding gas network decarbonisation options. The study focuses on the technologies used to generate biomethane and hydrogen, and examines the technical potentials, economic costs and emissions associated with the full supply chains involved. The following summarises the main findings of this research. The report concludes that there are a number of options that could significantly decarbonise the gas network, and doing so would provide energy system flexibility utilising existing assets. However, these options will be more expensive than the existing gas system, and the GHG intensity of these options may vary significantly. In addition, more research is required, particularly in relation to the capabilities of existing pipework to transport hydrogen safely.","[Speirs, Jamie; Balcombe, Paul; Martin, Jeanne; Brandon, Nigel; Hawkes, Adam] Imperial Coll London, Sustainable Gas Inst, 11 Princes Gardens, London SW7 1NA, England; [Speirs, Jamie; Brandon, Nigel] Imperial Coll London, Royal Sch Mines, Dept Earth Sci & Engn, Prince Consort Rd, London SW7 2BP, England; [Balcombe, Paul; Johnson, Erin; Hawkes, Adam] Imperial Coll London, Dept Chem Engn, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England",Imperial College London; Imperial College London; Imperial College London,"Speirs, J (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll London, Sustainable Gas Inst, 11 Princes Gardens, London SW7 1NA, England.;Speirs, J (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll London, Royal Sch Mines, Dept Earth Sci & Engn, Prince Consort Rd, London SW7 2BP, England.",jamie.speirs@imperial.ac.uk,"Hawkes, Adam/F-6631-2012; Speirs, Jamie/ABD-8770-2020","Speirs, Jamie/0000-0002-6729-9831; Hawkes, Adam/0000-0001-9720-332X; , Paul/0000-0002-3490-0707",Royal Dutch Shell,Royal Dutch Shell(Royal Dutch Shell),The Sustainable Gas Institute is supported by funding from Royal Dutch Shell.,,63,67,70,0,40,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2018,118.0,,,,,,291,297,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.03.069,0.0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ1TF,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000435050000027,0

Firstly, we sets three scenarios: business as usual (BAU), policy scenario, and synergistic emission reduction (SER) scenario, which consider the influence of low-carbon building policies and emission factors (i.e. power and heat emission factor (PEF and HEF)). Then we develop an emission reduction potential model to assess the CO2 abatement potential of the building sector in 2016-2050. The results reveal that low-carbon policies of building sector in policy scenario can only slow down but not curb the CO2 emission completely. The CO2 emissions will reach its peak before 2030 in the SER scenario, taking into account the impact of PEF and HEF. The analysis demonstrates that the synergistic reduction effect of inter-department will be better than that of one sector. Furthermore, green buildings, renewable energy building and energy conservation policies for district heating have a great influence on emission abatement in the building sector.","[Tan, Xianchun; Lai, Haiping; Gu, Baihe; Zeng, Yuan; Li, Hui] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci & Dev, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Lai, Haiping; Zeng, Yuan; Li, Hui] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Gu, BH (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci & Dev, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",gubaihe@casipm.ac.cn,,"Gu, Baihe/0000-0003-2257-8471; Zeng, Yuan/0000-0002-9710-6543",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71573249]; Clean Development Mechanism Fund of China [2014091]; Key Task Project of Institute of Science and Development of Chinese Academy of Sciences [Y02015003],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Clean Development Mechanism Fund of China; Key Task Project of Institute of Science and Development of Chinese Academy of Sciences,"We would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their invaluable comments and suggestions.

Since the 1990s, market-oriented reform models and economic regulation have reshaped the structure and organisational environment of this industry. The increasing focus on the environmental sustainability requiring the addition of new measures and policies into the sector has added to the challenges facing the sector. In addition, in response to these strong trends, technological progress has brought significant cost reductions in some technologies and innovative technical possibilities. However, these changes are increasingly challenging the existing market designs, regulatory framework, and policies while giving rise to new ones. This means that the sector's transition path constantly creates a diverse range of new issues and options that are in need of sound economic analysis. This also poses significant challenges to the sub-discipline of energy economics and policy analysis to play an important role in the coming years.

Differing from previous works that simply treat the whole inputs in the construction stage as some primary materials, this study inclusively covers all input items as products of the economy, supported by input-output database. An integrated inventory that contains over seventy items is established, in which the materials, equipment, and services inputs throughout the construction stage are given full consideration. In magnitude, the greenhouse gas emissions embodied in the construction stage of the power plant are calculated in carbon dioxide equivalent as 1.54% of those from coal combustion, which are several times or even one order of magnitude higher than that estimated in some previous studies. The emissions induced by coal-fired power generation infrastructure in China are accordingly estimated, in magnitude up to 0.6%, one-eighth and one-sixth of the total national emissions in China, UK and France, respectively. The outcome provides a unique perspective for policy makers into apprehending carbon emissions by the power sector.","[Wu, X. D.; Guo, J. L.; Chen, G.

However solid data on the performance of improved biomass cooking stoves remains scarce. This paper provides controlled cooking test (CCT) evidence on fuel savings from a promising improved biomass cooking stove in Ethiopia. The stove is called Mirt (meaning best in Amharic), and is used to bake injera, the staple food in much of Ethiopia. Injera preparation accounts for about half the primary energy consumed in the country. We find that the Mirt stove offers fuel savings of 22% to 31% compared with a traditional three-stone tripod, with little or no increase in cooking time. Fuel savings in the CCTs are significant, but are substantially smaller than in laboratory testing. Users also generally report high levels of satisfaction with the stove, which is crucial for successful large-scale adoption. The fuelwood savings increase and cooking times decline over time, suggesting the importance of user experience and learning. Though our results are robust to different ways that the stoves were rolled out, conclusions regarding acceptability of the stove are still indicative, because of the CCT methodology we employ. Despite the limitations of our study, the findings suggest that the Mirt stove could have positive welfare effects for households who adopt it.

There is however little empirical examination of how actors from politics, government, civil society and non-governmental organisations regard the role of public engagement in climate and energy policy. Research is lacking as to their views on the desirability of active citizen participation or indeed whether they draw on the findings from social science research in forming strategies and policy. This paper presents an analysis of interviews with policy experts and deliberative seminars held with non-governmental stakeholders acting in an intermediary capacity between climate policy and the public. A comparison of four policy scenarios was used to explore intermediaries' beliefs about the role of the public in delivering the UK's Climate Change Act targets. The results reveal a general antipathy to policies that seek to 'engage' the public and a lack of knowledge amongst seminar participants about how insights from the social sciences can be used to build and sustain public engagement.

For example, in Ghanaian Living Standards Measurement surveys, households are visited up to 10 times over a period of 1 month. I find strong evidence for conditioning effects as a result of this approach: In the Ghanaian data the estimated level of consumption is a function of the number of prior visits, with consumption being highest in the earlier survey visits. Telescoping (perceiving events as being more recent than they are) or seasonality (first-of-the-month effects) cannot explain the observed pattern. To study whether earlier or later survey visits are of higher quality, I employ a strategy based on Benford's law. Results suggest that the consumption data from earlier survey visits are of higher quality than data from later visits. The findings have implications for the value of additional visits in household surveys, and also shed light on possible measurement problems in high-frequency panels. They add to a recent literature on measurement errors in consumption surveys (Beegle etal., , Gibson etal., ), and complement findings by Zwane etal.

There are important interdependencies between different forms of integration that should be accounted for when evaluating policy changes. Brexit is likely to make the UK poorer by reducing trade and investment flows, but the magnitude of the economic decline will depend upon the nature of the UK's post-Brexit economic relations with the EU and the rest of the world.

A Jackknife model averaging method and two stochastic frontier models are utilized to estimate the input-output relation more accurately. The derived efficiency is then decomposed to predict the effect of various efficiency determinants with an emphasis on gas ratio and ownership. A significantly negative effect of natural gas ratio (in production portfolio) on efficiency is found for both National Oil Companies (NOCs) and privately-owned International Oil Companies (IOCs). This finding implies that the decline in natural gas ratio for IOCs is economics-driven, and the incline in gas ratio for NOCs is environment-driven. Therefore, the environmental objective is the NOCs' third non-commercial objective, alongside subsidizing below-market energy prices and offering excessive employment, as found in the literature. Governments may consider the transfer of subsidies from low energy prices to clean energy promotion, which leads to energy saving and emissions reduction.","[Gong, Binlei] Zhejiang Univ, CARD, Dept Agr Econ & Management, 866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University,"Gong, BL (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, CARD, Dept Agr Econ & Management, 866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",gongbinlei@zju.edu.cn,,"Gong, Binlei/0000-0002-0615-9341",,,,,34,17,17,0,33,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2018,114.0,,,,,,145,152,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.12.004,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FW0DY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424962800015,0

Our key contributions are (i) an intuitive description of the conditions under which groundwater extraction can be non-monotonic, (ii) a numerical demonstration that extraction is non-monotonic in an important region overlying the Ogallala Aquifer, and (iii) the predicted gains from management are substantially larger after accounting for climate and technical change. Intuitively, optimal extraction is increasing in early periods when the marginal benefits of extraction are increasing sufficiently fast due to climate and technical change compared to the increase in the marginal cost of extraction. In contrast, most previous studies include the stock of groundwater as the only state variable and recommend a monotonically decreasing extraction path. We conduct numerical simulations for a region in Kansas overlying the Ogallala Aquifer and find that optimal groundwater extraction peaks 23 years in the future and the gains from management are large (29.5%). Consistent with previous literature, the predicted gains from management are relatively small (6.1%) when ignoring climate and technical change. The realized gains from management are not substantially impacted by incorrect assumptions of climate and technical change when formulating the optimal plan. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In short run, Thai non-listed food companies should aim for seeking cost-efficiency from production and financial cost reduction including foreign exchange risk due to their main sales volumes relying on export market. To enhance companies' value for Thai listed food companies, companies' economic value-added increases by fixed asset turnover, profit margin, sales growth, and time interest earned. On the other hand, Average costs of capitals (WACC) are negatively related to economic value-added. The food companies with high EVA will have lower costs of capitals. The listed companies achieve their value enhancing target quite satisfied, while non-listed companies should set this value-enhancing target for their long-run goal.","[Boonvorachote, Tanachote; Sakulveeraphan, Rapeepat] Kasetsart Univ, Fac Agroind, Dept Agroind Technol, 5o Ngamwongwan Rd, Bangkok 10900, Thailand",Kasetsart University,"Boonvorachote, T (通讯作者)，Kasetsart Univ, Fac Agroind, Dept Agroind Technol, 5o Ngamwongwan Rd, Bangkok 10900, Thailand.",tanachote.b@ku.ac.th,,,,,,,10,1,1,1,10,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2413-0877,,,KNE LIFE SCI,,,2018,,,,,,,277,283,,10.18502/kls.v4i2.1682,0.0,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BL1IO,,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447763100032,0

Openness is measured by the share of businesses belonging to an exporting sector. Next, it examines the relationship of these indicators with employment growth in metropolitan France. Both interdependence and openness influence employment growth positively, but their effects depend on both the macroeconomic and local context.

Most Consumers decided to buy the instant chili paste based on a taste satisfaction at convenient stores or supermarkets. Those whose monthly income were less than 865 USD preferred a chili paste in a 90-gram plastic jar and made a purchase with higher frequency than those who earned more and preferred a 230-gram glass jar. Taste, reasonable price to quality, availability near home or workplace and product promotion were consumers' most important buying decision criteria. The logistic regression model built to represent the relationship between a probability to buy and marketing factors revealed that buying chance would be higher if the consumers perceived that the product were made from high quality materials and were packed in the see-through packaging. Marketing strategies for the chili paste manufacturer are to communicate its high quality raw materials and standard certificate on the label or QR code, product visibility through a transparent package or window on a package and prepare for digital marketing.

For several decades, this industry grew based on the protectionist policies developed by the Spanish state, but it went through a deep restructuring process in the final decades of the twentieth century. Spanish shipyards were forced to reduce their production capacity and change their competitive strategies and target markets. The recent evolution and future development of these firms depends on their internationalization. The Spanish tax lease scheme (first developed in 2002) is a legal-financial scheme aimed at increasing the competitiveness of Spanish shipyards. Its legal evolution within the framework of European regulation has strongly affected activity in this industry.","[Gonzalez-Mieres, Celina; Lopez-Duarte, Cristina; Vidal-Suarez, Marta M.] Univ Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain",University of Oviedo,"González-Mieres, C (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.",,"Vidal-Suarez, Marta/ACI-5190-2022","Vidal-Suarez, Marta/0000-0002-9579-8750",,,,,32,1,1,0,5,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

These companies associate buyers with sellers, but do not participate directly in the ownership or storage of goods, they make revenues through commissions. Globally, the goal of any business is to increase the value of an enterprise. To determine the value of the business, traditional financial analysis proved to be inadequate. The need for application and use of new indicators that more accurately measure the efficiency of both the processes and the elements that generate the value caused great interest in the so-called value generators. Value generators refer to activities and capabilities that increase profitability, reduce risk, and promote growth in the company. This paper aims to identify generators of the value of an average business enterprise in the Czech Republic. The assumption is that we measure the value of an enterprise using the EVA equity indicator. The data set contains the complete financial statements of the Czech companies for the year 2016. EVA equity is calculated for each enterprise. For statistical analysis, the software Statistica and artificial neural networks are used. A total number of 1,000 neural networks are generated, five of them showing the best characteristics, are preserved. The result is the neural network that predicts EVA equity based on input data from which we are able to derive the probable EVA equity value. The most important variables are identified which most influence the value of the average business enterprise in the Czech Republic.","[Horak, Jakub] Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Okruzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice 37001, Czech Republic; [Machova, Veronika] Univ Econ, Nam W Churchilla 1938-4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic","Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice; Prague University of Economics & Business","Horák, J (通讯作者)，Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Okruzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice 37001, Czech Republic.",horak@mail.vstecb.cz; machova@mail.vstecb.cz,"Machová, Veronika/AAF-9612-2021; Horák, Jakub/T-7022-2019","Machová, Veronika/0000-0001-5479-6655; Horák, Jakub/0000-0001-6364-9745",,,,,17,1,1,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,547,554,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300072,0

On the other hand, less attention is dedicated to the issue of brand management at the level of small and medium-sized enterprises. This situation causes frequent failures in application practice of brand management leading to a reduction in market dynamics as well as to sector monopolization. As a result of competitive indulgence, small and medium-sized enterprises rapidly leave the market, so the consumer becomes more loyal to brands of large enterprises in such a turbulent marketplace as it eliminates the risk associated with making a purchasing decision while there is an absence of information about new entrants on the market. This reduces the market share of small and medium-sized enterprises (mostly national) in favour of large global brands. The aim of the presented paper is to identify the current state of the use of CSR in the practice of building and managing the brand value in specific conditions of the Slovak Republic and to highlight the possibilities of gaining the competitive advantage of small and medium-sized enterprises by implementation of this concept with regard to national specifics. We used modified methods of comparative analysis and chronological benchmark. Our final statements are based on the outcomes of rankings Via Bona Slovakia 2017 and Superbrands 2017.

Progressive implementation of labour-saving technologies, information and communication technologies changed economic activity and consequently the character and forms of work. The accompanying phenomenon of these changes in the labour market was growing uncertainty and the level of unemployment. People threatened by the unemployment, especially by the long-term unemployment became dependant on social benefits. Multiple increase in public expenditure in the social sector has emerged and welfare state has found itself in a crisis especially since the 90s of the last century when long-term unemployment has risen significantly. Given the fiscal unsustainability of the current social systems, measures and reforms addressing the fiscal crisis of the welfare state are being introduced.

In order to address concerns about the highly nonlinear relationship between pollution and income, the endogeneity of income, and the discrete nature of political variables, we use a nonparametric instrumental variable approach that allows for the inclusion of continuous and discrete variables to identify these relationships. Results indicate an inverted-U shaped relationship between pollution and income consistent with an environmental Kuznets curve for one pollutant (lead), a cubic shape for three pollutants (nickel, mercury, and fecal coliform), and more highly nonlinear relationships for many of the other pollutants. For several stock pollutants (nickel, mercury, and arsenic), we find that pollution levels may continue to increase at higher levels of income, suggesting that stock pollutants may continue to accumulate in productive high-income countries even when marginal emissions have been reduced. We also find suggestive evidence that levels of pollutants resulting from industrial activity (e.g., chemical oxygen demand) may increase with income while those that are more driven by residential activity and population levels (e.g., fecal coliform) do not. By estimating a nonparametric relationship between pollution and political institutions and by accounting for the categorical nature of the political variables, we are able to detect a nonlinear relationship between pollution and political institutions as well, which for some pollutants is an inverted-U shaped curve.","[Lawell, C. -Y.

The security of this public service significantly depends on its users and their rightful actions. Security threats are even more serious, since this service is provided in globalized environment on the places such as airports, hotels, restaurants and more and more often also local free Wi-Fi zones in various metropolitan areas. Combined with wide spectrum of users migrating in short periods of time throughout the world, this is a significant security problem also from the view of globalization trends. It is good to realize that public Wi-Fi networks can be compared to a sandpit on a children's playground. It also has a set of rules and duties for provider regarding sand treatment and construction elements, but parents still have concern about their children when they play there. They worry that children can find unwanted or health threatening objects there, which sometimes unfortunately happens.

In the study, series are assumed to be I(d), 0 < d 1, with parameter d supposed to be known. In this context, the order of integration of the error series is I(d - b), b [0, d]. Besides, the determinant of the spectral density matrix for the dth difference series is a power function of b. The proposed estimator for b is obtained here performing a regression of logged determinant on a set of logged Fourier frequencies. Under the null hypothesis of noncointegration, the expressions for the bias and variance of the estimator were derived and its consistency property was also obtained. The asymptotic normality of the estimator, under Gaussian and non-Gaussian innovations, was also established. A Monte Carlo study was performed and showed that the suggested test possesses correct size and good power for moderate sample sizes, when compared with other proposals in the literature. An advantage of the method proposed here, over the standard methods, is that it allows to know the order of integration of the error series without estimating a regression equation. An application was conducted to exemplify the method in a real context.","[Melo Souza, Igor Viveiros] UFMG, DEECO, UFOP, Rua Catete 166, BR-30420000 Mariana, MG, Brazil; [Melo Souza, Igor Viveiros] UFMG, Dept Estat, Rua Catete 166, BR-30420000 Mariana, MG, Brazil; [Reisen, Valderio Anselmo] Univ Fed Espirito Santo, PPGEA, PPGECON, Dept Estat, Av Fernando Ferrari S-N Goiabeiras, BR-29060900 Vitoria, ES, Brazil; [Franco, Glaura da Conceicao] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Estat, Av Antonio Carlos,6627 Predio ICEx 4067, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Bondon, Pascal] Univ Paris Sud, CNRS, Lab Signaux & Syst, Cent Supelec, Orsay, France",Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; Universidade Federal do Espirito Santo; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paris Saclay,"Souza, IVM (通讯作者)，UFMG, DEECO, UFOP, Rua Catete 166, BR-30420000 Mariana, MG, Brazil.;Souza, IVM (通讯作者)，UFMG, Dept Estat, Rua Catete 166, BR-30420000 Mariana, MG, Brazil.",igorviveiros@gmail.com; valderioanselmoreisen@gmail.com; glaura@est.ufmg.br; bondon@lss.supelec.fr,"Bondon, Pascal/AAT-3568-2020; reisen, Valderio/AFA-5027-2022; da Conceição Franco, Glaura/AAG-7750-2021","Bondon, Pascal/0000-0002-5158-7337; reisen, Valderio/0000-0002-8313-7648;",CNRS; CentraleSupelec; CNPq; FAPES; CNPq-Brazil [305646/2012-5]; FAPEMIG Foundation [PPM-00021-14],CNRS(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)); CentraleSupelec; CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); FAPES(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Espiritu Santo (FAPES)); CNPq-Brazil(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); FAPEMIG Foundation(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)),"The work of Prof. Valderio Anselmo Reisen was partially supported by CNRS and CentraleSupelec, CNPq and FAPES.

In such conditions, there is a need for optimal planning and work distribution management. The author had previously proposed a mathematical model aimed at finding the distribution of works by performers, which fit in a given time and minimizes the total costs of the work of performers. However, a number of questions arose: What if it is necessary to involve third-party performers? What if in the context of globalization it is more cost-effective to give part of the work to other companies? How to determine what is more cost effective - to give to third-party companies or to perform the work on their own? The answers to these questions will help to give the proposed mathematical model of the distribution of work, taking into account the possibility of attracting third-party performers. This problem belongs to the class of NP-complete algorithms for which there are no exact efficient (non-exhaustive) algorithms. To solve this problem, the author developed a heuristic algorithm based on splitting works on the fronts. The information management subsystem of works distribution on performers is developed. For example, the project design-center microelectronics were carried out testing of the system.","[Novikova, Tatyana P.; Novikov, Arthur, I] Voronezh State Univ Forestry & Technol, Voronezh, Russia",Voronezh State University of Forestry & Technologies named after G.F.

This paper sheds light on the main aggregate-level determinants of electoral support for regionalist parties across 10 Western European countries. A region being relatively richer than the country to which it belongs is associated with higher electoral support for regionalist parties only to the extent that the region is culturally differentiated. This hypothesis is substantiated theoretically, tested empirically and found to hold in the form of a strong and significant interaction effect between cultural and economic variables. This result, omitted in previous studies, implies a profound change in the interpretation of the role of income and cultural differences in explaining support for regionalism, for both autonomist and separatist parties.","[Pereira, Brais Alvarez; Vourdas, John] European Univ Inst EUI, Dept Econ, Florence, Italy; [Portos, Martin] European Univ Inst EUI, Dept Polit & Social Sci, Florence, Italy; [Portos, Martin] Scuola Normale Super, COSMOS, Florence, Italy; [Portos, Martin] Inst Humanities & Social Sci, Florence, Italy",European University Institute; European University Institute; Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa,"Portos, M (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst EUI, Dept Polit & Social Sci, Florence, Italy.;Portos, M (通讯作者)，Scuola Normale Super, COSMOS, Florence, Italy.;Portos, M (通讯作者)，Inst Humanities & Social Sci, Florence, Italy.",brais.alvarez@eui.eu; martin.portos@eui.eu; john.vourdas@eui.eu,"PORTOS, MARTIN/AAZ-4843-2021","PORTOS, MARTIN/0000-0003-1714-6383; Alvarez Pereira, Brais/0000-0003-3702-9520",,,,,32,14,15,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The health system is singled out in a separate institution consisting of basic elements. In the conditions of increasing decentralization of practical medicine management, it is necessary to apply the cluster approach to the problem. The study also examines healthcare coordination councils. Reform package, models for the program and its aims also differ in different health systems. The main priority of the government is the effective utilization of modern science and technology, competitiveness and the partnership between governmental and private sectors. The examples of implementation of cluster approach on regional level are provided. Important factor is localization of major cluster participants, as well as transport and data infrastructures, which ensure the possibility of interaction between aforementioned participants. Moreover, the characteristics of development of the health system in Russian Federation are also examined with the use of cluster approach.","[Petrovna, Yakunina Regina; Paylovich, Pshenichnyi Sergey; Sergeevna, Ryzhova Asya; Petrovna, Alekseeva Julia] Kazan Volga Reg Fed Univ, St Kremlin 18, Kazan 420008, Russia",Kazan Federal University,"Petrovna, YR (通讯作者)，Kazan Volga Reg Fed Univ, St Kremlin 18, Kazan 420008, Russia.",regina92homa@mail.ru; sergey_pshenichnyi_kpfu@mail.ru; a.s.ryzhova@yandex.ru; stirisidium@gmail.com,"Yakunina, Regina/R-9860-2016; Алексеева, Юлия/AED-2546-2022","Yakunina, Regina/0000-0001-5467-9846; Алексеева, Юлия/0000-0002-5850-5859",,,,,14,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1450,1455,,,,,,6,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300185,0

The effects of high public debt are: increase of unemployment, decrease of GDP, lower wages, which inhibit the country economic growth. Many countries are aware of the negative economic consequences of excessive public debt. The early warning system has an important role in identifying excessive public debt. The excessive public debt has a negative impact on the global economy. It allows quick response on changes and it allows to counteract negative effects of excessive public debt, which often becomes a brake in the development of economies. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to use the early-detection index of fiscal stress taking into account fiscal variables and variables affecting the macroeconomic equilibrium. The fiscal stress index presented in this paper provides a signaling tool to assess exposure to fiscal sustainability risks and helps identify the factors underlying changes in fiscal stress risks. This is important tool to assess vulnerabilities. The results speak that the analysis of an early-warning composite index of fiscal stress is better than the analysis of individual variables. The fiscal risk thresholds are determined based on a signals approach. The analysis is based on the G7 countries, Russia and China.","[Przybylska-Mazur, Agnieszka] Univ Eonc Katowice, Dept Stat & Math Methods Econ, Ul 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland",,"Przybylska-Mazur, A (通讯作者)，Univ Eonc Katowice, Dept Stat & Math Methods Econ, Ul 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland.",agnieszka.przybylska-mazur@ue.katowice.pl,"Przybylska-Mazur, Agnieszka/AAD-1816-2022","Przybylska-Mazur, Agnieszka/0000-0001-6889-0060",,,,,15,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1779,1786,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300227,0

The article focuses on the essence of unification and approximation of law due to relatively dynamic globalization, mainly from the economic and labour law aspect. We ask the question of the existing discrepancy and the possible mantinels of globalization and the impact on our legal system as a whole. In this article we discuss the impact of unification and implementation of legal norms from the point of view of natural globalization on the development of legal theory and practice in the field of international law and labour law. The fact is that even though globalization is a great benefit to the European Union, it has brought many challenges. Globalization has helped hundreds of millions of people around the world to break out of poverty, and poorer countries have made it possible to catch up with the richest. Thanks to world trade, the EU's economic growth has been fostered. Cheaper households also benefit from cheaper imports. However, these benefits are not automatic and not evenly distributed among our citizens. In our conditions, the product of globalization is also convergence and extension of the legal orders of the European Union with the shared competences of the main bodies of the European Union, which has transferred powers in the form of a personal union. We also discuss the European Commission's debate of 1 March 2017 on the sustainability and benefits of globalization for the individual in the context of the existence and impact of the four fundamental freedoms of the European Union, such as the free movement of goods, capital, services and persons.","[Skolkova, Slavomira Micurova; Paliderova, Martina] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Skolková, SM (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",slavomira.micurova@fpedas.uniza.sk; martina.paliderova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Paliderova, Martina/P-3826-2015",,,,,,24,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,723,729,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300094,0

The qualitative data analyses revealed that most teachers insist on the use of text memorization as they do not see any negative impact of this practice on understanding, creativity and motivation.

A theoretical explanation argues that this stylized fact is the result of a trade-off between two characteristics of these modes of production: the high degree of flexibility of electricity production using natural gas as an input and the low marginal cost of renewable energy sources.","[Baranes, Edmond] Univ Montpellier, LAMETA, UFR Econ, Site Richter,Ave Raymond Dugrand,CS 79606, F-34960 Montpellier 2, France; [Baranes, Edmond] Univ Montpellier, Labex Entreprendre, UFR Econ, Site Richter,Ave Raymond Dugrand,CS 79606, F-34960 Montpellier 2, France; [Jacqmin, Julien] Univ Liege, HEC Liege, Liege, Belgium; [Poudou, Jean-Christophe] Univ Montpellier, LAMETA, Montpellier, France; [Poudou, Jean-Christophe] Univ Montpellier, Labex Entreprendre, Montpellier, France",Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Montpellier; Universite de Montpellier; University of Liege; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Montpellier; Universite de Montpellier,"Poudou, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Montpellier, LAMETA, Montpellier, France.;Poudou, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Montpellier, Labex Entreprendre, Montpellier, France.",edmond.baranes@umontpellier.fr; Julien.Jacqmin@ulg.ac.be; jean-christophe.poudou@umontpellier.fr,,"Jean-Christophe, Poudou/0000-0001-9182-1979",,,,,34,29,30,2,28,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2017,111.0,,,,,,58,67,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.09.018,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FN1VQ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000415779700008,0

In practice, regulators are often less informed than project proponents; therefore, the baselines are more likely to be privately defined even for sectoral crediting. The primary concern with privately defined baselines is that baseline developers may exert their powers to manipulate the baselines, leading to increases in sectoral emission caps. This study models baseline manipulation behaviors in the context of adverse selection, where participants can self-select into the market. The theoretical results show that the extent to which the baseline is manipulated is highly dependent on who is assigned as the baseline developer. The more the baseline developer emits, the more likely the developer manipulates the baseline. The results are then further discussed in the context of the U.S. commercial building sector, where empirical methods are introduced to characterize cost and revenue functions. The empirical analysis reveals that, because of the notably low price elasticity of the offset supply, baselines are often positively biased even with third-party verifications. If that policymakers wish to allow baselines to be privately defined, they might be advised to implement baseline setting on an invitation-only basis to specific emitters that have relatively lower historical emissions.","[Liu, Xiaoyu; Cui, Qingbin] Univ Maryland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Liu, Xiaoyu] Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Cui, QB (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",cui@umd.edu,,,,,,,13,11,11,3,31,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2017,111.0,,,,,,9,17,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.09.014,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FN1VQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000415779700002,0

This study mobilises a multidisciplinary approach and a non-linear modeling strategy to examine the total, direct and indirect effects of households and housing units in designing French energy consumption. Based on micro-level data from the new French 2012 PHEBUS survey, this research implements a structural equation model to tease out the effects of both dwelling characteristics, household attributes, climate and behaviours on the domestic energy use. Findings confirm that the direct effect of household-related attributes on domestic energy demand is notably lower than the corresponding effect from the dwelling attributes. Nevertheless, considering for the indirect effect of household factors on energy use, across housing choices, the total impact of household-related attributes on the French domestic energy consumption is just slightly lower than that of dwelling characteristics. Therefore, to highlight the spectrum of residential energy use, this research calls to incorporate both direct and indirect effects of household attributes and choices. This study suggests several key insights on how to incorporate housing policy into residential energy policy and reduce energy-related greenhouse gas emissions.","[Belaid, Fateh] Univ Paris Est, Sci & Tech Ctr Bldg, 14 Blvd Newton,Champs Sur Marne, F-77447 Marne La Vallee 2, France",Universite Gustave-Eiffel,"Belaïd, F (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Est, Sci & Tech Ctr Bldg, 14 Blvd Newton,Champs Sur Marne, F-77447 Marne La Vallee 2, France.",fateh.belaid@cstb.fr,"BELAID, Fateh/AAO-6406-2020","BELAID, Fateh/0000-0002-1077-2798",,,,,60,63,67,1,34,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2017,110.0,,,,,,246,256,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.08.027,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FP5LK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417660800024,0

Based on the most updated multi-regional input-output table, this study investigates the evolution of energy-related carbon flows embodied in Macao's external trade. The results show that both carbon inflows and outflows maintain a growing trend from 2000 to 2013 in general, accompanied with some rise and falls during this period. Total carbon imports increase from 3.67E +06 t in 2000 to 1.24E+07 tin 2013, whose main contributor changes from Sector Textiles and Wearing Apparel in 2000 to Sector Electricity, Gas and Water in 2013. Mainland China, the European Union and Japan are the main providers of carbon inflows. Dominated by gaming service exports, total carbon outflows are equal to 6A8E + 06 tin 2013, which is 2.6 times that of year 2000. Macao has avoided large amounts of local carbon emissions by net carbon emission imports, indicating that the decarbonization of the urban economy achieved by transferring carbon intensive industries to other places is a bias towards sustainability. Following the results, holistic energy conservation and carbon reduction policies are proposed for Macao from both the local and global perspective.","[Chen, B.; Chen, G.

Findings have significance in determining whether a rebound effect needs to be factored into projected energy/carbon savings from solar PV installation. At issue is the robustness of carbon mitigation estimates included in future rounds of international climate change agreements as well as local forecasts of future electricity demand affecting the national grid. Analysis and modelling was undertaken on billing data for the period 2007-2014 on a representative sample of 4819 households. The sample comprised three groups: households who were early adopters and installed PV under a 60 c/kWh gross feed-in tariff scheme, a group who installed under a 20 c/KWh gross feed-in scheme and a control group with no PV. Econometric modelling undertaken on energy consumption behaviour of households with versus without local renewable energy generation revealed that on a kWh basis, the rebound effect is estimated to erode up to one fifth of the carbon benefit of renewable energy generated by solar PV.","[Deng, Gary; Newton, Peter] Swinburne Univ Technol, Ctr Urban Transit, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Swinburne University of Technology,"Newton, P (通讯作者)，Swinburne Univ Technol, Ctr Urban Transit, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",pnewton@swin.edu.au,,,Co-Operative Research Centre for Low Carbon Living,"Co-Operative Research Centre for Low Carbon Living(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme)",This work was supported by the Co-Operative Research Centre for Low Carbon Living.

Nevertheless an analysis of gas flow based on the ENTSOG leads to a conclusions that decision could have a substantial influence on Slovakia and Poland.

However, this literature has been more silent about the potential effects of internal migration on subjective measures of utility. In this paper I use panel data from Australia and Britain and panel regression models to examine whether and how internal migration is associated with young people's self-reported job satisfaction, paying attention to the time dynamics underpinning the associations. This enables gaining a more holistic picture of the outcomes associated with internal migration during early adulthood. Key findings indicate that long-distance and work-motivated migrations have positive and statistically significant effects on the job satisfaction of young people in Britain and Australia, particularly amongst those who hold university degrees. Additionally, the results reveal time patterns in the ways in which job satisfaction and residential mobility intersect: long-term trends in job dissatisfaction can trigger internal migration, and internal migration can set long-term onwards trends in job satisfaction. I conclude by calling for further research on the outcomes of internal migration on subjective well-being leveraging the properties of panel data and using a life course approach.","[Perales, Francisco] Univ Queensland, Social Sci Res Inst, ARC Ctr Excellence Children & Families Life Cours, Long Pocket Precinct, 80 Meiers Rd,Bldg C, Brisbane, Qld 4068, Australia",University of Queensland,"Perales, F (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Social Sci Res Inst, ARC Ctr Excellence Children & Families Life Cours, Long Pocket Precinct, 80 Meiers Rd,Bldg C, Brisbane, Qld 4068, Australia.",f.perales@uq.edu.au,"Perales Perez, Francisco/F-9549-2014","Perales Perez, Francisco/0000-0001-7508-9431",Australian Government Department of Social Services (DSS),Australian Government Department of Social Services (DSS)(Australian Government),"I would like to thank Sergi Vidal for helpful discussions and suggestions.

When the landscape appearance is referred to within the scope of energy topics (without a firm conceptual link to an energy landscape), the debate tends to be dominated by statements proclaiming the destruction of landscape, primarily by wind turbines and wind parks. In the case of concrete energy landscapes referring to geographical units, these are frequently trade marks, in other words, proper nouns used for the purpose of establishing an image. It has become apparent that the term energy landscape is used, above all, as a metaphor for a complex organisational-technical-legal structure and for the transformation thereof. The overall conclusion is that the term energy landscape as a metaphor is more likely to be linked to the meaning of opportunity ratherthan threat, while in terms of defining a location within the landscape for new energy production plants, the notion of a threat clearly outweighs that of an opportunity.","[Weiss, Guenther] Univ Cologne, Inst Geog & Its Didact, Gronewaldstr 2, Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Weiss, G (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Inst Geog & Its Didact, Gronewaldstr 2, Cologne, Germany.",g.weiss@uni-koeln.de,"Weiss, Günther/AAA-4629-2021","Weiss, Günther/0000-0001-8111-893X",,,,,40,5,5,0,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,845,853,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.06.031,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400081,0

However, charging EVs will increase the load on the electricity network. The maximum load may be minimized by coordinating the timing of charging activities, in order to spread electricity demand more equally over the course of a day. In this study, based on a stated-choice experiment, the effects of two different temporal price differentiation strategies on stated charging time are investigated, including socio-demographic, behavioural and socio-psychological variables. In a situation without charging time coordination, a peak in charging events is likely to occur during the early evening. Temporal price differentiation has a significant influence on charging time and in particular the level of price differentiation matters. The likelihood to change charging time differs and different alternative time slots are chosen when comparing high to low levels of price differentiation. People that have more knowledge about EVs have a higher chance to change their charging time, whereas people that have the tendency to plan their trips long time beforehand are less likely to adjust their charging time in the scenarios with temporal price differentiation.","[Langbroek, Joram H.

Here, a city-centric global multiregional input-output model (CCG-MRIO) was developed to assess the carbon footprints of urban consumption in the global supply chain. Beijing was selected as the studied case, and results were as follow. In 2010, Beijing's CBF was 338.26 Mt CO(2)e, which was 1.90 times amount of its purely geographic accounting (PGA). Manufacturing, services, and construction were the top three consumers, while Mainland China and other developing regions were the main net importing areas, and utilities, manufacturing, and agriculture were the top net importing sectors. These findings indicated that Beijing imports large amounts of energy, water, and raw materials to support its consumption, while it mainly exports services and industrial products. The study fills the gap of data and methods for urban CBF compiling and can replicate to other cities with an input-output table. The CBF can promote sustainable local consumption behaviors, local production efficiencies improvement, and cooperation with importing regions. However, the model uncertainties increase in coordinating sectors, estimating trade relationship, and ignoring traffic differences; and the availability of municipal input-output table and energy data hinder its application.","[Lin, Jianyi; Hu, Yuanchao; Zhao, Xiaofeng; Shi, Longyu; Kang, Jiefeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Urban Environm, Key Lab Urban Environm & Hlth, Xiamen 361021, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yuanchao; Kang, Jiefeng] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Urban Environment, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Lin, JY; Shi, LY (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Urban Environm, Key Lab Urban Environm & Hlth, Xiamen 361021, Peoples R China.",jylin@iue.ac.cn; lyshi@iue.ac.cn,"CAS, KLUEH/T-5743-2019; shi, longyu/E-5345-2017; Kang, Jiefeng/JXN-9959-2024",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71573242, 41371392, 71273252, 71403258]; National Key Research and Development Program [2017YFF0207302]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program,"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71573242, 41371392, 71273252, and 71403258) and National Key Research and Development Program (2017YFF0207302).",,54,48,52,8,122,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2017,108.0,,,,,,460,466,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.06.008,0.0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FC3FZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406725800043,0

A regression discontinuity design is employed and the results show that pollutant concentration levels were not significantly affected after the implementation of the policy. Empirically, the estimates of the effects under the discontinuity-based OLS model have the opposite sign for some of the pollutants relative to the estimates from the basic OLS model. Therefore, basing conclusions on the OLS results will engender incorrect inference. Discontinuity-based results are robust to different model specifications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

While important for China's long-term energy strategy, very few studies have yet analyzed the project from the standpoint of China's domestic policy process. This paper fills the gap by illuminating the broader historical context and presenting how this pipeline fits into energy politics in China. The policy-making process is fleshed out by using the multiple streams framework (MSF). Analysis of this case using MSF shows that, first, local governments and scholars played a key role in facilitating the project, especially in raising the proposal to the government agenda. Second, a policy window remains an important element in China's energy policy decisions, in light of the China-Myanmar pipeline idea was not taken seriously in the 1990s when it was first proposed. Third, although this cross-border energy project is part of a national strategy of energy security, domestic political considerations such as promoting investment in China's underdeveloped southwest were also at work. These conclusions are useful for understanding not only the motivations behind such transboundary pipeline projects but also China's energy decisions at large.","[Liu, Dawei] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Ctr Chinese Publ Adm Res, 135 Xingang Xi Rd, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Dawei] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Govt, 135 Xingang Xi Rd, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Yamaguchi, Kensuke] Univ Tokyo, Policy Alternat Res Inst, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Yoshikawa, Hisashi] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Publ Policy, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University; University of Tokyo; University of Tokyo,"Liu, DW (通讯作者)，Sun Yat Sen Univ, Ctr Chinese Publ Adm Res, 135 Xingang Xi Rd, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Liu, DW (通讯作者)，Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Govt, 135 Xingang Xi Rd, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",yoyopku@gmail.com; gucci.kensuke@gmail.com; yoshikawa@pp.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,"Liu, Dawei/0000-0001-6978-6185",National Social Science Fund of China [16CZZ034]; Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA),National Social Science Fund of China; Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA),"This research was supported by the National Social Science Fund of China (No. 16CZZ034) and the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA).

To date, many emerging case studies have analysed urban transport CO2 emissions in China; however, they lack an in-depth decomposition and causal mechanism analyses as well as a comparative study. To fill this gap, this study aims to conduct a decomposition analysis and causal mechanism investigation study on the urban transport sector with comparative studies on two Asian mega cities, Tokyo and Shanghai.

However, the issues such as different electricity market structures, regulatory and institutional diversity and disparate level of political stability make interconnection investment between north and south a risky undertaking. Due to high perceived risk, delivery of interconnection projects through the EU regulated model is less likely, or only possible at prohibitively high rate of returns. The merchant transmission initiative (MTI), on the other hand, seen as an exception under the EU laws, can be approved only if the project meets a set of strict conditions. Here we show that a hybrid business model in which the main benefits of a merchant model are maintained within a regulated structure, that involves minimal regulatory changes to national electricity markets, offers an appropriate response to the existing investment challenges in the Euro-Mediterranean basin. We highlight the main components of the proposed model and show how it addresses the key features of a viable business model regarding investment incentives, risks, governance and compatibility with the region's energy scenario.","[Poudineh, Rahmatallah] Oxford Inst Energy Studies, Oxford, England; [Rubino, Alessandro] Univ Bari, Bari, Italy",University of Oxford; Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro,"Rubino, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bari, Bari, Italy.",alessandro.rubino@eui.eu,"Rubino, Alessandro/AAI-5772-2021","Rubino, Alessandro/0000-0002-2737-9052; Poudineh, Rahmatallah/0000-0003-1894-5187",,,,,45,9,9,0,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2017,107.0,,,,,,96,108,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.04.027,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FA0WU,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405158200010,0

While manufacturing production has been moving from developed countries to the relatively less developed ones, which have become the emerging economies over the last two decades, the concentration of these activities within the countries has always received the attention of researchers. On the other hand, not only the geographical shift but also structural shifts have increasingly been an important phenomenon of the twenty-first century. It is known that the level of technology and innovation makes a significant contribution to regional economic development. Determinants of manufacturing agglomerations have created a wide literature based on different empirical studies. Moreover the structural changes of industry need to be investigated regarding the spatial agglomerations. The aim of this paper is to explore how the factors of manufacturing agglomerations have differentiated due to the technological level across the country. Furthermore, we assume that the agglomeration mechanism is likely to vary across the space. Therefore, we have run both global and local regression models based on the employment data of the 81 NUTS III level regions (provinces) of Turkey in 2012. The results point out that the factors of agglomerations are different in the east and west provinces, while GWR has significantly improved global results.","[Gezici, Ferhan; Walsh, Burcin Yazgi] Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Istanbul, Turkey; [Kacar, Sinem Metin] Urban Strategy Partners, Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Technical University,"Gezici, F (通讯作者)，Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Istanbul, Turkey.",gezicif@itu.edu.tr; yazgi@itu.edu.tr; sinem@urbanstrategypartners.com,,,ITU Research Fund,ITU Research Fund(Istanbul Technical University),This study was funded by ITU Research Fund.,,78,13,16,0,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

To this end, it has significantly encouraged renewable energy development through a variety of support schemes, ranging from green certificates to feed-in and premium tariffs. Asa result, the production of electricity from renewable energy sources, in particular from solar and wind energy, has risen considerably over the past years. In this paper we review the Italian support schemes for wind and solar energy and estimate the cost of abating CO2 emissions by generating electricity from these two sources of energy for the period 2008-2011. The results show that the average costs for wind were around 165 (sic)/tCO(2). For solar, they were much higher, around 1000 (sic)/tCO(2), as solar energy received much higher remunerations than wind energy. These costs were much higher than in Germany. This was due to the differences between the level of incentives and the different power systems.","[Marcantonini, Claudio] European Univ Inst, Via Roccettini 9, I-50014 Fiesole, FI, Italy; [Valero, Vanessa] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Zurich, Switzerland",European University Institute; University of Zurich,"Marcantonini, C (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Via Roccettini 9, I-50014 Fiesole, FI, Italy.",claudio.marcantonini@eui.eu,,,,,,,52,30,30,2,29,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2017,106.0,,,,,,600,613,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.12.029,0.0,,,14,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EW2RL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402343600056,0

Future energy demand is forecasted based on socio-economic variables such as gross domestic product, income per capita, population, and urbanisation. The Long-range Energy Alternative Planning System (LEAP) modelling framework is employed to analyse and project energy demand and the related emissions under alternative strategies for the period of 2010-2040. Results of scenarios including business-as-usual (RAU) policies, moderate energy access and accelerate energy access policies, renewable energies promotion and energy efficiency policies and their environmental implications are provided.

Employing an experiment embedded on a nationally representative survey, we examine how citizens respond to arguments concerning the costs and benefits of fracking, and incorporate them into their policy preferences. Arguments emphasizing the economic benefits of fracking bolster support for the technique; however, these gains are completely canceled if paired with a discussion of fracking's environmental costs. Additionally, we find mixed evidence of partisan motivated reasoning in how this information is processed. Individuals whose partisan attachments and preexisting beliefs about global climate change conflict are particularly responsive to arguments about the benefits and costs of fracking.

Road transport, which is contributing 20.5% to Germany's CO2 emissions, has become a major obstacle to achieving the country's policy goals. This paper analyses energy use from road transport in order to provide a better understanding of emissions from this sub-sector. Data is derived from representative longitudinal household surveys as well as mobility and fuel diaries for the period 2002-2015. Analysis reveals significant growth in energy-inefficient car choices, as well as considerable differences in mobility patterns (distances driven, driving styles) and actual fuel consumption between car segments. Findings suggest that German transport policies will fail to deliver significant emission reductions if complexities in car model choices and use patterns are ignored. Both command-and-control and market-based measures will be needed to align the transport sector with climate goals, while persisting policy inconsistencies will also have to be addressed. Findings are of central relevance for EU-wide and global climate policy in the transport sector:","[Gossling, Stefan] Linnaeus Univ, Sch Business & Econ, S-39182 Kalmar, Sweden; [Gossling, Stefan] Western Norway Res Inst, POB 163, N-6851 Sogndal, Norway; [Metzler, Daniel] Munich Univ Appl Sci, Schachenmeierstr 35, D-80636 Munich, Germany",Linnaeus University; University of Munich,"Metzler, D (通讯作者)，Munich Univ Appl Sci, Schachenmeierstr 35, D-80636 Munich, Germany.",stefan.gossling@lnu.se; daniel.metzler@hm.edu,,,,,,,89,13,13,2,30,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUN,2017,105.0,,,,,,418,428,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.03.019,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ET8EY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000400532900040,0

The third frame then portrays the siting process as a display of general distrust towards political elites and state institutions.

Second is expanding beyond humans to look at the Rights of Nature or non-anthropocentric notions of justice. Third is focusing on cross-scalar issues of justice such as embodied emissions. Fourth is identifying business models and the co-benefits of justice. Fifth is better understanding the tradeoffs within energy justice principles. Sixth is exposing unjust discourses. In doing so, the article presents an agenda constituted by 30 research questions as well as an amended conceptual framework consisting of ten principles.

In this article, I argue that Ilexibilities' within the EU's emissions legislative framework afforded automakers the opportunity to legally sidestep strict performance standards laid out in the law and resulted in a significant performance gap in real world driving emissions. This article provides a timely examination of EU emission legislation policy design and policy interaction within the European Union with the aim of explaining why the EU policy framework failed to regulate the regional automotive industry. Current research is mostly concerned with the typology and effectiveness of individual environmental policy instruments, be it regulatory or economic incentives, that aim to influence industry behaviour. This article approaches the current EU policy regime in a more holistic manner and focuses on the exploitation of weaknesses in the regulatory framework by private firms, which has received little academic attention in the innovation and transition literature. A major contribution of this article therefore is a body of primary qualitative interview data from industry elites concerning relevant emissions policies.","[Skeete, Jean-Paul] Univ York, Environm & Polit Dept, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Skeete, JP (通讯作者)，Univ York, Environm & Polit Dept, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",jpskeete@gmail.com,,,,,,,83,35,35,2,39,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2017,104.0,,,,,,373,381,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.02.018,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP7HS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397549500037,0

Moreover, we construct energy price and policy response scenarios based on Ordos' management experience. The results show that the energy price slump had a negative impact on the overall economic development of the coal-chemical industry district, despite promoting non-resource industries. Furthermore, policies had different effects on the industry's output value and profit. In the long-term, developing alternative industries (AI) helps increase the industrial output value and profit. Decreasing value added tax (VAT) has immediate results and a distinctive effect on industrial short-term production value and profit, its long-term effect being limited. The effect of production limit (PL) on industrial profit is stronger than output value, and financial support (FS) is more conducive to improve the latter. However, coal mining and coal-chemical loan increases decrease the gross industrial profit level. Technology innovation (TI) has the best individual policy overall effect on production value and profits. Furthermore, the simultaneous implementation of PL, TI and AI can generate the synergy effect for each of them. And the simultaneous implementation of VAT and one or couple of other policies will generate the crowding-out effect both for VAT and other policies.","[Wang, Delu; Ma, Gang] China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Management, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Song, Xuefeng] Nanjing Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Ind Engn, Nanjing 210003, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yun] Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Lancaster LA2 0PJ, England",China University of Mining & Technology; Nanjing University of Finance & Economics; Lancaster University,"Wang, DL (通讯作者)，China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Management, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",dlwang@cumt.edu.cn,"wang, jiajun/JRW-6032-2023",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71573252, 71202112]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71573252, No. 71202112).",,52,23,28,2,85,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2017,104.0,,,,,,325,339,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.02.014,0.0,,,15,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP7HS,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397549500032,0

We assume that there is uncertainty about a single unobservable characteristic, willingness-to-pay. We show that the subgame perfect equilibrium supports that both firms choose separate pricing policies, uniform pricing and discriminatory pricing, and the Prisoner's Dilemma does not occur. This result is maintained when the uncertainty is sufficiently high, and differs from Thisse and Vives's one-dimensional model in which discriminatory pricing is a dominant strategy. As the uncertainty decreases, the pricing structure converges to Thisse and Vives's model in which the Prisoner's Dilemma and all-out competition emerge.","[Won, Sei Beom] Korea Fair Trade Mediat Agcy, 39 Sejong Daero, Seoul, South Korea",,"Won, SB (通讯作者)，Korea Fair Trade Mediat Agcy, 39 Sejong Daero, Seoul, South Korea.",sbwon418@gmail.com,,,,,,,13,2,2,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Relaxing this hypothesis and being able to detect which parameters evolve over time is relevant for interpreting the changes in the dynamics of the series, for specifying models parsimoniously, and may be helpful in forecasting. We propose the class of sticky infinite hidden Markov-switching autoregressive moving average models, in which we disentangle the break dynamics of the mean and the variance parameters. In this class, the number of regimes is possibly infinite and is determined when estimating the model, thus avoiding the need to set this number by a model choice criterion. We develop a new Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation method that solves the path dependence issue due to the moving average component. Empirical results on macroeconomic series illustrate that the proposed class of models dominates the model with fixed parameters in terms of point and density forecasts.","[Bauwens, Luc] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Bauwens, Luc] SKEMA Business Sch, Lille, France; [Carpantier, Jean-Francois] Univ Luxembourg, CREA, Grand Duche Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Dufays, Arnaud] Univ Laval, Dept Econ, Ville De Quebec, PQ, Canada",Universite Catholique Louvain; SKEMA Business School; University of Luxembourg; Laval University,"Bauwens, L (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.;Bauwens, L (通讯作者)，SKEMA Business Sch, Lille, France.",luc.bauwens@uclouvain.be; jf.carpantier@gmail.com; arnuad.dufays@uclouvain.be,"Carpantier, Jean-François/H-5786-2012","Carpantier, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-2620-2503",Communaute francaise de Belgique through Projet d'Actions de Recherche Concertees - Academie universitaire Louvain [12/17-045]; Centre de Recherche en Economie et Statistique (CREST) [ANR-11-IDEX-0003/Labex Ecodec/ANR-11-LABX-0047]; Universite Catholique de Louvain,Communaute francaise de Belgique through Projet d'Actions de Recherche Concertees - Academie universitaire Louvain; Centre de Recherche en Economie et Statistique (CREST); Universite Catholique de Louvain,"Luc Bauwens acknowledges support of the Communaute francaise de Belgique through contract Projet d'Actions de Recherche Concertees 12/17-045, granted by the Academie universitaire Louvain.; Arnaud Dufays has been partly supported by the contract Investissement d'Avenir ANR-11-IDEX-0003/Labex Ecodec/ANR-11-LABX-0047 granted by the Centre de Recherche en Economie et Statistique (CREST) and by the FSR grant awarded by the Universite Catholique de Louvain.",,54,13,14,1,22,AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC,ALEXANDRIA,"732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

Using a unique dataset on tender prices of selected drugs for hospital usage provided by a sample of 52 Italian local health service providers (aziende sanitarie locali - ASLs) between 2009 and 2012, the paper tests which procurement system (centralized, decentralized or hybrid) performs better. Controlling for several covariates, including measures of institutional quality and corruption, it finds that centralized and hybrid procurers pay lower prices than decentralized units. Moreover, the results show that in areas in which institutional quality is lower or corruption is higher, the effect of centralization in terms of negotiating lower prices is much stronger, with savings of up to 60% of the price paid by ASLs that procure independently.","[Baldi, Simona] ART Transport Regulat Author, Turin, Italy; [Vannoni, Davide] Univ Turin, Dept Econ Math & Stat, Turin, Italy; [Vannoni, Davide] Coll Carlo Alberto, Moncalieri, Italy",University of Turin; Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Vannoni, D (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Econ Math & Stat, Turin, Italy.;Vannoni, D (通讯作者)，Coll Carlo Alberto, Moncalieri, Italy.",simobaldi@gmail.com; davide.vannoni@unito.it,,,,,,,38,36,39,7,69,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

A bottom-up model is used to find the least cost electricity generation mix in Alberta and British Columbia under different carbon policies. The long-term evolution of the electricity system is determined by minimizing net present cost of electricity generation for the time span of 2010-2060. Different levels of intertie capacity expansion are considered together with a variety of carbon tax and carbon cap scenarios. Results indicate that increased intertie capacity reduces the cost of electricity and emissions under carbon pricing policies. However, the expandable intertie does not encourage greater adoption of variable renewable generation. Instead, it is used to move low-cost energy from the United States to Alberta. The optimal intertie capacity and cost reduction of increased interconnectivity increases with more restrictive carbon policies.","[English, J.; Niet, T.; Lyseng, B.; Palmer-Wilson, K.; Keller, V.; Moazzen, I.; Pitt, L.; Wild, P.; Rowe, A.] Univ Victoria, Inst Integrated Energy Syst, 3800 Finnerty Rd, Victoria, BC V8W 3P6, Canada; [Niet, T.] British Columbia Inst Technol, Sch Energy, 3700 Willingdon Ave, Burnaby, BC V5G 3H2, Canada",University of Victoria; British Columbia Institute of Technology,"English, J (通讯作者)，Univ Victoria, Inst Integrated Energy Syst, 3800 Finnerty Rd, Victoria, BC V8W 3P6, Canada.",jre@uvic.ca,"Wild, Pascal/A-9585-2012","Niet, Taco/0000-0003-0266-2705; Rowe, Andrew/0000-0002-8749-9646; Wild, Peter/0000-0002-6826-0031",Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions (PICS),Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions (PICS),The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions (PICS).,,52,8,8,0,24,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2017,101.0,,,,,,571,581,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.10.026,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EI8PD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000392768800057,0

The current world population of 7.3 billion is projected to reach 8.5 billion by 2030 and 11.2 billion by 2100. Population growth and increasing energy access are incongruous with forecasts of declining non-renewable energy production and climate change concerns. Previous studies have examined these issues at global or at individual regional or national levels. Here we use a nine region model of the world with two per capita energy consumption scenarios to find that significant restructuring of the current energy mix will be necessary in order to support population projections. Modelled interaction between the regions highlights the importance of examining energy and population concerns in a systemic manner, as each of the nine regions faces unique energy-population challenges in the coming decades. As non-renewable energy reserves decline globally, the transition to a renewable energy infrastructure will develop at different times in each region.","[Warner, Kevin J.; Jones, Glenn A.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Sci, 1001 Texas Clipper Rd, Galveston, TX 77554 USA; [Warner, Kevin J.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Biol, 1001 Texas Clipper Rd, Galveston, TX 77554 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University System,"Warner, KJ (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Sci, 1001 Texas Clipper Rd, Galveston, TX 77554 USA.",kewarner@tamu.edu,,"Warner, Kevin/0000-0002-0155-852X",R & H Jenswold fellowship; J & J Whitworth fellowship; Texas Institute of Oceanography,R & H Jenswold fellowship; J & J Whitworth fellowship; Texas Institute of Oceanography,"IOW supported in part by R & H Jenswold and J & J Whitworth fellowships.

A limited understanding of the effects of gasoline properties on modern vehicle emissions is one obstacle for the establishment of stricter fuel standards in China. This study evaluated the effects of aromatic and olefin contents and T50 and T90 (defined as the 50%v and 90%v distillation temperatures) on tailpipe emissions from two gasoline direct injection (GDI) vehicles compliant with China 4 standards. Both gaseous and particulate emissions using different types of gasoline were measured. Changing aromatic and olefin contents had relatively small impacts on fuel consumption. Compared with olefins and T90, the regulated gaseous emissions were impacted more by aromatics and T50. Evident decreases of the particle mass (PM) and particle number (PN) emissions were found when the aromatic content and T90 decreased. Reducing the olefin content slightly decreased the PM emissions and increased the PN emissions. With decreasing T50, the PM emissions increased and the PN emissions slightly decreased. The results suggest that aromatic content and T90 should be decreased to reduce particle emissions from GDI vehicles. This study also provides some other suggestions for how to improve gasoline quality in China.","[Zhu, Rencheng; Bao, Xiaofeng] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Energy & Power Engn, Nanjing 210016, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Rencheng; Hu, Jingnan; Bao, Xiaofeng; He, Liqiang; Zu, Lei] Chinese Res Inst Environm Sci, State Environm Protect Key Lab Vehicle Emiss Cont, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China; [Hu, Jingnan] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Jiangsu Collaborat Innovat Ctr Atmospher Environm, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [He, Liqiang] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics; Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Tsinghua University,"Hu, JN (通讯作者)，Chinese Res Inst Environm Sci, 8 Dayangfang, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China.",zhurencheng2006@163.com; hujn@craes.org.cn; baoxf@craes.org.cn; heliqiang4@163.com; thierrymi123@sina.com,"He, Liqiang/AEG-5113-2022; Jiang, Yuan/JED-3759-2023; Zhu, Rencheng/AAX-2740-2021","He, Liqiang/0000-0002-4598-124X;",National Natural Science Foundation of China [21577135]; National Environmental Protection Research Projects for Public Welfare of China [201409013],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Environmental Protection Research Projects for Public Welfare of China,"This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 21577135); and the National Environmental Protection Research Projects for Public Welfare of China (grant number 201409013).

Impacts of alternative flow regimes on smolt production were examined under different physical mitigation scenarios using the minimum flow regime recently proposed by the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE) as a baseline. Different combinations of hydropower operational strategies and/or physical mitigation measures were examined together with changes in the minimum discharge using a series of linked simulation models with the objective of finding combinations that both increased smolt production and maintained power production. This methodology provided a toolbox for predicting both the potential tradeoffs between smolt production and power production and therefore the evaluation of the most cost-effective environmental flow regime. The main finding was that it was possible to achieve a similar smolt production with a lower hydropower plant flow release (with consequent lower power loss) than the flow regime proposed by the NVE. Introducing habitat modification measures further reduced the need for release of water in relation to the proposed minimum flow, while increasing the smolt production. In an economic cost-benefit analysis perspective, benefits per smolt from recreational fishing were small compared to hydropower costs per smolt, with hydropower losses determining optimal flow. This study concludes that the use of a modeling-based methodology to define a targeted environmental flow can be used to successfully balance the sometimes conflicting requirements of effective management of salmon populations while maintaining hydropower production.","[Bustos, Ana Adeva; Alfredsen, Knut] NTNU, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, SP Andersens 5, Trondheim, Norway; [Hedger, Richard David] Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, Hogskoleringen 9, N-7043 Trondheim, Norway; [Fjeldstad, Hans-Petter; Sundt, Hakon] SINTEF Energy Res, Sem Saelandsvei 11, N-7048 Trondheim, Norway; [Barton, David Nicholas] Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, Gaustadalleen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Norwegian Institute Nature Research; SINTEF; Norwegian Institute Nature Research,"Bustos, AA (通讯作者)，NTNU, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, SP Andersens 5, Trondheim, Norway.",ana.adeva.bustos@ntnu.no,"Hedger, Richard/D-8425-2011","Hedger, Richard/0000-0003-0236-3289; Adeva-Bustos, Ana/0000-0001-7655-784X",CEDREN; Norwegian Research Council [215934/E20],CEDREN; Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),"This research received funding from the CEDREN project EcoManage (Grant agreement from Norwegian Research Council, contract no. 215934/E20).

In consequence, the interpretation of the measures that have been used so far and are based on foreign trade calls for revision and updating. The paper is an attempt to compare the levels of globalization in the economies of the world's three largest exporters: the USA, China and Germany, measured with the export ratio, which, however, was broken down into a domestic and foreign component. The analysis comprised the years 2000-2014. The data from WIOT database were used for estimations. Based on the measure applied, it can be concluded that in the years considered the level of globalization in the economies of the USA and Germany increased. The case of China is different. The level of globalization in the Chinese economy grew in the years 2000-2006, only to fall afterwards. Eventually, in 2014 it recovered to the level achieved in 2000. The most globalized economy of the three under study was the German economy. It was characterized with the highest export ratio and the strongest geographical dispersion of exports (attesting to the strong connection with foreign economies in trade), as well as the highest share of value added content in exports and the highest share of the foreign component in the export ratio/GDP generation (which may be interpreted as the strongest connections with foreign economies in terms of production). The US economy was the least globalized economy. This is revealed in the lowest export ratio, the lowest share of value added content, and the lowest share of the foreign component in GDP generation.","[Fronczek, Malgorzata; Czech, Katarzyna] Univ Econ Katowice, 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Fronczek, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland.",malgorzata.fronczek@ue.katowice.pl; katarzyna.czech@uekat.pl,"Czech, Katarzyna/HNI-9110-2023; Fronczek, Malgorzata/W-1554-2018","Fronczek, Malgorzata/0000-0002-1502-1168",,,,,24,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,444,450,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059200059,0

The main point is that software architectures, similarly to what happens in SOA, are decomposed into very elementary tasks, that can be developed, maintained and deployed in isolation by small independent teams, and that compose an application by means of simple interactions. The resulting architecture is advocated to be more maintainable, less prone to failures, more agile, but obviously impacts on performances.

Our approach aims at giving a first approximation estimation of the behavior of different classes of microservice-based applications over a given system configuration, to characterize the infrastructure from the point of view of the service provider under a randomly generated realistic overall workload: to the best of our knowledge, there is not any other analogous decision support tool available in literature.","[Gribaudo, Marco] Politecn Milan, DEIB, Via Ponzio 51, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Iacono, Mauro] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, DMF, Viale Lincoln 5, I-81100 Caserta, Italy; [Manini, Daniele] Univ Turin, DI, Corso Svizzera 185, I-10129 Turin, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan; Universita della Campania Vanvitelli; University of Turin,"Gribaudo, M (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, DEIB, Via Ponzio 51, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",marco.gribaudo@polimi.it; mauro.iacono@unicampania.it; manini@di.unito.it,"Iacono, Mauro/G-2772-2011; GRIBAUDO, MARCO/AAI-5402-2021","Iacono, Mauro/0000-0002-2089-975X; GRIBAUDO, MARCO/0000-0002-1415-5287; MANINI, DANIELE/0000-0002-2080-1986",,,,,14,8,10,0,4,EUROPEAN COUNCIL MODELLING & SIMULATION,NOTTINGHAM,"SCHOOL COMPUTING & MATHEMATICS, NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV, BURTON STREET, NOTTINGHAM, NG1 4BU, ENGLAND",,,978-0-9932440-4-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,598,604,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Economics; Engineering, Industrial",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Engineering,BH9XI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404420000089,0

The inequality remains unchanged, despite efforts to harmonize accounting practices within the European Union, where partial directives are introduced into the legislation of individual sovereign states. Another area that the article will focus on is the area of disagreement in the assessment of long-term assets. There is a different impact of taxes on corporate income here, despite the efforts of establishing a fair tax base for corporations through CCCTB, which is a long-term property one of the components of the allocation formula. Different accounting definitions of long-term assets in individual countries have an impact on the varied depreciation rates applied and hence on the different levels of accounting costs, or on corporate profit. An equally negligible aspect is the different definition of long-term assets for tax purposes, which affects the amount of tax depreciation applied. The different definition of long-term assets for tax purposes then has a different degree of impact on the corporate income tax base. The aim of this paper is to define long-term assets under the laws of individual states, to analyze the collected information and comparison within the definition of the main differences in registration and depreciation of fixed assets among the surveyed countries.","[Kucharova, Ivana; Pfeiferova, Daniela; Sturcova, Anna] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Trade & Finance, Kamycka 129, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Kucharová, I; Pfeiferová, D (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Trade & Finance, Kamycka 129, Prague, Czech Republic.",kucharovai@pef.czu.cz; pfeiferova@pef.czu.cz; cerna.ani@gmail.com,"Pfeiferova, Daniela/H-2003-2018; Kucharova, Ivana/B-6148-2018","Kucharova, Ivana/0000-0001-5609-442X",,,,,17,1,1,1,4,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1211,1218,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059202022,0

That may be measured in several ways. One of them is, undoubtedly, via an indicator, the economic value added for shareholders (EVA Equity). It is a difference between equity rentability and the amount of alternative costs on equity multiplied by the value of equity. According to this indicator, we not only evaluate the enterprise ' s ability to generate value for shareholders, but we also measure its success on the market, especially on global capital markets. If EVA Equity results are positive, the investor, shareholder, has chosen a suitable investment opportunity at the given risk level. In case of a negative result, they should be considering a change of their investment priorities. The value added represents a very important enterprise indicator - it measures how the enterprise valorizes material incomes. Already according to the name, EVA Equity and value added are assumed to be based on the same inputs. Is it so in reality? The contribution sets its aim to identify dependency between value added and economical value added in the construction industry in the Czech Republic during the period of 2006 to 2015. The calculation is carried out on a collection of building enterprises in an observed period. To find a dependency, neural networks were used.

Web-based idea management (IMS), decision support (DSS) and innovation management systems (INMS) are a crucial part of this process being the nexus between various actors inside some of the largest and most important companies in the world. Based on previous researches by the authors there is a gap in the literature - terms for denominating these systems have been discussed and used, but the meanings are not strictly separated. The paper aims to clarify parities and disparities of IMS, DSS and INMS. It proposes definitions of these terms based on the parities and disparities of these terms. Research bridges this research gap theoretically by: (1) exploring terms denominating these systems by literature review in 7 scientific databases; (2) complementing the data using case studies. In the end of the research authors discuss possible implications, limitations, and future research directions. The paper provides not only theoretical, but also empirical insights about what are the main parities and disparities of IMS, DSS, INMS by demonstrating it by existing and applied systems. It suggests that the main parities of these systems are (1) aim to support decision-making processes and/or innovation, (2) they are manageable and systematic, (3) they are tools or tool kits, (4) web-based systems supports have potential in advancing international processes. Main disparities are revealed in created definitions of these terms.","[Mikelsone, Elina; Liela, Elita] BA Sch Business & Finance, K Valdemara St 161, LV-1018 Riga, Latvia",,"Mikelsone, E (通讯作者)，BA Sch Business & Finance, K Valdemara St 161, LV-1018 Riga, Latvia.",mikelsone.elina@gmail.com; elita.liela@ba.lv,,,,,,,18,0,0,1,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1566,1574,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059202065,0

The sustainability of public budgets affects not only the domestic economy but also affects international relations, foreign trade, the balance of payments and the country's position on an international business scale. It also directly affects the level of interest rates on government bonds and hence the financing of public debt management. To manage the public economy is thorough knowledge of the real decision-making and allocation mechanisms at all levels of public budgets. From a budgetary perspective, the public economy in the Czech Republic is characterized mainly by the state budget, 6.249 municipal budgets and 14 budgets of local government units, including budgets of state funds, public health insurance companies, state-owned enterprises and micro-regions. Indebtedness in 2015 was showed in 3.255 municipal budgets and in all 14 local government units, which are comparable to the situation 10 years ago. All of these all units are together subject to annual statutory audit, which mainly represents the analysis of the system of the Audit informative and monitoring indicators (ASIMI). Municipalities reported at the end of 2015 the total debt of EUR 3,10 billion and local government units of EUR 0,94 billion, which is by 3,0 % more than in the previous year. Municipalities and local government units currently show better indebtedness ratio than the state - of the total volume of public debt, it accounts for only 9%. The paper analyzes the outcome of the audit with the use of absolute and relative indicators and suggests possible changes and consolidation of municipal and local government budgets in the Czech Republic.","[Pospisil, Richard] Palacky Univ Olomouc, Dept Appl Econ, Olomouc, Czech Republic; [Oancea, Bogdan] Univ Bucharest, Fac Business & Adm, Bucharest, Romania; [Dragoescu, Raluca] Natl Inst Stat, Bucharest, Romania",Palacky University Olomouc; University of Bucharest,"Pospisil, R (通讯作者)，Palacky Univ Olomouc, Dept Appl Econ, Olomouc, Czech Republic.",richard.pospisil@upol.cz; bogdan.oancea@faa.unibuc.ro; dragoescuraluca@gmail.com,"Oancea, Bogdan/C-4147-2011","Oancea, Bogdan/0000-0001-6987-5137",Faculty of Arts of Palacky University [IGA_FF_2017_011],Faculty of Arts of Palacky University,"Work on this article is supported by the grant from the Faculty of Arts of Palacky University, IGA_FF_2017_011, Continuities and Discontinuities of Economy and Management in Past and Present.",,16,0,0,1,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2096,2103,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059204001,0

It is difficult to explain how a large extent of cooperation could evolve if individual free riding always provides higher benefits and chances of survival. In absence of direct reciprocation, it has been suggested that indirect reciprocity could potentially solve the problem of large scale cooperation. In this paper, we compare the chances of two forms of indirect reciprocity with each other: a blind one that rewards any partner who did good to previous partners, and an embedded one that conditions cooperation on good acts towards common acquaintances. We show that these two versions of indirect reciprocal strategies are not very different from each other in their efficiency. We also demonstrate that their success very much relies on the speed of evolution: their chances for survival are only present if evolutionary updates are not frequent.

As a result, the main objective of the article is to conduct quantitative analysis of conditions and factors influencing entrepreneurship in Poland at regional level (NUTS 3 level). In the research the factors influencing entrepreneurship are treated as multivariate phenomena. As a result, a taxonomic approach was applied here. In order to quantify the conditions influencing entrepreneurship zero-unitarization method was used for obtaining a synthetic measure of development of the analyzed phenomenon. Based on the obtained measure a ranking of Polish NUTS 3 regions for the years 2010-2015 was obtained, which provides the information on the best regions for entrepreneurs and the worst once. The research confirmed significant disparities in regard to the conditions influencing entrepreneurship at regional level, which should be the object of interests of Polish authorities.

When coaching culture is implemented, it is important to continuously develop the skills of workers and constantly promote development opportunities, coaching supervision and quality assessment processes. Coaching is a way to more effectively manage people at all levels of the business. The basis for a sustainable coaching strategy and culture are firm foundation. The paper also presents the proposal where the assumptions and the implementation process of coaching culture into the organization are stated. A very important factor is the thorough preparation for change. Top management is undergoing intensive training based on practical exercises and training. Workshops include the individual coaching, team coaching, and support through peer coaching supervision and mentoring, to help managers acquire and improve their skills. The result is a firm belief of function of management style by coaching and it is therefore appropriate to implement a coaching culture to a whole organization.

Businesses, under the pressure of competition or the public, not only increasingly streamline their processes, but are trying to improve their image in the public perception as well as their regular and potential customers. Therefore, many companies apply so-called socially responsible entrepreneurship (SRE), which adapt to the external and internal environments. The corporate social responsibility (CSR) is committed to ethical behaviour promoting ethical decision-making, especially at top management levels. It is precisely the question of CSR and ethical decision-making that becomes a burning problem of our society - in a global, national and local concept.

While it is clear that the rationale behind and mechanisms by which social housing is provided and managed varies greatly between the countries, due to globalization some common trends may be distinguished, e.g. limiting the scope of government intervention in the sphere of housing, as well as cutting public expenditures in this segment. The consequence is a progressive decentralization of housing policy and privatization of tasks related to housing. In many European countries, there is a notion that the system of new social housing provision should not only be socially, but also financially effective. Therefore, social housing actors are challenged to market-orient their statutory tasks in the light of rising constraints: dwindling financial backup, growing needs for affordable housing, and very often lack of cost recovery. The study focuses on the Swedish social housing system as it is a model that is undergoing extensive changes, i.e. marketisation of the social housing sector. The paper presents changes to the model and discusses whether they map a different trajectory for the future of social housing in Sweden.","[Suszynska, Katarzyna] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Suszynska, K (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Poznan, Poland.",katarzyna.suszynska@ue.poznan.pl,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,4,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2579,2585,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059204063,0

This article reveals the nature of such phenomena as interpenetration, deterritorialization, contamination, pluralism and hybridization of culture that influence the behavior of consumers on the global markets. It also exposes the extent of differences or similarities in behavior of consumers from different cultures/countries, identified in the course of the review of 86 international studies of cross-cultural variations in consumer behavior conducted over a 17-year period from 2000 to 2016. The studies, published in the leading international peer-reviewed journals, were selected based on 19 criteria and grouped into three categories: study description, market description and characteristics of culture. In this article the author uses content analysis to systemize approaches to implementation of results of research of cross-cultural variations in consumer behavior in international marketing. The author concludes that while marketing strategy of differentiation currently prevails, the above-mentioned phenomena may cause this pattern to significantly change in the future.","[Timokhina, Galina] Ural State Univ Econ, Ekaterinburg, Russia",Ural State University of Economics,"Timokhina, G (通讯作者)，Ural State Univ Econ, Ekaterinburg, Russia.",Galinatimokhina@yandex.ru,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2674,2681,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059205009,0

According to a number of experts, it is an expression of a certain crisis of a social order which was to serve all its members. The current concept of globalisation, which was originally supposed to serve only the interests of large corporations, finds itself in the crisis. The cause is obvious. It is the surplus of profit over the interests of employees and customers, over public and social interests. The aim of our time should then be a new interpretation of the notion of education that would equip us with the ability to support human development with regard to sustainable development. We perceive education as a constant process of increasing learning, improving human skills and as a means of personal development and building relationships between individuals, groups, and peoples. The paper addresses lifelong learning, which is of great importance nowadays. The lifelong learning has contributed to the creation of new jobs and the emergence of many institutions. The pressure of companies on employees' skills is on the rise all over the world with a new name arising: a learning society. The aim of the paper is to analyse the lifelong learning of employees in the public sector and to assess the importance of lifelong learning in the non-profit sector. The secondary objective of the paper is to identify the interest of public sector employees in the lifelong learning.

The results show that occupational and educational related variety are positively correlated with productivity growth, which supports the conceptual discussion put forth in the paper.

This represents a way forward for governments, international finance institutions, and entrepreneurs to address some of the challenges of energy access. However, little is understood about how consumption has evolved among these newly-electrified customers. In this paper, we address this by conducting a longitudinal analysis for 136k utility customers across Kenya over six years of electricity bills, uncovering critical trends in spatio-temporal evolution of electricity consumption. Our analysis reveals that recently-electrified customers are reaching their steady-state consumption more quickly than previous customers, that the steady-state is increasingly less, and that typical urban and peri-urban customers tend to consume 50% more electricity than rural customers. In addition we present implications for policymakers and electricity planners considering grid extension and distributed systems for improving electrification.","[Fobi, Simone; Modi, Vijay] Columbia Univ, Dept Mech Engn, QSEL Lab, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Deshpande, Varun; Taneja, Jay] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, STIMA Lab, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Ondiek, Samson] Kenya Power, Business Strategy, Nairobi, Kenya",Columbia University; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Taneja, J (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, STIMA Lab, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",jtaneja@umass.edu,,,,,,,21,28,35,1,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2018,123.0,,,,,,569,578,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.065,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HE6FW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000453499700056,0

The focus is on the technological knowledge transfer through the technical cooperation of foreign aid. As transferred knowledge accumulates, the recipient country's technological capacity increases. To better understand this accumulating capacity, this study explores the effect of foreign aid as a channel of technology transfer on the recipients' technological capacity in the renewable energy sector. To investigate the effect of hands-on assistance, the empirical model estimates the long-term effects of foreign-aid disbursements for non-hydro renewable energy (NHRE) projects. I find that foreign aid for technical cooperation in NHRE projects catalyzes investments in NHRE capacity in low-income countries with a long incubation period. The findings confirm that hands-on cooperation, as emphasized by developing countries, contributes to their capacity building, although only in countries with low capacity to begin with.

As the quality and quantity of oil extracted changes, in response to changes in end uses and in response to biophysical limitations, it is important to understand the metabolism of oil extraction - i.e. the relation between the inputs used and the output extracted. We formalize a methodology to describe oil extraction based on the distinction between functional and structural elements, using the Multi-Scale Integrated Analysis of Societal and Ecosystem Metabolism (MuSIASEM) to generate a diagnostic of the performance of oil extraction and to build scenarios. The analysis allows generating modular benchmarks which are applicable to other countries. It is shown that oil extraction in Ecuador consumes, per cubic meter of crude oil extracted, over 100 kWh of electricity and 1.5 GJ of fuels, requiring 3 kW of power capacity and 2 h of human activity. A scenario is developed to check the effects on Ecuador's metabolic pattern of an increase in oil production over the next five years. The strength of the proposed methodology is highlighted, focusing on the adaptability of the method for dealing with policy issues.","[Parra, Rony; Ramos-Martin, Jesus] Univ Reg Amazon Ikiam, Grp Poblac & Ambiente, Via Muyuna Atacapi,Km 7, Tena 150102, Ecuador; [Parra, Rony; Jane Di Felice, Louisa; Giampietro, Mario] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Giampietro, Mario] ICREA, Pg Lluis Co 23, Barcelona 08010, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; ICREA,"Parra, R (通讯作者)，Univ Reg Amazon Ikiam, Grp Poblac & Ambiente, Via Muyuna Atacapi,Km 7, Tena 150102, Ecuador.;Parra, R (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol, Bellaterra 08193, Spain.",rony.parra@ikiam.edu.ec; louisajane.difelice@uab.cat; mario.giampietro@uab.cat; jesus.ramos@ikiam.edu.ec,"Ramos-Martin, Jesus/C-7105-2008; Di Felice, Louisa/AAC-9856-2022; Giampietro, Mario/F-6874-2016","Ramos-Martin, Jesus/0000-0002-1057-3545; Di Felice, Louisa/0000-0003-3375-5242; Giampietro, Mario/0000-0002-5569-7023",European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme [689669]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [MDM-2015-0552],European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"JRM acknowledges support from the project HAR2016-76814-C2-1-P AEI/FEDER, UE, Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness.

Controlling for an extensive set of firm-level characteristics, we find that certain regional characteristics matter for innovation persistency of firms. In particular, those firms located in regions with: (i) thicker labour market or (ii) higher extent of knowledge spillover exhibit higher probability of being persistent innovators up to 14 percentage points.

We calculated the costs of the invasive worm Marenzelleria in the Baltic Sea, which affects the capacity of the seabed to store nutrients, by combining the production function and replacement cost methods. The nutrient storage capacity is then regarded as an input to nutrient cleaning of the sea, with reduced capacity implying higher costs of reaching nutrient reduction targets. We developed a simple dynamic model which captured the effect of Marenzelleria on the decay rates of nutrient pools in different interconnected sea basins of the Baltic Sea. Evidence and numerical estimates indicated a decrease in sequestration of phosphorus in the different sea basins caused by occurrence of the invasive worm. The total discounted cost of this decrease was estimated for two different international nutrient policy scenarios; cost-effective abatement and current international agreement on country targets. The results showed large differences in total abatement costs between these scenarios, but the calculated cost of the species were similar. The estimated cost ranged between 290 and 1094 billion SEK, depending on the effect of Marenzelleria on sequestration of phosphorus. The average annual cost corresponds to 0.03-0.13% of total gross domestic product of the nine coastal countries. However, the cost was unevenly distributed among the countries, with Poland bearing the largest share because of its large phosphorus loads and access to low-cost abatement options.","[Gren, Ing-Marie] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, Box 7013, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Sandman, Antonia Nystrom; Naslund, Johan] AquaBiota Water Res, Stockholm, Sweden; [Naslund, Johan] Swedish Environm Protect Agcy, Stockholm, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Gren, IM (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, Box 7013, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",ing-marie.gren@slu.se; antonia.sandman@aquabiota.se; Johan.Naslund@aquabiota.se,"Naslund, Johan/B-3076-2012","Naslund, Johan/0000-0002-7296-1463; Nystrom Sandman, Antonia/0000-0002-4511-6176",Swedish Environmental Protection Agency [13/132],Swedish Environmental Protection Agency,"We are much indebted to the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency for funding the project 'Value of underwater habitat ecosystem services' (VALUES), with grant number 13/132.",,45,7,7,2,29,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4284,,,WATER RESOUR ECON,Water Resour.

Some policy must be chosen for the fair and efficient rationing of power, however, transmission constraints and unreliabile generation can make it difficult to achieve a particular allocation of power. We develop methods to quantify the trade-off between maximising the total amount of power delivered and distributing the available power in a fairer way. To do so, we model a common situation in which the system operator minimises load shedding, subject to exogenous proportional allocation targets for different regions. We then explore how the level of permitted deviation from the target affects the level of load shedding. This minimisation problem is mathematically challenging, but we develop an efficient solution method for it based on Lagrangian decomposition. We apply our methods to a case study of the Nigerian Power system and analyse the Pareto frontiers between efficiency and fairness obtained under different specifications of the problem. In our case study, we show that current Nigerian policies reduce the total amount of power delivered by up to 5%, but that enforcing policies over a longer time horizon substantially reduces this efficiency penalty.","[Heggie, Alastair] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Engn, Inst Energy Syst, Kings Bldg,Mayfield Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JL, Midlothian, Scotland; [Eager, Dan] EMRC, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [McKinnon, Ken] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Math, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Van Der Weijde, Adriaan H.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Engn, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Van Der Weijde, Adriaan H.] Alan Turing Inst, London, England",University of Edinburgh; University of Edinburgh; University of Edinburgh,"Heggie, A (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Sch Engn, Inst Energy Syst, Kings Bldg,Mayfield Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JL, Midlothian, Scotland.",a.heggie@ed.ac.uk; dan.eager@energy-mrc.com; K.McKinnon@ed.ac.uk; H.Vanderweijde@ed.ac.uk,"van der Weijde, Adriaan Hendrik/AAN-3878-2021","van der Weijde, Adriaan Hendrik/0000-0002-6822-5527",University of Edinburgh; EMRC,University of Edinburgh; EMRC,The authors would like to thank EMRC (http://energy-mrc.co.uk/) for their help in the preparation of this paper.

It is shown that the Brazilian gas demand does not have a seasonal characteristic; instead, the demand is volatile of a random nature associated with the demand from thermal power plants, which are complementary to hydropower generation. This paper has proved that there is an important economic value associated with the storage of gas in periods of low power prices and its consumption in period of high power prices. Finally, this paper argues that it is essential to seek mechanisms to include the economic value of UGS for the power sector into the UGS regulation and market design, as well as to explore the possibility of making gas storage a resource for the power sector operation.","[Uchoa Cavalcanti Almeida, Jose Ricardo; Torres, Ednildo Andrade; Mendonca Freires, Francisco Gaudencio] Univ Fed Bahia, Interdisciplinary Ctr Energy & Environm, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Fagundes De Almeida, Edmar Luiz] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Econ, Energy Econ Grp, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Universidade Federal da Bahia; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"Almeida, JRUC (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Bahia, Interdisciplinary Ctr Energy & Environm, Salvador, BA, Brazil.",almeida.jose@ufba.br,"TORRES, EDNILDO ANDRADE/AAC-6115-2020; Freires, Francisco Gaudencio Mendonça/AAQ-9319-2020","Freires, Francisco Gaudencio Mendonça/0000-0001-9622-8242; Almeida, Jose Ricardo Uchoa Cavalcanti/0000-0002-1133-1011",,,,,24,13,16,0,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2018,121.0,,,,,,488,497,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.07.005,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV3HA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445983800048,0

The results indicate that the overall EROIsoc was around 27:1 in the early 1960s, and was volatile for a period of time before stabilizing at around 45:1 in 1974 after establishing a strong mix of renewable energy. These findings further show that Icelanders have generally had access to energy sources with higher EROI than if they had relied on fossil fuels, except for the period between 1963 and 1967. If they had relied on fossil fuels alone, Icelanders would now have access to combined resources with an EROI of around 16:1, likely too low for prosperity, and an even lower EROI for long periods of time. Regarding policies, this paper shows that relying on an energy grid mix with an EROI higher than 20-30:1, especially for island nations, has the potential to raise the standard of living greatly. For policymakers in island nations, attention should be given to this relationship between high-EROI energy sources with low price volatility and the standard of living.","[Atlason, Reynir Smari] Univ Southern Denmark, Fac Engn, Dept Chem Engn Biotechnol & Environm Tech, SDU Life Cycle Engn, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark,"Atlason, RS (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Fac Engn, Dept Chem Engn Biotechnol & Environm Tech, SDU Life Cycle Engn, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense, Denmark.",resa@iti.sdu.dk,,"Atlason, Reynir Smari/0000-0002-6860-3348",,,,,25,2,2,0,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2018,120.0,,,,,,52,57,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.069,0.0,,,6,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO6DC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440123300005,0

Such findings inform us about the effectiveness of telecommuting policies that try to alleviate congestion and transport-related emissions, but they also stress that the geography of labour markets is changing due to information technology. We argue that estimates of the effect of working from home on commuting time may be biased because of sorting based on residential- and commuting preferences. In this paper we investigate the relationship between telecommuting and commuting time, controlling for preference-based sorting. We use 7 waves of data from the Dutch Labour Supply Panel and show that on average telecommuters have higher marginal cost of one-way commuting time, compared to non-telecommuters. We estimate the effect of telecommuting on commuting time using a fixed effects approach, and we show that preference-based sorting biases cross-sectional results upwards. This suggests that the bias due to sorting based on residential preferences is strongest. Working from home allows people to accept 5% longer commuting times on average, and every additional 8 h of working from home are associated with 3.5% longer commuting times.","[de Vos, Duco; Meijers, Evert; van Ham, Maarten] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Julianalaan 134, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands; [van Ham, Maarten] Univ St Andrews, Sch Geog & Geosci, Irvine Bldg,North St, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fyfe, Scotland",Delft University of Technology; University of St Andrews,"de Vos, D (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Julianalaan 134, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands.",d.w.devos@tudelft.nl,"van Ham, Maarten/AAA-6263-2020; Meijers, Evert/C-2143-2012; Meijers, Evert/AAW-1909-2021","van Ham, Maarten/0000-0002-2106-0702; Meijers, Evert/0000-0002-0031-6828; Meijers, Evert/0000-0002-0031-6828; de Vos, Duco/0000-0002-5161-3101",Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (NL) [452-14-004],Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (NL),Funding was provided by Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (NL) (Grant No. 452-14-004).,,38,40,44,1,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

A learning curve analysis is conducted on an original dataset of 312 Chinese wind farms under the Clean Development Mechanism. A key strength of the dataset is that it includes data on actual, wind-farm level power generation. The analysis, based on third-party verified data, reveals that the experience and knowledge accumulation did not result in improvements in generation performance, turbine size, or unit turbine costs of Chinese wind farms. Rather, generation performance was driven by capital investments (i.e., larger and more expensive wind farms performed better). Turbine cost reductions were achieved by intense price competition which hampered investments in technology improvement and quality assurance. The Chinese wind power case demonstrates how market expansion, in the absence of carefully designed innovation policies that complement deployment policies, does not necessarily lead to technological learning. Fostering the technological capability of local industry can take a long time. When scale-up happens quickly, it is crucial to develop and refine local technological capability.","[Hayashi, Daisuke] Ritsumeikan Univ, Dept Int Relat, Kyoto, Japan; [Hayashi, Daisuke] Univ Zurich, Dept Polit Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Huenteler, Joern] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Zurich, Switzerland; [Lewis, Joanna, I] Georgetown Univ, Edmund A Walsh Sch Foreign Serv, Sci Technol & Int Affairs Program, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Ritsumeikan University; University of Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Georgetown University,"Hayashi, D (通讯作者)，56-1 Toji In Kitamachi,Kita Ku, Kyoto 6008577, Japan.",dhayashi@fc.ritsumei.ac.jp,,"Lewis, Joanna I./0000-0002-5362-1308","JSPS KAKENHI [15K16163]; National Science Foundation [1262452]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K16163] Funding Source: KAKEN; SBE Off Of Multidisciplinary Activities; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1262452] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); SBE Off Of Multidisciplinary Activities; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This work was partly supported by JSPS KAKENHI [Grant number 15K16163] and the National Science Foundation [Award number 1262452].

To this end, a comprehensive database of commercial Light Water Reactors (LWR) was developed and a statistical analysis was conducted. Findings reveal a significant delay in lead-time, especially for the last generation reactors constructed from 2010s, with 3/4 of the sample showing significant construction delays. This results in an escalation of capital costs rather than in a decline. Average OCC of newer reactors is 60% higher than the ones implemented in the earlier stages of the nuclear era. This suggests a discontinuity of the learning curve for both OCC and lead-time, which threats the market and financial sustainability of current and future nuclear energy projects. Although this is a general trend, this discontinuity is country specific and, thus, induced by national policies and regulatory frameworks. Therefore, the role of nuclear technology as an alternative to cope with the need for a decarbonisation of the power sector must be better evaluated, taking into account the real cost impacts of nuclear technology implementation.","[Portugal-Pereira, J.; Szklo, A.; Schaeffer, R.] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Ctr Tecnol, Energy Planning Program, Grad Sch Engn, Bloco C,Sala 211,Cidade Univ, BR-21941972 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Portugal-Pereira, J.] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, Weeks Bldg 16-18 Princes Gardens, London SW7 1BA, England; [Ferreira, P.; Cunha, J.; Araujo, M.] Univ Minho, ALGORITMI Ctr, Sch Engn, Campus Azurem, P-4800058 Guimaraes, Portugal",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Imperial College London; Universidade do Minho,"Portugal-Pereira, J (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, Weeks Bldg 16-18 Princes Gardens, London SW7 1BA, England.",j.portugal@imperial.ac.uk,"Araujo, Madalena T/I-2673-2013; Szklo, Alexandre/AAP-8970-2021; Pereira, Joana/IQT-1620-2023; Cunha, Jorge/M-6099-2013; Portugal-Pereira, Joana/ABF-1654-2020; Schaeffer, Roberto/AAY-4357-2020; Ferreira, Paula/H-8646-2012; Szklo, Alexandre/C-3315-2013; Schaeffer, Roberto/F-9262-2012","Araujo, Madalena T/0000-0002-3515-0135; Cunha, Jorge/0000-0002-6267-708X; Portugal-Pereira, Joana/0000-0003-1260-6950; Ferreira, Paula/0000-0002-3712-4803; Szklo, Alexandre/0000-0002-7101-1810; Schaeffer, Roberto/0000-0002-3709-7323","Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development agency (CNPq) [166074/2015-2]; Marie Curie International Research Staff Exchange Scheme Fellowship within the 7th European Union Framework Programme, under the project NETEP- European Brazilian Network on Energy Planning [PIRSES-GA-2013-612263]","Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development agency (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)Fundacao de Apoio a Pesquisa do Distrito Federal (FAPDF)); Marie Curie International Research Staff Exchange Scheme Fellowship within the 7th European Union Framework Programme, under the project NETEP- European Brazilian Network on Energy Planning(European Union (EU))","This work was funded by the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development agency (CNPq) (166074/2015-2) and the Marie Curie International Research Staff Exchange Scheme Fellowship within the 7th European Union Framework Programme, under the project NETEP- European Brazilian Network on Energy Planning (PIRSES-GA-2013-612263).

Considering the great contribution of power industry on the energy-related CO2 emissions and its main role for peaking China's CO2 emissions prior to 2030, this study aims to investigate the peaking time of CO2 emissions in China's power industry from a regional perspective. Only each regional power industry tries its best to peak its carbon emissions prior to 2030, will China's power industry achieve its carbon emissions peak by 2030. Consequently, we develop a National Energy Technology-Power (NET-Power) model to assess the impacts of technological improvement and energy structure shift on the carbon emissions for each region, and further answer the question of carbon emissions peak in the power industry. The results show that when taking joint actions of promoting advanced technologies and shifting to more renewable energy, China's power industry could peak its CO2 emissions at 3717.99MtCO(2) in 2023. All regional power industries will achieve the goals of peaking their CO2 emissions by 2030 except East. The detailed development pathways of power-generation technologies for achieving the peak prior to 2030 in each region are drawn.","[Tang, Baojun; Li, Ru; Yu, Biying; An, Runying; Wei, Yi-Ming] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, 5 South Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Tang, Baojun; Li, Ru; Yu, Biying; An, Runying; Wei, Yi-Ming] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Tang, Baojun; Li, Ru; Yu, Biying; An, Runying; Wei, Yi-Ming] Beijing Key Lab Energy Econ & Environm Management, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Tang, Baojun; Yu, Biying] Sustainable Dev Res Inst Econ & Soc Beijing, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Tang, Baojun] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Elect Vehicles Beijing, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Beijing Institute of Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology,"Yu, BY (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",tang_baojun@126.com; liru1001@163.com; yubiying_bj@bit_edu.cn; anrunying_bit@hotmail.com; wei@bit.edu.cn,,"An, Runying/0000-0001-6412-9565","National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFA0602603]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71573013, 71603020, 71521002, 71642004]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation of China [9152014]; Special Items Fund for Cultivation and Development of Beijing Creative Base [Z171100002217023]; Key Project of Beijing Social Science Foundation Research Base [15DJA084]; Special Items Fund of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education",National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Natural Science Foundation of China(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); Special Items Fund for Cultivation and Development of Beijing Creative Base; Key Project of Beijing Social Science Foundation Research Base; Special Items Fund of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education,"The authors acknowledge financial support received through National Key R&D Program of China (2016YFA0602603) and from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 71573013, 71603020, 71521002, 71642004), the Beijing Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 9152014), Special Items Fund for Cultivation and Development of Beijing Creative Base (Grant No. Z171100002217023), Key Project of Beijing Social Science Foundation Research Base (Grant No. 15DJA084), and Special Items Fund of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education.",,38,97,108,33,294,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2018,120.0,,,,,,365,381,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.067,0.0,,,17,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO6DC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440123300035,0

This paper contributes to this literature through an analysis of multiple projected sources of biomass demand growth in different regions of the world using a detailed intertemporal optimization model of the global forest sector. Given the range of current policies incentivizing bioenergy expansion globally, evaluating the combined global implications of regional bioenergy expansion efforts is critical for understanding the extent to which renewable energy supplied from forest biomass can contribute to various policy goals (including GHG emissions mitigation). Unlike previous studies that have been more regionally focused, this study provides a global perspective, illustrating how large potential demand increases for forest biomass in one or multiple regions can alter future forest management trends, markets, and forest carbon sequestration in key timber supply regions. Results show that potential near term (2015-2030) biomass demand growth in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere can drive forest resource investment at the intensive and extensive margins, resulting in a net increase in forest carbon stocks for most regions of the world. When the reallocation of biomass away from traditional pulp and sawtimber markets is accounted for, net forest carbon sequestration increases (that stored on the land and in wood products) by 9.4 billion tons CO2 over the near term and 15.4 billion tons CO2 by 2095. Even if most of the increased forest biomass demand arises from one region (e.g., Europe) due to a particularly strong promotion of forest bioenergy expansion, changes in forest management globally in anticipation of this demand increase could result in carbon beneficial outcomes that can be shared by most regions.

Moreover, the organizational structures associated with single-plant and multi-plant firms, generate different plant performance outcomes of knowledge variety.","[Ostbring, Lisa; Eriksson, Rikard; Lindgren, Urban] Umea Univ, Dept Geog & Econ Hist, S-90187 Umea, Sweden",Umea University,"Östbring, L (通讯作者)，Umea Univ, Dept Geog & Econ Hist, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",lisa.ostbring@umu.se; rikard.eriksson@umu.se; urban.lindgren@umu.se,,,,,,,49,8,8,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

The results were achieved using large proportions of 'integration biomasses'. The concept of Land Efficiency is verified because the first constituent of the formula (land efficiency) is much higher than the second one (biomethane yield of monocrops). The outcome of this study indicates clearly that 'integration biomasses' in the Sicilian context are among those which produce advanced biofuels. All by-products and wastes from the agrifood sector are necessary to produce about 562 million Nm(3)/year of biomethane in Sicily for 2030 (about 8% of the Italian one), allocating only 28,000 ha for the monocrops for the anaerobic digesters.","[Selvaggi, Roberta; Pappalardo, Gioacchino; Chinnici, Gaetano] Univ Catania, Dept Agr Food & Environm Di3A, Via S Sofia 98-100, I-95123 Catania, Italy; [Fabbri, Claudio I.] CRPA, Viale Timavo 43-2, I-42121 Reggio Emilia, Italy",University of Catania,"Selvaggi, R (通讯作者)，Univ Catania, Dept Agr Food & Environm Di3A, Via S Sofia 98-100, I-95123 Catania, Italy.",roberta.selvaggi@unict.it; gioacchino.pappalardo@unict.it; chinnici@unict.it; c.fabbri@crpa.it,"Chinnici, Gaetano/E-9681-2016; Pappalardo, Gioacchino/F-7624-2016; Selvaggi, Roberta/AAD-1798-2020","Chinnici, Gaetano/0000-0002-4728-646X; Pappalardo, Gioacchino/0000-0002-8312-0862; Selvaggi, Roberta/0000-0003-1207-8844",Italian Ministry of Agriculture (MIPAAF) [E62F15000380005],Italian Ministry of Agriculture (MIPAAF),"This research was conducted within the framework of the research project INNOBIOMED (ID number E62F15000380005), financially supported by Italian Ministry of Agriculture (MIPAAF).",,39,31,31,4,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2018,119.0,,,,,,689,695,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.039,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO0XY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439671200063,0

Vigorously developing new energy sources has become an important way to reduce CO2 emissions. Therefore, more and more scholars have studied effective ways to promote the development of new energy industry. However, most of the existing research use single-equation linear models or static models to study the driving forces of the new energy industry. This not only ignores the large number of dynamic relationships between economic variables, but also produces endogeneity problems. In order to overcome the shortcomings of existing research, this paper uses vector auto regressive model to study the new energy industry. The results show that energy consumption structure has a positive effect on the new energy industry in the short run, but the effect is limited in the long run. The impact of the agriculture industry is gradually narrowing over time due to the gradual reduction of crop acreage. However, the influence of economic growth is positive both in the short and long run. This is due to the gradual optimization of industrial structure. Technological progress produces a similar impact, owing to continued investment in research and development funding as well as research and development personnel.","[Lin, Boqiang] China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Sch Management, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Xu, Bin] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Xu, Bin] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Res Ctr Appl Stat, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics; Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics,"Bin, X (通讯作者)，Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",xubin9675@163.com,"Lin, Boqiang/G-3960-2010","Lin, Boqiang/0000-0002-1308-400X; Xu, Bin/0000-0003-3581-7603","Xiamen University - Newcastle University Joint Strategic Partnership Fund; Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy [1260-Z0210011]; Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding [1260-Y07200]; National Social Science Foundation of China [15BTJ022, 16BTJ011]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71663024, 71563014]; Jiangxi Soft Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province [20151BBA10037, 20161BBA10042]; Science and Technology Foundation of Department of Education in Jiangxi Province [GJJ160441]; Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of Department of Education in Jiangxi Province [TJ161001]",Xiamen University - Newcastle University Joint Strategic Partnership Fund; Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy; Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding; National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Jiangxi Soft Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province; Science and Technology Foundation of Department of Education in Jiangxi Province; Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of Department of Education in Jiangxi Province,"The paper is supported by Xiamen University - Newcastle University Joint Strategic Partnership Fund, the Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy (No: 1260-Z0210011), and Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding (No: 1260-Y07200), National Social Science Foundation of China (No: 15BTJ022; 16BTJ011), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71663024; 71563014), Jiangxi Soft Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province (No. 20151BBA10037; 20161BBA10042), the Science and Technology Foundation of Department of Education in Jiangxi Province (No. GJJ160441), and the Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of Department of Education in Jiangxi Province (No. TJ161001).",,65,44,45,10,74,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2018,118.0,,,,,,390,403,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.003,0.0,,,14,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ1TF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000435050000035,0

This paper takes an instrumental variable (IV) approach to establish individual-unit test statistics for no cointegration that are robust to variance non-stationarity. The sign of a fitted departure from long-run equilibrium is used as an instrument when estimating an error-correction model. The resulting IV-based test is shown to follow a chi-square limiting null distribution irrespective of the variance pattern of the data-generating process. In spite of this, the test proposed here has, unlike previous work relying on instrumental variables, competitive local power against sequences of local alternatives in 1/T-neighbourhoods of the null. The standard limiting null distribution motivates, using the single-unit tests in a multiple testing approach for cointegration in multi-country data sets by combining P-values from individual units. Simulations suggest good performance of the single-unit and multiple testing procedures under various plausible designs of cross-sectional correlation and cross-unit cointegration in the data. An application to the equilibrium relationship between short- and long-term interest rates illustrates the dramatic differences between results of robust and non-robust tests.","[Demetrescu, Matei] Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Inst Stat & Econometr, Olshausenstr 40-60, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Hanck, Christoph] Univ Duisburg Essen, Fac Econ, Univ Str 12, D-45117 Essen, Germany",University of Kiel; University of Duisburg Essen,"Demetrescu, M (通讯作者)，Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Inst Stat & Econometr, Olshausenstr 40-60, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",mdeme@stat-econ.uni-kiel.de; christoph.hanck@vwl.uni-due.de,"Demetrescu, Matei/ABD-6488-2021","Demetrescu, Matei/0000-0003-0815-5384","German Research Foundation (DFG) [DE 1617/4-1, HA 6766/2-2]",German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The authors thank the editor, two anonymous referees, as well as Yoosoon Chang for very useful comments and remarks.

Here, we quantitatively measure the impact of energy data revisions on China's ability to achieve its mitigation targets. Our results indicate the following effects of data revisions: 1. Mitigation challenges have increased by 5%, and the achievement of national mitigation targets (as well as international pledges) might be postponed by two years. 2. Greater than expected carbon space or emission quota (from 22.94 to 31.31 Gt) will be obtained from 2015 to 2035. 3. CO2 peak levels may become highly uncertain, with the uncertainty varying from 12% to 29%. In addition to national mitigation targets, data revision has profound implications for key industrial sectors. For example, raw coal consumption by the cement and iron and steel industries has long been underestimated, bringing uncertainty to the achievement of industrial mitigation targets. Our results reveal considerable uncertainty in China's energy data, and this uncertainty suggests that previous mitigation achievements have been overestimated and that the mitigation targets, carbon space values, and peak level estimates proposed by future mitigation schemes may not be reached.","[Zheng, Heran; Shan, Yuli; Ou, Jiamin; Schroeder, Heike; Guan, Dabo] Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Mi, Zhifu] UCL, Bartlett Sch Construct & Project Management, London WC1H 0QB, England; [Meng, Jing] Univ Cambridge, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Cambridge CB3 9DT, England",University of East Anglia; University of London; University College London; University of Cambridge,"Shan, YL; Guan, DB (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",Yuli.Shan@uea.ac.uk; Dabo.guan@uea.ac.uk,"Zheng, Heran/GSE-6466-2022; Guan, Dabo/Y-2406-2019; Shan, Yuli/N-7747-2015; Meng, Jing/J-9740-2013; Guan, Dexin/I-4184-2018; Mi, Zhifu/P-1027-2019","Zheng, Heran/0000-0003-0818-7933; Guan, Dabo/0000-0003-3773-3403; Shan, Yuli/0000-0002-5215-8657; Meng, Jing/0000-0001-8708-0485; Mi, Zhifu/0000-0001-8106-0694; Schroeder, Heike/0000-0003-2342-2030","National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFA0602604]; Natural Science Foundation of China [71533005, 41629501]; UK Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L016028/1]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/N00714X/1]; British Academy Grant [AF150310]; China Scholarship Council [201606510016]; Leverhulme Trust; Social Sciences Faculty Postgraduate Studentships at the University of East Anglia; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L016028/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/N00714X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/L016028/1] Funding Source: UKRI; NERC [NE/N00714X/1] Funding Source: UKRI",National Key R&D Program of China; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); UK Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); British Academy Grant; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust); Social Sciences Faculty Postgraduate Studentships at the University of East Anglia; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"All the data and results can be download freely from China Emission Accounts and Datasets (CEADs) at http://www.ceads.net.

Further, we show that the impact of such biases on the total number of votes a candidate receives is fairly limited and hence is likely to affect the outcome of this competition only on rare occasions where the difference in quality between the leading candidates is small. Finally, analysing the incidence of strategic voting', we find jury members who vote for one leading candidate are more, rather than less, likely to also give points to his main competitor, as compared with neutral jury members.

Results found that 70-85% of respondents showed a moderate or strong willingness to learn about 14 relevant issues ranging from nuclear waste management to policy transition periods. Moreover, 35% of respondents indicated a moderate or strong willingness to participate in a national-or prefectural-level random sampling citizen dialogue on energy and environmental policy. A stronger desire to learn about the issues is directly associated with a greater willingness to participate in public discussions. The Japanese government produces and disseminates pertinent information reflecting the results of public dialogue, which shows citizens' increasing willingness to participate in debates at the national level, particularly for those who are more inclined to pay for renewable energy. This survey shows the propensity of Japanese citizens to engage in talks on energy and environmental policy.","[Nakamura, Hidenori] Toyama Prefectural Univ, Dept Environm & Civil Engn, 5180 Kurokawa, Imizu, Toyama 9390398, Japan",Toyama Prefectural University,"Nakamura, H (通讯作者)，Toyama Prefectural Univ, Dept Environm & Civil Engn, 5180 Kurokawa, Imizu, Toyama 9390398, Japan.",hdnakamu@pu-toyama.ac.jp,"Nakamura, Hidenori/AAK-4246-2020","Nakamura, Hidenori/0000-0003-4712-7810",MEXT/JSPS KAKENHI [JP15K00656]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K00656] Funding Source: KAKEN,"MEXT/JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This research was supported by the Japanese Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (MEXT/JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP15K00656).

Yet, despite the pervasiveness of the crisis, its impact was highly differentiated across countries. The macroeconomic country-level effects are very important, but also within countries the impact on the various regions has been far from uniform, with some regions, often the most urban, able to resist the crisis better than others. Among the many factors which can have influenced the differential impact of the crisis in Europe, this paper looks at the regional endowment of structural territorial assets, those which have been labelled as territorial capital. Territorial capital comprehends all those assets, being material or immaterial, public or private, which represent the development potential of places. Territorial capital enhances regional growth in ordinary times, and, being structural, can be expected to also act as a factor of resilience in times of crisis. To investigate this hypothesis, a database of territorial capital indicators for all regions of the European Union at NUTS3 level is exploited, and a classification of regions based on the endowment of territorial capital is built. It appears that regions belonging to different groups, i.e. being differently endowed with territorial capital, have had different degrees of resilience, with some being able to maintain their income levels better than their country and others losing ground. The structure of regions is hence an important determinant of how they can afford periods of distress, and in particular, more resilient have been those regions endowed with less mobile territorial capital assets and with those territorial capital assets of mixed levels of materiality and rivalry.","[Fratesi, Ugo; Perucca, Giovanni] Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture Built Environm & Construct Engn, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Perucca, G (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture Built Environm & Construct Engn, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",ugo.fratesi@polimi.it; giovanni.perucca@polimi.it,"Perucca, Giovanni/M-6766-2017; Fratesi, Ugo/IAM-5881-2023","Fratesi, Ugo/0000-0002-0755-460X",,,,,41,79,80,4,38,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

This is despite the increasing influence of rising powers in technology transfer, specifically in the area of energy generation. China is an important player in this field. This article has two aims: firstly, it adds to the small but emerging literature on South-South technology transfer by exploring the role of Chinese actors, using the Bui dam in Ghana as a case study. Secondly, the article develops an expanded notion of technology transfer by arguing that technology transfer is not only a technical process, but it is inherently political as it includes crucial issues on decision-making regarding the type of technology that is transferred, who is granted access to the decision-making process, and who benefits from the new technology. In examining technology transfer from this perspective, the article draws on the sociology of technologies approach and the sustainable transitions literature arguing that technology transfer is a contested process that takes place within complex political, economic, social and cultural settings and actor networks. This determines the technology that is transferred, who benefits most, and who is marginalized in the process.","[Hensengerth, Oliver] Northumbria Univ, Dept Social Sci, Ellison Pl, Newcastle NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England",Northumbria University,"Hensengerth, O (通讯作者)，Northumbria Univ, Dept Social Sci, Ellison Pl, Newcastle NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England.",oliver.hensengerth@northumbria.ac.uk,,"Hensengerth, Oliver/0000-0002-6565-692X",German Development Institute; German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ),German Development Institute; German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ),This research was supported by the German Development Institute and the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ).

It does so by evaluating the role of electricity in improving the quality of people's lives, using the capability approach, looking at the case of rural electrification in India. This study was carried out in two villages in Chittoor district in the state of Andhra Pradesh, using a qualitative approach. The findings suggest that electricity is a critical input to expand people's choices and opportunities in the pursuit of valued lives. However, the findings also indicate that the benefits of electricity are not equally distributed among all the families in the villages studied. The study recommends that rural electrification policies reconsider what defines an electrified village. Furthermore, this paper also suggests that the policy should promote not only access to electricity but also enhance social and political settings that may help people to transform electricity access into valued capabilities.","[Malakar, Yuwan] Univ Queensland, Energy & Poverty Res Grp, UQ Energy Initiat, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Malakar, Yuwan] Univ Queensland, Ctr Commun & Social Change, Sch Commun & Arts, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland; University of Queensland,"Malakar, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Energy & Poverty Res Grp, UQ Energy Initiat, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",y.malakar@uq.edu.au,"Malakar, Yuwan/H-1442-2019; Malakar, Yuwan/H-7042-2019","Malakar, Yuwan/0000-0002-9067-7108; Malakar, Yuwan/0000-0002-9067-7108",University of Queensland; Dow Centre for Sustainable Engineering Innovation,University of Queensland(University of Queensland); Dow Centre for Sustainable Engineering Innovation,The author received a scholarship from the University of Queensland and Dow Centre for Sustainable Engineering Innovation.

Research has focused on the psychological mechanisms underlying individuals' environmental risk attitude toward nuclear energy. The aim of this study was to examine whether power affects environmental risk attitudes toward nuclear energy from the perspective of construal level theory and psychological distance theory, since these psychological mechanisms could underlie the influence of power on attitudes to risk. Three studies explored the environmental risk attitudes of participants with different levels of power toward environmental governance of nuclear energy. Results revealed that power affects environmental risk attitudes and perception, with low-power being associated with more risk-avoiding and negative attitude toward the development of nuclear energy relative to high-power. The results of the present study are discussed in reference to policy implications for nuclear energy, such as policy agenda, public participation, and risk communication.","[Geng, Liuna; Liu, Ting; Yang, Genmao] Nanjing Univ, Dept Psychol, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Kexin] Minist Environm Protect, Nanjing Inst Environm Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University,"Geng, LN (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ, Sch Social & Behav Sci, Dept Psychol, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",gengliuna@nju.edu.cn,"Geng, Liuna/JXM-4109-2024",,Jiangsu University Philosophy Social Science Fund Project Mentality in the period of social transformation [2015JDXM003],Jiangsu University Philosophy Social Science Fund Project Mentality in the period of social transformation,"The research was supported by the Jiangsu University Philosophy Social Science Fund Project Mentality in the period of social transformation (No. 2015JDXM003).

U.S. onshore and offshore wind targets have been particularly aggressive. Some wind energy technologies, such as direct-drive wind turbines, rely on a volatile and Chinese-concentrated rare earth element (REE) supply chain. Global efforts have been made to develop new sources of REEs, with limited success. This lack of rare earth availability has been suggested to inhibit direct-drive adoption, despite its energy efficiency benefits. However, it is unclear if new U.S. REE supply could adequately support onshore and offshore direct-drive wind energy growth, and help meet U.S. wind energy targets. This analysis estimates U.S. and Chinese REE availability that could support U.S. direct-drive and other REE demand. Results indicated that U.S. wind installation targets with solely direct-drive designs could only require 4-12% of maximum light rare earth production from Mountain Pass, Bear Lodge and phosphate rock mines. When considering market dynamics and hypothetical U.S. production, U.S. light REE production capacity was not able to provide sufficient light rare earths to achieve wind energy targets. U.S. wind energy targets could be achieved by prioritizing 3-17% of U.S. light REE production for direct-drive wind energy.",,,,,"Nguyen, Ruby/O-5931-2019","Nguyen, Ruby/0000-0002-5791-5004; Imholte, Daniel/0000-0001-8415-0409; Smith, Braeton/0000-0002-0667-6007; Nguyen, Ruby/0000-0002-6598-8457","Critical Materials Institute, an Energy Innovation Hub - U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Advanced Manufacturing Office; U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC07-05ID14517]","Critical Materials Institute, an Energy Innovation Hub - U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Advanced Manufacturing Office(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This work is supported by the Critical Materials Institute, an Energy Innovation Hub funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Advanced Manufacturing Office.; (c) This manuscript has been authored by Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC under Contract No. DE-AC07-05ID14517 with the U.S. Department of Energy.

Today, offshore wind is the prevailing marine renewable technology but there is growing progress towards developing others, such as tidal stream energy (TSE) turbines which capture kinetic energy from tidal currents. Using historical operations data from 18 wind farms and simulated generation data for two TSE sites in the UK, we estimate that TSE projects offer about $10/MW h more in net social benefits than offshore wind projects. This estimate includes the value of energy generated, value of reduced marginal CO2 emissions, cost of visual changes to the landscape, and cost of energy generation forecast errors. However, relative to offshore wind, the increased cost of TSE projects far outweighs the increased social benefits. The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of TSE projects is expected to be about $74/MW h to $330/MW h higher than offshore wind projects through 2050. Only with optimistic LCOE projections, small TSE projects (20 MW) may be competitive (when including increased net social benefits) with small offshore wind projects by 2020.","[Lamy, Julian V.; Azevedo, Ines L.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Engn & Publ Policy, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Carnegie Mellon University,"Lamy, JV (通讯作者)，Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Engn & Publ Policy, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",jlamy@andrew.cmu.edu; iazevedo@cmu.edu,"Azevedo, Inês/HNQ-6690-2023; Azevedo, José Manuel Neto/C-1504-2010","Azevedo, José Manuel Neto/0000-0003-2573-1371","Center for Climate and Energy Decision Making (CEDM) [SES-0949710, SES-1463492]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1463492] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Center for Climate and Energy Decision Making (CEDM); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This work was funded by the Center for Climate and Energy Decision Making (CEDM) through a cooperative agreement between the National Science Foundation and Carnegie Mellon University (SES-0949710 and SES-1463492).

The concept of a model for implementing enterprise environmental costs and returns to traditional business accounting is designed. The concept is based on the use of STN EN ISO 14052:2012 Environmental Management. Cost accounting material flow were processed at the workplace of contributors. In analyzing and evaluating environmental business costs and revenues, all the organization activities have to identify relevant costs and revenues, and these are associated with the identified environmental aspects, impacts and risks. If an organization has established and maintained a standard environmental management system (according to STN EN ISO 14001 respectively EMAS III), the use of the model in practice is significantly more effective through the EAVaR. If an organization does not operate such a certified system, an environmental audit - an initial environmental review - is required to enter into the economic and environmental operational accounting. The concept of the model was dimensioned by pilot verification under specific conditions of practice - civil engineering.","[Daneshjo, Naqib; Majernik, Milan; Sanciova, Gabriela; Pajerska, Erika Dudas] Univ Econ, Fac Business Econ, Dept Management, Tajovskeho 13, Kosice 04130, Slovakia; [Stofkova, Katarina Repkova] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Commun, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01015, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava; University of Presov; University of Zilina,"Daneshjo, N (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Business Econ, Dept Management, Tajovskeho 13, Kosice 04130, Slovakia.",daneshjo47@gmail.com; milan.majernik@euke.sk; gabriela.sanciova@euke.sk; erika.dudas.pajerska@euke.sk; katarina.stofkova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Majerník, Milan/AAE-5751-2022",,[KEGA 026EU-4/2018],,This paper is an output of the science project KEGA 026EU-4/2018.,,19,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1510,1519,,,,,,10,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300193,0

The results are robust to different specifications of the spatial neighbours and are confirmed by a natural experiment (an earthquake in the Abruzzo region of Italy in 2009) that creates an exogenous variation in the neighbours' spending. Furthermore, there is no evidence of yardstick competition when one considers political effects, while a negative relationship is found between spatial interaction and the size of the municipality.

A simulation exercise shows under what conditions certain specifications lead to biased estimations of dynamic localization (Marshall-Arrow-Romer - MAR) externalities. The results suggest that applied researchers can choose between the size of the local industry, the specialization index and the location quotient to proxy for these externalities as far as they also encompass a correct proxy for the size of the local economy.","[Fracasso, Andrea] Univ Trento, Dept Econ & Management, Trento, Italy; [Fracasso, Andrea] Univ Trento, Sch Int Studies, Trento, Italy; [Vittucci Marzetti, Giuseppe] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Sociol & Social Res, Milan, Italy",University of Trento; University of Trento; University of Milano-Bicocca,"Vittucci Marzetti, G (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Sociol & Social Res, Milan, Italy.",andrea.fracasso@unitn.it; giuseppe.vittucci@unimib.it,"Fracasso, Andrea/S-9532-2019; Marzetti, Giuseppe Vittucci/AAG-2246-2020","Fracasso, Andrea/0000-0003-1581-8481; Marzetti, Giuseppe Vittucci/0000-0003-3093-8000",,,,,58,27,28,3,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

This paper examines whether RES-E shares should be measured based on consumption rather than production with a European case study presented for the year 2030. The case study demonstrates the volume and scale of RES-E transfers and shows how countries have differing RES-E shares when comparing those derived based on the traditional production-based approach to the alternative. The proposed consumption-based approach accounts for RES-E being imported and exported on an hourly basis across 30 European countries and highlights concerns regarding uncoordinated support mechanisms, price distortions and cost inequality. These concerns are caused by cross-border subsidisation of electricity and this work propoes that an agency be appointed to administer regional RES-E affairs. This agency would accurately quantify RES-E shares and remunerate producers from the country that consumed their electricity instead of where it has been produced policy would be enhanced by enabling more equitable and optimal electricity decarbonisation.","[Gaffney, F.; Deane, J.

Examining the case of LNG infrastructure development in the Baltic Sea region, it clarifies how choices made in interlinked policy areas may affect infrastructural policy output in a regional context. It is argued that LNG is expanding as a new major energy technology around the Baltic due to its capacity to fulfill policy expectations in three issue-areas: enhancing energy security, providing low-sulphur bunker fuel, and balancing renewables in the power sector. The analysis of linkages between these actions situations emphasizes the spatial, temporal, and discursive aspects of energy infrastructure governance at the regional level. The application of NAAS as an analytical tool to map out the unintended consequences of infrastructural choices is relevant in policymaking.","[Gritsenko, Dania] Univ Helsinki, Aleksanteri Inst, POB 42, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Gritsenko, D (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Aleksanteri Inst, POB 42, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",daria.gritsenko@helsinki.fi,,"Gritsenko, Daria/0000-0003-3577-0470",Academy of Finland project CHIP-clean shipping economics-shipping under the new paradigm [257968]; Finnish Center of Excellence Choices of Russian Modernization (Academy of Finland),Academy of Finland project CHIP-clean shipping economics-shipping under the new paradigm; Finnish Center of Excellence Choices of Russian Modernization (Academy of Finland)(Research Council of Finland),"This research has been supported by the Academy of Finland project CHIP-clean shipping economics-shipping under the new paradigm (decision number 257968) and the Finnish Center of Excellence Choices of Russian Modernization (Academy of Finland, 2012-2017).

Here, we seek to quantify price and income elasticities, as well as provide reasonable justification for price asymmetry in Singapore using a panel approach across dwelling types and geographical areas. We find that households do not react much to prices, and that price elasticities may decrease as income rises. There is also some evidence of price asymmetry, with surprising results putting responsiveness towards price decreases larger than price increases. This points towards similar behavioural patterns with the rebound effect for household energy efficiency, if found present in future studies. Our findings suggest that there will only be positive responses towards dynamic pricing and higher churn rates if more transparent information is provided on related cost savings, when households are exposed to retail choice in the electricity market after full retail competition is introduced in 2018. In addition, a large role will have to come from cultivating the young to engage in sustainable practices to achieve energy efficiency targets.","[Loi, Tian Sheng Allan; Jia Le Ng] Natl Univ Singapore, Energy Studies Inst, 29 Heng Mui Keng Terrace,Block A 10-01, Singapore, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Loi, TSA (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Energy Studies Inst, 29 Heng Mui Keng Terrace,Block A 10-01, Singapore, Singapore.",esiltsa@nus.edu.sg; Jialeng91@gmail.com,,,,,,,63,23,25,0,33,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JAN,2018,112.0,,,,,,415,426,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.09.052,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FO2NK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416615800041,0

The purpose of the study is to analyze the growth rates based on the Harrod and Domar models, which allow determining the rate of growth with which investments should grow, as well as the rate of growth in income and production capacity, which contributes to the effective regulation of economic development. The study constructed models of Harrod and Domar economic growth of the Russian economy, which make it possible to identify the areas of outstripping growth necessary to stimulate investment activity and balance the savings of the population. Taking into account the peculiarities of the development of the territories and the different rates of economic growth, the study suggested measures to stimulate sustainable development of the economy.

Regional Studies. Since several federations rely on a decentralized system of public education, understanding local responses to intergovernmental grants is a relevant issue in regional economics. This paper investigates whether different types of grants (block, categorical and matching) increase the dispersion of education spending and impact spending inequalities across Brazilian municipalities from 2004 to 2010. The results suggest that in a decentralized fiscal system public funding based on block grants, unlike funding from categorical grants, favours differences in tastes and leads to a higher dispersion of public provision across jurisdictions. Matching grants do not produce a consistent effect on dispersion.","[Mattos, Enlinson; Yamaguchi, Afonso] Getulio Vargas Fdn, Sao Paulo Sch Econ, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Politi, Ricardo] Fed Univ ABC, CECS Ctr Engn Modelling & Appl Social Sci, Sao Bernardo Do Campo, SP, Brazil",Getulio Vargas Foundation; Universidade Federal do ABC (UFABC),"Politi, R (通讯作者)，Fed Univ ABC, CECS Ctr Engn Modelling & Appl Social Sci, Sao Bernardo Do Campo, SP, Brazil.",enlinson.mattos@fgv.br; rbpoliti@gvmail.br; afonsomy@gmail.com,"Politi, Ricardo B/O-7109-2015",,,,,,33,2,3,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Based on consumers' needs and demands they should try to adjust the product offer. Understanding, analysing and keeping track of consumer's behaviour is very critical for businesses to retain the competitive market position. The paper is focused on the selected global consumer trends, which affects buying behaviour of responsible (ethical and environmental) consumers in the globalization era. We assume that Slovak consumers are increasingly demanding environmentally friendly products and expecting more environmental responsibility in behaviour of businesses. Consumer behaviour is also affected by ethical or unethical practices of businesses. The aim of our paper is to present selected results of the questionnaire survey, which was realized to identify significant factors influencing responsible consumer behaviour. The obtained data from sample of 274 Slovak respondents were evaluated by selected statistical methods.

The portfolio of investments built up according to the examined approach, including its evaluation on a model example, spreads the awareness of this investment opportunity.

Economic theory offers several ways of finding a solution to the different quality of products sold under the same brand and packaging. The first one concerns socially responsible entrepreneurship within the business ethics. The second solution relates to the ability of the market mechanism to allocate efficiently scarce resources providing that there are advanced supply-side competitions and symmetric information that prevents a negative selection. The third solution currently proposed by the European Commission is in the field of law in the sense of the European directive on unfair commercial practices.

This method appears to be convenient from a practical point of view because it examines the behaviour of specific entities within the network. There are many studies, that analyse the various effects of bilateral trade relationships from different perspectives, such as the volatility rate. International trade has a huge impact on the development of globalization within the world. It creates the appropriate background for the further development of relations between countries and not necessarily between countries dealing with trade. Exponential random graph models attempt to look for dependencies in relationships between entities, and then create a model for network structure. This model provides a view of the entire network from the point of view of local structures such as reciprocated ties or triangles. The social network can then be perceived as a structure that is made up of local patterns of specific relationships that we call network configurations. These configurations correspond to the model parameters. Exponential random graph can be used to create models in different cases and one of the areas where these models are not so much used is international trade. The international trade of EU is well recorded and it is possible to establish a network of relationships where the level of trade and the interconnection between countries creates the appropriate background for further modelling using exponential random graph models.","[Panus, Jan; Hajny, Jan] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Studentska 95, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Panus, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Studentska 95, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",jan.panus@upce.cz; st28730@student.upce.cz,"Panus, Jan/GRF-0682-2022",,University of Pardubice [SGS2018025],University of Pardubice,This paper is an output of the University of Pardubice science project No SGS2018025.,,23,0,0,1,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1748,1754,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300223,0

This is achieved through exploring a pioneering collaboration regarding waste heat from a steelworks to a local district heating system in northern Sweden that was established in the 1970s. With a historical qualitative approach and focus on the long-term and dynamic explanatory factors behind the collaboration, the article complements previous studies typically focusing on barriers/drivers at the end of the process from idea to actual waste heat supplies (e.g., the allocation of costs among parties). From a long-term perspective, concerns over the actual waste heat supplies were found to be protracted and more critical. Hence, although the collaboration from start rested on firm beliefs of sufficient supplies, concerns over actual supplies remained critical throughout the 11-year long process. The article suggests that: a) market fluctuations and the industrial company's continuous strive for profit maximization tend to be underestimated in previous literature on obstacles to waste heat supplies; and b) targeted government subsidies could be an essential policy tool for promoting future waste heat collaborations, in turn resting on a mix of societal rationales (e.g., energy security, climate mitigation, regional development, etc.).","[Soderholm, Kristina] Lulea Univ Technol, Div Social Sci, SE-97187 Lulea, Sweden",Lulea University of Technology,"Söderholm, K (通讯作者)，Lulea Univ Technol, Div Social Sci, SE-97187 Lulea, Sweden.",kristina.soderholm@ltu.se,,,Swedish Energy Agency; Swedish District Heating Association,Swedish Energy Agency(Swedish Energy Agency); Swedish District Heating Association,"Financial support from the Swedish Energy Agency and the Swedish District Heating Association is gratefully acknowledged, as are very valuable comments from an anonymous reviewer.

For this purpose, we will examine a European call option with binomial random strike price and an American put option with time- and state-varying strike price.

In the first article, devoted to the analysis of military-technical cooperation between Russia and the People's Republic of China in the era of comprehensive globalization, the main trends of the last decades were revealed. As in case of China, Russian military-technical cooperation with India has a long and rich history, but at the same time it has undergone significant qualitative changes in the last decade. In the world markets of armaments and military equipment, the competitive struggle between the leading arms-producing countries is intensifying. In order to keep traditional sales markets of WME, Russia should raise a military-technical cooperation with its traditional partners to a qualitatively new level, deepen cooperation and division of labor not only in production but also in the scientific-research and experimental-design developments.

We find that local residents in Pennsylvania own 53% of the acreage leased for development and capture an estimated 8.5% of the value of production of the typical well, more than double what is expected from a well in the UK's public-absentee regime despite revenue sharing policies. The dollar amount of local payments is also larger in Pennsylvania, with the difference reflecting policies and institutions, not differences in the value of production. The Pennsylvania case provides a benchmark for public-absentee owners considering policies to direct payments to communities hosting extraction: it gives the local payments corresponding to the case where subsurface owners voluntarily negotiate lease terms with energy firms and roughly half of ownership revenues accrue locally.","[Harleman, Max; Weber, Jeremy G.] Univ Pittsburgh, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, 3601 Wesley W Posvar Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Weber, JG (通讯作者)，Univ Pittsburgh, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, 3601 Wesley W Posvar Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",mrh105@pitt.edu; j.weber@pitt.edu,"Harleman, Max/IQV-2891-2023","Harleman, Max/0000-0001-5924-5297",University of Pittsburgh; James W.

However, the extensive growth model in the past several decades has led to environmental degradation. China is now shifting her development pattern to a more sustainable model. Using a hybrid input-output model, this paper found that total energy coefficients fell sharply between 1997 and 2002, and 2007 and 2012. The total energy consumption and CO2 emission embodied in China's industrial exports grew by more than 100% from 2002 to 2007, with little variation from 2007 to 2012. Subsequently, Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index (MLPI) is employed to assess the green productivity growth in the sector. The decomposition of the MLPI is further conducted. This suggests that efficiency changes from 2002 to 2007 and 2007 to 2012 are lower than 1, indicating that technical change is the main contributor to MLPI. Finally, policy implications are provided with emphasis on dissemination of new conservation technologies.","[Tian, Peng] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Lin, Boqiang] Xiamen Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Sch Management, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; Xiamen University,"Lin, BQ (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Sch Management, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",tianp@aliyun.com; bqlin@xmu.edu.cn,"Lin, Boqiang/G-3960-2010","Lin, Boqiang/0000-0002-1308-400X",Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy [1260-Z0210011]; Xiamen University [1260-Y07200]; China National Social Science Fund [15ZD058],Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy; Xiamen University(Xiamen University); China National Social Science Fund,"The paper is supported by the Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy (No: 1260-Z0210011), Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding (No:1260-Y07200) and China National Social Science Fund (No. 15ZD058)",,46,56,57,3,61,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2017,111.0,,,,,,394,402,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.09.033,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FN1VQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000415779700040,0

This paper argues that, due to its strong influence on EV innovation paths, EV policy could be better designed if it paid more attention to cost and technology development risk. In particular, using a model that estimates the incremental cost of different EV and infrastructure mixes over the whole passenger car fleet, we find that EV policy with a strong bias towards long-range battery electric vehicles (BEVs) risks leading to higher costs of electrification in the medium term, possibly exceeding the ability of governments to sustain the necessary incentives until battery cost drops sufficiently. We also find that promoting a balanced mix of BEVs and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) may set the electrification of passenger cars on a lower risk, lower cost path. Examining EV policy in the UK and in California, we find that it is generally not incompatible with achieving balanced mixes of BEVs and PHEVs. However some fine tuning would allow to better balance medium term risks and long term goals.","[Contestabile, Marcello; Alajaji, Mohammed; Almubarak, Bader] KAPSARC, POB 88550, Riyadh 11672, Saudi Arabia",,"Contestabile, M (通讯作者)，KAPSARC, POB 88550, Riyadh 11672, Saudi Arabia.",marcello.contestabile@kapsarc.org,,,,,,,42,28,32,1,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2017,110.0,,,,,,20,30,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.07.062,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FP5LK,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417660800003,0

Whilst substantial understanding exists of why people support climate-friendly energy policies, little is known about why they think affordability is important. Particularly, what leads members of the public to identify this policy goal as more important than other objectives? Here, we examine this question via a nationally-representative survey of 2441 UK residents and demonstrate that concerns about personal costs explain a small amount of variation in the prioritisation of affordability as an energy policy goal; a range of other factors also significantly contribute. One such factor is beliefs about who is responsible for energy transitions. These findings suggest policy actions to address affordability concerns should go beyond energy prices, and include additional considerations such as distributive justice and equality.","[Demski, Christina; Evensen, Darrick; Pidgeon, Nick] Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, 70 Pk Pl,Tower Bldg, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales; [Demski, Christina; Spence, Alexa] Univ Nottingham, Sch Psychol, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",Cardiff University; University of Nottingham,"Demski, C (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, 70 Pk Pl,Tower Bldg, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales.;Demski, C (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Psychol, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",demskicc@cardiff.ac.uk,"Evensen, Darrick/AAK-9941-2021; Demski, Christina/H-3746-2015; Spence, Alexa/D-3646-2009","Evensen, Darrick/0000-0001-8892-0052; Demski, Christina/0000-0002-9215-452X; Spence, Alexa/0000-0003-4014-0430","UK Research Councils under the Natural Environment Research Council [NE/G007748/1, NE/I006753/1]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L024756/1]; Horizon Digital Economy Research, RCUK [EP/G065802/1]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: UKRI","UK Research Councils under the Natural Environment Research Council; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Horizon Digital Economy Research, RCUK(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","This research formed part of the 2nd and 3rd programme of the UK Energy Research Centre and was supported by the UK Research Councils under the Natural Environment Research Council award NE/G007748/1 (grant NE/I006753/1) and Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council award EP/L024756/1.

This paper introduces a narrative-informed exploratory approach for analysing future energy transition pathways under these uncertainty conditions. In this approach, exploratory modelling is used to explore the impact of various uncertainties, such as potential installed capacity and supporting policies for different energy options, on the unfolding of transition pathways. The approach produces several sets of scenarios. We complement this quantitative exploration of the future with narratives (storylines) generated based on the concepts in the sustain ability transitions field. Narratives are used (i) as a supporting framework for model structure; (ii) to guide the exploration of the future; and (iii) to interpret the ensemble of quantitative scenarios. We describe how synergies between narratives and exploratory modelling inform both the framed and open-ended exploration of future transition pathways. The approach is demonstrated with a case study of the transition in India's electricity sector. We show that the realisation of the 100 GW solar electricity target by 2022 is unlikely, and that the development of solar electricity is highly dependent on the active role of government.","[Moallemi, Enayat A.; de Haan, Fjalar; Aye, Lu] Univ Melbourne, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Renewable Energy & Energy Efficiency Grp, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Moallemi, Enayat A.; Kwakkel, Jan] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Jaffalaan 5, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands; [de Haan, Fjalar] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Design, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [de Haan, Fjalar] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sustainable Soc Inst, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne; Delft University of Technology; University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne,"Moallemi, EA (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Renewable Energy & Energy Efficiency Grp, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",e.moallemi@unsw.edu.au,"Aye, Lu/J-8733-2013; Kwakkel, Jan H./D-9680-2013; Moallemi, Enayat A./D-5758-2015","Aye, Lu/0000-0002-5495-1683; Kwakkel, Jan H./0000-0001-9447-2954; Moallemi, Enayat A./0000-0001-8346-4043",University of Melbourne,University of Melbourne(University of Melbourne),"Enayat A.

As school-to-work pathways become increasingly diverse and complex, there is growing evidence that transitions during this period significantly influence individual career trajectories and long-term earning capacities. For non-metropolitan youth, this period of the life course often involves migration to urban centres in the search for better educational and employment opportunities. Drawing on longitudinal data, this paper examines the influence of migration and school-to-work pathways on entry-level wages for non-metropolitan youth in Australia. Our results highlight that migration from non-metropolitan communities to urban centres leads to higher entry-level wages, but these wage gains are not immediate, rather they are realised at a period 3 years post-migration. Individuals remaining in non-metropolitan communities were found to experience pathways that lead to lower wage returns. Furthermore, unobserved attributes, such as motivation and aspirations, were found to be a major factor explaining the higher wage returns achieved by non-metropolitan migrants. Findings have important consequences for policy in their potential to contribute to new evidenced-based policy designed to entice the return of young people to non-metropolitan communities and ameliorate the long-standing net loss of young population from regional areas.","[Rowe, Francisco] Univ Liverpool, Dept Geog & Planning, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Rowe, Francisco; Corcoran, Jonathan; Bell, Martin] Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, Queensland Ctr Populat Res, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",University of Liverpool; University of Queensland,"Rowe, F (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Dept Geog & Planning, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.;Rowe, F (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, Queensland Ctr Populat Res, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",f.rowegonzalez@uq.edu.au,"Rowe, Francisco/Q-7011-2019; Corcoran, Jonathan/A-4631-2010","Rowe, Francisco/0000-0003-4137-0246; Corcoran, Jonathan/0000-0003-3565-6061",,,,,72,15,18,1,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

As is generally recognised the most promising strategies involve biomass and pumped hydro storage, but these involve drawbacks that appear to be major limitations on the achievement of 100% renewable supply systems. Neglected aspects of the solar thermal storage solution are detailed, indicating that it is not likely to be able to make a significant contribution. Batteries, vehicle-to-grid, biomass and hydrogen based solutions also appear to have major drawbacks. Although other options not examined here might alter the outlook, the general impression arrived at is that the probability of achieving satisfactory storage provision enabling 100% renewable power supply are not promising.

Given current coal use in China, and the urgent need to cut emissions, 'clean coal' technologies are regarded as a promising solution for China to meet its carbon reduction targets while still obtaining a considerable share of energy from coal. Using an economy-wide model, this paper evaluates the impact of two existing advanced coal technologies - coal upgrading and ultra-supercritical (USC) coal power generation - on economic, energy and emissions outcomes when a carbon price is used to meet China's CO2 intensity target out to 2035. Additional deployment of USC coal power generation lowers the carbon price required to meet the CO2 intensity target by more than 40% in the near term and by 25% in the longer term. It also increases total coal power generation and coal use. Increasing the share of coal that is upgraded leads to only a small decrease in the carbon price. As China's CO2 intensity is set exogenously, additional deployment of the two technologies has a small impact on total CO2 emissions.","[Zhang, Xiaohan; Zhang, Xiliang] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Energy Environm & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiaohan; Winchester, Niven] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Tsinghua University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Zhang, XH; Zhang, XL (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Inst Energy Environm & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",xh-zhang13@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; zhang_xl@tsinghua.edu.cn,"Zhang, Xi/HJH-1211-2023","Winchester, Niven/0000-0003-2703-4596",MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change; National Sciences Foundation of China [7160244]; Federal grants,MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change; National Sciences Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Federal grants,"The authors thank John Reilly for helpful comments and suggestions, and gratefully acknowledge the financial support for this work provided by the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change through a consortium of industrial sponsors and Federal grants.

We assessed flexible power generation in biogas plants using a quotient of remuneration and surplus generation called the average integration costs of surplus generation (AICSG). We defined the AICSG, which can be interpreted as a new approach to assess and to compare the cost efficiency of flexibility options. Increasing the capacities of flexible biogas plants decreases future surplus generation by up to 35% compared to if these histallments were phased out. The best AICSG value was generated in a scenario that had a low rate of constructing new biogas plants. In conclusion, the system integration of intermittent renewable energies requires further technologies that result in additional costs. Therefore, biogas plants are one option for improving the system integration of intermittent renewable energies.","[Lauer, Markus; Thran, Daniela] DBFZ Deutsch Biomasseforschungszentrum Gemeinnutz, German Biomass Res Ctr, Torgauer Str 116, D-04347 Leipzig, Germany; [Thran, Daniela] UFZ Helmholtz Zentrum Umweltforsch GmbH, Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Lauer, M (通讯作者)，DBFZ Deutsch Biomasseforschungszentrum Gemeinnutz, German Biomass Res Ctr, Torgauer Str 116, D-04347 Leipzig, Germany.",markus.lauer@dbfz.de,"; Thran, Daniela/E-7672-2015","Lauer, Markus/0000-0003-0184-2085; Thran, Daniela/0000-0002-6573-6401",Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) based on a decision of the Parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany via the Federal Office for Agriculture and Food (BLE) under the innovation support programme,Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) based on a decision of the Parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany via the Federal Office for Agriculture and Food (BLE) under the innovation support programme,The project was supported by funds of the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) based on a decision of the Parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany via the Federal Office for Agriculture and Food (BLE) under the innovation support programme.,,51,27,27,1,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,324,336,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.07.016,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400030,0

A comprehensive System Dynamics (SD) model covering the period 2005 2050 is presented which captures both historical behaviours and real-world influences on the endogenous demand dynamics of an island-based electricity system. The impact of tourism, energy efficiency and electric vehicles (EV) expansion allied with associated policy options, are critically evaluated by the SD model using a series of scenarios. The model shows that energy efficiency measures exhibit the most significant long-term impact on electricity demand, while in contrast, policies to increase tourism have a much less direct impact and EV expansion has thought-provoking impacts on the long-term demand, although this is not as influential as energy efficiency measures.","[Matthew, George Jr.; Nuttall, William J.] Open Univ, Fac Sci Technol Engn & Math, Sch Engn & Innovat, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England; [Mestel, Ben] Open Univ, Fac Sci Technol Engn & Math, Sch Math & Stat, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England; [Dooley, Laurence S.] Open Univ, Fac Sci Technol Engn & Math, Sch Comp & Commun, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England",Open University - UK; Open University - UK; Open University - UK,"Matthew, GJ (通讯作者)，Open Univ, Fac Sci Technol Engn & Math, Sch Engn & Innovat, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England.",george.matthew@open.ac.uk; william.nuttall@open.ac.uk; ben.mestel@open.ac.uk; laurence.dooley@open.ac.uk,,"Matthew, George/0000-0003-3225-6951","Open University, Faculty of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics","Open University, Faculty of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics","This work was supported by a PhD studentship from The Open University, Faculty of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.",,48,16,16,2,45,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,121,131,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.06.060,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400012,0

We do so by distinguishing two interacting trajectories of assessment: a formal trajectory that is embedded in the legal system and an informal trajectory that is mainly embedded in public discourse. The emergence of an informal assessment trajectory can be seen as a response to a (perceived) lack of attention to particular concerns or values in the formal trajectory, i.e. 'overflowing'. The emerging informal assessment may subsequently lead to adaptations in the formal trajectory, which we refer to as `backflowing'. Based on insights from case studies on Dutch energy projects and literature on energy justice we identify three justice-related attributes that facilitate understanding of the emergence of controversies. These attributes are based on differences between the two trajectories in terms of 1) the way in which values are expressed, 2) the dimension of energy justice that is taken as a starting point, and 3) the democratic legitimization of assessment trajectories. In order to allow for legitimate and effective energy policy, overflowing and backflowing need to be addressed as interrelated rather than as separate processes.","[Pesch, Udo; Correlje, Aad; Cuppen, Eefje; Taebi, Behnam] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Jafflaan 5, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology,"Pesch, U (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Jafflaan 5, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands.",u.pesch@tudelft.nl,"Correljé, Aad/S-3249-2019; Cuppen, Eefje/M-1775-2015","Correljé, Aad/0000-0003-2722-1877; Cuppen, Eefje/0000-0003-2943-4761; Pesch, Udo/0000-0002-8980-5205",Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) [313-99-303],Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"This work is part of the research programme RESPONSE with project number 313-99-303, which is (partly) financed by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO), and co-financed by a consortium of public and private partners.

We derive the limiting distributions of the test under the null hypothesis of correct specification and a sequence of local alternatives. We show that the test is free of nuisance parameters asymptotically under the null and prove the consistency of our test. To improve the finite sample performance of our test, we also propose a residual-based wild bootstrap and justify its asymptotic validity. We conduct a small set of Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the finite sample properties of our tests. Finally, we apply the test to two empirical datasets: the vote cast and the economic growth rate. We reject the linear spatial autoregressive model in the vote cast example but fail to reject it in the economic growth rate example.

Spain, whilst among the EU countries with highest solar irradiation, has recently passed one of the most restrictive self-consumption regulations. We study the implications of this regulation in comparison with alternatives (net metering, net billing) on the profitability (internal rate of return) of potential residential, commercial and industrial investors, as well as the impact of PV self-consumption on government revenues and the electricity system. We find that this regulation hinders the diffusion of PV self-consumption applications by making them economically infeasible. It also creates inefficient disincentives for demand-side adjustment and by fostering disconnection from the grid. Under the current conditions, the direct economic impact of PV self-consumption on both aggregate government and electricity system revenues is positive for investments in the residential segment, negligible for those of the commercial segment and negative for those of the industrial segment. In order to raise compliance with the relevant European Commission guidelines and to promote the diffusion of PV systems at minimum cost to the electricity system, a dynamic net billing scheme is recommended.","[Prol, Javier Lopez; Steininger, Karl W.] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change, Brandhofgasse 5, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Prol, Javier Lopez; Steininger, Karl W.] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Dept Econ, Univ Str 5, A-8010 Graz, Austria",University of Graz; University of Graz,"Prol, JL (通讯作者)，Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change, Brandhofgasse 5, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",javier.lopez-prol@uni-graz.at,"Prol, Javier López/ABA-8522-2020; Steininger, Karl/O-6971-2016","Prol, Javier López/0000-0001-6654-8405; Steininger, Karl/0000-0003-3850-9315",Austrian Science Fund [W 1256-G15]; Wegener Center for Climate and Global Change; University of Graz,Austrian Science Fund(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Wegener Center for Climate and Global Change; University of Graz,"This research has been possible thanks to the funding of the Austrian Science Fund under the research grant W 1256-G15: Doctoral Program Climate Change - Uncertainties, Thresholds and Coping Strategies, and thanks to the support of the Wegener Center for Climate and Global Change and the University of Graz.",,38,71,73,0,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2017,108.0,,,,,,742,754,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.06.019,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FC3FZ,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406725800069,0

Without reducing the small economy's trade costs with a third region, the trade liberalization between the small and the large economy will cause the core-periphery effect, even if labor costs rise in the large economy.","[Tsai, I-Ju] Natl United Univ, Dept Finance, 1 Lien Da Kung Ching Li, Miaoli 36003, Taiwan",National United University,"Tsai, IJ (通讯作者)，Natl United Univ, Dept Finance, 1 Lien Da Kung Ching Li, Miaoli 36003, Taiwan.",ijutsai@nuu.edu.tw,,,,,,,19,2,2,1,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

It simulates the effect of changes in natural gas price control policy on carbon emission, and the economic effects in view of demand side and supply side. Based on the above, we also analyze the carbon emission mechanism from economic and energy structure perspective. The results show that: an increase in natural gas price can reduce carbon emission, or tends to cause a long-term decline in the surplus profit rate of the natural gas industry. Moreover, the increase in natural gas price may raise the CPI, and reduce actual GDP and residents' welfare. On the contrary, a decrease in natural gas price may reduce CPI and enhance resident welfare. However, the long-term actual GDP will not increase, but carbon emission will increase and the surplus profit rate of the natural gas industry may reduce in the short term and increase in the long term. On the other hand, Both increase and decrease in natural gas prices may result in a decrease of the actual GDP level in the long term. The elimination of price control in natural gas supply may increase actual GDP and residents' welfare and reduce CPI. Meanwhile, it may increase carbon emissions and improve the profitability of the natural gas industry.","[He, Yongda] Shanxi Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat, Taiyuan 030006, Shanxi, Peoples R China; [Lin, Boqiang] Xiamen Univ, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Sch Management, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China",Shanxi University Finance & Economics; Xiamen University,"Lin, BQ (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Sch Management, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",bqlin@xmu.edu.cn,"Lin, Boqiang/G-3960-2010","Lin, Boqiang/0000-0002-1308-400X",Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy [1260-Z0210011]; Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding [1260-Y07200]; China National Social Science Fund [15ZD058],Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy; Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding; China National Social Science Fund,"The paper is supported by the Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy (No: 1260-Z0210011), Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding (No: 1260-Y07200) and China National Social Science Fund (No. 15ZD058).",,46,37,38,3,72,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2017,107.0,,,,,,524,531,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.05.015,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FA0WU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405158200051,0

We investigate, in particular, the persistence of the effects and whether the effects differ between periods of high and low household occupancy, i.e. between morning and evening periods, and between weekdays and weekend days. The findings show that feedback is effective, leading to about 5% electricity consumption reduction that is persistent over an eleven month period.

Although the JCPOA restricts Iran's uranium enrichment program for 10-15 years, Iran's neighbors may choose to develop their own national enrichment programs giving them a potential nuclear weapons capability. This paper argues that converting Iran's national enrichment program to a more proliferation-resistant multinational arrangement could offer significant economic benefits-reduced capital and operational costs-due to economies of scale and the utilization of more efficient enrichment technologies. In addition, the paper examines policy aspects related to financing, governance, and how multinational enrichment could fit into the political and security context of the Middle East. A multinational enrichment facility managed by regional and international partners would provide more assurance that it remains peaceful and could help build confidence between Iran and its neighbors to cooperate in managing other regional security challenges.","[Ahmad, Ali] Amer Univ Beirut, Issam Fares Inst Publ Policy & Int Affairs, Beirut, Lebanon; [Salahieh, Sidra] Amer Univ Beirut, Energy Studies Program, Beirut, Lebanon; [Snyder, Ryan] Princeton Univ, Program Sci & Global Secur, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",American University of Beirut; American University of Beirut; Princeton University,"Ahmad, A (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Beirut, Issam Fares Inst Publ Policy & Int Affairs, Beirut, Lebanon.",ali.ahmad@cantab.net,,"Ahmad, Ali/0000-0003-0042-552X; Snyder, Ryan/0000-0002-2303-9093",John D. and Catherine T.

One of the main initiatives is the minimum efficiency performance standards (MEPS) program for energy-driven equipment and the electric motors appear as the most significant one (49% share of the total electricity consumption). The MEPS levels set new grades for efficiency, and then manufacturers and consumers have to conform to the new products and costs. Policy makers have to economically assess the effects of these MEPS in order to maintain the market stability. Since the benefits of this program come from future energy savings, this cost-effective analysis has to consider the parameters uncertainty and the results should reinforce the market players' confidence. Thus, the goal of this work is, first, to analyze the economic viability of the MEPS transitions in Brazil considering the uncertainty of the parameters involved and then, to estimate the effects of this program on the energy savings goals for 2030.

This study proposes and finds that consumer reactions to dynamic tariffs depend on the level of perceived price complexity that represents the cognitive effort consumers must engage in to compute the overall bill amount. An online experiment conducted with a representative sample of 664 German residential energy consumers examines how salient characteristics of dynamic tariffs contribute to perceived price complexity. Subsequently, a structural equation model (SEM) reveals that the depth of information processing is central to understand how price complexity relates to consumers' behavioral intentions. The results suggest that it will be challenging to convince European consumers to select complex dynamic tariffs under the current legal framework. Policymakers will need to find ways to make these tariffs more attractive.","[Layer, Patrick] Daimler AG, Stuttgart, Germany; [Feurer, Sven] KIT, IISM, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Jochem, Patrick] KIT, IIP, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany",Daimler AG; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Feurer, S (通讯作者)，KIT, IISM, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany.",sven.feurer@kit.edu,"Jochem, Patrick/Q-8828-2019","Jochem, Patrick/0000-0002-7486-4958",,,,,72,24,24,3,17,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2017,106.0,,,,,,244,254,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.02.051,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EW2RL,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402343600025,0

Through an empirical approach, we investigated 43 communities implementing smart and sustainable energy city projects under the Sixth and Seventh Framework Programmes of the European Union. Validated through literature review, we identified 35 barriers categorized in policy, administrative, legal, financial, market, environmental, technical, social, and information-and-awareness dimensions. We prioritized these barriers, using a novel multi-imensional methodology that simultaneously analyses barriers based on frequency, level of impact, causal relationship among barriers, origin, and scale. The results indicate that the key barriers are lacking or fragmented political support on the long term at the policy level, and lack of good cooperation and acceptance among project partners, insufficient external financial support, lack of skilled and trained personnel, and fragmented ownership at the project level. The outcome of the research should aid policy-makers to better understand and prioritize implementation barriers to develop effective action and policy interventions towards more successful implementation of smart energy city projects.","[Mosannenzadeh, Farnaz] Univ Trento, Doctoral Sch Civil Environm & Mech Engn, Via Mesiano 77, I-38123 Trento, Italy; [Mosannenzadeh, Farnaz; Vettorato, Daniele] European Acad Bolzano, Inst Renewable Energy, Via G Vittorio 16, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy; [Di Nucci, Maria Rosaria] Free Univ Berlin, Environm Policy Res Ctr, Ihnestr 22, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",University of Trento; European Academy of Bozen-Bolzano; Free University of Berlin,"Mosannenzadeh, F (通讯作者)，Univ Trento, Doctoral Sch Civil Environm & Mech Engn, Via Mesiano 77, I-38123 Trento, Italy.;Mosannenzadeh, F (通讯作者)，European Acad Bolzano, Inst Renewable Energy, Via G Vittorio 16, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy.",farnaz.mosannenzadeh@alumni.unitn.it; dinucci@zedat.fu-berlin.de; daniele.vettorato@eurac.edu,,"Di Nucci, Maria Rosaria/0000-0002-0833-8247; VETTORATO, DANIELE/0000-0002-5482-1723","European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration [609019]","European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration(European Union (EU))","This work was partially supported by the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration [Grant number 609019].

Located in the complex international economic and political environment, the benefits of overseas oil projects are affected by various uncertainties. Oil companies call for a set of evaluation method dealing with these uncertainties, especially when encountering low-oil-price conditions. It is much more crucial to answer when to optimally invest rather than whether to invest. This paper analyzes the investment opportunity of an oil project in the development and production phase considering uncertainty, irreversibility and management flexibility. The decision-making process combines Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method and the trinomial tree model of Real Option Approach (ROA). For practical purposes, tools of hurdle price, cumulative probability and decision tree are adopted. In addition, results of the case project show the economic feasibility at present and optimal start-up timing at the end of 2016. Besides, the lower cost parameters generally make it easier to meet the opportunity. The scenario analysis suggests the higher risk contributes to an earlier start-up. Furthermore, the issues of method applicability, investment signals and decision-lag effects are discussed.","[Tang, Bao-Jun; Zhou, Hui-Ling; Chen, Hao; Cao, Hong] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Tang, Bao-Jun; Zhou, Hui-Ling; Chen, Hao; Cao, Hong] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Tang, Bao-Jun; Zhou, Hui-Ling; Chen, Hao; Cao, Hong] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Elect Vehicles Beijing, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Wang, Kai] China Natl Petr Corp, Res Inst Petr Explorat & Dev, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",Beijing Institute of Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology; China National Petroleum Corporation,"Tang, BJ (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",tbj@bit.edu.cn,,"Zhou, Huiling/0000-0002-0493-560X","Science Fund for Creative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [71521002]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71273031, 71573013]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation of China [9152014]; Key Project of Beijing Social Science Foundation Research Base [15DJA084]; National Key R D Program [2016YFA0602603]",Science Fund for Creative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Natural Science Foundation of China(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); Key Project of Beijing Social Science Foundation Research Base; National Key R D Program,"We gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the Science Fund for Creative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 71521002), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant nos. 71273031 and 71573013), the Beijing Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 9152014), Key Project of Beijing Social Science Foundation Research Base (Grant no. 15DJA084) and National Key R & D Program (Grant no. 2016YFA0602603).",,39,29,30,2,75,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUN,2017,105.0,,,,,,17,26,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.02.023,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ET8EY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000400532900003,0

Most of the proposals for price computation existing in the literature are concerned with short-term competitive equilibrium (generators should not be willing to change the dispatch assigned to them by the auctioneer), which implies operational-cost recovery for all of the generators accepted in the auction. However, this is in general not enough to choose between the different pricing schemes. We propose to include an additional criterion in order to discriminate among different pricing schemes: prices have to be also signals for generation expansion. Using this condition, we arrive to a single solution to the problem of defining prices, where they are computed as the shadow prices of the balance equations in a linear version of the unit commitment problem. Importantly, not every linearization of the unit commitment is valid; we develop the conditions for this linear model to provide adequate investment signals. Compared to other proposals in the literature, our results provide a strong motivation for the pricing scheme and a simple method for price computation.","[Vazquez, Carlos] Univ Politecn Madrid, Sch Mines & Energy, Calle Rios Rosas 21, Madrid 28003, Spain; [Vazquez, Carlos] Gas Nat Fenosa, Ave San Luis 77, Madrid 28033, Spain; [Hallack, Michelle; Vazquez, Miguel] Univ Fed Fluminense, Fac Econ, Campus Gragoata,Bloco F, BR-24210510 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil; [Hallack, Michelle; Vazquez, Miguel] European Univ Inst, RSCAS, Florence Sch Regulat, Via Fontanelle 19, I-50014 Florence, Italy; [Vazquez, Miguel] FGV, Ctr Regulat & Infrastruct Studies CERI, Bartio Itambi 60, Botafogo, RJ, Brazil",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Universidade Federal Fluminense; European University Institute; Getulio Vargas Foundation,"Vazquez, M (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Fluminense, Fac Econ, Campus Gragoata,Bloco F, BR-24210510 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil.",vazquez.martinez@upm.es; MichelleCMHallack@gmail.com; Miguel.Vazquez.Martinez@gmail.com,,,CSEN; CAPES/BRASIL through the Science without Borders research program,CSEN; CAPES/BRASIL through the Science without Borders research program,"The ideas developed in this paper took shape within a research project sponsored by the CSEN (the former Electricity Regulatory Commission of Spain) in 1997-98.

Although forestland owners can supply biomass using different means, including supplying biomass from existing stands and changing land use to establish feedstock plantation, among others, previous studies mostly focus only on a given way of supplying biomass at a time. This produces incomplete information that adversely affects its use. By presenting survey takers in Virginia and Texas three different ways of supplying biomass at the same time, we determine forestland owners' willingness to consider multiple ways of supplying biomass simultaneously and identify the factors that predict such behavior, assess overlap in forestland owners across the different ways of supplying biomass, and assess if and how respondents' forest management plans and sustainability concerns correspond with their supply decision. Our results show a higher and more articulated rate of willingness to supply biomass than reported in previous studies.

Results hold when controlling for universities' educational offer, trying different definitions of university attractiveness, excluding private academic institutions and limiting the analysis to non-selective courses.","[Cattaneo, Mattia; Malighetti, Paolo; Meoli, Michele; Paleari, Stefano] Univ Bergamo, Dept Management Informat & Prod Engn, Dalmine, BG, Italy; [Cattaneo, Mattia; Meoli, Michele; Paleari, Stefano] Univ Bergamo, CCSE Cisalpino Inst Comparat Studies Europe, Bergamo, BG, Italy",University of Bergamo; University of Bergamo,"Cattaneo, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bergamo, Dept Management Informat & Prod Engn, Dalmine, BG, Italy.;Cattaneo, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bergamo, CCSE Cisalpino Inst Comparat Studies Europe, Bergamo, BG, Italy.",mattia.cattaneo@unibg.it; paolo.malighetti@unibg.it; michele.meoli@unibg.it; stefano.paleari@unibg.it,"Meoli, Michele/X-2093-2019","Meoli, Michele/0000-0002-9438-0782; malighetti, paolo/0000-0002-2655-9860; Cattaneo, Mattia/0000-0003-4400-089X; Paleari, Stefano/0000-0001-6099-560X",Fondazione Cariplo [2010-1106],Fondazione Cariplo(Fondazione Cariplo),This work was financially supported by the Fondazione Cariplo [grant number 2010-1106].,,51,33,33,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

In this study using a mathematical programming approach we compare a direct water buyback program with an indirect, land idling based, program for securing required amount of water. We show that land idling based programs can be costlier than direct water buyback programs. Compensation for water idling directly, unlike land idling based programs, ensures that marginal water units with the lowest derived demand values are removed from production first.

This goal has been challenged by many factors influencing energy prices and costs such as developments in global energy markets, the EU ETS, and the promotion of renewables. Analysing energy costs (prices times quantity) instead of prices has the advantage of accounting for quantity adjustments. However, it does not allow for monitoring the burden that energy costs pose on firms. For this purpose, both the European Commission and the Energy Expert Commission of the German Government recommend using real unit energy costs, defined as energy costs as a fraction of value added. We develop an input-output based (real unit) energy cost accounting framework and study the trends in Germany and the EU between 1995 and 2011. We find that many of the discovered developments are not adequately represented in the political debate, especially with regard to indirect costs (via energy embodied in intermediate inputs), which are more difficult to assess. Indirect energy costs are on the rise, are larger than direct costs in many industries, are increasingly imported, and amplify the asymmetric impacts of legal exceptions available to energy-intensive industries.","[Kaltenegger, Oliver; Loeschel, Andreas; Baikowski, Martin; Lingens, Joerg] Univ Munster, Ctr Appl Econ Res Munster CAWM, Stadtgraben 9, D-48143 Munster, Germany; [Loeschel, Andreas] Univ Int Business & Econ, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Loeschel, Andreas] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, L7,1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany; [Loeschel, Andreas] CESifo Res Network, Munich, Germany",University of Munster; University of International Business & Economics; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Ifo Institut,"Kaltenegger, O (通讯作者)，Univ Munster, Ctr Appl Econ Res Munster CAWM, Stadtgraben 9, D-48143 Munster, Germany.",Oliver.Kaltenegger@wiwi.uni-muenster.de,"Löschel, Andreas/AAG-6699-2020","Löschel, Andreas/0000-0002-3366-8053",,,,,35,15,15,2,40,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2017,104.0,,,,,,419,430,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.11.039,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP7HS,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397549500042,0

However, it differs from most such studies in contrasting the private incentives of a storage operator with the public desirability of bulk storage. A key factor in the context of a market such as Britain, where renewable energy largely means wind generation, is the nature of wind generation itself. The problem of wind's high variance and intermittent nature is explored. It is argued that not only is there a missing money and a missing market issue in providing secure energy supplies, there is also a missing informational issue. A key opportunity for new storage is participation in a capacity market, if the setting is right.","[Waterson, Michael] Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Waterson, Michael] ZEW, Mannheim, Germany",University of Warwick; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Waterson, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.;Waterson, M (通讯作者)，ZEW, Mannheim, Germany.",Michael.waterson@warwick.ac.uk,"Waterson, Michael/N-7203-2019","Waterson, Michael/0000-0003-0363-9267",EPSRC [EP/K002228]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K002228/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/K002228/1] Funding Source: UKRI,EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This paper reports on work carried out in part with John Barton, Lisa Flatley, Monica Giulietti, Luigi Grossi, Robert MacKay, Murray Thompson and Elisa Trujillo.

The dynamical simulation model HiREPS of the Austrian and German electricity, heating and cooling sectors was used for this analysis. The electricity generation cost and changes in the required secured capacity were used as indicators for the resilience of the energy system. The results show, that the analysed changes in the natural gas price have larger impact on the electricity generation cost than weather variability between different years or climate change. Especially the fossil fuel based scenario showed high sensitivity to the gas price. Analysis of the required secured capacity shows, that in the last quarter of the 21st century the annual maximum residual loads are growing and are dominated by strong cooling demand peaks. Promoting passive cooling options, efficient building designs and options for a controlled down regulation of cooling devices seems to be advisable to avoid installing large thermal power plant backup capacities. The evaluated climate model simulations show only small changes in photovoltaic, wind and hydro power generation for 2051-2080 in Austria and Germany.","[Totschnig, G.; Hirner, R.; Mueller, A.; Kranzl, L.; Hummel, M.] Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Energy Syst & Elect Dr, Energy Econ Grp, Gusshausstr 25-29-370-3, A-1040 Vienna, Austria; [Nachtnebel, H. -P.; Stanzel, P.] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Water Management Hydrol & Hydraul Engn, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Schicker, I.; Formayer, H.] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Meteorol, A-1190 Vienna, Austria","Technische Universitat Wien; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Totschnig, G (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Energy Syst & Elect Dr, Energy Econ Grp, Gusshausstr 25-29-370-3, A-1040 Vienna, Austria.",totschnig@eeg.tuwien.ac.at,,"Hummel, Marcus/0000-0001-7697-1426; Kranzl, Lukas/0000-0003-3350-7134; Schicker, Irene/0000-0001-6401-2412; Muller, Andreas/0000-0002-2030-4584",Austrian Climate and Energy Fund; ACRP (Austrian climate research program),Austrian Climate and Energy Fund; ACRP (Austrian climate research program),"This publication was enabled by the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund and the ACRP (Austrian climate research program), supporting the research project PRESENCE (Power through resilience of energy systems: energy crises, trends and climate change).",,22,33,34,3,40,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,APR,2017,103.0,,,,,,238,248,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.01.019,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP4NA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397356000019,0

Ceding autonomy and independence in the home for increased technological control are the main perceived risks. An additional survey of actual SHT users (n=42) participating in a smart home field trial identifies the key role of early adopters in lowering perceived SHT risks for the mass market. Content analysis of SHT marketing material (n=62) finds the SHT industry are insufficiently emphasising measures to build consumer confidence on data security and privacy. Policymakers can play an important role in mitigating perceived risks, and supporting the energy management potential of a smart-home future.

In the proposed model, two main agents, i.e., the government (the ETS implementer) and the firms in different sectors (the ETS targets), are considered. Under the ETS policy, all agents make various decisions individually according to their own goals, and interact with each other through three main markets: the commodity market, the primary carbon auction market and the secondary carbon trading market. Different popular auction designs are introduced into the ETS formulation to offer helpful insights into China's ETS design. (1) Generally, the ETS would lead to positive effects on China's carbon mitigation and energy structure improvement, but a negative impact on economy. (2) As for auction forms, the uniform-price design is relatively moderate, while the discriminative-price design is quite aggressive in both economic damage and emissions reduction. (3) As for carbon price, the uniform-price auction might generate a slightly higher market clearing price than the discriminative-price auction, and the prices under two auction rules fluctuate about RMB 40 per metric ton. (4) As for carbon cap, the total allowances in the carbon auction market should be carefully set to well balance economic growth and mitigation effect.","[Tang, Ling] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China; [Tang, Ling; Yu, Lean] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Wu, Jiaqian] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci & Dev, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Bao, Qin] Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China","Beihang University; Beijing University of Chemical Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Academy of Mathematics & System Sciences, CAS","Yu, LA (通讯作者)，Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",tangling@mail.buct.edu.cn; wujiaqian@casipm.ac.cn; yulean@amss.ac.cn; baoqin@amss.ac.cn,,"Wu, Jiaqian/0009-0006-4275-3416","National Program on Key Research Project of China [2016YFF0204400]; National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars (NSFC) [71025005]; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71622011, 71433001, 71301006, 71203214]; National Program for Support of Top-Notch Young Professionals; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in BUCT",National Program on Key Research Project of China; National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Program for Support of Top-Notch Young Professionals; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in BUCT,"This work is supported by grants from the National Program on Key Research Project of China (Grant no. 2016YFF0204400), National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars (NSFC no. 71025005), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC no. 71622011, NSFC no. 71433001, NSFC no. 71301006 and NSFC no. 71203214), the National Program for Support of Top-Notch Young Professionals, and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in BUCT.",,35,79,84,26,199,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2017,102.0,,,,,,30,40,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.11.041,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP4NM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397357200005,0

The analysis focuses on the empirical evidence of learning processes in PV deployment. Our findings show that learning for PV deployment exhibits characteristics of local learning identified in the innovation literature (tacit knowledge, shared narratives, user relations and learning in interorganizational networks). In addition, we show that competencies in the deployment of PV rely on learning processes that are closely connected to the historically and geographically distinctive characteristics of the built environment. We also find evidence of the significance of proximity in (local) learning, as well as examples of knowledge being codified over time into national and global knowledge flows.

In 2013, the Government launched its capacity-based renewable energy support scheme (CRESS), however, the Ministry of Energy (2016a) expects it will merely add 0.3% to the current 0.67% share of renewables (Ministry of Energy, 2016c). This raises the question what factors might explain this implementation gap. On the basis of field research in Moscow, the article offers an in-depth policy analysis of resource-geographic, financial, institutional and ecologic enabling and constraining factors of Russia's CRESS between 2009 and 2015. To avoid the trap that policy intentions remain on paper, the entire policy cycle from goal setting to implementation - has been covered. The article concludes that wind energy, which would have contributed the lion's share of new renewable energy capacity, lags behind, jeopardizing the quantitative renewable energy target. The depreciation of the rouble decreased return on investment, and the local content requirement discouraged investors given the lack of Russian wind production facilities. Contrary to resource-geographic and financial expectations, solar projects have been commissioned more accurately, benefitting from access to major business groups and existing production facilities.","[Smeets, Niels] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Pk Str 45 Box 3602, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Smeets, N (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Pk Str 45 Box 3602, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",niels.smeets@kuleuven.be,,"Smeets, Niels/0000-0002-9850-6733","FP7 project The EU In Depth: European Identity, Cultural Diversity and Political Change [PIRSES-GA-2013- 612619]","FP7 project The EU In Depth: European Identity, Cultural Diversity and Political Change","The author wishes to thank Marianne Riddervold and Dicle Korkmaz for their valuable feedback within the ANTERO network.

Total regional electricity demand and supply increase by eight to fourteen times from 2010 to 2070, with major shifts in both the sectoral composition of demand and the geography of demand, with South Africa becoming a much smaller share. On the supply side, the fuel mix shifts from coal and toward hydro in the medium term, but towards other renewables, such as solar, in the longer term, particularly in the scenarios with the fastest decline in capital costs for renewables. This leads to declining unit carbon dioxide emissions in the more aggressive scenarios, even though total power sector emissions still increase. The unit cost of generation for the entire region is stable across all scenarios. The potential transformation of the supply sector would require a fundamental shift in resource use, grid management and infrastructure development in the region, as well as greater regional integration. This also implies significant institutional capacity development in the SAPP Coordination Centre or similar structures for cooperative management of resources.","[Spalding-Fecher, Randall.] Carbon Limits AS, Ovre Vollgate 6, N-0158 Oslo, Norway; [Senatla, Mamahloko] Univ Cape Town, Energy Res Ctr, Private Bag, Cape Town, South Africa; [Yamba, Francis; Lukwesa, Biness; Himunzowa, Grayson] Ctr Energy Environm Engn Zambia, Private Bag E 721, Lusaka, Zambia; [Heaps, Charles] Stockholm Environm Inst US Ctr, 11 Curtis Ave, Somerville, MA USA; [Chapman, Arthur] OneWorld Sustainable Investments, 4 Spin St, Cape Town, South Africa; [Mahumane, Gilberto] Eduardo Mondlane Univ, Maputo, Mozambique; [Tembo, Bernard] UCL, Gower Str, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Nyambe, Imasiku] Univ Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia; [Senatla, Mamahloko] CSIR, 1 Meiring Neude Rd, Pretoria, South Africa; [Mahumane, Gilberto] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Cape Town; Eduardo Mondlane University; University of London; University College London; University of Zambia; Council for Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - South Africa; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Spalding-Fecher, R (通讯作者)，Carbon Limits AS, Ovre Vollgate 6, N-0158 Oslo, Norway.",randall.spaldingfecher@gmail.com; msenatla@gmail.com; ceeez2015@gmail.com; ceeez2015@gmail.com; ceeez2015@gmail.com; cheaps@sei-us.org; rarthur.chapman@gmail.com; gilberto.mahumane@gmail.com; ben2great@yahoo.co.uk; inyambe@unza.zm,"Chapman, Arthur/JGM-0057-2023; Senatla, Mamahloko/W-5024-2019","Senatla, Mamahloko/0000-0002-1640-6123; Chapman, Arthur/0000-0001-8356-7050; Lukwesa, Biness/0000-0002-5491-5623; Nyambe, Imasiku/0000-0002-6176-0084; Tembo, Bernard/0000-0003-3219-8173",World Bank group [7170118],World Bank group,"Funding from the World Bank group (contract number 7170118) for this research is gratefully acknowledged.

An indispensable prerequisite for the successful operation of companies in any area is the building of different connections between companies, between companies and customers or suppliers. These links mean that companies create certain mutual groupings. These groupings are usually formed between companies with a similar sectoral orientation or within a geographic affinity, thus creating the so-called clusters. The affinity of companies brings different benefits to members of these clusters - for example, in the form of positive externalities. Effective clustering can have positive effects for national economies, notably in the form of increasing of company performance and competitiveness. In dynamic world of today, where globalization is pushing to the foreground, it is essential to address the issues of cooperation that will ensure the development of the country and increase its position on the world market. Success in global markets is determined the competitiveness of individual countries. Country competitiveness as a tool for building a position in relation to other countries of the international market is currently being created and maintained mainly through innovation and regional development. The cluster policy is one of the instruments of development policies in the individual countries of the world, including those of the European Union. Slovak Republic, as part of the Visegrad Four (V4), does not have a unified system to support the formation and development of clusters and national cluster policies. We consider the comparison of cluster policy and cluster support in the V4 countries to be an incentive to further improve of the functioning clusters.","[Chlebikova, Darina] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Chlebikova, D (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",darina.chlebikova@fpedas.uniza.sk,,,Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education of the Slovak Republic Project [VEGA 1/0693/16],Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education of the Slovak Republic Project,This work has been supported by the Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education of the Slovak Republic Project VEGA 1/0693/16.,,29,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,741,748,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059201030,0

A distinctive feature of our estimator is that it does not require a fully parametric model for the conditional mean and variance. We establish consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimates. The theory is nonstandard due to the presence of estimated factors. We provide sufficient conditions for the estimated factors not to have an impact in the asymptotic standard error of estimators. A simulation study investigates the finite sample performance of the estimates. Finally, an application to the CRSP value-weighted excess returns highlights the merits of our approach. In contrast to most previous studies using nonparametric estimates, we find a positive and significant price of risk in our semiparametric setting.","[Escanciano, Juan Carlos] Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, 100 S Woodlawn,Wylie Hall, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Carlos Pardo-Fernandez, Juan] Univ Vigo, Dept Stat & OR, Campus Univ, Vigo 36310, Spain; [Van Keilegom, Ingrid] Catholic Univ Louvain, Voie du Roman Pays 20, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Universidade de Vigo; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Escanciano, JC (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, 100 S Woodlawn,Wylie Hall, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",jescanci@indiana.edu; juancp@uvigo.es; ingrid.vankeilegom@uclouvain.be,"Pardo-Fernandez, Juan Carlos/N-7760-2019; Escanciano, Juan Carlos/R-1878-2018","Pardo-Fernandez, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-8260-374X; Van Keilegom, Ingrid/0000-0001-8827-7642; Escanciano, Juan Carlos/0000-0001-6559-416X",Spanish Plan Nacional de I+D+I [ECO2014-55858-P]; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [MTM2014-55966-P]; European Research Council under the European Community [203650]; IAP research network grant of the Belgian government (Belgian Science Policy) [P7/06]; contract Projet d'Actions de Recherche Concerte es (ARC) of the Communaute francaise de Belgique - Academie universitaire Louvain [11/16-039],Spanish Plan Nacional de I+D+I(Spanish Government); Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); European Research Council under the European Community(European Research Council (ERC)); IAP research network grant of the Belgian government (Belgian Science Policy); contract Projet d'Actions de Recherche Concerte es (ARC) of the Communaute francaise de Belgique - Academie universitaire Louvain,"The first author acknowledges research support from the Spanish Plan Nacional de I+D+I, reference number ECO2014-55858-P.

Regional Studies. This paper presents an evaluation exercise on the impact of European Cohesion Policy on the economic performance of the most disadvantaged European areas (Objective 1 regions) for the programming period 2000-06. By performing the analysis at NUTS-3 rather than NUTS-2 level to exploit the exogeneity of the treatment status in the context of a regression discontinuity design (RDD),the analysis shows that European Cohesion funds have positively contributed to generating economic growth in lagging areas. However, their effect is mainly driven by the successful performance of rural areas close to the main urban agglomerates. Favourable geography and the progressive suburbanization of the rural landscape created new opportunities for rural areas close to cities, thus boosting the effect of the policy.","[Gagliardi, Luisa] Univ Geneva, Sch Social Sci SdS, Dept Hist Econ & Soc DEHES, Geneva, Switzerland; [Gagliardi, Luisa] London Sch Econ, SERC, London, England; [Gagliardi, Luisa; Percoco, Marco] Bocconi Univ, Res Ctr Reg Econ Transports & Tourism CERTeT, Milan, Italy; [Percoco, Marco] Bocconi Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Publ Management, Milan, Italy",University of Geneva; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Bocconi University; Bocconi University,"Gagliardi, L (通讯作者)，Univ Geneva, Sch Social Sci SdS, Dept Hist Econ & Soc DEHES, Geneva, Switzerland.;Gagliardi, L (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, SERC, London, England.;Gagliardi, L (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Res Ctr Reg Econ Transports & Tourism CERTeT, Milan, Italy.",luisa.gagliardi@unige.ch; marco.percoco@unibocconi.it,,,EIBURS grant by the European Investment Bank (EIB); EIB,EIBURS grant by the European Investment Bank (EIB); EIB,This paper was developed in the context of an EIBURS grant provided by the European Investment Bank (EIB).

The design of the system for increasing navigation safety consists of a system for monitoring the life functions of a crew member as well as a position of the vessel towards the fairway / shore. The first level focuses on tracking the life function of the vessel's crew / boat master. The second level addresses the position of the vessel and the possibility of increasing safety by cooperating with the data provided by Automatic Identification System - AIS.

Regional Studies. A regional or meso'-level of regulation and policy-making has emerged in Europe. This cannot adequately be explained by functional imperatives or drivers. A constructivist perspective sees the region as the outcome of political contestation over the definition and meaning of territory. Six competing conceptual frames for regionalism are proposed: integrative; competitive; welfare; identity; government; and the region as a refraction of social and economic interests. Any given case will reflect a balance among these conceptions. Such an understanding permits a combination of comparative analysis with an understanding of individual cases and avoids both dismissal of territory and territorial determinism.,"[Keating, Michael] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Social Sci, Aberdeen, Scotland",University of Aberdeen,"Keating, M (通讯作者)，Univ Aberdeen, Sch Social Sci, Aberdeen, Scotland.",M.keating@abdn.ac.uk,,,"Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [RES-051-27-0302]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/N004302/1, ES/H004645/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H004645/1, ES/N004302/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),The research on which this paper is based was conducted under an Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Professorial Fellowship [grant number RES-051-27-0302].,,99,66,69,4,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Despite complex business globalization, many project managers are facing an inability to make proper decisions when it comes to project risks. They would list all potential risks that could affect a project, instead of carefully considering what the common business risks of every project are and what the real risks are; otherwise the list of risks may become too long. Where are the origins of the project managers' decisions concerning the project risks? The project managers' leadership style is a success factor on leading projects and on managing the risks in the projects. In this paper, we work with the relevant literature on the topic. Surprisingly, there is a lack of studies reflecting the connection between the project managers' leadership styles and family education styles. We aim to show that the project manager's leadership style is influenced by the styles of family education the managers experienced in the childhood. We suppose 1) that different leadership styles are appropriate for different types of projects and 2) that different leadership styles arise from different family education styles. The education styles experienced in the family create a fundamental self-image of the future project manager and it's a particular family education style that influences strongly whether the future manager will be able to reject or accept the project risks. Those decisions are his / her self-image response, arising from his / her childhood education experiences.","[Kratka, Jana; Hruskova, Lenka] Metropolitan Univ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic",Metropolitan University Prague,"Krátká, J (通讯作者)，Metropolitan Univ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.",jana.kratka@mup.cz; lenka.hruskova@mup.cz,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1178,1185,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059202018,0

The project idea is focused on analysing the potential and growth opportunities for multimodal transport usage in chemical supply chain management. Firstly, the objectives, current status and methodology of the project are explained. Then, the results of the research carried out among chemical and logistics companies operating in Poland are discussed. Furthermore, there is recognised that transport modal shift decisions determine changes in supply chain configurations that might be supported by planning and management tools. Consequently, the elements of the ChemMultimodal toolbox are outlined and its potential significance for low-carbon scenarios development is highlighted. As a result, both theoretical and practical implications of the research findings are indicated.","[Ocicka, Barbara] Warsaw Sch Econ, Collegium Business Adm, Dept Logist, Al Niepodleglosci 162, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Ocicka, B (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Collegium Business Adm, Dept Logist, Al Niepodleglosci 162, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland.",barbara.ocicka@sgh.waw.pl,,"Ocicka, Barbara/0000-0003-4898-9594",Interreg Central Europe Programme; research project From horse-drawn railway to intermodal transport within Visegrad Fund,Interreg Central Europe Programme(Interreg Europe); research project From horse-drawn railway to intermodal transport within Visegrad Fund,The article is a result of ChemMultimodal Project implementation and is co-financed by Interreg Central Europe Programme.; This paper is supported by the research project From horse-drawn railway to intermodal transport within Visegrad Fund.,,17,0,0,0,4,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2261-236X,,,MATEC WEB CONF,,,2017,134.0,,,,,,,,43.0,10.1051/matecconf/201713400043,0.0,,,8,Business; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BJ5ZQ,,"gold, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426430600043,0

In order to report on the current state of B2B communications, a literature review has been conducted. A qualitative study among representatives of the European machine tools market followed, so as to determine the state of communications in a specific part of the market. It was discovered that the European B2B marketers in the field of machine tools have an overview of the new marketing communication techniques, but the use is narrow. This shows the large reserves in marketing techniques and the opportunities to make the communications strategies of these companies more efficient. Future research should validate these findings by means of quantitative methods to propose actions for restructuring their communications strategies and techniques, as in the following decades the millennial generation will take over management positions and will call for modern forms of communication.","[Povolna, Lucie] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Econ & Management, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Povolná, L (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Econ & Management, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic.",lucie.povolna@ujep.cz,"Povolná, Lucie/IZE-1916-2023","Povolná, Lucie/0000-0002-6237-699X",,,,,33,0,0,18,87,TOMAS BATA UNIV ZLIN,ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7454-654-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,278,285,,10.7441/dokbat.2017.29,0.0,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BM6FF,,"Bronze, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000466528800029,0

Traditionally, infrastructure has been funded mostly through public investment. However, in view of budgetary resources scarcity and lack of capacity within the government to implement these ambitious programmes, the strategy of the government relies significantly on promoting investment through a combination of public investment and private participation. It is shown that the high frequency of crises in the global economy, associated with decline in production, the loss of business solvency makes it necessary to identify some key obstacles for greater infrastructure finance. The foreign and domestic practice in the formation and development of a market for long-run investment in infrastructure has been examined; sources and mechanisms for organizing long-run investment in infrastructure have been identified, as well as the role of specialized development institutions in financing infrastructure. The main trends in the development of the market for long-run investment in Russia and its constraints under the conditions of globalization are identified. Given the special status of financing long-run infrastructure projects, a system of incentives and measures is proposed that would, on the one hand, specifically stimulate and protect investment in infrastructure, and on the other, create a common quality investment environment for infrastructure projects. The paper presents the results of research new financing approaches reflecting the market changes and the advent of new financial instruments. A greater variety of financial instruments for infrastructure financing would help to make infrastructure more attractive for a broader group of investors and would allow a better diversification of risks.","[Tolstel, Marina S.] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Econ, GSP 1,1-46 Leninskiye Gory, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Russkova, Elena G.] Volgograd State Univ, Inst World Econ & Finance, Prospekt Univ Skiy 100, Volgograd 400062, Russia; [Yalmaev, Rustam A.] Chechen State Univ, Sheripova Str 32, Grozny 364093, Russia",Lomonosov Moscow State University; Volgograd State University (VOLSU); Kadyrov Chechen State University,"Tolstel, MS (通讯作者)，Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Econ, GSP 1,1-46 Leninskiye Gory, Moscow 119991, Russia.",marina-tolstel@yandex.ru; russkovaeg@volsu.ru; imamat@list.ru,"Tolstel, Marina/HKV-5998-2023",,,,,,15,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2690,2697,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059205011,0

In this paper, a recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium model is established to examine the existence of synergetic effects within water fee policy and energy related climate policy, i.e. carbon tax, and provide insights for Chinese integrative policy-making. The results show that water fee can contribute to industrial water conservation, whereas its effect is limited under current water fee level. The adoption of a carbon tax in addition to it might further improve its water saving benefits. Furthermore, water fee can also promote the enhancement of China's emission reduction goal, and a higher carbon tax and water fee rate can achieve greater emission reduction effects. At this point, the synergetic spillover effects that water conservation benefits will be achieved simultaneously via the transition of industry into a more low-carbon form is critical for elaborating an effective strategy of environmental policy. Besides, our results suggest that giving priority to renewable power is regarded as the silver bullet to address the water and emission constraints on energy system, as it can optimize the water conservation benefits of emission reduction.","[Fan, Jing-Li; Kong, Ling-Si] CUMTB, Sch Resources & Safety Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Fan, Jing-Li] China Univ Min & Technol, State Key Lab Coal Resources & Safe Min, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Fan, Jing-Li] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xian] Minist Sci & Technol MOST, ACCA21, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China",China University of Mining & Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology,"Zhang, X (通讯作者)，Minist Sci & Technol MOST, ACCA21, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China.",zhangxian@acca21.org.cn,"Zhang, Xian/JJE-3540-2023; Fan, Jing-Li/AGN-2363-2022","Zhang, Xian/0000-0002-5841-6899; Fan, Jing-Li/0000-0003-2371-5845","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71503249]; Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST [2016QNRC001]; Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research, Japan [CBA2018-02MY-Fan]; Beijing Excellent Talent Program, China [2015000020124G122]; Open Research Project of State Key Laboratory of Coal Resources and Safe Mining (China University of Mining and Technology) [SKLCRSM16KFC05]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST; Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research, Japan; Beijing Excellent Talent Program, China; Open Research Project of State Key Laboratory of Coal Resources and Safe Mining (China University of Mining and Technology)","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant (No. 71503249), Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST (No. 2016QNRC001), Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research (No. CBA2018-02MY-Fan), Japan, Beijing Excellent Talent Program (No. 2015000020124G122), China, and the Open Research Project of State Key Laboratory of Coal Resources and Safe Mining (China University of Mining and Technology) (No. SKLCRSM16KFC05).

Here we advance a conceptual framework and quantitative method for quantifying the causes of cost changes in a technology, and apply it to PV modules. Our method begins with a cost model that breaks down cost into variables that changed over time. Cost change equations are then derived to quantify each variable's contribution. We distinguish between changes observed in variables of the cost model - which we term low-level mechanisms of cost reduction - and research and development, learning-by-doing, and scale economies, which we refer to as high-level mechanisms. We find that increased module efficiency was the leading low-level cause of cost reduction in 1980-2012, contributing almost 25% of the decline. Government-funded and private R&D was the most important high-level mechanism over this period. After 2001, however, scale economies became a more significant cause of cost reduction, approaching R&D in importance. Policies that stimulate market growth have played a key role in enabling PV's cost reduction, through privately-funded R&D and scale economies, and to a lecser extent learning-by-doing. The method presented here can be adapted to retrospectively or prospectively study many technologies, and performance metrics besides cost.","[Kavlak, Goksin; McNerney, James; Trancik, Jessika E.] MIT, Inst Data Syst & Soc, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Trancik, Jessika E.] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); The Santa Fe Institute,"Trancik, JE (通讯作者)，MIT, Inst Data Syst & Soc, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",trancik@mit.edu,"Kavlak, Goksin/H-8224-2014","/0000-0001-8338-7244; Kavlak, Goksin/0000-0001-9380-6449",U.S. Department of Energy [DE-EE0006131],U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"We thank Geoffrey Kinsey, Richard Swanson, Michael Woodhouse, Paula Mints, Adam Cohen, Marie Mapes, Dave Rench-McCauley, Gregory Nemet, Marius Peters, and John Deutch for valuable discussions.

We identify three messaging pitfalls that can result from this assumption, namely that a message will be more persuasive if it emphasizes the greatest number of people engaging in undesirable behavior, the greatest number of victims of such behavior, and the greatest number of reasons why one should adopt particular energy conservation and efficiency measures. We cite experimental evidence demonstrating that these strategies can in fact reduce the persuasive power of a message, and review several underlying psychological mechanisms that may explain these counterproductive effects.

According to the China Global Energy Finance database, between 2000 and 2017, China Development Bank (CDB) and China Export-Import Bank (CHEXIM) provided $225.75 billion in overseas energy development finance. We find that: China's 'policy banks' and funds have doubled the availability of global development finance-and hold more assets than the major Western-backed MDBs operating in developing countries. With the onset of a new family of funds and multilateral development banks co-financed by China, China is poised to be the largest development lender in the world as Western-backed MDBs appear stagnated in their ability to increase their capital bases. China's global energy portfolio is heavily exposed to country, macroeconomic, climate, and social risks, however. To mitigate such risks and meet the broader sustainable development challenge for the 21st Century, China's development finance will need to shift the composition of its global energy lending in a significant manner.","[Gallagher, Kevin P.; Kamal, Rohini; Jin, Junda; Ma, Xinyue] Boston Univ, Global Dev Policy Ctr, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Chen, Yanning] SAIS CARI China Africa Initiat, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Chen, Yanning] 1717 Massachusetts Ave NW,Suite 723, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Boston University,"Chen, YN (通讯作者)，SAIS CARI China Africa Initiat, Washington, DC 20036 USA.;Chen, YN (通讯作者)，1717 Massachusetts Ave NW,Suite 723, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",ychen282@jhu.edu,"Ma, Xinyue/K-8161-2012",,Climate Works Foundation; Charles Stewart Mott Foundation [2013-00755.01],Climate Works Foundation; Charles Stewart Mott Foundation,Research for this publication was funded by Climate Works Foundation and Charles Stewart Mott Foundation (2013-00755.01).,,33,52,60,2,50,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2018,122.0,,,,,,313,321,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.06.009,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GX2UX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447576700029,0

This study examines the sustainability of switching from fossil-based electricity generation to renewable energy systems. Life cycle assessment (LCA) of both fossil- and renewable-based electricity generation were modeled for four environmental impact categories, in the context of Singapore city. The LCA method followed the CMI. methodology. Four major environmental impacts were calculated: global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP), eutrophication potential (EP) and human toxicity potential (HTP). The cradle-to-gate analyses were done for various types of electricity supply sources: Solar photovoltaics (PV), biogas, municipal waste incineration, natural gas, coal and oil. The current mix of 95.2% natural gas, 3% incineration, 1% petroleum products and 0.8% coal was used as baseline for comparison with other mixes. The results showed that having a high proportion of electricity generated from solar PVs can produce ten times higher HIP than baseline scenario. Similarly, electricity from biogas can produce eight times higher AP and EP than baseline. Further analysis showed that HTP from solar PVs impacts locally, but mostly external to Singapore. AP from biogas impacts regionally, within and without Singapore. Policies about renewable energy in the overall electricity mix would thus be value- based, rather than purely economic or environmental.","[Quek, Augustine; Ee, Alvin] Natl Univ Singapore, NUS Environm Res Inst NERI, Energy & Environm Sustainabil Solut Megac E2S2, Singapore, Singapore; [Ng, Adam] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Ind Syst Engn & Management, Singapore, Singapore; [Wah, Tong Yen] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Singapore, Singapore",National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore,"Quek, A (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, NUS Environm Res Inst NERI, Energy & Environm Sustainabil Solut Megac E2S2, Singapore, Singapore.",augustineq@gmail.com,"Tong, Yen Wah/D-4602-2009","Tong, Yen Wah/0000-0002-6004-6284; Ng, Adam/0000-0002-2391-1566","National Research Foundation, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore under its Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (CREATE) programme","National Research Foundation, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore under its Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (CREATE) programme","This research is supported by the National Research Foundation, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore under its Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (CREATE) programme.",,33,29,35,1,52,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2018,122.0,,,,,,388,394,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.07.055,0.0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GX2UX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447576700036,0

Interventions to encourage adoption of cleaner and more fuel-efficient stoves are being implemented widely to reduce these burdens, but sustained use has proven elusive. This study develops a data-driven simulation approach to investigate the potential costs and benefits of cleaner stoves, informed by recent empirical studies. The results suggest that the private case for adoption of technologies other than charcoal ICS is often unclear; that is, households' private benefits do not usually outweigh the costs of these improvements. Overall social benefits, in contrast, are typically positive and large for nearly all such improved technologies. We investigate how economic benefits vary with intensity of use, and find that higher use does not unambiguously translate into greater private benefits. Analyzing the effects of different subsidies, we further find that fuel subsidies for purchased fuels could substantially improve private net benefits, but that even these may be insufficient to make cleaner cooking attractive to many households; stove subsidies meanwhile tend to modestly improve private outcomes. To capture the social benefits of cleaner cooking, new and effective incentives may be needed to support household use of efficient stoves.","[Jeuland, Marc] Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Box 90239, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Jeuland, Marc; Shindell, Drew] Duke Univ, Duke Global Hlth Inst, Box 90328, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Soo, Jie-Sheng Tan] Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, 469B Bukit Timah Rd, Singapore 259771, Singapore; [Shindell, Drew] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Box 90328, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Jeuland, Marc] RWI Leibniz Inst Econ Res, D-45128 Essen, Germany",Duke University; Duke University; National University of Singapore; Duke University; RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Jeuland, M (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Box 90239, Durham, NC 27708 USA.;Jeuland, M (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Duke Global Hlth Inst, Box 90328, Durham, NC 27708 USA.;Jeuland, M (通讯作者)，RWI Leibniz Inst Econ Res, D-45128 Essen, Germany.",marc.jeuland@duke.edu,"Shindell, Drew/D-4636-2012","Shindell, Drew/0000-0003-1552-4715",Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves [UNF 39687],Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves,"We are grateful to the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves (UNF 39687) for contributing financial support that enabled this analysis, and to Sumi Mehta in particular for organizing phone and webinar meetings with expert reviewers who critiqued and helped improve it.",,55,26,29,3,20,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2018,121.0,,,,,,275,285,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.06.031,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV3HA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445983800028,0

Hydrocarbons are not the only output from this process, though, as billions of barrels of produced water are extracted and subsequently pumped back underground. This process of injecting produced water into disposal wells has been causally linked to the rise in earthquakes. Here I show how the amount of earthquakes in Oklahoma are positively linked to the price of oil, and further find that the decrease in earthquake activity in Oklahoma is due to both the drop in oil prices and the regulatory directives of regional authorities. The estimated impact of the various shut-in policies have been small compared to the reduction in earthquakes due to the broad price decline, though. I find that the drop in oil prices that began in mid-2014 led to as large of a reduction in earthquakes as the combined effect of new policies that started in March of 2015.","[Roach, Travis] Univ Cent Oklahoma, Dept Econ, Edmond, OK 73034 USA",University of Central Oklahoma,"Roach, T (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Oklahoma, Dept Econ, Edmond, OK 73034 USA.",troach2@uco.edu,,,NSF Oklahoma EPSCoR ROA+ program,NSF Oklahoma EPSCoR ROA+ program,This research was supported through funding from the NSF Oklahoma EPSCoR ROA+ program.,,37,7,10,0,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2018,121.0,,,,,,365,373,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.040,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV3HA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445983800037,0

The water accounts presented are based primarily on actual water supply and use rates and distinguish between various raw water sources and uses: groundwater, fresh surface, brackish water self-abstracted for own use, and mains-water supply and use. Separate accounts for cooling water are presented. The paper covers flow accounts from the environment to the economy and within the economy excluding all return flows.

The strategy presumes a far-reaching structural system change towards the marketing of advanced electrified powertrains and use of energy carriers such as electricity and hydrogen that are generated in a carbon-free way. The decade 2020-2030 is expected to set in motion the complex process of the necessary transformation of the power generation and transport systems which mandates the successful coordination of the interrelated market actors, consumers and policy makers. This paper presents a systems analysis that aims to assess what would happen if the decarbonisation strategy fails to develop, as anticipated during the decade 2020-2030. We refer to this timeframe as the Lost Decade. To answer this question, our analysis is based on counterfactual scenarios quantified using the PRIMES energy systems model. The analysis concludes that the decade 2020-2030 is a critical point in this transformation. Limited progress in the coming decade would require the adoption of stringent policy measures beyond 2030 which, along with the pressure to reduce emissions in a short period are found to increase substantially the total costs of the system.","[Siskos, Pelopidas; Zazias, Georgios; Petropoulos, Apostolos; Evangelopoulou, Stavroula; Capros, Pantelis] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, E3MLab, 9 Iroon Polytech St, Athens 15773, Greece",National Technical University of Athens,"Siskos, P (通讯作者)，Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, E3MLab, 9 Iroon Polytech St, Athens 15773, Greece.",siskos@e3mlab.eu,,"Capros, Pantelis/0000-0002-8463-5729; , Siskos/0000-0003-4889-6451",,,,,44,41,41,0,24,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2018,121.0,,,,,,48,60,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.06.016,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV3HA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445983800006,0

This is because the links between energy efficiency and energy access, is often overlooked. This oversight of energy efficiency is frequently a missed opportunity, as efficiency is often a very cost-effective energy resource. In combination with grid expansion and new clean energy generation, efficiency efforts can help to ensure that reliable power is provided to the maximum number of customers at a lower cost than would be required to increase generation alone. In this paper we describe an analysis method for determining a country's energy efficiency priorities and devising an action plan to integrate energy efficiency as a resource for meeting a nation's energy access goals. We illustrate this method with a detailed case study of Uganda. If the most efficient technologies on the market were adopted in Uganda, 442 MW of generation-level demand could be offset and energy access for an additional 6 M rural customers could be achieved by 2030. Of this technical potential for efficiency, 91% is cost-effective, and 47% is economically achievable under conservative assumptions.","[du Can, Stephane de la Rue] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Anal & Environm Impacts Div, Energy Technol Area, 1 Cyclotron Rd,MS 90R2121, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Pudleiner, David] ICF Int, Fairfax, VA USA; [Pielli, Katrina] US Agcy Int Dev, Power Africa Initiat, Pretoria, South Africa",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Agency for International Development (USAID),"du Can, SD (通讯作者)，Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Anal & Environm Impacts Div, Energy Technol Area, 1 Cyclotron Rd,MS 90R2121, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",sadelarueducan@lbl.gov,"de la Rue du Can, Stephane/ABI-1794-2020","de la Rue du Can, Stephane/0000-0001-8054-5737",Power Africa funding under the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231],Power Africa funding under the U.S. Department of Energy,This work was funded by Power Africa funding under the U.S. Department of Energy Contract no.

This may help specifically to better understand how an emerging economy can at least in theory have sectors that could be defined as innovation core and source for technology transfer.

This study used citation network analysis and patent analysis to analyse knowledge flows between wind firms and to identify and compare the positon and role of each firm in the knowledge network.

The results of the clustered logistic regression and continuation ratio models provide some support for the hypothesis that interregional (non-local) collaboration results in commercially more valuable inventions relative to patents that are product of intraregional (local) collaboration. The same empirical results also indicate that (1) inter-industry (related) knowledge flows contribute to the patent value more than inter-industry (unrelated) or intra-industry knowledge flows and (2) general-purpose technologies/products as measured by citations of patented inventions received from diverse sets of industries are indicative not only of technological/scientific quality, but also of the economic value of patented inventions. These results are robust in different citation-window designations, exclusion of self-citations, different regional definitions and different patent classifications.","[Sonmez, Zafer] Univ Illinois, Coll Urban Planning & Publ Affairs, Chicago, IL 60607 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Sonmez, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Coll Urban Planning & Publ Affairs, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",zsonme2@uic.edu,,,,,,,101,5,5,4,59,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

First, the ripple index between regional housing markets was estimated using housing price and transaction volume. Findings revealed that the ripple effect in the transaction volume of regional housing markets was far more evident than that in housing prices and that the two types of ripple effect are negatively correlated. In other words, information between regional housing markets is either transferred through price or volume. In this study, monetary policy, overall economic performance, and new housing market were adopted as variables to analyze the cause and outcomes of the ripple effect. The results show that inflation stemming from an excess supply of money causes a ripple effect of rising regional housing prices. This money illusion leads contractors to believe that the housing market has increasing demand, motivating them to enter into new projects. Once these projects are completed, the increase in supply (new homes for sale) is reflected in the transaction volume of the regional housing market. In this instance, a stagnation in housing prices signifies that information is only transferred in the transaction volume. In short, the rise (housing boom) and fall (housing depression) of transaction volume affect interest rates in the mortgage market.","[Tsai, I-Chun] Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Finance, 700 Kaohsiung Univ Rd, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan",National University Kaohsiung,"Tsai, IC (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Finance, 700 Kaohsiung Univ Rd, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan.",ictsai@nuk.edu.tw,"Tsai, I-Chun/H-6503-2018","Tsai, I-Chun/0000-0001-8277-2327",Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [MOST-104-2410-H-390-028-MY3],"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",Funding from the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan under Project No. MOST-104-2410-H-390-028-MY3 has enabled the continuation of this research and the dissemination of these results.,,29,11,11,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

During the period of the European solar boom, the PVGIS-3 radiation data have been largely used by policy makers in setting remuneration levels, as well as by project developers, banks and asset managers for professional assessment of the underlying financial return of the investment. High quality and more accurate data included in the updated PVGIS-CMSAF show that solar resources in Europe have been greatly underestimated by PVGIS-3. The present paper evaluates how reported changes in solar irradiation have affected both PV projects profitability and overall costs of subsidy for final consumers. By focusing on a large sample of Italian PV plants, our findings highlight that solar irradiation levels higher than those initially assumed have caused excessive rents and windfall profits for PV project developers thus potentially harming electricity users which are indirectly bearing the burden of the renewable energy sources (RES) incentives. In regulatory contexts suffering from information asymmetries between RES producers and regulatory agencies, support tariff set by public authorities should be periodically revised according to transparent procedures, whenever significant changes in long-term solar irradiation data occur.","[Monarca, Umberto] Univ Foggia, Dept Econ, Largo Papa Giovanni Paolo II 1, I-71121 Foggia, Italy; [Cassetta, Ernesto] Univ Udine, Dept Econ & Stat, Via Tomadini 30-A, I-33100 Udine, Italy; [Pozzi, Cesare] Luiss Guido Carli, Dept Law, Viale Parenzo 1, I-00197 Rome, Italy; [Dileo, Ivano] Univ Bari, Dept Polit Sci, Piazza Cesare Battisti 1, I-70123 Bari, Italy",University of Foggia; University of Udine; Luiss Guido Carli University; Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro,"Monarca, U (通讯作者)，Univ Foggia, Dept Econ, Largo Papa Giovanni Paolo II 1, I-71121 Foggia, Italy.",umberto.monarca@unifg.it; ernesto.cassetta@uniud.it; cpozzi@luiss.it; ivano.dileo@uniba.it,,"DILEO, Ivano/0000-0003-4004-7527; CASSETTA, Ernesto/0000-0002-7876-4903; MONARCA, UMBERTO/0000-0002-1615-443X",,,,,62,11,12,0,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2018,119.0,,,,,,307,316,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.058,0.0,,,19,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO0XY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439671200028,0

According to our results, rig rates increase very modestly in this reference case. We also consider alternative simulations, e.g., featuring a higher real crude oil price (in 2010 USD) gradually increasing to 100 USD per barrel in 2022q4. In this case, the rig rates become about 41 percent higher in 2022q4 than in the reference case. If in addition capacity utilization increases more rapidly, and to a higher level than in the reference simulation, the rig rate is 48 percent higher. In the last alternative simulation, we explore the effects of opening new Arctic areas for petroleum activity, in which case forecasted rig rates in 2022q4 are 26 percent higher than in the reference simulation.

The expansion rate is co-determined to a significant degree at the level of the federal states, and varies considerably from state to state. Apart from the existence of natural energy resources and general economic conditions, do parties in government play an important role for the development at the state level? We consider potentially influential factors in a fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) focusing on the expansion of renewable electricity production in all 16 federal German states from 2004 to 2014. As a result, two promising ways for accelerated expansion of renewable electricity production can be identified. On the one hand, a group of economically less developed states have succeeded in promoting expansion and uses it as part of an economic modernization strategy. Within the economically more developed states, however, the party-political composition of the state governments (Green party's involvement) plays a significant role. These results also have implications for other (federal) countries beyond Germany, pointing to tailor-made policy strategies that consider these specific circumstances.","[Wurster, Stefan; Hagemann, Christian] Tech Univ Munich, Bavarian Sch Publ Policy, Richard Wagner Str 1, D-80333 Munich, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Hagemann, C (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, Bavarian Sch Publ Policy, Richard Wagner Str 1, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",stefan.wursuer@hfp.tum.de; christion.hagemann@hfp.tum.de,,,,,,,49,21,21,1,21,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2018,119.0,,,,,,610,619,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.059,0.0,,,19,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO0XY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439671200057,0

In this paper we model the EU-ETS in presence of the Market Stability Reserve (MSR) as it is defined by that decision and investigate the impact that such a measure has in terms of permits price, output production and banking strategies. To do so we build an inter-temporal model in which polluting firms competing in an homogeneous good market are price takers in a permits market and face an uncertain demand. Our main finding is that the MSR succeeds in increasing the permits' price correcting an excess supply (and conversely decreasing it in case of excess demand). However, when the output demand is stochastic, the MSR may alter the arbitrage conditions that determine permits' prices. In some cases which depend on the extend of the demand variation, unintended effects on the price pattern appear.

Despite the prevalence of such education, there is little empirical evidence to support the efficacy of these programs on tangible outcomes outside of school. This paper contributes an empirical analysis of a series of energy lessons in the United States. Using a differences-in-differences approach with a rich panel data set, we find evidence for short-term reductions on the order of eight percent in electricity use the day of a lesson regarding energy conservation via reducing phantom electric loads (standby power), with evidence of deferment in electricity use rather than true conservation. We find no effect of lessons on energy pathways or wind energy on the days of the lessons. Despite limited evidence of conservation, our results do indicate a connection between lessons learned in school and measurable behavior at home. Importantly, this research indicates that energy education could be a potentially valuable tool for policy regarding energy conservation and efficiency, though future research is needed to optimize the timing and content of such lessons.","[Gill, Carrie; Lang, Corey] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Environm & Nat Resource Econ, Coastal Inst, 1 Greenhouse Rd, Kingston, RI 02881 USA",University of Rhode Island,"Lang, C (通讯作者)，Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Environm & Nat Resource Econ, Coastal Inst, 1 Greenhouse Rd, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",cagill@my.uri.edu; clang@uri.edu,,,University of Rhode Island Coastal Institute,University of Rhode Island Coastal Institute,"The authors thank our utility partner and the many employees that helped us understand the data and education programs.

There is, however, remarkably little empirical evidence on self-consumption. This paper begins to address this gap by analysing one-minute electricity monitoring data for 302 households that participated in a UK smart grid demonstration project. We calculate annual self-consumption levels and find that they are 855 kWh/year per household on average, or 45% of PV generation. We conduct a simple regression analysis to estimate self-consumption and use the results to show that self-consumption for an average UK household with electricity demand of 4000 kWh/year and 2.9 kWp PV system would be 966 38 kWh/year, equivalent to a 24% reduction in average annual electricity demand from the grid. Our methodology can be readily applied to measure and predict self-consumption in other solar markets as well, which has increasingly important implications for valuing solar investments, setting feed-in tariffs, and examining the impacts of PV on networks and retail sales.","[McKenna, Eoghan; Darby, Sarah J.] UCL Energy Inst, Cent House,14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England; [Pless, Jacquelyn] Univ Oxford, Inst New Econ Thinking, Eagle House,Walton Well Rd, Oxford OX2 6ED, England",University of London; University College London; University of Oxford,"McKenna, E (通讯作者)，UCL Energy Inst, Cent House,14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England.",e.mckenna@ucl.ac.uk,,,Oxford Martin School through the Oxford Martin Programme on Integrating Renewable Energy; EPSRC [EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Oxford Martin School through the Oxford Martin Programme on Integrating Renewable Energy; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),The authors gratefully acknowledge funding from the Oxford Martin School through the Oxford Martin Programme on Integrating Renewable Energy.

These outcomes can be explained by specific design features in the program that placed large-scale projects at a disadvantage, and by the wider context of EU climate and energy policies providing inadequate market-pull incentives for CCS and biofuels.

The study confirmed the concentration of the population in the two provinces that contain the country's main cities. However, in recent years, this trend has weakened, to the extent that the provinces with the greatest influx of migrants are not necessarily the most populated. This indicates that growth has become more balanced throughout the territory, and that small and medium-sized cities are increasingly important.","[Royuela, Vicente] Univ Barcelona, AQR IREA Res Grp, Avda Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Ordonez, Jessica] Univ Tecn Particular Loja, Dept Econ, 11-01-608 San Cayetano Alto, Loja, Ecuador",University of Barcelona; Universidad Tecnica Particular de Loja,"Royuela, V (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, AQR IREA Res Grp, Avda Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",vroyuela@ub.edu; jordonezx@utpl.edu.ec,"Royuela, Vicente/A-4162-2009","Royuela, Vicente/0000-0002-7647-0063","Ecuadorean Secretaria de Educacion Superior, Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion; [ECO2013-41022-R]","Ecuadorean Secretaria de Educacion Superior, Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion;","Vicente Royuela acknowledges the support of ECO2013-41022-R.

We consider a carbon pricing policy in Alberta's electricity market as a case study. This policy consists of two phases. In the first phase, the carbon price is increased with the output subsidy being based on a fraction of facility-level emission intensity. In the second phase, the output subsidy is altered to be uniform across assets and based on the emissions intensity of an efficient natural gas asset. Using a model of oligopoly competition, we simulate the short-run impacts of the two phases on electricity prices, emissions, and unit and firm-level profitability. We find that the mechanisms by which electricity prices and emissions change in response to carbon pricing differ depending on whether the market is perfectly competitive or oligopolistic. We demonstrate that by differentiating the effective carbon price across technologies, changing the basis of the output subsidy has substantially larger price and emissions effects than increasing the carbon price for all generators. The estimated effects of carbon pricing vary as the firms' generation portfolios change. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Significant progress has been made since but the target has not been reached. The impact of the weakness of formal and importance of informal institutions on the policy outcome was found to be significant. Not only is far more flaring allowed as a result of exemptions and non-compliance with subsoil licenses but it also remains unclear how much is actually flared due to unclear metering practices and if fines can be avoided or written off without much oversight. Oil sector lobby has advocated many of these informal institutions. Standard type of informal institutions dominates, while also subversive institutions as well as gaps in regulations were identified. Analysing the oil sector interests through new institutionalism shows that the dominance of informal institutions has influenced the behaviour and interests of oil companies, especially in terms of relaxing legitimacy rules on compliance. Also the norm that oil sector activities are prioritized over environmental protection partly explains the relaxed attitude towards informal institutions; the 5% target set is partly ceremonial for the government.","[Korppoo, Anna] Fridtjof Nansen Inst Polhogda, POB 326, N-1326 Lysaker, Norway",,"Korppoo, A (通讯作者)，Fridtjof Nansen Inst Polhogda, POB 326, N-1326 Lysaker, Norway.",anna.korppoo@fni.no,,"Korppoo, Anna/0000-0003-1060-5161",Research Council of Norway's KLIMAFORSK programme [235588],Research Council of Norway's KLIMAFORSK programme(Research Council of Norway),"The author would like to express her gratitude to Julia Bunina, Elena Depova, Olga Gassan-zade, Alexey Knizhnikov, Valery Kryukov, Julia Loe, Arild Moe, Nina Tynldcynen and the interviewees.

This study empirically analyzes the demographic effects on residential electricity and city gas consumption in Japan. Our analysis presents the following main results. First, the aging of the society decreases the electricity demand but does not affect the city gas demand significantly. Second, the decrease in population with the prevalence of nuclear families increases the electricity demand but decreases the city gas demand. The direction of the demand for each alternative depends on the balancing of the first and second effects. Third, the analysis also shows clear results about the own- and cross-price effects. Ongoing energy market reforms for price suppression would increase energy demand with possible substitutability between the two energy sources.

Adaptative resilience is measured through a traditional shift-share approach applied to employment, whereas engineering and ecological resilience pay attention to growth path and total employment level, in the pre- and post-crisis period. The paper presents an application of the different notion of resilience to the case of Spanish provinces in the last years. We find that provinces with sectoral structure and location advantages, or those with locational advantages in the post-crisis period (according to the adaptative resilience measure), exhibit a significantly lower drop in growth (according to the engineering and ecological resilience measure). Furthermore, we conclude that the probability of presenting a better behavior (lower drop in growth than the average) increases for those regions specialized in the service sector before the crisis. As expected, the worse behavior has correspond to those regions specialized in the pre-crisis period in the construction sector.","[Angulo, A. M.; Mur, J.; Trivez, F.

The analysis adds to the unsettled discussion of whether retail gasoline prices respond asymmetrically to oil prices and it is carried out for the US, the UK, Spain, Italy and Greece, spanning the period January 2009 to July 2016. These countries have been selected on the basis that fuel markets are differentiated by the structure of retail markets (oligopolistic behavior, production lags and market competition), which depends on extraction, refinery and distribution. The analysis considers markets that differ in terms of their structure. Both short- and long-run non-linearity are tested by deriving both the positive and negative partial sum decompositions of the dependent variable. In addition, it was feasible to quantify the responses to positive and negative oil price shocks from the asymmetric dynamic multipliers. The findings indicate that oil and gasoline prices provide mixed evidence of an asymmetric behavior. Short-run asymmetry is found in the Italian market, while in the Spanish market there is evidence of both short- and long-run asymmetry. The remaining cases (Greece, U.K., U.S.) illustrate a symmetric pass-through scheme of oil to retail gasoline prices.","[Apergis, Nicholas] Univ Piraeus, Piraeus, Greece; [Vouzavalis, Grigorios] Int Hellen Univ, Thermi, Greece",University of Piraeus,"Apergis, N (通讯作者)，Univ Piraeus, Piraeus, Greece.",napergis@unipi.gr; vouzgreg@hotmail.com,,", Nick/0000-0002-0375-2457",,,,,33,41,43,2,22,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2018,114.0,,,,,,519,528,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.12.046,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FW0DY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424962800048,0

However, many megaprojects fail to deliver the scale and efficiency aspirations initially expected. The purpose of this paper is to estimate the probability distribution function of cost overruns and delays in the construction of power generation projects, with a particular focus on mega hydroelectric dams recently built in Brazil. Results show that construction costs were, on average, 97.53% above the initial estimates. The distribution that best fits the hydroelectric power plants costs overruns is the gamma distribution. For the delays, the construction completion time had an average increase of 74.28%, or 3.5 years. The distribution that best fits the hydroelectric plants delays is the lognormal distribution. The essential statistical message obtained in this paper is that megaprojects fail to deliver the economies of scale embedded in large projects because the exposure to risk is disproportionate to the financial economies they can generate.

Compared to the fast-growing consumption of automobile, the growth rate of urban transportation investment is relative low. This study is designed to evaluate the impact of the urban transportation investment on SO2 emissions, using the data of capital cities of 30 provinces in China from 2002 to 2012. Our empirical results show that the urban transportation investment increases SO2 emissions in the short run since it might cause road blockages which would enhance the emissions of the low-speed traffic. But in the long run the urban transportation investment has a positive impact on reducing SO2 emissions as it could widen the roads and make the traffic system more accessible. Moreover, we also find that there exists a SO2 Kuznets curve in China and environmental regulation can effectively curb SO2 emissions. The robustness tests are conducted to support the empirical results. Policy suggestions are further recommended to help the urban traffic planning to reduce SO2 emissions.","[Yang, Mian] Wuhan Univ, Econ & Management Sch, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Ma, Tiemeng; Sun, Chuanwang] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, China Ctr Energy Econ Res, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; Xiamen University,"Sun, CW (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, China Ctr Energy Econ Res, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",cw_stm@foxmail.com,"Ma, Tiemeng/GSI-7165-2022; Sun, Chuanwang/JOZ-8733-2023","Sun, Chuanwang/0000-0002-1900-4699; Yang, Mian/0000-0001-7806-1311; Ma, Tiemeng/0000-0002-6073-3551","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673230, 71303199, 71774071]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [20720171001, 20720151026, 20720151039]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the editor and anonymous referees for their insightful and constructive comments.

Moreover, this finding is stronger when the firm is smaller, when the age similarity between local firm leaders is higher, and when the firm is located in areas that are densely populated or that feature strong attachment to the local community.","[Amore, Mario Daniele] Bocconi Univ, Dept Management & Technol, Milan, Italy; [Amore, Mario Daniele] Bocconi Univ, ICRIOS, Milan, Italy",Bocconi University; Bocconi University,"Amore, MD (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Dept Management & Technol, Milan, Italy.;Amore, MD (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, ICRIOS, Milan, Italy.",mario.amore@unibocconi.it,,"Amore, Mario Daniele/0000-0003-4107-6979",,,,,51,2,2,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Blind search methods can be used for off-line path planning for unknown environments to locate phenomena of interest. Different blind search patterns have been implemented and evaluated in terms of their ability to reach the mission's goal. A novel blind search pattern that is based on a truncated Levy distribution is also proposed and compared with other search patterns as path-planning algorithms. The simulations show that Levy search pattern can outperform other search patterns for small size phenomena. On the other hand, the proposed inverse-Levy pattern can locate large size phenomena more than other search patterns. The simulations show that the probability of locating the most important phenomenon by a single autonomous underwater vehicle using blind search patterns is much smaller than of a swarm of autonomous underwater vehicles in similar conditions.

The estimations take into account endogeneity, dynamics and spatial dependence among regions. Estimations' outcome is interpreted with the help of a simple theoretical model of intergovernmental grants. Results reveal that the European Social Fund is not effective in its aim of promoting ALMP expenditure and show that rent-seeking when regions compete to attract funds from a common pool provokes the opposite effect, which is exacerbated in the presence of imitation.","[Gonzalez-Alegre, Juan] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ Aplicada, Barcelona, Spain; [Gonzalez-Alegre, Juan] Univ Malaga, Dept Teoria & Hist Econ, Malaga, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Universidad de Malaga,"González-Alegre, J (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ Aplicada, Barcelona, Spain.;González-Alegre, J (通讯作者)，Univ Malaga, Dept Teoria & Hist Econ, Malaga, Spain.",juan.gonzalez@uab.es,"González-Alegre, Juan/K-2306-2014",,Catedra Pasqual Maragall de Economia y Territorio under the Ayudas a la Investigacion grants programme; Generalitat de Catalunya AGAUR research grants programme [2014 SGR 1326]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2014-52999-R],Catedra Pasqual Maragall de Economia y Territorio under the Ayudas a la Investigacion grants programme; Generalitat de Catalunya AGAUR research grants programme; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),This work was supported by the Catedra Pasqual Maragall de Economia y Territorio under the Ayudas a la Investigacion 2012 grants programme; the Generalitat de Catalunya AGAUR research grants programme [grant number 2014 SGR 1326]; and the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [grant number ECO2014-52999-R].,,51,5,5,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The essence and principles of the fuzzy approach are first described generally in the methodological part and specifically in the context of the problem of the prediction of the GDP growth rate. The practical illustration of the growth rate prediction for the Czech Republic in the years 2018 and 2020 follows. This is based on the components of the previous four-year evolution of the selected three macroeconomic indicators, which are the long-term interest rates, investment and unemployment that are the input parameters of the task. These inputs are processed by means of the algorithm based on the fuzzy approach that allows capturing the uncertainty and complexity of vague socio-economic factors occurring in the real economy. The results achieved correspond with the official statistical predictions largely. The performed procedure sets a new global trend in the possibility of the prediction of macroeconomic indicators.","[Haskova, Simona] Inst Technol & Business, Sch Expertness & Valuat, Okruzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice 37001, Czech Republic","Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice","Haskova, S (通讯作者)，Inst Technol & Business, Sch Expertness & Valuat, Okruzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice 37001, Czech Republic.",haskovas@post.cz,"Hašková, Simona/N-3667-2019",,,,,,18,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,2532,2539,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300324,0

The future of the economic growth is hidden in the capability of reusing and re-evaluation of resources. The main topic of the paper is a circular economic, which presents the idea of sustainable development, creates a beneficial and healthy relationship between the human and nature. Circular economy and its basic principles stand on the idea that all products and materials can be repeatedly used in the product cycle even after their actual usage. In such way, products and materials can become raw materials for new products and services. Replacing of primary raw materials with secondary raw materials can be a part of the solution, however, recycling is far not a final and attractive solution because it is quite power-consuming and moreover it leads to high material degradation. The aim of the paper is to show the analysis of theoretically possible solutions for existing issues in circular economy, to define and compare it with linear economic model, to show successful and inspirational examples of Slovak companies, which within their strategies of corporate social responsibility implemented the key factors of closed economies. Such global companies bring innovative recycling solutions, which go beyond the traditional recycling suggestions and apply ideas and principles of zero waste concept.","[Jurisova, Vladimira] Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius, Fac Mass Media Commun, Nam J Herdu 2, Trnava 91700, Slovakia",University of SS Cyril & Methodius Trnava,"Jurisova, V (通讯作者)，Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius, Fac Mass Media Commun, Nam J Herdu 2, Trnava 91700, Slovakia.",vladimira.jurisova@ucm.sk,,"Jurisova, Vladimira/0000-0003-3021-2648",VEGA project [1/0708/18],VEGA project(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This paper is part of VEGA project no. 1/0708/18 entitled Aspects of using the SoLoMo marketing concept to raise awareness about eco-innovations.,,25,1,1,0,4,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,2107,2113,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300269,0

A theoretical lens is used to discuss whether effective internal control and ERM enhance performance and increase value creation ability. ERM is most frequently defined with the reference to the 2004 Guidance document published by Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of Treadway Commission (COSO). Proponents of COSO's ERM Integrated Framework describe this framework as a world-level template for best practice, and claim that ERM used by management to enhance an organization ability to manage uncertainty and to consider how much risk to accept as it strives to increase stakeholder value. Additionally the Internal Control-Integrated Framework is a viable and suitable framework for designing, implementing, conducting and assessing the effectiveness of internal control and for reporting. The relationship between value creation and ERM is widely investigated in academic literature. Empirical studies on the value creation abilities of ERM and internal control suggest that there is a positive relation between value creation, internal control and ERM. These studies reveal that firm performance and value are enhanced by high-quality ERM adoption and implementation. Using different identifier of ERM such as Standard and Poor's risk management ratings or presence of a Chief Risk Officer, the findings of empirical studies reveal that higher ERM quality is associated with less resource constraint, better corporate governance and better accounting performance. Additionally academic studies indicate that the risk-based communication is reinforced with ERM implication.","[Kaya, Idil] Galatasaray Univ, Dept Business Adm, Istanbul, Turkey",Galatasaray University,"Kaya, I (通讯作者)，Galatasaray Univ, Dept Business Adm, Istanbul, Turkey.",ikaya@gsu.edu.tr,"Kaya, İdil/AAB-7497-2020",,Galatasaray University Research Fund [16.102.002],Galatasaray University Research Fund(Galatasaray University),The author is grateful for the support provided by Galatasaray University Research Fund.

In order to obtain a better understanding of Chinese consumers' preference on Thai RTE foods, three Thai and two Chinese foods were benchmarked as samples for the target panels. Sensory evaluation was tested over five items of RTE product with Chinese panels living in three major cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. All panels indicated their overall preferences; however Tom Yum Kung obtained the least acceptance among five products. Just About Right scale composed of sweet, sour, salty, spicy and oiliness was assessed and it was found that different located area of testing panels have shown the significantly different preferences. Beijing panels preferred noodle-based foods like Spaghetti and Pad Thai, while Shanghai and Guangzhou panels favored of rice dishes such as Green Curry and Yellow Curry with Rice.

The main interests of the retailer are related to increasing turnover and making profit, but customer can have several aims - to obtain the necessary item in the necessary place and quantity and also to receive information, attitude and incentives for the purchase. Globalization of the market is increasingly affecting also retail businesses, which have led them to seek fair solutions for competitiveness and development. In order to identify factors of competitiveness, the authors of the current article have put forward the goal - to analyse processes of retailing related to customer relationship formation and management in the Baltic countries. To attain this goal, the authors, first, research the theoretical background of the customer relationship formation, then analyse the retail trade development in the Baltic countries and, finally they conduct customer survey to identify the basic relationship formation factors. This research will provide retailers with comprehension of necessity to develop a customer relationship system, taking into account industry requirements. The scientific novelty of the current article lies in the fact that the authors defined the unified approach to formation of customer relationship system in retailing.

Generally, outliers or extreme values have a negative effect on data analysis. Especially, some statistical methods are very sensitive to their existence in data set, namely ANOVA test or regression analysis. Their existence may cause an incorrect results and wrong identification of relationship between variables. For these reasons, methods for detecting outliers in data set represent very actual topic not only in Slovakia but also in abroad. Paper main aim is to capture impact of outliers detection on the prediction ability of international prediction models. Paper works with one method for outliers detection, namely: interquartile range (IQR). In addition, paper works with selected international prediction models. Paper applies method for outliers detection on the data set of financial ratios that are necessary for prediction models calculation. Then, paper follows changes in prediction ability of international prediction models after removing outliers according to specific technique for outliers.

Within the review literature we concentrate on those migration models which orientate themselves towards the investigation of motives and influences of migration. Subsequently we focus on an analysis of migrant structure in the Slovak Republic according to selected criteria that are age, level of education completed, regional views and migration reasons. On the basis of the processed data of the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic, this contribution provides information, not only about the number of immigrants into Slovakia, but also it collects emigrant data on particular states in the world. Wepoint out the possible impacts of migration on the awaited demographic development in the Slovak Republic. The prognoses of demographic development of Slovakia refer to serious problems such as the ageing of population. Its extent will depend on a broad range of factors including migration, fertility and mortality. In the conclusion we indicate more proposals for measures from the state side by means of which, it would be possible to contribute to a reduction of negative impacts of migration on Slovakia.","[Rievajova, Eva; Privara, Andrej] Univ Econ Bratislava, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Rievajova, E (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Bratislava, Slovakia.",eva.rievajova@euba.sk; andy.privara@gmail.com,,,VEGA project [1/0014/16],VEGA project(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This contribution is one of the results of the VEGA project 1/0014/16 Present and Perspectives of Changes in Employment and Related Processes in the Context of the Achievement of the European Employment Strategy.,,24,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,318,325,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300043,0

To explore the correlation between the time series, we used the methodology of estimating trend deviation. We applied analytical smoothing to model trends, estimating regression models. To assess the strength of relationship between the time series, we analysed correlation between regressions' residuals. The results of our analysis showed no relationship between people's incomes and fertility rates. The research we carried out into time series dynamics did not confirm the results of other studies based on static data. Accordingly, this raises questions about the methodology for analyzing the relationship between dynamic processes with a high volatility of input data. Evidently to receive reliable and stable results, multidimensional analysis methods should be integrated into the study of relationships between dynamic time series, including preliminary multi-dimensional data classification.

Thus, the supplier needs to monitor the retailer's restocking efforts with the available data. We empirically assess stockout levels using only shipment and sales data that is readily available to the supplier. The model distinguishes between store stockouts (zero inventory in the store) and shelf stockouts (an empty shelf but some inventory in other parts of the store), thereby identifying the cause of the stockout to be either a supply chain or a restocking issue. We find that, as suspected by the supplier, the average stockout rate is much higher than published averages. In addition, stockout rates vary widely between stores.

It can be concluded that the relation between the corporate income tax and the total amount of assets resulted in negative correlation, i.e. the increase in the corporate income tax leads to the decrease in corporate assets.","[Vanova, Alexandra Ferenczi; Krajcirova, Renata; Bojnansky, Jozef; Durkacova, Petra] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Accounting, Tr Andrej Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia; [Maris, Martin] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac European Studies & Reg Dev, Dept Reg & Rural Dev, Tr Andrej Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Vanová, AF (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Accounting, Tr Andrej Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",alexandra.ferenczi@uniag.sk; renata.krajcirova@uniag.sk; martin.maris@uniag.sk; jozef.bojnansky@uniag.sk; petradurkacova@gmail.com,"Vanova, Alexandra Ferenczi/P-4099-2018; Maris, Martin/HGT-9826-2022",,project VEGA [1/0666/17],project VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This paper is an output of the science project VEGA no. 1/0666/17 with the title Impact of Integration and Globalization on Business Risk in Slovak Agriculture.,,17,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1560,1567,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300199,0

However, the burning of coal pollutes the air and can cause manifold health problems. This study focused on domestic coal consumption patterns and any concomitant trends in sulfur, arsenic, fluorine and mercury emissions in China during the 1991-2015 period. The most recently published domestic coal consumption statistics were collected, and data covering the emission levels and concentrations of sulfur, arsenic, fluorine and mercury released during the burning of domestic coal were obtained. We found that domestic coal consumption distribution patterns in China were spatially consistent with levels of atmospheric pollution. In 2015, the emissions of sulfur, arsenic, fluorine and mercury from domestic coal-burning amounted to 0.88 million tons, 213.28 t, 11,618.73 t and 15.89 t, respectively. These results showed a marked increase in rural emissions since 2002, and represented a total five times larger than urban emissions in 2015. Further, after 2008, there was a sharp increase in sulfur, arsenic, fluorine and mercury emissions from domestic coal-burning, in sharp contrast to the decrease in emissions from coal-fired power plants. These findings highlight the environmental impact of domestic coal consumption on rural communities, accelerating the need for more effective air pollution controls.","[Zhao, Chao; Luo, Kunli] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Luo, KL (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",zhaochao@igsnrr.ac.cn; kunliluo@sohu.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41172310, 41472322]; National Key Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) [2014CB238906]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(National Basic Research Program of China),"We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the editor and three anonymous referees for their insightful and constructive suggestions and comments that have substantially improved our analysis and exposition.

The risk profile to security of supply is presented, in the United Kingdom, in terms of the conventional metrics capacity margin and loss of load expectation. However, increasing levels of disruption in the power sector, arising from a combination of policy, technological and customer change, challenge this traditional approach to characterise the risk to security of supply. The paper presents a framework to evaluate the risk profile to security of supply through a series of probabilistic metrics that establish the expected magnitude (power and energy), likelihood, frequency and duration of encountering supply shortfalls.

Following an agent-based modeling approach, the two most commonly applied auction pricing rules are compared (uniform and pay-as-bid) and first conclusions on outcomes are drawn for future policy design. The auctions are modeled to closely represent the auction design foreseen in the German Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG, 2017) and replicate their parameters. The analysis draws on auction theory. For both pricing schemes, individually rational agents with independent valuation are assumed. As support for renewable electricity through auctions is to be established permanently and auction rounds will be held multi-annually, a further focus lies on agents learning over time by adapting their behavior to new information. The model results show that pay-as-bid exhibits lower prices and thus support costs than uniform pricing, whereas allocative efficiency suffers under pay-as-bid. Over time, one can observe a decline in the strike price, which is due to learning effects, whereas agents' profits increase in the course of the auctions. Furthermore, smaller actors will experience difficulties and agent diversity is likely to suffer in the long term, if this is not accounted for in other ways.","[Anatolitis, Vasilios] Fraunhofer Inst Syst & Innovat Res Fraunhofer ISI, Breslauer Str 48, D-76139 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Anatolitis, Vasilios; Welisch, Marijke] TU Wien, Inst Energy Syst & Elect Drives, EEG, Gusshausstr 25-29-370-3, A-1040 Vienna, Austria; [Anatolitis, Vasilios] KIT, IIP, Hertzstr 16, D-76187 Karlsruhe, Germany",Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; Technische Universitat Wien; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Welisch, M (通讯作者)，TU Wien, Inst Energy Syst & Elect Drives, EEG, Gusshausstr 25-29-370-3, A-1040 Vienna, Austria.",vasilios.anatolitis@isi.fraunhofer.de; welisch@eeg.tuwien.ac.at,,"Anatolitis, Vasilios/0000-0001-8649-7131",European Commission [646172]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [646172] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme,European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),"This research was funded by the European Commission and contains results of the Horizon2020 Project AURES [grant number 646172].

Among the land use systems, agroforestry is recognized as superior land management system having potential to deliver sustainable biomass and energy supply in rural landscape. Present study highlights a comparison of seasonal biomass consumption pattern in terms of fodder and fuelwood energy supply across different village clusters along an altitudinal gradient. The average fuelwood consumption ranged between 242 +/- 22 to 373 +/- 23 kg/capita/year and fodder consumption ranged between 154 +/- 17 to 463 +/- 14 kg/unit/year. However, the energy value of fuelwood and fodder consumption ranged between 2160 +/- 242 to 7317 +/- 234 MJ/kg. The study demonstrated that the fuelwood and fodder consumption was significantly greater (p < 0.05) in winter (lean period) as compared to that in summer and monsoon seasons. The results of this study are valuable to policy planners to improve the current policies for sustainable biomass energy supply in the Himalayan context through utilization of indigenous tree species in agroforestry systems.","[Phondani, P.

The criticality and dimensions of such problems are reflected in the energy policies of many countries and regions; however, the implementation of energy policies in an effective manner along with the assessment of their success have not been investigated in detail. Energy policies often derive from broad strategic goals and may not include specific or operational implementation plans. Accordingly, the effectiveness of those energy policies is also evaluated at the strategic level, which may fail to appropriately evaluate the policy performance at lower levels. This paper proposes an approach that enables policy- and decision-makers to assess the effectiveness of energy policies at strategic, tactical, and operational (STO) levels. This approach herein referred to as the STO framework enables assessing energy policies in terms of both the strategic goal achievements and the implementation details. Results of this study illuminate potential advantages and limitations of using the STO framework as an energy policy assessment tool. Moreover, findings of this study suggest that the strategic, tactical and operational levels should be identified explicitly in future energy policies in order to improve their effectiveness.","[Arababadi, Reza; Moslehi, Salim; El Asmar, Mounir; Parrish, Kristen] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Haavaldsen, Tore] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Trondheim, Norway",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Arababadi, R (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",,,"El Asmar, Mounir/0000-0003-0011-6903",,,,,30,9,10,0,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,530,538,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.07.042,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400051,0

Here we report a model showing that the question of when people invest in residential PV systems is found to be not only determined by profitability, but also by profitability's change compared to the status quo. This finding is interpreted in the light of loss aversion, a concept developed in Kahneman and Tversky's prospect theory.

Because environmental performance is related with economic development, FM and FDI may affect environment indirectly through their impacts on economic growth. In this study, the direct and indirect effects of both FM and FDI on China's environmental quality are distinguished and separately estimated for the first time with a carefully designed framework of a two-equation model. Because most economic activities and environmental pollutions occur in the urban areas, a panel data of 112 Chinese cities for the period 2002-2015 is utilized. Several spatial factors are also introduced to control for the potential spatial correlations in economic development and pollutant emissions. The estimation results indicate that there exist apparent differences in the environmental effects of FM and FDI. The direct effects of FM on SO2 emissions are significant positive and dominate the negative indirect effects. By contrast, the direct, indirect and total effects of FDI on pollutant emissions are all negative. Therefore, overall speaking, well designed and targeted policies should be formulated to reduce the negative environmental impacts of FM and to increase the positive influences of FDI on environment.","[Liu, Yiming; Hao, Yu; Gao, Yixuan] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yu] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yu] Sustainable Dev Res Inst Econ & Soc Beijing, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yu] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Elect Vehicles Beijing, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yu] Beijing Key Lab Energy Econ & Environm Management, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yiming] Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Design & Environm, Dept Bldg, 4 Architecture Dr, Singapore 5117566, Singapore; [Gao, Yixuan] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, 56 Coll Rd, Durham, NH 03824 USA",Beijing Institute of Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology; National University of Singapore; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire,"Hao, Y (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.;Hao, Y (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.;Hao, Y (通讯作者)，Sustainable Dev Res Inst Econ & Soc Beijing, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.;Hao, Y (通讯作者)，Collaborat Innovat Ctr Elect Vehicles Beijing, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.;Hao, Y (通讯作者)，Beijing Key Lab Energy Econ & Environm Management, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",1152253939@qq.com; haoyuking@gmail.com; gaoyx1119@163.com,"Hao, Yu/ABF-4628-2021","Hao, Yu/0000-0001-8394-4215","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403015, 71521002]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [9162013]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFA0602801, 2016YFA0602603]; Joint Development Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); National Key Research and Development Program of China; Joint Development Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education,"The authors acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71403015, 71521002), Beijing Natural Science Foundation (9162013), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFA0602801, 2016YFA0602603) and the Joint Development Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education.

In the case of thermal power plants, investment in energy efficiency projects, using clean coal and buying energy saving certificates are the available compliance options for complying with the scheme. These options are associated with specific forms of cash flows that depend on the uncertain price of energy saving certificates and clean coal premium. This paper uses a Monte Carlo-based decision tree approach to find the optimal compliance options for an efficient and a less efficient thermal power plant. The decision tree evaluates different sequences of compliance options in three consecutive PAT cycles by using the discounted cash flows and their associated probabilities. The study shows that investment in energy efficiency is optimal in the first PAT cycle for the inefficient plant only. The threshold certificate price for the efficient plant is substantially higher than the inefficient plant, implying that the real efficiency improvement is likely to take place in the low-efficiency plants. The study also indicates that the investment in high-efficiency plants is not optimal over a wide range of certificate prices and the incremental cost of clean coal.","[Sahoo, Nihar R.; Mahanty, Biswajit] Indian Inst Technol, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India; [Mohapatra, Pratap K.

The improvement of energy efficiency is one of the key elements of the low carbon development strategies. This study develops a methodology to estimate marginal abatement cost (MAC) curve for energy efficiency measures and apply in the building sector in both countries. The study finds that among the various energy efficiency measures considered, the replacement of energy inefficient light bulbs (i.e., incandescent lamps) with efficient light bulbs is the most cost effective measure in saving energy and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the building sector. Most energy efficiency improvement options considered in the study would produce net economic benefits even if the value of reduced carbon is not taken into account. While the MAC analysis conducted demonstrates the cost competitiveness of various energy efficiency measures in Armenia and Georgia, the study also offers a caution to policy makers to have supplemental analysis before prioritizing the implementation of these measures or introducing policies to support them.","[Timilsina, Govinda R.] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Sikharulidze, Anna] Sustainable Dev Ctr Remissa, Tbilisi, Georgia; [Karapoghosyan, Eduard; Shatvoryan, Suren] Sci Res Inst Energy, Energy Strategy Ctr, Yerevan, Armenia",The World Bank,"Timilsina, GR (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",gtimilsina@worldbank.org,,,Knowledge for Change (KCP) Trust Fund of the World Bank,Knowledge for Change (KCP) Trust Fund of the World Bank,"The authors would like to thank Marina Shvangiradze, Dana Kenney, Adrien Vogt-Schilb and Mike Toman for their valuable comments and suggestions.

In this context two questions arise. How to evaluate cost-effectiveness of energy efficiency programs in a more comprehensive manner? And how to improve the programs' cost-effectiveness? We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of energy efficiency programs in Switzerland, based on three electricity-saving programs in Geneva. We review the existing practices of cost-effectiveness analysis and propose a somewhat modified methodology that allows considering perspectives of the following stakeholders: program participants, energy consumers, program administrator, utility, geographic jurisdiction territory and society as a whole. We also analyze the cost breakdown of energy efficiency programs and its evolution over time. We find that energy efficiency programs can contribute to energy efficiency target achievement while having positive economic and social impacts, including increased GDP and employment. However, energy efficiency programs can potentially lead to increased energy tariffs and higher costs for utilities. As policy recommendations for increasing cost-effectiveness of energy efficiency programs we propose a larger scale of energy efficiency programs, focus on education and training as well as on the development of long-term relationships with program participants and contractors.","[Yushchenko, Alisa] Univ Geneva, Fac Sci, Inst Environm Sci ISE, Chair Energy Efficiency, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; Univ Geneva, Fac Sci, Dept FA Forel Environm & Aquat Sci DEFSE, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland",University of Geneva; University of Geneva,"Yushchenko, A (通讯作者)，Univ Geneva, Fac Sci, Inst Environm Sci ISE, Chair Energy Efficiency, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland.",alisa.yushchenko@unige.ch; martin.patel@unige.ch,"Patel, Martin K./N-6853-2013","Patel, Martin K./0000-0002-3983-6003",Services Industriels de Geneve (SIG); CTI (Commission for Technology and Innovation); Swiss Competence Center for Research in Efficiency of Industrial Processes (SCCER EIP),Services Industriels de Geneve (SIG); CTI (Commission for Technology and Innovation); Swiss Competence Center for Research in Efficiency of Industrial Processes (SCCER EIP),"This work was funded by Services Industriels de Geneve (SIG) in the context of their support of the Chair for Energy Efficiency at University of Geneva.

The convergence of prices between the day-ahead forward and the real-time markets analysed in order to determine whether persistent price differences between the two markets exist. Arbitrage opportunities exist if there is a persistent difference between prices in the day-ahead forward and real-time market. Markets are considered to be efficient if it is not possible for market participants to earn an excess profit through exploitation of price differences. Furthermore, we examined how the ex-post risk premium changes over time using rolling estimations and find that after the implementation of dual pricing, the risk premium increased significantly for day and peak hours where the demand is relatively higher compared to night hours. As market participants have more experience regarding the dynamics of the market, the difference between real-time and day-ahead forward prices converges to zero since the dual-pricing regime enforce market participants to forecast accurately by punishing the forecast error.","[Asan, Goksel] Istinye Univ, Dept Econ, Topkapi Kampusu,Maltepe Mah,9 Zeytinburnu, TR-34010 Istanbul, Turkey; [Tasaltin, Kamil] Deloitte LLP, Econ Consulting, Athene Pl,66 Shoe Lane, London EC4A 3BQ, England; [Tasaltin, Kamil] Istanbul Bilgi Univ, Istanbul, Turkey",Istinye University; Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited; Istanbul Bilgi University,"Asan, G (通讯作者)，Istinye Univ, Dept Econ, Topkapi Kampusu,Maltepe Mah,9 Zeytinburnu, TR-34010 Istanbul, Turkey.",gasan@istinye.edu.tr; ktasaltin@yahoo.com,,,,,,,17,5,5,0,16,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2017,107.0,,,,,,109,118,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.04.024,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FA0WU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405158200011,0

We use a real options model of firm-level investment decisions under stochastic prices to compare alternative emission trading and permit-offset linkage schemes. By isolating the critical design factors that drive energy investments, we seek to identify policy regimes that balance the different concerns in the polarized debate for and against the inclusion of offsets. Our findings indicate that a moderate offset quota is sufficient to contain investment crowding-out effects, while it still has a positive effect on profit distributions. In contrast, the classical permit price collar will not effectively change investment behavior, precisely because in a framework with multiple compliance instruments the volatility of cheaper offsets is the driving force for investment. Under these conditions, a price collar for offsets emerges as a largely overlooked policy option to foster investment incentives. A combination of offset quota and offset price collar leads to investment patterns that are almost identical to a regime without access to offsets. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In response, there was a surge of mergers and acquisitions (M & As). This study addresses the effects of M & As on the eco-efficiency of European electricity producers in 2005-2013. The environmental production technology comprises CO2 emissions as an undesirable output. I compute eco-efficiency using data envelopment analysis (DEA) and the Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index, which are both based on radial directional distance function. I observe a decreasing trend in average eco-efficiency, which contradicts the previously documented moderate efficiency gains of liberalization. The effects of M & As are isolated using second-step fractional regression. The domestic horizontal M & As, which are systematically regulated by the European Commission, have no impact. Although one cross-border horizontal deal has a same-year effect of roughly -3%, this effect becomes approximately +1.5% over a two-year timespan. Vertical domestic M & As have a short-run negative impact of 3.6% that does not persist over time. Vertical international M & As reduce the eco-efficiency by 2.1% two years after their completion. Limited evidence suggests that the conglomerate deals are at least not harmful. The policy implication is that the merger regulation should be based on DEA eco-efficiency measures. Regulators should devote more attention to cross border M & As and particularly to vertical deals.","[Monastyrenko, Evgenii] Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne Univ, Paris Sch Econ, 106-112 Blvd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France",Paris School of Economics,"Monastyrenko, E (通讯作者)，Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne Univ, Paris Sch Econ, 106-112 Blvd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France.",evgenii.monastyrenko@univ-paris1.fr,,"Monastyrenko, Evgenii/0000-0003-3865-116X",LABEX OSE; Paris School of Economics; Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne University,LABEX OSE; Paris School of Economics; Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne University,"The author appreciates the valuable comments of two anonymous referees.

We consider two types of misallocation: (i) dispersion in the distribution of output-based TFP (TFPQ), in particular the survival of low productivity firms in the left tail; and (ii) dispersion in revenue-based TFP (TFPR), indicative of allocative inefficiency. The results are mixed: On the one hand, we find that the distribution of TFPQ is less dispersed in more agglomerated areas, measured by the localization quotient, local productive concentration, and average firm size. At the same time, we find that average TFPQ is also positively related to localization, especially the presence of small firms in the same sector, even though own-firm TFP is lowest for small firms. On the other hand, we do not find evidence that agglomeration improves allocative efficiency measured as deviations in TFPR from the sector average, concluding rather that greater localization of small firms is associated with firms being more output and capital constrained.","[Chaudhry, Theresa] Lahore Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Intersect Main Blvd,Phase 6,DHA & Burki Rd, Lahore 53200, Pakistan; [Haseeb, Muhammad] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Haroon, Maryiam] Lahore Sch Econ, Ctr Res Econ & Business, Intersect Main Blvd,Phase 6,DHA & Burki Rd, Lahore 53200, Pakistan",Lahore School of Economics; University of Warwick; Lahore School of Economics,"Chaudhry, T (通讯作者)，Lahore Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Intersect Main Blvd,Phase 6,DHA & Burki Rd, Lahore 53200, Pakistan.",theresa@lahoreschool.edu.pk; M.Haseeb@warwick.ac.uk; maryiamharoon@gmail.com,"Chaudhry, Theresa/AAX-9154-2021; Chaudhry, Theresa/JCE-5989-2023","Chaudhry, Theresa/0000-0002-3248-8018; Chaudhry, Theresa/0000-0002-3248-8018; Haroon, Maryiam/0000-0003-1396-109X",,,,,43,3,3,0,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The economics of vehicle-to-grid energy storage for peak reduction,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Vehicle-to-grid; Grid-able vehicles; Electric vehicles; Battery storage,,"This article discusses a five-year, hourly economic model of vehicle-to-grid energy storage for peak reduction. Several scenarios are modeled for a participant using a 60 kW-h capacity battery electric vehicle, such as the Tesla Model S or Chevrolet Bolt, in the New York City area using pricing data for the years 2010 through 2014. Sensitivity analysis identifies that variables such as one-way power efficiency and battery lifetime are the major factors influencing the economics of selling electricity back to the grid. Although it is shown that vehicle-to-grid electricity sales can create positive economic benefits, the magnitudes are small due to the cost of added degradation to the vehicle's battery and are not likely to entice the average electric vehicle owner to participate. However, over the five-year period, the potential economic benefits of this technology have shown a promising trend. A carbon dioxide tax is examined as a potential policy measure to encourage vehicle-to-grid adoption. The implementation of a carbon dioxide tax is shown to create additional opportunities for economic gain but, these benefits are dependent on the grid's electricity generation portfolio. Added benefits from the tax are also small in magnitude considering current international carbon prices.","[Freeman, Gerad M.; White, Andrew D.] Univ Rochester, Dept Chem Engn, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Drennen, Thomas E.] Hobart & William Smith Coll, Dept Econ, Geneva, NY 14456 USA",University of Rochester,"White, AD (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Dept Chem Engn, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",gerad@cmu.edu; drennen@hws.edu; andrew.white@rochester.edu,,"White, Andrew/0000-0002-6647-3965; Freeman, Gerad/0000-0002-6310-3942",,,,,24,38,39,2,52,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2017,106.0,,,,,,183,190,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.03.052,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EW2RL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402343600019,0

Specifically, this study examines the Chinese Government's effort to facilitate reduction of energy consumption among SMEs through Energy Performance Contracts (EPCs) to incentivize domestic manufacturers to adopt energy efficient measures (EEMs) in order to reduce demand for energy and corresponding drop in emissions. The data is gathered from relevant EPC stakeholders in the National Motor Upgrading Demonstration Project and its implementation in Dongguan city, which is based on 30 in-depth interviews and 6 focus group discussions. Using stakeholder analysis, this study finds that guaranteed energy savings model is the favorite model in implementation, given the gained benefits outweigh committed resources, and the control capability overrides possible risks among the two core stakeholders.

However, progress on the ground has been slow. This paper adds to the literature on the politics of interconnection through a case study of a proposed link between Ireland and Great Britain. We analyse how the institutional setting for investment has evolved at EU and Member State level, and how the influence of stakeholders is mediated by the ability of actors to define their interests and by institutional points of entry. Using this framework we examine the Greenwire/Greenlink project. We find first that developments in the institutional context, especially the adoption of a new cap-and-floor regime for merchant investment by the GB regulator, have had both positive and negative impacts on the project. Second, we find that regulators and governments in the two markets, have found it hard to define their interests in the project, and its net social benefit, due to informational complexities and changes in information over time. Third, the project has met with local public opposition that is strong but which has little leverage due to a lack of institutional entry points.","[Dutton, Joseph; Lockwood, Matthew] Univ Exeter, Energy Policy Grp, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England",University of Exeter,"Lockwood, M (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Energy Policy Grp, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England.",m.lockwood@exeter.ac.uk,,"Lockwood, Matthew/0000-0003-2380-3300",Research Councils UK under the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council award [EP/L024756/1]; EPSRC [EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Research Councils UK under the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council award(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This research formed part of the programme of the UK Energy Research Centre, Phase 3, and was supported by the Research Councils UK under the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council award EP/L024756/1.

Each of the scenarios represents policy options for generation expansion in Ghana up to 2040. Energy, economic and environmental analysis of the three alternative scenarios compared to the base scenarios was undertaken. Sensitivity results show that, if the country were to follow the generation expansion path described in the renewable energy scenarios, it could reap economic benefits of 0.5-13.23% depending on the developments in fuel prices and renewable technology capital cost. The analysis further quantifies benefits to be derived from a reduction in Greenhouse gases of the scenarios.

Regional Studies. Local governments are increasingly faced with public policy problems that span across their individual jurisdictional boundaries. Interlocal service collaboration has been suggested as a preferable alternative to address these issues. This study examines the association between collective social capital, especially focusing on Putnam-type organizations and interlocal service collaboration, by investigating the interlocal revenues at the county level for the fiscal year 2002 in the United States. An instrumental variables estimator to address a potential endogeneity problem of social capital was adopted. The results show that social capital is positively associated with interlocal service collaboration. Further analysis revealed that 15.8% of counties' variation in interlocal service collaboration was attributed to the state level.","[Han, Sehee] Penn State Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Middletown, PA 17057 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University,"Han, S (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Middletown, PA 17057 USA.",shkingdom@gmail.com,,,,,,,96,5,6,0,49,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

We construct an endogenous learning model with fat-tailed uncertainty about the equilibrium climate sensitivity. We find that a decision maker with a possibility of learning lowers efforts to reduce carbon emissions relative to the no-learning case. The larger the tail effect, the larger the counteracting learning effect because learning reduces the marginal benefit of emissions control compared to the case where there is no learning. The optimal decisions (summarized by the carbon tax level) in the learning case are less sensitive to the true value of the uncertain variable than the decisions in the uncertainty case. Learning lets uncertainty converge to the true value of the state in the sense that the variance approaches zero as information accumulates. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

CCIs are a priority sector on the European agenda and represent an excellent opportunity to exit the current economic crisis. In the literature, the most discussed aspect of CCIs is their value creation ability, which is due to a high degree of diversity/variety, and their impact on innovation within the wider economy, which results from the activation of cross-fertilisation processes between different sectors. Evolutionary economic geography (EEG), adopting the recently established approach based on related variety, also emphasises the issues of diversity/variety as determinants of local and urban development and innovation. This interesting and complex theoretical framework has produced a considerable number of empirical studies, none of which has been specifically applied to the creative sector. With the present study, we intended to contribute to the debate on creative economy research and EEG by investigating the impact of variety in CCIs in Italy, following the related-variety approach and using a long-term employment perspective (1991-2011). The results indicated that related variety has an important effect on the growth of creative industries, characterised by high internal connections between different creative activities. Our outcomes also led us to reassess the view held by some, namely, that creative industries can actually make a strong impact on economic growth in the wider economy; this did not appear to emerge in the Italian context, according to the methodologies we used.","[Lazzeretti, Luciana; Innocenti, Niccolo; Capone, Francesco] Univ Florence, Dept Econ & Management, Via Pandette 9, I-50127 Florence, Italy",University of Florence,"Lazzeretti, L (通讯作者)，Univ Florence, Dept Econ & Management, Via Pandette 9, I-50127 Florence, Italy.",luciana.lazzeretti@unifi.it; niccolo.innocenti@unifi.it; francesco.capone@unifi.it,"Capone, Francesco/CAA-3109-2022; Innocenti, Niccolò/AAB-1489-2020","Innocenti, Niccolò/0000-0001-8421-5479; Capone, Francesco/0000-0003-2000-3033; Lazzeretti, Luciana/0000-0002-9759-2289",,,,,53,24,25,1,40,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

However, there is still a deficit in terms of knowledge of individuals' energy-use behaviours in organisations, despite a variety of available theories. This paper addresses this need in three main stages, based on a survey among mid-level managers at a major infrastructure operator in Great Britain. Firstly, a principal components analysis is performed to identify key determinant constructs driving energy-efficient behaviours in organisations, revealing the importance of perceived benefit to the organisation and flexibility of existing performance goals and targets. Secondly, cluster analysis is undertaken, in an effort to identify differences in behavioural influences between demographic groups. These clusters highlight the heterogeneity of employee populations' energy behaviours, demonstrating that assumptions cannot be made about these based on single responses to cross-industry surveys. Finally, a structural equation model of individuals' energy use intentions and behaviours using the newly-identified constructs is developed, revealing some similarities with existing behavioural frameworks such as the Theory of Planned Behaviour (Ajzen, 1991). Implications for policymakers are then discussed, in terms of encouraging individual employees' curtailment of energy consumption in organisations through tailored engagement programmes.","[Zierler, Rupert; Wehrmeyer, Walter; Murphy, Richard] Univ Surrey, Fac Engn & Phys Sci, Ctr Environm & Sustainabil, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England",University of Surrey,"Zierler, R (通讯作者)，Univ Surrey, Fac Engn & Phys Sci, Ctr Environm & Sustainabil, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England.",r.zierler@surrey.ac.uk; w.wehrmeyer@surrey.ac.uk; rj.murphy@surrey.ac.uk,,"MURPHY, Richard/0000-0002-3063-515X","UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC); Network Rail; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [1770613, 1225057] Funding Source: researchfish",UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Network Rail; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"Research was carried out as part of an Engineering Doctorate (EngD) in Sustainability for Engineering and Energy Systems (SEES) at the Centre for Environmental Strategy, University of Surrey by the first author.

A higher level of perceived trust in international climate policy was positively related to perceived relevance in the USA and in China, but not in Germany.

Consistent with Florida's notion of creativity, it suggests a microfoundation that relates creativity to workers' cognitive and non-cognitive skills. It shows that this microfoundation is similar to that of human capital in recent labour economics, which has facilitated important new insights. While the regional measures of creative occupations developed by Florida or others are too crude to make a difference, occupations may help project workers' cognitive and non-cognitive skills from the micro to the regional level. Resumen Este articulo corrobora el debate iniciado a partir de la sugerencia de Richard Florida de medir el capital humano regional por medio de las ocupaciones creativas, en lugar de empleando la educacion.

Se demuestra que esta microfundamentacion es similar a la del capital humano en la reciente economia laboral, que ha facilitado nuevas e importantes ideas. Si bien las medidas regionales de las ocupaciones creativas desarrolladas por Florida u otros son demasiado toscas como para lograr una diferencia, las ocupaciones pueden ayudar a proyectar las habilidades cognitivas y no cognitivas de los trabajadores desde el nivel micro al nivel regional.","[Bode, Eckhardt; Villar, Lucia Perez] Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24100 Kiel, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Bode, E (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24100 Kiel, Germany.",eckhardt.bode@ifw-kiel.de; lucia.perez@ifw-kiel.de,,,,,,,72,7,8,1,79,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

Rather than focusing on particular sectors or examples, we determine the distributions of revealed comparative advantage (RCA) in terms of both gross exports and value-added for 40 countries. Systematically comparing these distributions reveals significant differences for RCA based on gross exports versus value-added data.

The inception of new alternative technologies, smart grids and distributed generation and storage is expected to make system planning even more challenging. Government policies still play a major role in the evolution of a country's power generation mix, even in those countries with liberalized markets. This paper presents a System Dynamics model aimed at assessing the overall technical, economic and environmental impact of renewable energy incentives and capacity payment policies. The model has been used to simulate Spain's power industry in order to assess the impact of electric power policies with the goal of getting insights regarding how to achieve an optimum power generation mix. The main conclusions of the present paper are (i) the necessity of specific regulatory actions in Spain in order to keep adequate reliability levels, avoid price spikes and boom and bust investment cycles as well as to deploy specific technologies, (ii) the fact that capacity payments are a better instrument for keeping adequate reserve margins and avoiding power price spikes than renewable energy incentives and (iii) the evidence that both instruments entail additional system costs over the base case scenario.","[Ibanez-Lopez, A.

We calculated the LCOE for each county of the contiguous United States for 12 power plant technologies. The minimum LCOE option for each county varies based on local conditions, capital and fuel costs, environmental externalities, and resource availability. We considered ten scenarios that vary input assumptions. We present the results in a map format to facilitate comparisons by fuel, technology, and location. For our reference analysis, which includes a cost of $62/tCO(2) for CO2 emissions natural gas combined cycle, wind, and nuclear are most often the lowest-LCOE option. While the average cost increases when internalizing the environmental externalities (carbon and air pollutants) is small for some technologies, the local cost differences are as high as $0.62/kWh for coal (under our reference analysis).

This paper analyses the factors behind this fall and the impacts they are having. The main drivers are: demand falling 1.3% per year due to efficiency gains and mild winters; gas doubling its share to 60% of fossil generation due to the carbon price floor; and the dramatic uptake of wind, solar and biomass which now supply up to 45% of demand. Accounting conventions also play their part: imported electricity and biomass would add 5% and 2% to emissions if they were included. The pace of decarbonisation is impressive, but raises both engineering and economic challenges. Falling peak demand has delayed fears of capacity shortage, but minimum net demand is instead becoming a problem. The headroom between inflexible nuclear and intermittent renewables is rapidly shrinking, with controllable output reaching a minimum of just 5.9 GW as solar output peaked at 7.1 GW. 2015 also saw Britain's first negative power prices, the highest winter peak prices for six years, and the highest balancing costs.","[Staffell, Iain] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, London, England",Imperial College London,"Staffell, I (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, London, England.",i.staffell@imperial.ac.ulc,,,"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) via the project Maximising the Carbon Impact of Wind Power [EP/N005996/1]; EPSRC [EP/L014106/1, EP/N005996/1, EP/N006224/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/N006224/1, EP/L014106/1, EP/N005996/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) via the project Maximising the Carbon Impact of Wind Power(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"Support from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) via the project Maximising the Carbon Impact of Wind Power (EP/N005996/1) is gratefully acknowledged.

In contrast, the alternative place-based approach espoused in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) Promoting Growth in All Regions (2012) remains largely inaccessible to laypersons.

This paper provides an extended Crepon-Duguet-Mairesse (CDM) approach to analyse jointly the simultaneous effects of knowledge spillovers in the knowledge-generation and technology production functions. It introduces the distinction between imitation and knowledge externalities and articulates the hypothesis that spillovers yield their effects via three well-distinct mechanisms: (1) knowledge externalities that exert positive and direct effects on the knowledge-production functionand (2) indirect effects on the technology-production function via their effects on the cost of knowledge; and (3) imitation externalities that exert direct and positive effects on productivity in the technology-production function. We test our hypotheses on a large panel of Italian companies distributed in NUTS-2 regions for the period 2005-09. The econometric analysis consists of a model comprising a system of equations that test the simultaneous role of spillovers in the knowledge-generation and technology-production functions with the inclusion of endogenous knowledge costs. The results confirm that the access to external knowledge - as an input in the knowledge-generation function - plays a key role in increasing the knowledge output and - as an input in the technology-production function - has positive indirect and direct effects on the productivity of firms.,"[Antonelli, Cristiano] Univ Torino, Dipartimento Econ Stat Cognetti de Martiis, Campus Luigi Einaudi, Turin, Italy; [Antonelli, Cristiano; Colombelli, Alessandra] Coll Carlo Alberto, BRICK, Turin, Italy; [Colombelli, Alessandra] Politecn Torino, DIGEP, Turin, Italy",University of Turin; Collegio Carlo Alberto; Polytechnic University of Turin,"Colombelli, A (通讯作者)，Coll Carlo Alberto, BRICK, Turin, Italy.;Colombelli, A (通讯作者)，Politecn Torino, DIGEP, Turin, Italy.",cristiano.antonelli@unito.it; alessandra.colombelli@polito.it,"ANTONELLI, CRISTIANO/HTN-7364-2023","Antonelli, Cristiano/0000-0002-5652-0510; COLOMBELLI, ALESSANDRA/0000-0003-4513-8612",European Commission [266959]; Universita di Torino; Politecnico di Torino,European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Universita di Torino; Politecnico di Torino,"The authors acknowledge the financial support of the European Commission [grant number 266959] to the research project 'Policy Incentives for the Creation of Knowledge: Methods and Evidence (PICK-ME)' within the context Cooperation Program/Theme 8/Socio-economic Sciences and Humanities (SSH), as well as the institutional support of the Collegio Carlo Alberto under the Incentive Policies for European Research (IPER) project and the funding of the Universita di Torino and the Politecnico di Torino.",,31,17,18,1,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

However, in some countries there are sold products with similar price but with different contents (foodstuffs, hygiene products, disinfecting agents, etc.). In 2011 the Association of Slovak Consumers ran a test which proved that selected goods bought in different EU countries produced by the same multinational company, had different contents and also various characteristics and quality. According tom the European Commission, products can have different contents in different countries but producers must show and present it clearly. From this point of view this is not legislative but moral problem since if consumers buy an identical product in different places they assume that it is really identical product. Considering EU newly associated countries they pay attention to this topic especially in the Czech Republic, in other countries the research lag behind. In the SR, for example, we miss survey of consumers' opinions related to this topic and also research concerning their ability to distinguish goods with different contents and different quality resulting from it. There is also missing analysis of approaches and attitudes of responsible institutions of the European Commission and particular professional and interest groups in selected countries related to the topic.

Italy represents a relevant case study given the wellknown role of firm clusters in the country's economic development. Results obtained support the hypothesis that industry variety reduces the likelihood of firm exit. Specifically, related variety, which contributes to the generation and diffusion of new knowledge, has a positive effect on firm survival in manufacturing sectors, while unrelated variety, which may work as a portfolio strategy, plays a positive role in services sectors. Localization economies positively influence firm survival only in services sectors. Finally, urban density is not robust to the control for firm characteristics.","[Basile, Roberto; Pittiglio, Rosanna] Univ Naples 2, Dept Econ, Capua, Caserta, Italy; [Reganati, Filippo] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Law Philosophy & Econ Studies, Rome, Italy",Universita della Campania Vanvitelli; Sapienza University Rome,"Pittiglio, R (通讯作者)，Univ Naples 2, Dept Econ, Capua, Caserta, Italy.",roberto.basile@unina2.it; rosanna.pittiglio@unina2.it; filippo.reganati@uniroma1.it,"Basile, Roberto/AAH-5983-2019; Reganati, Filippo/F-4225-2011","REGANATI, Filippo/0000-0002-5028-0421; PITTIGLIO, Rosanna/0000-0002-1717-2453",,,,,50,56,63,5,67,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The concept of global education has been studied by foreign and Russian scholars. The essence of methodological approaches is that education moves to a new level - the use of non-traditional teaching methods aimed at revealing individual traits of a personality. A lot of attention in the research is given to formation of innovation competencies. Each educational system - American, European, Asian, Russian - is characterized by its own approach. In American and European systems of education, more attention is paid to the comprehensive development of students; it is they who are supposed to become the drivers of future development. In Asian and Russian models, approaches to the formation of innovation competencies are in the state of development. The authors have shown that the peculiarity of the global education model is that, on the one hand, each national economy has a specific character and is oriented to its own way of development. On the other hand, in each presented model of education, transformation takes place under the influence of changes in the world economy. Such contradictions cause and contribute to the formation of a commonality and a unified model of global education with orientation toward the formation of innovation competencies.","[Frolova, Natalya; Boyko, Tatyana] FSEI HE Khabarovsk State Univ Econ & Law, Dept World Econ & Customs, Tihookeanskaya Str 134, Khabarovsk, Russia",Pacific National University,"Boyko, T (通讯作者)，FSEI HE Khabarovsk State Univ Econ & Law, Dept World Econ & Customs, Tihookeanskaya Str 134, Khabarovsk, Russia.",frolova.nc@rambler.ru; tanbo60@mail.ru,,,Russian Foundation for Basic Research [16-02-00191/17 OGammaOH],Russian Foundation for Basic Research(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)Spanish Government),This paper is an output of the science project. 16-02-00191/17 O Gamma OH Theoretical and methodological foundations for the formation of innovative mesoeconomics and competencies of small innovative firms -the Russian Foundation for Basic Research.,,18,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,436,443,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059200058,0

That however, carries certain limits with it. In such a situation we assume that the enterprise uses the market potential as efficiently as possible. Further, we assume that the enterprise uses enough of its assets. Another necessary condition is adequate costs on such capital. The general truth is that the volume of foreign capital is increased when the enterprise has no internal sources, which could be engaged, and at the same time costs on equity exceed costs on offered foreign capital. Further on, it is suitable to mention the assumption that the enterprise has no obstacles in its access to capital (equity as well as foreign capital). Nevertheless, the truth still is that the optimal value of enterprise indebtedness in today's globalized world always remains individual. The aim of this contribution is a recommendation of a suitable level of debt in an enterprise operating in manufacturing industry. The question of indebtedness rate is current of the whole globalized world. However, in case of this contribution we are only working with a sample of enterprises within the Czech Republic during the period of 2006 to 2015.

Empirical analysis is conducted using UK longitudinal data linked to local area unemployment and earnings data. Analysis shows that pull factors are more significant in driving transitions into self-employment.

A brief description of clusters is given and the changes in the countries' competitive positions within the period 2013-2015 are analysed. The countries are ranked according to their competitive strengths and weaknesses in tourism sector, the nearest competitors and the leading competitor in the higher cluster are defined.

The authors analyzed the problem of introduction of QMS in the industry, noted the difficulty of quantifying the cost of quality in the provision of transport services. Also they considered elements of the quality economics in transport organization, evaluation of the effectiveness of the proposed implementation of the QMS. The authors state that for successful innovation development of the transport industry a number of challenges needs to address, one of which is raising the level of quality of transport services and transport security up to global indicators. The problem of improving the quality of products in conditions of globalization is very relevant because the success of a business depends on the competitiveness of goods or services. The high competitiveness of services is only a necessary condition for the successful implementation of them in the market in a given amount, taking into account the implementation of the quality management system (QMS) and client-centeredness. The company with great attention to product quality and management can achieve heights in its segment. Innovative principles introduction and effective operation of the quality management system (QMS) offer organizations new opportunities as well as stimulate to create entirely new technologies in management quality. Currently managers put as main objective not only profit but also ensuring the quality of products or services required by the consumer, on the basis that no quality depends on profit but profit depends on quality. Also this dependence should be commensurate with the cost of quality.","[Kazanskaya, Liliya; Saks, Nadezhda; Egorov, Yuriy] Emperor Alexander I St Petersburg State Transport, Fac Econ & Managment, Dept Transport Econ, 9 Moscovskiy Pr, St Petersburg 190031, Russia",Emperor Alexander I St. Petersburg State Transport University,"Egorov, Y (通讯作者)，Emperor Alexander I St Petersburg State Transport, Fac Econ & Managment, Dept Transport Econ, 9 Moscovskiy Pr, St Petersburg 190031, Russia.",yalifa@inbox.ru; sax-nad@yandex.ru; orion56@mail.ru,"Kazanskaya, Liliya/AAA-8677-2022",,,,,,24,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,890,897,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059201049,0

This measure is averaged over five-year periods to reduce short-run fluctuations and probable delayed effects. The results show a significant negative impact of corruption on long-term growth in all specifications, both on average and for each Italian region. As a consequence, a zero level of corruption is growth maximizing. This effect is non-linear such that the negative impact of corruption on growth becomes less intense as corruption increases.","[Lisciandra, Maurizio; Millemaci, Emanuele] Univ Messina, Dept Econ, Messina, Italy",University of Messina,"Lisciandra, M (通讯作者)，Univ Messina, Dept Econ, Messina, Italy.",mlisciandra@unime.it; millemaci@unime.it,"Lisciandra, Maurizio/J-4444-2016","Lisciandra, Maurizio/0000-0002-9020-7106; Millemaci, Emanuele/0000-0002-9095-7513",,,,,38,18,18,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

By doing so, tools of linear programming (LP) or of dynamic optimization are needed many times, particularly in our globalised world, where the cardinality of variables is almost infinite. Although decision makers use different kinds of computer systems to identify the most desired alternative, the result can be questioned in several ways. Should the input attributes take on values of a non-linear scale, the outcome will contain uncertainty. On the one hand in case of complex, global problems, this uncertainty tends to be accepted; managers still use these systems because more advantages can be gained than disadvantages. On the other hand, we can point out that alternatives recommended by computer systems are consistent. However, there are many more people who do not face such complex problems but make their small and simple decisions every day. These small and simple decisions can have international impact as well. Let's just think of the impact of boycott. Although options preferred by humans should be consistent as well, customers often violate even the simplest logical rules or assumptions that could be expected to be taken into consideration during the decision-making process. The global supply chain management and JIT manufacturing are not so keen on not consistent decisions because they cannot be forecasted. That can be a tough challenge for Sales Departments in the international market too.","[Nagy, Viktor] Obuda Univ, Keleti Fac Business & Management, Obuda, Hungary",,"Nagy, V (通讯作者)，Obuda Univ, Keleti Fac Business & Management, Obuda, Hungary.",nagy.viktor@kgk.uni-obuda.hu,,,NEW NATIONAL EXCELLENCE PROGRAM OF THE MINISTRY OF HUMAN CAPACITIES [UNKP-17-4-III],NEW NATIONAL EXCELLENCE PROGRAM OF THE MINISTRY OF HUMAN CAPACITIES,SUPPORTED BY THE UNKP-17-4-III.

For the determination of profit or loss at individual time intervals, an analysis is performed using the Elliott International Classification of Waves. The problem is that a large proportion of citizens cannot exploit and assess the precious metals' benefits for improving living conditions. The business environment, nevertheless, creates and adjusts investment products made of precious metals in physical form in the form of slurries, bricks and coins to make them affordable for as many investors as possible. Thanks to these adjustments, citizens can make regular and irregular investment plans which increase their real wealth according to their economic possibilities. The advantage is that some metals are highly liquid and acceptable assets in the global environment and not only from the side of the investment public but also from the side of industrial companies. Some enterprises are unable to create products without the existence of precious metals, which is another positive attribute which has an influence on their assessment. Making real money savings in precious metals can be considered justifiable and desirable because they lead to securing or possibly maintaining the current standard of living in unexpected life situations.","[Novotny, Josef; Sejkora, Frantisek] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Studentska 95, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Sejkora, F (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Studentska 95, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic.",josef.novotny@upce.cz; frantisek.sejkora@upce.cz,"Novotný, Josef/E-5011-2015",,,,,,15,0,0,2,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1764,1771,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059203024,0

With the help of the proposed model it is possible to take into account all these factors and to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the university's competitiveness, evaluate the effectiveness of its chosen strategy, formulate recommendations for choosing the mechanism for developing the university's resource potential and to adapt its strategy to the existing conditions of the competitive environment.","[Pashkus, Vadim Y.; Kotsofana, Tatiana, V] St Petersburg State Univ, Univ Skaya Nab 7-9, St Petersburg, Russia; [Pashkus, Natalia A.] Herzen State Pedag Univ, Moika River Emb 48, St Petersburg, Russia",Saint Petersburg State University; Herzen State Pedagogical University of Russia,"Pashkus, VY (通讯作者)，St Petersburg State Univ, Univ Skaya Nab 7-9, St Petersburg, Russia.",v.pashkus@spbu.ru; nat_pashkus@mail.ru; tankotsofan@mail.ru,"Pashkus, Vadim Y/N-1291-2015; Pashkus, Natalia/U-3301-2018; Kotcofana, Tatyana/I-6264-2016","Kotcofana, Tatyana/0000-0003-0219-7508",,,,,16,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1867,1873,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059203037,0

Initially, the agricultural landscape in the middle of the last century turned into a centrally managed economy, geared towards the heavy industry and the markets of the countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. At that time, however, globalization processes began to appear in globalized economies, reflected in the volume of international trade, the emergence of multinationals, mixed cultures, and the growth of living standards. Only in 1989 the Central European political and economic changes have taken place that have allowed our economy to be changed to market oriented, with the possibility of moving closer to advanced Western European economies. Until then, for a partially isolated Slovak economy, entering the globalized economy was a great challenge. The involvement of the national economy in the global economic ties and the global competitive environment has also been reflected in structural unemployment in Slovakia. The aim of the paper is to clarify this historical development and to find its reflection in the structure of the Slovak economy and employment. Information has been drawn from available statistical surveys since the 1920s. The historical and logical approach and the genetic-historical analysis were used to process the contribution. At the end of the paper are outlined the positive and negative effects of globalization on the Slovak labour market, household behaviour and living standards of the population.","[Polackova, Hana] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Polackova, H (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",hana.polackova@euba.sk,"Poláčková, Hana/ISV-0949-2023","Poláčková, Hana/0000-0003-2364-1049",,,,,17,0,0,0,4,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2026,2033,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059203058,0

This article presents the potential of using the methodology of life cycle cost calculation in the conditions of a transport company that focuses on the logistic supply of wood-housing producers. The problem is presented through a case study and addresses the decision-making aspect of the decision about acquisition of the transport vehicle. This decision uses time value indicators, inflation rates, average rate of profitability of industry and life cycle costs. Due to the short life cycle of the analyzed period, it was not necessary to consider the ergonomic requirements resulting from the trend of anthropometric dimensions growth.","[Potkany, Marek; Hitka, Milos; Krajcirova, Lucia] Tech Univ Zvolen, TG Masaryka 24, Zvolen 96053, Slovakia",Technical University Zvolen,"Potkány, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Zvolen, TG Masaryka 24, Zvolen 96053, Slovakia.",potkany@tuzvo.sk,"Krajcirova, Lucia/CAG-7372-2022; Hitka, Miloš/Y-2342-2019; Potkány, Marek/E-2115-2017","Krajcirova, Lucia/0000-0002-2512-2069; Hitka, Miloš/0000-0002-6567-7333; Potkány, Marek/0000-0002-7477-6157","grant scientific project VEGA [1/0320/17, APVV 16-02-97]; research project From horse-drawn railway to intermodal transport within Visegrad Fund",grant scientific project VEGA; research project From horse-drawn railway to intermodal transport within Visegrad Fund,The paper is a partial result of the grant scientific project VEGA No. 1/0320/17 Economic and Social Context of European 20/20/20 Targets from the Viewpoint of Economy Low-energy Houses and project APVV 16-02-97 Updating of anthropometric database of Slovak population.; This paper is supported by the research project From horse-drawn railway to intermodal transport within Visegrad Fund.,,22,4,4,1,6,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2261-236X,,,MATEC WEB CONF,,,2017,134.0,,,,,,,,49.0,10.1051/matecconf/201713400049,0.0,,,7,Business; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BJ5ZQ,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426430600049,0
