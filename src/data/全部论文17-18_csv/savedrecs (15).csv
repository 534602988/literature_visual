KEYNES; MODELS; UNEMPLOYMENT; FUTURE; INFLATION; DYNAMICS,"In this paper we review the Rebuilding Macroeconomic Theory Project, in which we asked a number of leading macroeconomists to describe how the benchmark New Keynesian model might be rebuilt, in the wake of the 2008 crisis. The need to change macroeconomic theory is similar to the situation in the 1930s, at the time of the Great Depression, and in the 1970s, when inflationary pressures were unsustainable. Four main changes to the core model are recommended: to emphasize financial frictions, to place a limit on the operation of rational expectations, to include heterogeneous agents, and to devise more appropriate microfoundations. Achieving these objectives requires changes to all of the behavioural equations in the model governing consumption, investment, and price setting, and also the insertion of a wedge between the interest rate set by policy-makers and that facing consumers and investors. In our view, the result will not be a paradigm shift, but an evolution towards a more pluralist discipline.","[Vines, David] Univ Oxford St Antonys Coll, Balliol Coll, Polit Econ Financial Markets Programme, Oxford, England; [Vines, David] Univ Oxford, Oxford Martin Sch, Inst New Econ Thinking INET, Oxford, England; [Vines, David] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England; [Wills, Samuel] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Wills, Samuel] Univ Oxford, Oxford Ctr Anal Resource Rich Econ, Oxford, England; [Wills, Samuel] Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Appl Macroecon Anal, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of Sydney; University of Oxford; Australian National University,"Vines, D (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford St Antonys Coll, Balliol Coll, Polit Econ Financial Markets Programme, Oxford, England.;Vines, D (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford Martin Sch, Inst New Econ Thinking INET, Oxford, England.;Vines, D (通讯作者)，Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England.",david.vines@economics.ox.ac.uk; samuel.wills@sydney.edu.au,,,,,,,103,56,55,1,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

This paper uses the National Transfer Accounts methodology, which defines dependency by the life cycle periods in which individuals' consumption exceeds their labour income. The novelty of the paper is the decomposition of the results by gender, as well as the retrospective pre- and post-crisis analysis for the 20002012 period. Slovenia, an ageing European society with a small, open economy, is used as a showcase. The findings indicate that, in Slovenia in 2012, women were able to finance their consumption through their labour income for 29.0 years, compared to 35.9 years for men, with a significant decrease in the gender gap in economic dependency over time, from 7.9 years in 2000 to 6.9 in 2012. It would seem that the economic crisis interrupted the path to equal periods of economic dependency for both genders. However, overall, the gender gap tends to decrease, despite the economic crisis.","[Istenic, Tanja; Ograjensek, Irena; Sambt, Joze] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Sambt, J (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",joze.sambt@ef.uni-lj.si,"Ograjenšek, Irena/ABB-8263-2020","Ograjensek, Irena/0000-0002-2248-1517",Seventh Framework Programme [613247],Seventh Framework Programme(European Union (EU)),This work was supported by Seventh Framework Programme [grant number 613247].,,65,7,9,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

While some estimates imply substantial gains from child care subsidies, others find insignificant effects. To determine the causes of the variance, this paper reviews and analyzes the elasticity sizes using estimates from 36 peer-reviewed articles and working papers in the literature. We start by reviewing the theoretical and empirical aspects related to participation elasticity with regard to child care costs, paying special attention to sample characteristics, methodological aspects, and macro level factors. We conclude by providing a meta-regression using control variables based on our review of the literature to explain some of the differences between the estimates. As research builds on and improves the methods and assumptions in priorworks, elasticity estimates have become smaller over time. This declinemight also be partially explained by changes in labor market characteristics. In countries with high rates of part-time work and very high or very low rates of female labor force participation, we find elasticity rates to be smaller.","[Akgunduz, Yusuf Emre] Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Ankara, Turkey; [Plantenga, Janneke] Univ Utrecht, Sch Econ, Utrecht, Netherlands",Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey; Utrecht University,"Akgunduz, YE (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Ankara, Turkey.",yusufemre.akgunduz@tcmb.gov.tr,"Akgündüz, Yusuf Emre/AAK-1838-2020","Akgündüz, Yusuf Emre/0000-0001-6171-5593",Bernard van Leer Foundation; CARE project - European Union,Bernard van Leer Foundation; CARE project - European Union,We gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the Bernard van Leer Foundation and the CARE project funded by the European Union.,,60,22,23,2,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

However, there are few case studies dedicated to the analysis of allocative efficiency. The aim of this paper is to fill this gap by incorporating a methodology that analyses both technical and allocative efficiency. We use the Shephard's distance function, particularly suitable when affronted with non-profit-making firms or institutions that are not interested in cost minimization. As an empirical application, we analyse the efficiency of Fundacin Princesa de Asturias (PAF), a Spanish non-governmental organization devoted to promoting the cultural, scientific and humanistic values of universal heritage, the period of study being 1988-2012. Our findings suggest that PAF could have used 7% less inputs to achieve the same level of output. On the other hand, we have found allocative inefficiency. Concretely, the input for other expenditures appears to have been over-utilized in relation to both the inputs for labour and current assets, with labour in turn being over-utilized in relation to current assets. Moreover, our results indicate that both technical and allocative efficiency have clearly improved during the period analysed. In summary, our empirical application shows how distance function methodology can be successfully implemented to measure allocative efficiency in cultural firms and institutions.","[Fernandez-Blanco, Victor] Univ Oviedo, Dept Econ, Ave Cristo, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain; [Rodriguez-Alvarez, Ana] Univ Oviedo, Dept Econ, Oviedo Efficiency Grp, Ave Cristo, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain",University of Oviedo; University of Oviedo,"Rodríguez-Alvarez, A (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Dept Econ, Oviedo Efficiency Grp, Ave Cristo, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain.",vfernan@uniovi.es; ana@uniovi.es,"Rodriguez-Alvarez, Ana/G-6344-2010","Rodriguez-Alvarez, Ana/0000-0002-2492-5070",Fundacion Princesa de Asturias [FUO-EM-171-13]; Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2013-43925-R],Fundacion Princesa de Asturias; Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness,"We are grateful to Fundacion Princesa de Asturias for its personal and financial support (FUO-EM-171-13).

We study the decentralization of home care in the Netherlands and exploit the gradual introduction of formula-based equalization to identify the effect of exogenous changes in an unconditional block grant on local expenditure and utilization. A one euro increase in central government grants raises local expenditure by twenty to fifty cents. Adjustments occur through the number of hours as well as through substitution between basic and more advanced types of assistance.

A quantitative spatial analysis of the transatlantic trade partnership,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,COMPETITION; WORLD,"This paper explores the quantitative effects of trade liberalization envisioned in a transatlantic trade and investment partnership (TTIP) between the United States and the European Union. We use a quantitative trade model that, in contrast to other works, features consumptive and productive uses of land and we allow for labor mobility and a spatial equilibrium. Our calibration draws mainly on the world input-output database (WIOD). The eventual outcome of the negotiations is uncertain. Tariffs in E.U.-U.S. trade are already very low, however, so that an agreement will have a major impact only by eliminating nontariff barriers. These are extremely hard to quantify. We address these uncertainties by considering a corridor of trade-liberalization paths and by providing numerous robustness checks. Even with ambitious liberalization, real income gains within a TTIP are in the range of up to 0.46 percent for most countries. The effect on outside countries is typically negative, yet even smaller. Taking land into account scales down the welfare effects strongly. Interestingly, we find that all German counties derive unambiguous welfare gains even though the model allows for negative terms-of-trade effects. Our analysis also implies that in order to arrive at the same welfare gains as under a TTIP, a multilateral liberalization would have to be much more ambitious for the U.S. than for the E.U.","[Krebs, Oliver; Pflueger, Michael] Univ Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany; [Pflueger, Michael] Inst Econ Res DIW, Berlin, Germany; [Pflueger, Michael] Inst Labour Econ IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Wurzburg; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Pflüger, M (通讯作者)，Univ Wurzburg, Fac Econ, Sanderring 2, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany.",michael.pflueger@uni-wuerzburg.de,"Krebs, Oliver/AAJ-1413-2021",,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [PF 360/7-1],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) Grant No. PF 360/7-1,,54,8,8,2,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Our results also confirm that the export-led growth (ELG) and FDI-led growth hypotheses hold true in the long and short run.

Determining the effectiveness of websites is a multi-dimensional decision-making problem which encompasses the assessment of information quality, system quality, and service quality. The criteria and sub-criteria affecting website effectiveness were determined through literature research and expert panel assistance. AMP method was utilized to determine the relative weights of the evaluation criteria in the study. Then, fuzzy linguistic variables were adopted to rank the websites of SMEs engaged in foreign trade. The proposed evaluation model identifies key factors regarding the criteria and sub-criteria of a website effectiveness. The model can provide a helpful reference in designing useful websites which are an important task for SMEs involved in international trade.","[Akman, Engin] Cankiri Karatekin Univ, Dept Int Trade, TR-18000 Uluyazi, Cankiri, Turkey; [Dagdeviren, Metin] Gazi Univ, Dept Ind Engn, TR-06570 Ankara, Turkey",Cankiri Karatekin University; Gazi University,"Akman, E (通讯作者)，Cankiri Karatekin Univ, Dept Int Trade, TR-18000 Uluyazi, Cankiri, Turkey.",akmanakman@yahoo.com,"Dagdeviren, Metin/S-7039-2019; Dagdeviren, Metin/D-9194-2013; Akman, Engin/AAK-4331-2020","Dagdeviren, Metin/0000-0003-2121-5978; Dagdeviren, Metin/0000-0003-2121-5978;",,,,,55,3,4,2,16,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

We introduce a model of optimal cash holdings and payments that exploits survey payment diaries from Austria, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the United States. Our results provide evidence that differences in incentives, such as the relative cost of cards compared with cash, and differences in ATM withdrawal costs, are key factors explaining why cash remains top-of-wallet across many developed economies.

The utility function is assumed to be non-negative and unbounded from above. The novel feature in our framework is that the agent has risk sensitive preferences in the sense of Hansen and Sargent (1995). Under mild assumptions imposed on the productivity and utility functions we prove that the maximal discounted non-expected utility in the infinite time horizon satisfies the optimality equation and the agent possesses a stationary optimal policy. A new point used in our analysis is an inequality for so-called associated random variables. We also establish the Euler equation that incorporates the solution to the optimality equation.

In this paper a novel formal modeling approach is conceptually developed and presented to address sustainable supplier selection. Grey theory and TOPSIS, a distance based multiple criteria method, are used for the integration and evaluation of sustainable supplier performance for sustainable supplier selection. From a research perspective, TOPSIS is improved to more effectively deal with grey numbers by integrating a degree of likelihood rather than converting grey numbers into crisp numbers functions, and it provides more flexible supplier rankings. This methodology strengthens the sustainable supplier selection process, and can be applied to other multiple criteria decision making problems. Illustrative calculations are made using data on sustainable supplier selection and evaluation published by Bai and Sarkis (2010). The technique is relatively accurate, matching well with results from a published grey rough set approach. The methodology easily implementable with minimal complex calculations required. It can also provide support for sustainable supplier selection, benchmarking, and improvement decisions. This is one of the first papers to integrate a broad set of sustainability factors for grey-based TOPSIS and supplier selection.","[Bai, Chunguang] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econ, 2006 Xiyuan Ave,West Hitech Zone, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Sarkis, Joseph] Worcester Polytech Inst, Sch Business, 100 Inst Rd, Worcester, MA 01609 USA",University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; Worcester Polytechnic Institute,"Bai, CG (通讯作者)，Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econ, 2006 Xiyuan Ave,West Hitech Zone, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",chunguang.bai@gmail.com,"Bai, Chunguang April/E-3296-2012; Sarkis, Joseph/F-4508-2014","Bai, Chunguang April/0000-0002-9461-1632; Sarkis, Joseph/0000-0003-0143-804X","National Natural Science Foundation of China Project [71472031, 71772032]",National Natural Science Foundation of China Project(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China Project (71472031, 71772032).",,33,29,31,12,53,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

The aim of this paper is to examine the FDI inflows determinants for 24 OECD countries. To this end we employ annual data from 1980 to 2012 for a series of potential FDI determinants that have been identified as the most important by the relevant literature. Our empirical strategy employs both the standard fixed effects panel as well as a dynamic panel approach. The empirical findings highlight the importance of market size, trade openness, unit labor cost, schooling, taxation, gross capital formation, institutional variables, and ROA/ROE as significant FDI determinants. In the case of the dynamic panel model those FDI inflows determinants are not uniform for all country groups. Additionally, the results indicate that corporate tax rates clearly affect FDI attractiveness. This finding is robust when testing different countries subgroups. The present study has important policy implications indicating the factors that host economies should place emphasis on in order to attract FDI inflows. Policy makers should not only pay attention to the corporate tax rate level but they should also design a simple, stable and transparent taxation system that minimizes the relevant business risk.","[Baltas, Nicholas; Tsionas, Mike G.] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece; [Tsionas, Mike G.] Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Lancaster, England; [Baltas, Konstantinos] Univ Essex, Finance Grp, Essex Business Sch, Colchester, Essex, England",Athens University of Economics & Business; Lancaster University; University of Essex,"Baltas, N (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece.",baltas@aueb.gr,"Tsionas, Mike George/AAC-3783-2020","Tsionas, Mike George/0000-0003-3761-8106",,,,,34,6,8,1,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This change in life expectancy has potentially profound influences on life-cycle decisions. A longer life expectancy increases the value of human capital investment, while the effect on savings is theoretically ambiguous and life-cycle saving could increase or decrease. This paper uses spatial and temporal variation in ART availability to evaluate the impact of ART provision on savings and investment. We find that ART availability significantly increases savings, expenditures on education, and children's schooling, including among HIV-negative individuals who do not directly benefit from ART. These results are not driven by the direct health effects of treatment or reductions in caretaking responsibilities, but rather by reduced perceptions of mortality risk after ART has become available.","[Baranov, Victoria] Univ Melbourne, 111 Barry St, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia; [Kohler, Hans-Peter] Univ Penn, 3718 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Melbourne; University of Pennsylvania,"Kohler, HP (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, 3718 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",victoria.baranov@unimelb.edu.au; hpkohler@pop.upenn.edu,,"Kohler, Hans-Peter/0000-0003-0639-4349; Baranov, Victoria/0000-0003-4777-6466","Beinecke Scholarship; National Science Foundation GRFP; National Institute of Child Health and Development at the University of Pennsylvania [R03HD058976, R21HD050652, R21HD071471, R21AG053763, R01HD044228, R01HD053781, R01HD087391]; National Institute on Aging at the University of Pennsylvania [P30 AG12836]; Boettner Center for Pensions and Retirement Security at the University of Pennsylvania; National Institute of Child Health and Development Population Research Infrastructure Program at the University of Pennsylvania [R24 HD-044964]",Beinecke Scholarship; National Science Foundation GRFP(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Institute of Child Health and Development at the University of Pennsylvania; National Institute on Aging at the University of Pennsylvania; Boettner Center for Pensions and Retirement Security at the University of Pennsylvania; National Institute of Child Health and Development Population Research Infrastructure Program at the University of Pennsylvania,"We would like to thank anonymous referees for comments and suggestions that substantially improved the paper.

Ensuring incentive -compatibility through state contingent contracts between principal and agent, however, is undesirable for risk-averse agents. We provide a theoretical intuition on how pro-social preferences between agents in a joint liability group contract.can ensure incentive-compatibility. Two independent largescale behavioral experiments framed in an insurance context support the hypotheses derived from our theory. In particular, effort decreases when making agents' payoff less state dependent, but this effect is mitigated with joint liability in a group scheme where agents are additionally motivated by pro-social concerns. Activating strategic motives slightly increases effort further; particularly in non-anonymous groups with high network strength. The results support existing evidence on joint liability groups and further suggest that even if peer pressure to ensure effort provision is absent, such group policies can improve efficiency when agents are pro-social.

To improve treatment outcomes, it is important to identify risk factors for insomnia and sedative-hypnotic use. Classification and regression trees and logistic regression models were used to identify variables associated with insomnia or sedative-hypnotic use. Key findings include low insomnia diagnosis rates (3.5-5.6%) and high rates of sedative-hypnotics (44.2-49.0%). Younger Veterans and those without a breathing-related sleep disorder (BRSD) were more likely to receive an insomnia diagnosis. Veterans with greater service connection and those with an alcohol/substance use disorder were more likely to be prescribed sedative-hypnotics. Interaction terms may have identified potential groups at risk of being under-diagnosed with insomnia (i.e. non-black Veterans with psychiatric co-morbidity, black Veterans without psychiatric co-morbidity) as well as groups at risk for sedative-hypnotic use (i.e. younger Veterans without BRSD). In sum, Veterans with PTSD have high rates of sedative-hypnotic use despite minimal evidence they are effective. This is counter to recommendations indicating behavioral interventions are the first-line treatment. Policy changes are needed to reduce use of sedative-hypnotics and increase access to behavioral insomnia interventions.","[Bramoweth, Adam D.; Luther, James; Hanusa, Barbara H.; Walker, Jon D.] VA Pittsburgh Healthcare Syst, Mental Illness Res Educ & Clin Ctr, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Bramoweth, Adam D.; Atwood, Charles W., Jr.] VA Pittsburgh Healthcare Syst, Ctr Hlth Equ Res & Promot, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Luther, James] Univ Pittsburgh, Grad Sch Publ Hlth, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Atwood, Charles W., Jr.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Med, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Germain, Anne] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychiat, Pittsburgh, PA USA",US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Bramoweth, AD (通讯作者)，VA Pittsburgh Healthcare Syst, Mental Illness Res Educ & Clin Ctr, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.;Bramoweth, AD (通讯作者)，VA Pittsburgh Healthcare Syst, Ctr Hlth Equ Res & Promot, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",Adam.Bramoweth@va.gov,"Bramoweth, Adam/ABB-6789-2020","Bramoweth, Adam/0000-0002-3535-0292","Department of Veterans Affairs VISN 4 Mental Illness Research, Education and Clinical Center [XVA 72-904]; HSR&D Career Development Award [CDA 13-260]","Department of Veterans Affairs VISN 4 Mental Illness Research, Education and Clinical Center; HSR&D Career Development Award","This work was supported by the Department of Veterans Affairs VISN 4 Mental Illness Research, Education and Clinical Center [XVA 72-904] and a HSR&D Career Development Award [CDA 13-260].",,47,2,2,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

This article extends a variant of the asymmetric preference model suggested by Ruge-Murcia to investigate the use of real-time data available to policymakers when making their decisions and revised data which more accurately measure economic performance, but is only available much later. In our extended model, the central banker targets a weighted average of revised and real-time inflation together with a weighted average of revised and real-time output. Moreover, we allow for an asymmetric central bank response to real-time data depending on whether the unemployment rate is high or low. Our model identifies several new potential sources of inflation bias due to data revisions. Our empirical results suggest that the Federal Reserve Bank focuses on targeting revised inflation during low unemployment periods, but it weighs heavily real-time inflation during high unemployment periods. The inflation bias due to data revisions is comparable in magnitude to the bias from asymmetric central banker preferences with the bias being somewhat larger during high unemployment.","[Cassou, Steven P.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Econ, 327 Waters Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Scott, C.

The growth miracle' of the Asian countries centres on the effective use of ER and trade policies, specifically the adoption of depreciation of real exchange rate (RER). However, the case of Africa is different, as the continent is yet to adopt an appropriate ER policy that enhances industrial diversification and growth. Examining the effectiveness of the RER as a policy tool for industrial diversification and growth in 36 African countries, this study applied a dynamic generalised method of moments (GMM) estimation technique to determine how changes in RER affects the growth composition of the three main productive sectors-primary, secondary, and tertiary and their response rates. Our findings suggest that the primary sector leads to appreciation of the RER, while the secondary and tertiary lead to depreciation of the RER. This result has serious policy implication for the Africa continent that has relied so much on the production of primary commodities. Rather than pursue the policy of ER depreciation which affects the primary and secondary sectors, policy shift in favour of the tertiary sector should be highly encouraged.","[Chukwu, Anayochukwu Basil] FUNAI, Fac Management & Social Sci, Dept Econ, Abakaliki, Nigeria; [Malikane, Christopher] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, Dept Econ, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Chukwu, AB (通讯作者)，FUNAI, Fac Management & Social Sci, Dept Econ, Abakaliki, Nigeria.",basilchukwu@gmail.com,,"malikane, christopher/0000-0001-7757-3331",,,,,41,2,2,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

The primitives are the preferences of the players, their assignment to nonoverlapping groups, and the goals of the groups. Our notion of collusion is that a group coordinates the play of its members among different incentive compatible plans to best achieve its goals. Unfortunately, equilibria that meet this requirement need not exist. We instead introduce the weaker notion of collusion constrained equilibrium. This allows groups to put positive probability on alternatives that are suboptimal for the group in certain razor's edge cases where the set of incentive compatible plans changes discontinuously. These collusion constrained equilibria exist and are a subset of the correlated equilibria of the underlying game. We examine four perturbations of the underlying game. In each case,we show that equilibria in which groups choose the best alternative exist and that limits of these equilibria lead to collusion constrained equilibria. We also show that for a sufficiently broad class of perturbations, every collusion constrained equilibrium arises as such a limit. We give an application to a voter participation game that shows how collusion constraints may be socially costly.","[Dutta, Rohan] McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Levine, David K.] European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, Florence, Italy; [Levine, David K.] Washington Univ, Dept Econ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Modica, Salvatore] Univ Palermo, Dept Econ, Palermo, Italy",McGill University; European University Institute; Washington University (WUSTL); University of Palermo,"Dutta, R (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",rohan.dutta@mcgill.ca; david@dklein.com; salvatore.modica@unipa.it,,,EIEF; MIUR PRIN [20103S5RN3],"EIEF; MIUR PRIN(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)Research Projects of National Relevance (PRIN))","We are especially grateful to Marco Mariotti, Andrea Mattozzi, Kirill Pogorelskiy, Joel Sobel, Chris Tyson, seminar participants at Bocconi, Glasgow, Naples, Padua, QMUL, the Games Meetings in Maastricht, and a number of anonymous referees.

It is shown that 1) the social welfare is always increasing in the share of profits distributed to workers and profit taxation is not neutral: the optimality rule prescribes complementarity in their use; 2) although an increasing profit-sharing parameter has conflicting effects (i.e. the net profit accruing to the firms reduces, workers and consumers' welfare increase), a sufficiently high profit-sharing rule may be in the interest of the society, because it allows for eliminating the inefficiency due to the labour market imperfections. Moreover, we show that a third best optimal social welfare (given the institutional constraint of a non-negative wage rate) can be achieved. Interestingly, in this case, firms and workers achieve the maximal welfare. Therefore, we argue that profit-subsidisation may be used for motivating firms to apply the socially optimal profit-sharing rule, which warrants Pareto-superior outcomes for producers (firms and workers) (for instance, in the special case of monopoly unions and perfect substitute goods, the rule corresponding to a 50 per cent net profit share distributed to workers, jointly with a 50 per cent profit subsidisation).","[Fanti, Luciano] Univ Pisa, Pisa, Italy; [Buccella, Domenico] Kozminski Univ, Warsaw, Poland",University of Pisa; Kozminski University,"Fanti, L (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, Pisa, Italy.",,"Buccella, Domenico/F-8981-2019","Buccella, Domenico/0000-0002-9594-0630",,,,,30,0,0,0,5,INST ESTUDIOS FISCALES,MADRID,"AVDA CARDENAL HERRERA ORIA, 378, MADRID, 28035, SPAIN",0210-1173,,,HACIENDA PUBLICA ESP,Hacienda Publica Esp.,,2018,,226,,,,,59,84,,10.7866/HPE-RPE.18.3.3,0.0,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,HF2BO,,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000454041300003,0

The governance effectiveness and the foreign direct investment are also included in the analysis. The results show that in countries with higher GDPPC, the CSR disclosure is negatively related to individualism and masculinity and positively related to uncertainty avoidance and indulgence. When focusing in countries with lower GDPPC, the results suggest that CSR disclosure is negatively related to power distance and positively related to uncertainty avoidance. Moreover, five of the six Hofstede's cultural dimensions negatively affect sustainability disclosure in countries with middle GDPPC.","[Gallen, Maria L.] Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Dept Accounting, Valencia, Spain; [Peraita, Carlos] Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Anal, Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia; University of Valencia,"Peraita, C (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Anal, Valencia, Spain.",carlos.peraita@uv.es,"Peraita, Carlos/HKN-2387-2023","Peraita, Carlos/0000-0001-5445-3847; Gallen, Maria Luisa/0000-0001-6797-4465",,,,,44,41,44,8,81,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The purpose of the present study is to determine the relationship between school shootings and state and Federal gun control laws. Using a Poisson, two-way fixed effects model, it was found that assault weapons bans reduced the number of school shooting victims by 54.4%. All other gun control laws (concealed carry laws, private sale background checks and Federal dealer background checks) had no statistically significant effects on school shootings. Although assault weapons bans may reduce the overall number of school shooting victims, the average reduction in murder victims may be less than 10 per year. Hence, it is unclear if gun control is the most appropriate policy to use to reduce the number school shooting victims.","[Gius, Mark] Quinnipiac Univ, Hamden, CT 06518 USA",Quinnipiac University,"Gius, M (通讯作者)，Quinnipiac Univ, Hamden, CT 06518 USA.",Mark.gius@quinnipiac.edu,,,,,,,5,6,19,3,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

It is hypothesized that productivity growth in agriculture, particularly food staples, is a critical factor in explaining the differences in structural change. In China, rapid agricultural growth kept food cheap and thus labor inexpensive, fostering rapid growth in labor-intensive manufacturing. In India, sluggish agricultural growth and rising food costs meant that labor in India has become increasingly expensive and this has inhibited the development of labor-intensive manufacturing.","[Grabowski, Richard] Southern Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA",Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University,"Grabowski, R (通讯作者)，Southern Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.",ricardo@siu.edu,,,,,,,30,0,0,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

To our best knowledge, the research on the influence channel of the bank credit is new in the literature. The effects of economic policy uncertainty on corporate investment through bank credit are obvious, and the effects are more significant for firms with low external demand than those that have high external demand. However, this result is influenced by the varying characteristics of controlling shareholders and industries as well as the different degrees of financial development.

Standard Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) Armington models fail to account for either vertical linkages or parameter uncertainty. Here, we introduce a vertically integrated, nested two-sector Armington model that incorporates uncertainty in the estimates of Armington elasticities through Monte Carlo simulation. As an illustrative case, we model the effects of changes in country of origin labeling (COOL) rules on the market shares of cattle in the U.S. beef market. By accounting for parameter uncertainty in this way, we are able to estimate the distribution of potential effects of repealing mandatory COOL. Ultimately, we predict that, in all but the most extreme cases, Mexico and Canada would not gain as much market share from the repeal of mandatory COOL as they claim in their World Trade Organization (WTO) filings against the regulation.","[Hallren, Ross] USITC, Off Econ, Res Div, 500 E St SW, Washington, DC 20436 USA; [Opanasets, Alexandra] Boston Coll, Econ Dept, Maloney Hall,140 Commonwealth Ave, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA",Boston College,"Hallren, R (通讯作者)，USITC, Off Econ, Res Div, 500 E St SW, Washington, DC 20436 USA.",ross.hallren@usitc.gov,,,,,,,16,2,3,2,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze the conditions under which the trickle-down effect does not work properly such that the connection between trade-induced output growth and welfare improvement is broken. Design/methodology/approach - This paper introduces an inter-sectoral migration barrier in the general equilibrium model and conducts various simulation experiments under reasonable parameter values. Findings - This paper demonstrates that subsidizing export industries may raise the total value-added of an economy but deteriorate aggregate welfare. This worsens especially when the supply of non-tradable domestic goods is inelastic, and the demand for them is more substitutable by tradable goods. Practical implications - To reinforce the trickle-down effect, it is necessary to facilitate efficient labor reallocation and to induce capitalization in the non-tradable sector. Originality/value - That output growth and welfare improvement do not always move in the same direction requires a reappraisal of the former common belief on the trickle-down effect which emphasizes output growth as an indicator of welfare improvement.","[Hong, Sungwan] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Econ, Tokyo, Japan; [Oh, Soo Hyun] Korea Inst Int Econ Policy, Dept Int Trade, Sejongsi, South Korea; [Sim, Seung-Gyu] Univ Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan",University of Tokyo; Korea Institute for International Economic Policy (KIEP); University of Tokyo,"Sim, SG (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.",sgsim@sipeb.aoyama.ac.jp,"Sim, Seung-Gyu/AAD-9199-2019","Hong, Sungwan/0000-0002-5868-8691",,,,,24,0,0,0,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

It also brought about an increase in vigorous exercise for those who had the behaviour at baseline. These results further vary by a person's job type, but less so with respect to gender or geographic region. Overall, our findings provide new empirical evidence on the causal link between retirement and health behaviours and how such link relates to four sources of individual heterogeneity: gender, European geographic region, job type and baseline health behaviour.","[Kesavayuth, Dusanee; Zikos, Vasileios] Univ Thai Chamber Commerce, RIPED, Bangkok, Thailand; [Rosenman, Robert E.] Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",University Thai Chamber Commerce; Washington State University,"Rosenman, RE (通讯作者)，Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",yamaka@wsu.edu,"Kesavayuth, Dusanee/AAR-7084-2020","Kesavayuth, Dusanee/0000-0002-7398-8908; Rosenman, Robert/0000-0002-3812-5824",University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce,University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce,This work was supported by a grant from the University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce.,,42,12,13,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

State-funded propaganda has been using distorted institutionalism to rationalize both authoritarianism and nationalism as a left-wing response to global neoliberalism and as a welcome manifestation of civilizational plurality. To help western heterodox-institutionalists offer an informed critique of what Vladimir Putin's apologists have made of some heterodox ideas, I discuss the particularities of the history of Russian post-Soviet economic thought, and explain who these apologists are and what their training is. I also clarify how, in post-socialist Russia, it has become possible to successfully misappropriate the institutionalist emphases on the significance of culture and history in socio-economic development, and on the active role of the state in a market economy for narrow ideological purposes. In my conclusion, I emphasize strongly that traditional institutionalism is not compatible with oppression and authoritarianism.","[Klimina, Anna] Univ Saskatchewan, St Thomas More Coll, Dept Econ, Saskatoon, SK, Canada",University of Saskatchewan,"Klimina, A (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, St Thomas More Coll, Dept Econ, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.",,,,,,,,41,6,6,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Second, we find that convergence of household credit occurs faster than firm credit, inducing a process of convergence of the share of household credit to total credit. Third, convergence occurs faster in low-income countries and in countries with a lower initial level of total credit but slows down after the 2008 global financial crisis.

We embark on an analysis of trade in high-tech goods with a particular emphasis placed on Polish-German relations in the most significant sectors: machinery, electrical and electronic equipment. The results show tendencies typical for the middle-income trap, which has particular implications for the development of the semi-peripheral Polish economy.","[Michalski, Bartosz] Univ Wroclaw, Inst Int Studies, Dept Int Econ Relat & European Integrat, Wroclaw, Poland",University of Wroclaw,"Michalski, B (通讯作者)，Univ Wroclaw, Inst Int Studies, Dept Int Econ Relat & European Integrat, Wroclaw, Poland.",bartosz.michalski@uwr.edu.pl,"Michalski, Bartosz/G-3043-2014","Michalski, Bartosz/0000-0002-0824-0098","University of Wroclaw, Institute of International Studies","University of Wroclaw, Institute of International Studies","This work was supported by University of Wroclaw, Institute of International Studies.",,23,3,3,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2018,30.0,3,,,,,405,420,,10.1080/14631377.2018.1442050,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GF8JM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432216800007,0

When facing insufficient internally generated cash flows and external funds for accommodating capital investments, companies are found to finance capital expenditure by primarily depleting cash reserves and increasing trade payables. Corroborating the postulates of the financing constraints theory, working capital investments are found to be inversely related to the degree of financing constraints, and positively sensitive to operating cash flow fluctuations and availability of external finance. For financially constrained companies, capital expenditures are found to more likely exercise a negative impact on working capital investments. Contributing to the discussion on the nature of business cycles, we document that the negative cash flow shocks are likely to be transmitted to firms' counterparties through the trade credit channel rather than through the reduction of investment demand. The empirical findings also suggest that financial managers fail to properly account for capital expenditures in short-term liquidity planning, which, under conditions of limited access to imperfect capital markets, may induce the recurrence of costly working capital adjustments.","[Mielcarz, Pawel; Osiichuk, Dmytro] Kozminski Univ, Dept Finance, Warsaw, Poland",Kozminski University,"Osiichuk, D (通讯作者)，Kozminski Univ, Dept Finance, Warsaw, Poland.",dosiichuk@kozminski.edu.pl,"Osiichuk, Dmytro/G-6500-2019; Mielcarz, Pawel/G-4844-2019","Osiichuk, Dmytro/0000-0002-6235-2576; Mielcarz, Pawel/0000-0002-3986-1858",,,,,53,8,10,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The Nordics are an ideal case as they are perceived to be a cluster of similar countries, but they have chosen different relations to the European Union (EU) and the rest of the world. First, comparing actionable and non-actionable determinants of services trade, I find that policy-determined free trade agreements (FTAs) boost services trade by 75% and a single market by an additional 45%, while the accumulated effect of all standard non-actionable shared geographical, institutional and cultural features (sharing a land border, language, colonial past and legal origin) almost triples services trade.

We assume that the production will generate environmental pollution, which causes an extra cost that the private firm does not bear but residents with the environmental preference have to tolerate. The government pursues to maximize social welfare. We find that the residents' environmental preference has significant impacts on privatization. When residents pay more attention to environmental pollution, privatization cannot induce more social welfare, and thus the government will choose not to privatize the public firm. The degree of substitution of products will affect the results when the value of the residents' environmental preference is given, but the order of the firms' moves will not change the results.","[Pi, Jiancai; Guan, Yiwen] Nanjing Univ, Dept Econ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University,"Pi, JC (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ, Dept Econ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",pi2008@nju.edu.cn; guanyiwen1990@163.com,"Pi, Jiancai/AAY-5955-2021","Pi, Jiancai/0000-0003-4327-8355",National Social Science Fund of China [16BJY080],National Social Science Fund of China,The authors thank two anonymous referees for their valuable comments.

To this purpose, we use a simple model of a vertically linked market, where an upstream regulated natural monopoly is trading via two-part tariff contracts with a downstream duopoly. Combining our results to those of the existing literature on deregulated markets, we argue that when the downstream competition is in prices, efficiency dictates regulating the monopoly with a marginal cost based pricing scheme. However, this type of regulation leads to significant welfare loss, when the downstream market is characterized by Cournot competition.","[Polemis, Michael; Eleftheriou, Konstantinos] Univ Piraeus, Dept Econ, 80 Karaoli & Dimitriou St, Piraeus 18534, Greece",University of Piraeus,"Eleftheriou, K (通讯作者)，Univ Piraeus, Dept Econ, 80 Karaoli & Dimitriou St, Piraeus 18534, Greece.",mpolemis@unipi.gr; kostasel@otenet.gr,"Polemis, Michael/AAM-7918-2021","POLEMIS, MICHAEL/0000-0003-2223-0547",,,,,37,0,0,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

Unlike previous papers evaluating the efficiency of South-Eastern European banks, we emphasize the importance of applying weight restrictions in Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The aim is to incorporate every aspect of a decision-making unit's performance to avoid misevaluation of a bank's efficiency. As a possible remedy to the issue, a bootstrapped I-distance is suggested as a statistically sound framework for determining weight bounds in the Global Assurance Region (GAR) DEA model. In terms of average efficiency, the banking sector of Serbia exhibits an improving trend over the period analyzed.

Generally, when prices raise consumption decreases. However, real estate is not only source of housing. It is also a source of wealth and as such can be converted into liquidity at a suitable time by using a home equity loan. Unfortunately, the best time for this convertibility is the moment least suitable for the authorities who are responsible for monetary control. Firstly, I refer to the channel of a transmission mechanism by which central bank can disrupt the economy at the time of boom. Secondly, I introduce and verify a mechanism that may cause the rise of consumption depending on the real estate price increase in boom times. Last but not least, I mention why there could be the relationship between the price of real estate and the consumption problematic when setting monetary policy. The cross-correlation analysis is implemented on data of the Czech Republic which cover the period between 2006Q1 and 2017Q4. The outcome of the work results in the fact that a mechanism which can pump up a large amount of financial resources to the economy at an inappropriate moment can be a reason why the effectiveness of restrictive measures of the monetary authorities in the Czech Republic is slowing down.","[Reichel, Vlastimil] Masaryk Univ, Lipova 507-41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Reichel, V (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Lipova 507-41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",reichel.v@mail.muni.cz,"Reichel, Vlastimil/AAB-5334-2021","Reichel, Vlastimil/0000-0001-7280-4508","Faculty of Economics and Administration, Masaryk University [MUNI/A/0966/2017]","Faculty of Economics and Administration, Masaryk University","This work was supported by funding of specific research at Faculty of Economics and Administration, Masaryk University, project MUNI/A/0966/2017.

We study how four measures of income inequality and poverty respond to several stock and flow variables accounting for fiscal actions. We find that increases in government debt and expenditure promote a less unequal distribution of income. We detect a significant distributional impact of education and social spending as well as of government consumption expenditure. We also investigate potential redistributive implications of large fiscal expansion and consolidation episodes finding no evidence of additional effects beyond those associated with conventional fiscal variables.Abbreviations: OECD: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; GDP: Gross Domestic Product; G20: Group of 20 economies (forum of 19 dvanced and emerging countries plus the European Union); CGE: Computational General Equilibrium models; DSGE: Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium models; UN-WIDER: United Nations World Institute for Development Economics Research; SWIID: Standardized World Income Inequality Database; WDI: World Development Indicators; PPP: Purchasing-Power Parity; LIS: Luxembourg Income Database; GMM: Generalized Method of Moments; FE: Fixed Effects; RE: Random Effects; SE: Standard Errors; CPI: Consumer Price Index,"[Salotti, Simone] European Commiss, JRC, Seville, Spain; [Trecroci, Carmine] Univ Brescia, Dept Econ & Management, Via San Faustino 74-B, I-25122 Brescia, Italy",University of Brescia,"Trecroci, C (通讯作者)，Univ Brescia, Dept Econ & Management, Via San Faustino 74-B, I-25122 Brescia, Italy.",carmine.trecroci@unibs.it,"Salotti, Simone/N-7916-2019; TRECROCI, Carmine/M-1326-2016","Salotti, Simone/0000-0003-1898-6683; TRECROCI, Carmine/0000-0003-2281-1181",,,,,84,11,13,3,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

To that end, a bootstrap rolling window Granger causality approach based on the modified Granger causality test is used. A new index for tourism activity which combines via principal component analysis the commonly used tourism indicators is also employed. The results of the bootstrap rolling window causality tests reveal that the causal relations between tourism and economic growth vary substantially over time and across countries in terms of both magnitude and direction. It is shown that the causal linkages tend to be more pronounced for a large group of countries following the global financial crisis of 2008. Additionally, Germany, France and China clearly stand out as the countries with the weakest causal nexus, while the UK, Italy and Mexico emerge as the countries that have the strongest causal links.

The empirical evidence shows that the consumption income ratio is stationary around structural breaks in most (44 out of 50) African countries.

The cartel overcharge is larger the lower the entry cost and the larger the market size, and is independent of the degree of product differentiation. These theoretical results are consistent with evidence from a natural experiment of policy reform, the introduction of cartel law in the UK in the late 1950s. Price-cost margins declined after the breakdown of cartels in low-capital and larger-sized industries relative to capital intensive and smaller-sized ones. There is weaker evidence of a fall in price-cost margins in consumer good and advertising-intensive relative to producer good and low-advertising industries. Crucially, these effects are not observed for industries that were not affected by the cartel law. A comparison of these findings with evidence on the incidence of collusion suggests that the welfare loss from collusive pricing may often be smaller in industries where cartels tend to form than in those where collusion is more difficult to sustain.

Asymmetric information comes from the fact that insiders know the probability of the growth prospects of the firm while outsiders do not. Also, we assume that there are two types of firms (good and bad types) that differ in the quality of their forecasting of future cash flows. Our numerical simulations reveal that firms with more accurate forecasting of cash flows have an interest in speeding up investment in order to make it more difficult for bad firms to mimic their actions. Moreover, we show that the presence of asymmetric ambiguity leads to costly cash holding. These findings may help firms when making their investment and financing decisions under asymmetric ambiguity.","[Viviani, Jean-Laurent; Lai, Anh-Ngoc] Univ Rennes 1, Rennes, France; [Viviani, Jean-Laurent; Lai, Anh-Ngoc] CREM Rennes 6211 CNRS, Rennes, France; [Louhichi, Wael] ESSCA Sch Management, Angers, France",Universite de Rennes; Universite de Rennes; ESSCA School of Management,"Louhichi, W (通讯作者)，ESSCA Sch Management, Angers, France.",jean-laurent.viviani@univ-rennes1.fr; anh-ngoc.lai@univ-rennes1.fr; wael.louhichi@essca.fr,,,,,,,32,7,8,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

This model proves that M2/GDP is positively related to the expected wealth and negatively related to the opportunity costs of holding money. China's extremely high monetization ratio as measured by M2/GDP is the result of a decades-long rapid economic growth and a depressed financial system. Fast economic growth leads to high expected wealth. A depressed financial system leads to low opportunity costs of holding money. The combination of those two factors increases money demand and leads to very high M2/GDP. The model is verified indirectly by testing two implied testable hypothesizes. The study of this article raises questions on the accuracy of M2/GDP as a measure of monetization.,"[Wang, Lei] Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies, Sch Finance, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Taihui] China Banking Regulatory Comm, Policy Res Bur, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Taihui] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Finance & Banking, Beijing, Peoples R China",Guangdong University of Foreign Studies; Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Wang, L (通讯作者)，Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies, Sch Finance, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",wangleiruc@gmail.com,,"Wang, Lei/0000-0001-5908-9116",,,,,8,0,0,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

First, the article examines the failure of mainstream economics to present a coherent story of consumer behavior. Ignoring the relevance of assumptions, as Milton Friedman advocated, leads economists to hypostasize the model, filtering information central to the crisis. Second, Minsky's discussion of consumer behavior and its effect on cash inflows to businesses represents an institutional explanation regarding why John Maynard Keynes's long-run vision did not occur. The third section expands on some of the themes addressed by Minsky, which are found among the contributions of institutional economists, focusing on efforts to mold institutions to increase cash inflows to corporations and protect those inflows.","[Watkins, John P.] Westminster Coll, Econ, Salt Lake City, UT 84105 USA",,"Watkins, JP (通讯作者)，Westminster Coll, Econ, Salt Lake City, UT 84105 USA.",,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Examining the history and marketing strategies of yogurt in Japan, I demonstrate how international marketing and cooperation has influenced the definitions, meanings and values of yogurt. In Japan, companies turn to ethnographic images of Bulgaria to sell their products, emphasizing visions of rural life over Bulgarian yogurt-making technology. At the same time, the fact that Bulgarian yogurt has turned into a symbol of health and wellbeing in one of the world's economic powers is a source of national pride for consumers in post-socialist Bulgaria. The branding strategies of yogurt show how companies transform foods into culturally meaningful products, thereby doing much more than making profitable commodities of them.

The results indicate that, first, the preferences of decision-makers in the university for article publications and research funds may significantly affect the allocation of PhD enrolment quotas among schools. Second, when the linear combination weighting method is used, the overall efficiency for PhD enrolment allocation proves the highest, among various weighting methods concerned. Finally, to improve the overall efficiency of the 19 schools, five social science schools and four engineering schools have to cut their PhD enrolment quotas; among them, three engineering schools should reduce the largest redundant quotas sharply.

The model is consistent with observed falls in GDP growth rates and subsequent recoveries and illustrates why fiscal multipliers are small during sovereign debt crises.","[Alonso-Ortiz, Jorge] ITAM, CIE, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Colla, Esteban] Univ Panamer, Escuela Gobierno & Polit Publ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Da-Rocha, Jose-Maria] Univ Vigo, EUEE, Vigo, Galicia, Spain",Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico; Universidad Panamericana - Ciudad de Mexico; Universidade de Vigo,"Alonso-Ortiz, J (通讯作者)，ITAM, CIE, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",jorge.alonso@itam.mx; ecolla@up.edu.mx; jdarocha@itam.mx,"Da-Rocha, Jose-Maria/Y-7181-2018; Colla-De-Robertis, Esteban/C-6651-2017; Da-Rocha, Jose-Maria/CAJ-5410-2022","Da-Rocha, Jose-Maria/0000-0003-3985-8816; Colla-De-Robertis, Esteban/0000-0002-0364-3445;",Xunta de Galicia [GRC 2015/014]; Xunta de Galicia (ECOBAS),Xunta de Galicia(Xunta de Galicia); Xunta de Galicia (ECOBAS)(Xunta de Galicia),Jose Maria Da Rocha gratefully acknowledges financial support from Xunta de Galicia (Ref.

Not only was real growth disappointingly low, but even nominal growth over which monetary policy has more control was feeble. Why did QE fail to stimulate robust aggregate demand growth? This paper argues the answer is that the Federal Reserve could not credibly commit to a permanent expansion of the monetary base under QE. Both quantity theoretic and New Keynesian models show, however, that a permanent expansion of the monetary base is needed to spur aggregate demand growth at the zero lower bound (ZLB). The Federal Reserve's inability to do so meant its QE programs got consigned to 'irrelevance results' of Krugman (1998) and Eggertson and Woodford (2003) and were never going to spark a strong a recovery. Going forward, this inability to commit to a permanent expansion of the monetary base at the ZLB will continue to weigh down on the effectiveness of Fed policy. As a result, this paper calls for a new monetary policy regime of a NGDP level target that is backstopped by the consolidated balance sheet of the government. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In contrast to Beine and Parsons (2015, The Scandinavian Journal of Economics, 117, 723-767) and in light of recent empirical contributions, we adopt an alternative identification strategy in which we only include fixed effects together with our measures of climatic change to quantify the net partial effect of climatic change on bilateral migration. Again drawing on panel data from 1960 to 2000, we further exploit the dyadic dimension of our data to highlight the importance of neighbouring countries and former colonial powers in determining the direction of climate-induced emigration. Our baseline results suggest that climatic shocks affect individuals' financial constraints more than their desire to move. Our key findings are that natural disasters tend to deter emigration but importantly spur emigration to neighbouring countries. For middle-income origins, natural disasters, while deterring migration, foster emigration to former colonial powers.

This result holds after controlling for business and financial cycle conditions and different bank-specific characteristics such as liquidity, capitalisation, funding costs, bank risk and income diversification.

The originality of our approach does not lie so much in the identification of the main conventions shaping the governance of SSEOs, but rather in the analysis of the conflicts and achievable compromises among each of these polities. Our contribution is threefold. We first show that the competition among several conventions generates organizational conflicts that are difficult to solve. We then reveal that achieving an (ephemeral) compromise entails a risk of excluding a 'polity', which may in turn weaken the governance of SSEOs. We finally sketch out some perspectives allowing to mitigate this risk. In particular, we outline organizational strategies likely to frame the governance of SSEOs without impairing their identities and plural forms of 'worth'.","[Bouille, Julien] Univ Rennes 2, LIRiS, EA 7481, F-7481 Rennes, France; [Cornee, Simon] Univ Rennes 1, CREM UMR CNRS 6211, Rennes, France; [Cornee, Simon] CERMi, Rennes, France",Universite de Rennes; Institut National des Sciences Appliquees de Lyon - INSA Lyon; Universite Rennes 2; Universite de Rennes,"Bouillé, J (通讯作者)，Univ Rennes 2, LIRiS, EA 7481, F-7481 Rennes, France.",julien.bouille@univ-rennes2.fr; simon.cornee@univ-rennes1.fr,,,,,,,79,0,0,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

Taking full account of firm heterogeneity, the paper analyses which characteristics make some CEEC firms more resilient to crisis than others. Using the panel VAR system on a large firm-level dataset, we estimate the responses in firms' employment and investment to cyclical demand shocks and financial shocks. Controlling for industry, time and country differences, we split firms according to size, age, export status, foreign versus domestic ownership and pre-crisis growth vs. growth during crisis in order to compare firms' responses between distinct splits. We find that a cyclical drop in demand decreases firms' employment in subsequent periods, but there is substantial heterogeneity among different types of firms. Old and especially small old firms react more swiftly, whereas the downward adjustment in employment is less severe in exporters and in foreign-owned firms. On the other side, investment does not respond to demand shocks per se, but to the free cash flow component of the business cycle. Differences in country-specific settings also show an important impact on firms' resistance to crisis.","[Burger, Anze; Damijan, Joze P.; Kostevc, Crt; Rojec, Matija] Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Damijan, Joze P.] LICOS, Veurne, Belgium; [Damijan, Joze P.] VIVES, Kortrijk, Belgium; [Damijan, Joze P.; Kostevc, Crt; Rojec, Matija] Inst Econ Res, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Rojec, Matija] Inst Macroecon Anal & Dev, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Damijan, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Kardeljeva Ploscad 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",joze.damijan@ef.uni-lj.si,,"Damijan, Joze/0000-0001-9150-1174",European Union's Seventh Framework Programme under grant agreement Growth-Innovation-Competitiveness: Fostering Cohesion in Central and Eastern Europe (GRINCOH),European Union's Seventh Framework Programme under grant agreement Growth-Innovation-Competitiveness: Fostering Cohesion in Central and Eastern Europe (GRINCOH),The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under the grant agreement Growth-Innovation-Competitiveness: Fostering Cohesion in Central and Eastern Europe (GRINCOH).,,74,30,33,2,29,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0939-3625,1878-5433,,ECON SYST,Econ.

It concentrates on the underwriting risk (in particular, on the reserve risk) and on the counterparty default risk (i.e. mainly on the reinsurers' default risk), since such risks are crucial for insurance activities. Various actuarial approaches to the underwriting risk applied by subjects respected by insurance regulators and supervisors are surveyed. Moreover, one of them suggests by means of a real data example a simplified approach to the reserve risk, which may be appreciated in practice just for its simplicity. As to the counterparty default risk, the paper presents a method that can be suitable when the reinsurers form a small group of heterogeneous subjects imperilled by a common shock as a financial crisis or a natural catastrophe; this methodological approach is also demonstrated by a numerical example.","[Cipra, Tomas; Hendrych, Radek] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Probabil & Math Stat, Fac Math & Phys, Prague, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Cipra, T (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Dept Probabil & Math Stat, Fac Math & Phys, Prague, Czech Republic.",cipra@karlin.mff.cuni.cz; hendrych@karlin.mff.cuni.cz,"Cipra, Tomáš/N-8668-2019; Hendrych, Radek/O-8266-2017; Hendrych, Radek/HJH-3526-2023","Cipra, Tomáš/0000-0003-0604-324X; Hendrych, Radek/0000-0003-3222-3148; Hendrych, Radek/0000-0003-3222-3148",Czech Science Foundation [GA P402/12/G097],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),This work was supported by the Czech Science Foundation (the Grant No. GA P402/12/G097: DYME - Dynamic Models in Economics).,,15,1,1,1,9,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

We show that an increase in monetary compensation may cause reputation-concerned individuals to be more prone to participate in corruption due to an overjustification effect. The overall effect of monetary incentives on fighting corruption crucially depends on the composition of the pool of public sector workers for two reasons: first, different types of workers react differently to the same policy; second, the composition of the pool of workers affects individual behavior through its effect on collective reputation.

While many of these decisions are taken on behalf of others rather than for oneself, the existing literature finds mixed results on whether people take more or less risk for others then for themselves. Recent studies suggest that taking decisions for others reduces loss aversion, thereby increasing risk taking on behalf of others. To test this, we elicit loss aversion in three treatments: making risky decisions for oneself, for one other subject, or for the decision maker and another person combined. We find a clear treatment effect when making decisions for others but not when making decisions for both. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Exploiting granular deal-level data, we empirically study the U.S. daily deals promotion market, characterized by frequent multihoming of consumers and merchants leading to intense competition in over 150 regional markets between two major platforms, Groupon and LivingSocial. Consistent with the competitive pressure due to prevalent multihoming on the consumer side, we find little inter-platform difference in deal terms such as discount rate, price and value offered to consumers. On the merchant side, merchants that performed worse in the first promotion were more likely to switch to a competing platform for the next promotion. However, such platform switching brought little improvement in coupon sales in the subsequent promotion, particularly when the merchant switched from the market leader to a newer platform. Being first in a regional market provided an advantage to the platform in coupon sales, but that advantage quickly attenuated as promotions were repeated. Thus, in the presence of multihoming agents, the daily deal platforms appear to find it difficult to create a competitive bottleneck in either side of the market. The insight from our findings can be extended to other infomediary platform markets. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The availability of financial assistance has counteracting effects on the default incentives of governments. On the one hand, financial assistance can help to avoid defaults by bridging times of fundamental crises or resolving coordination failures among private investors. On the other hand, the insurance effect of financial assistance lowers borrowing costs, which induces the sovereign to accumulate higher debt levels. To assess the overall effect of financial assistance on the probability of default, we construct a quantitative model of endogenous credit structure and sovereign default that allows for self-fulfilling expectations of default. Calibrating the model to Argentinean data, we find that the availability of financial assistance reduces the number of defaults that occur due to self-fulfilling runs by private investors. However, at the same time, it raises average debt levels causing an overall increase in the probability of default.","[Kirsch, Florian] Univ Bonn, Adenauerallee 24-42, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Ruehmkorf, Ronald] European Cent Bank, Sonnemannstr 20, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany",University of Bonn; European Central Bank,"Rühmkorf, R (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Sonnemannstr 20, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany.",fkirsch@uni-bonn.de; ronald.ruehmkorf@ecb.europa.eu,,,Bonn Graduate School of Economics; German Science Foundation (DFG),Bonn Graduate School of Economics; German Science Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We thank Gernot Muller, Thomas Hintermaier, Johannes Pfeifer, Almuth Scholl, and participants at the 3rd DFG Workshop on Financial Market Imperfections and Macroeconomic Performance, the 13th SAET Conference on Current Trends in Economics, the 2013 Annual Conference of the Royal Economic Society, the 37th Simposio de la Asociacion Espanola de Economia, the EDP Jamboree 2012, the 2nd Rhineland Workshop, the Annual Meeting of the Verein fur Socialpolitik 2012, the 27th Congress of the European Economic Association, the Macro-Workshop (Bonn University), and the 3rd Conference on Recent Developments in Macroeconomics for helpful comments and discussions.

Privateering produces two countervailing effects: it increases the offensive value of patents, whereas it decreases their defensive value and lowers the aggregate surplus of producing firms.

The model fully integrates the unique economic, institutional and social features of Singapore related to the ownership and usage of a passenger vehicle into consideration. Assuming current technologies and no change in the regulatory and policy framework, it is found that BEV is already economically competitive in certain niche markets of Singapore, such as small and midsize vehicles for car-sharing and corporate uses. In the near future, with technological progress, BEVs will become competitive in most parts of the Singapore passenger vehicle market, including small vehicles for household and small and midsize vehicles for car-sharing, corporate and taxi uses. However, certain supportive policies are called for, based on policy simulation results, to effectively accelerate the adoption of BEVs. Evidence also shows that supports should be given to the development of charging infrastructure at an early stage of BEV adoption.","[Li, Yanfei] Econ Res Inst ASEAN & East Asia ERIA, Sentral Senayan 2,6th Floor,Jalan Asia Afrika 8, Gelora Bung Karno 10270, Senayan Jakarta, Indonesia; [Kochhan, Robert] TUM CREATE Ltd, 1 Creat Way,10-02 CREATE Tower, Singapore 138602, Singapore",Economic Research Institute ASEAN & East Asia,"Li, YF (通讯作者)，Econ Res Inst ASEAN & East Asia ERIA, Sentral Senayan 2,6th Floor,Jalan Asia Afrika 8, Gelora Bung Karno 10270, Senayan Jakarta, Indonesia.",yanfei.li@eria.org; robert.kochhan@tum-create.edu.sg,"Li, Yanfei/IQT-6663-2023",,Singapore National Research Foundation,"Singapore National Research Foundation(National Research Foundation, Singapore)","The research was in collaboration with Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (CREATE), a programme financially supported by the Singapore National Research Foundation.

Moreover, abundance of various promotional techniques makes consumers indifferent to many companies' efforts. On the other hand, organizations are allocating tremendous parts of their budgets to create advertisements which sometimes remain unnoticed or do not stimulate consumer purchase intentions. Therefore, a wide body of scientific re-search on advertising effectiveness has emerged in recent years. Many aspects of advertising have been analysed, e.g. the effectiveness of advertising spokesperson, appeal, layout, etc. However, the research on advertising colour temperature and its impact on advertising effectiveness is still scarce. Purpose of the article: Considering the intensifying competition in the retail sector, creating attractive and stimulating advertisements becomes an important task for many organizations. The aim of this research is to determine the impact of the colour temperature used in advertisements on consumer purchase intentions. Methods: In order to determine the impact of advertising colour temperature on consumer purchase intentions, a questionnaire survey was provided. The questionnaire was elaborated based on the analysis and synthesis of scientific literature. Findings & Value added: The theoretical analysis substantiated the different influence of colours and colour temperature on consumer perception.

Our documentation is based on a dataset of 13.2 billion blog posts published on Sina Weibo--the most prominent Chinese microblogging platform--during the 2009-2013 period. Our primary finding is that a shockingly large number of posts on highly sensitive topics were published and circulated on social media. For instance, we find millions of posts discussing protests, and these posts are informative in predicting the occurrence of specific events. We find an even larger number of posts with explicit corruption allegations, and that these posts predict future corruption charges of specific individuals. Our findings challenge a popular view that an authoritarian regime would relentlessly censor or even ban social media.

Consumers with heterogeneous preferences choose between non-green and certified green products, while producers with heterogeneous production costs decide whether to engage in green production. In order for green products to be recognized by consumers, producers must join a green club. Key findings are summarized as follows. (i) The number of green producers, environmental standard, and overall welfare under the market solution are all socially sub-optimal. (ii) The introduction of a subsidy policy for greener production and standards is shown to increase social welfare, but is not Pareto optimal. (iii) A dual policy, which combines abatement subsidizes for a greener production standard and a tax charge for green certification, is shown to be the Pareto-optimal outcome.","[Walter, Jason] Univ Wisconsin Stout, Dept Social Sci, Harvey Hall 441B, Menomonie, WI 54751 USA; [Chang, Yang-Ming] Kansas State Univ, Dept Econ, 319 Waters Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Stout; Kansas State University,"Chang, YM (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Dept Econ, 319 Waters Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",walterja@uwstout.edu; ymchang@ksu.edu,,"Walter, Jason/0000-0003-0170-2621",,,,,41,16,16,2,39,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

I first develop a model in which consumers are heterogeneous in their valuations of product attributes and firms offer goods of heterogeneous attribute levels. With international trade in the presence of cross-country taste differences, consumption is home-biased in the immediate aftermath of liberalization. Once industries specialize, the volume of trade grows and so do the gains from liberalization. In the long-run equilibrium with open markets, the volume of trade is diminished by the existence of cross-country taste differences only if countries specialize completely. I then show that the adaptation of industrial composition to the demand structure of the European common market was associated with growing within-European trade in the automotive industry.

It proposes a framework for assessing the interconnectedness of debt dynamics, in particular deleveraging in the household and in the non-financial corporate sectors, using instrumental techniques for a panel of 36 mostly OECD countries, from 1981 to 2015. Households' debt developments are positively associated with non-financial corporations' debt dynamics for the whole sample. Conversely, corporate debt has a positive influence on household debt and in particular during deleveraging episodes and in relatively labour-intensive countries.

This process of direct competition simultaneously determines both the expected match output and workers' effective bargaining power. The framework delivers a unified aggregate production and matching technology, and firms are paid both productivity rents and matching rents. Both the curvature of the endogenous production technology and the distribution of output between workers and firms are influenced by properties of the underlying firm productivity distribution, particularly the tail index (a measure of tail fatness). For example, if the firm productivity distribution is Pareto, the labor share is decreasing in its tail index if the value of matching rents is not too high. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

When expressing their preferences over allocations in stylized, hypothetical scenarios meant to isolate key features of the tax problem, a large share of respondents resist the full equalization of unequal outcomes due to innate brute luck that standard analyses recommend. A similar share prefer a classical benefit-based logic for taxes over the conventional logic of diminishing marginal social welfare. Moreover, these two views are linked: respondents who more strongly resist equalization are more likely to prefer the classical benefit-based principle. Though the Amazon Mechanical Turk survey population is not a representative sample of the U.S. population, robustness of these results across demographic traits and political views suggests that a large share of the American public holds views inconsistent with standard welfarist objectives.

The paper makes two contributions. One is to provide a deeper understanding of the relationship between political institutions and economic efficiency by studying the endogenous interaction between the form of government and trade policy. The paper's second contribution is to show how a dictatorship can manipulate trade policy to maintain its grip on power in the face of permanent world price shocks, thus opening the door to a re-examination of trade policy responses to technology shocks. The model is used to explain an interesting episode of trade policymaking between 1815 and 1846, during which time Britain substantially liberalized trade while Prussia, on the other side of the grain market, significantly increased protectionism.

Here, the UN Human Development Index is analysed for correlation and causation with economic and resource parameters using novel quantitative techniques. Global datasets at national resolution are used to explore correlation and causation with the HDI. The whole HDI is not correlated to national totals of wealth or resource use, but is strongly correlated to personal wealth and resource use. The multi-spatial convergence cross mapping method is adapted to shed light on causation in this system. It is shown that the HDI is tightly linked to the economy and to personal resource use. Analysis of the HDI sub-indices reveals subtleties easily overlooked. For example, it is shown that access to water and electricity strongly influence GNI. It is shown that simple resource accumulation/exploitation is less important in determining HDI growth than personal wealth and access to resources. That is, equitable distribution is more effective than gross accumulation in influencing the HDI. Strong feedback means that investments in water treatment and distribution networks, for example, will have strong effects on HDI change, a conclusion that may play an important role in national developmental policy debate.","[Susnik, Janez; van der Zaag, Pieter] IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Integrated Water Syst & Governance Dept, Delft, Netherlands",IHE Delft Institute for Water Education,"Susnik, J (通讯作者)，IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Integrated Water Syst & Governance Dept, Delft, Netherlands.",j.susnik@un-ihe.org,"van der Zaag, Pieter/B-8247-2008; Susnik, Janez/T-6303-2017","van der Zaag, Pieter/0000-0002-1215-2656; Susnik, Janez/0000-0002-8814-0168",,,,,27,18,22,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Market clearing takes place through a tatonnement process which yields the equilibrium price, while traded quantities are determined by means of an assortative matching process. Contagion occurs through liquidity hoarding, interbank interlinkages and fire sale externalities. The resulting network configuration exhibits a core-periphery structure, dis-assortative behavior and low density. Within this framework we analyze the effects of a stylized set of prudential policies on the stability/efficiency trade-off. Liquidity requirements unequivocally decrease systemic risk, but at the cost of lower efficiency (measured by aggregate investment in non-liquid assets). Equity requirements also tend to reduce risk (hence increase stability), though without reducing significantly overall investment. On this basis, our results provide general support for the Basel III approach based on complementary regulatory metrics. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

I build an adverse selection model that predicts the existence of a separating equilibrium where lenders are able to achieve higher profits by simultaneously offering a rigid and a flexible repayment schedule, instead of just a rigid contract. Lab-in-the field games with Indian microentrepreneurs confirm the model predictions. I offer subjects both a flexible and a rigid repayment schedule and exogenously vary the price of the flexible schedule. I find that high-revenues borrowers are more likely to take up the flexible schedule than low-revenues ones, and even more so when the flexible schedule is more expensive than the rigid one. Risk-averse borrowers, on the contrary, are more likely to stick to the rigid contract when this is cheaper than the flexible contract. The paper thus indicates that lenders should offer a menu of contracts where the flexible and the rigid contract are provided simultaneously, at different prices. Back-of-the-envelope calculations indeed suggest that this mixed contract is more profitable than the standard, rigid microfinance contract. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Applying methods from the tax and transfer progressivity literature, we use the departure from per capita income proportionality at the zip code level as our measure of progressivity. Our findings indicate that premiums as a percentage of coverage purchased are regressive: premium shares are larger than income shares for lower-income zip codes. Payouts, however, also as a percentage of coverage purchased, are progressive, meaning lower-income zip codes receive a larger portion of claims paid. Overall net premiums (premiums -payouts) divided by coverage are also regressive. Our findings are driven by certain aspects of the current rate structure of the NFIP, as well as how income is related to risk.

Those with higher levels of creatine (proxied by urine creatinine) prior to labour market entry spend more time in the labour market in the subsequent two decades and earn more. The associations between creatine and labour market outcomes are robust to controlling for other biomarkers, educational attainment and parental background. Creatine is a naturally occurring nitrogenous organic acid which supplies energy to body cells, including muscles. Our findings are consistent with high energy levels, induced by creatine, leading to productivity-enhancing traits such as a high propensity for effort, perseverance, and high-commitment.

The paper advances current research on the monetary transmission mechanism in the following ways: Firstly, we analyze the differences between 'old' Economic Monetary Union (EMU) and 'new' EU countries. Secondly, we examine the key bank characteristics and monetary policy indicators that may have an impact on the bank lending channel. We assume that short-term market interest rates and monetary aggregate M2 affect banks' activities. We apply the generalized method of moments (GMM) with pooled data from 1999 to 2012. We show that in the pre-crisis period the effect of changing the short-term market interest rates on the bank lending channel of monetary policy is more pronounced among 'old' EMU countries, whereas the effect of M2 is significant during the period of the global financial crisis (GFC) among 'old' EMU countries.

We explore the effect of home-ownership on unemployment exploiting a rental housing market deregulation reform which created exogenous variation in home-ownership across regions, allowing us to avoid the endogeneity problem in earlier studies. While home-owners are less likely to experience unemployment, an increase in the home-ownership rate causes unemployment to rise.

This property is particularly important for trade policies, where tariff reductions span over decades. Nevertheless, intertemporal CGE models are dimensionally large and computationally difficult to solve, thus hindering their development, save for those that are scaled-down to only a few regions and commodities. Using a recently developed solution method, we address this problem by building an intertemporal version of a GTAP model that is large in dimension and can be easily scaled to focus to any subset of GTAP countries or regions, without the need for 'second best' recursive approaches. Specifically, we solve using a new parallel-processing technique and matrix reordering procedure, and employ a non-steady state baseline scenario. This provides an effective tool for the dynamic analysis of trade policies. As an application of the model, we simulate a free trade scenario for Vietnam with a focus on the recent Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Our simulation shows that Vietnam gains considerably from the TPP, with 60 of the gains realised within the first 10 years despite our assumption of a gradual and linear removal of trade barriers. We also solve for intertemporal and sector-specific effects on each industry in Vietnam from the trade agreements, showing an added advantage of our approach compared to standard static and recursive GTAP models.","[Pham Van Ha; Kompas, Tom; Hoa Thi Minh Nguyen; Chu Hoang Long] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Crawford Bldg 132, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Kompas, Tom] Univ Melbourne, Ctr Excellence Biosecur Risk Anal, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",Australian National University; University of Melbourne,"Kompas, T (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Ctr Excellence Biosecur Risk Anal, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",ha.pham@anu.edu.au; torn.kompas@anu.edu.au; hoa.nguyen@anu.edu.au; Long.Chu@anu.edu.au,"Kompas, Tom/M-8851-2019; Nguyen, Hoa-Thi-Minh/E-7491-2012","Kompas, Tom/0000-0002-0665-0966; Chu, Long/0000-0002-2954-0575; Pham, Van Ha/0000-0002-5927-6568",'Restructuring for a More Competitive Vietnam Project' at the Australian National University; College of Asia and the Pacific at the Australian National University,'Restructuring for a More Competitive Vietnam Project' at the Australian National University; College of Asia and the Pacific at the Australian National University,"The computations in this paper have been carried out with the help of Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (PETSc) 3.6.2 at Argonne National Laboratory (Balay et al., 1997, 2014, 2013); Message Passing Interface (MPICH) 3.1.4; HSL Mathematical Software Library (HSL, 2013); and the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) 5.2.1.

Given limited commitment and asymmetric information, financial contracts specify default, renegotiation and reorganization policies. Renegotiation entails a redistribution of social surplus, while reorganization takes the form of enhanced creditor monitoring. Firms with better contract histories are less likely to default, but, contingent on default, firms with better outside options successfully renegotiate, in line with the empirical evidence. Unless monitoring is too costly, renegotiation leads to reorganization, which resembles actual bankruptcy practice. We calibrate the model to match certain aspects of the data on bankruptcy and firm dynamics in the U.S. Our counterfactual experiments suggest that poorly designed bankruptcy arrangements can increase substantially the fraction of firms facing financial constraints, with sizable negative implications for aggregate output and TFP.

The government observes the private shock, but foreign investors do not. The government then uses debt repayment and default settlement as costly signals of the private shock. The signaling mechanism generates an endogenous cost of default. Furthermore, the combination of the public shock and the private shock loosens the relationship between default cycles and output in equilibrium: defaults can happen when output is above trend, and settlements can happen when output is below trend, as seen in data. The model also predicts a correlation between default cycles and foreign investment, as well as countercyclical sovereign spreads and trade balance, which are consistent with data.

The solution of the theoretical model along the balanced growth path suggests that in general equilibrium the level of innovative activity depends on the growth rate of energy generation cost.

Their contribution may alternatively be interpreted as a theory for preventing these bank runs. Absent aggregate risk over liquidity demand, they show that a simple scheme that suspends withdrawls when a target level of bank reserves is reached implements the efficient allocation as the unique equilibrium. Uniqueness implies that there cannot be a bank-run equilibrium. Unfortunately, this scheme cannot implement the efficient allocation when there is aggregate uncertainty over every possible liquidity demand because any realization of liquidity demand may, in this case, be determined by fundamentals instead of psychology. When there is aggregate risk, Peck and Shell (2003) demonstrate that the constrained efficient allocation can be implemented by a direct mechanism as an equilibrium. They show that the same mechanism can also implement a bank-run equilibrium, which suggests that Diamond and Dybvig (1983) can be understood as a theory of bank runs. The use of direct mechanisms, however, imposes a severe restriction on communications. We propose an indirect mechanism that (i) permits depositors to communicate their beliefs, not just their types, (ii) incentivizes depositors to communicate rumors of an impending bank run, and (iii) threatens to suspend payments conditional on what is revealed in these communications. We demonstrate that if commitment is possible, then under some weak parameter restrictions our indirect mechanism uniquely implements an allocation that can be made arbitrarily close to the the constrained efficient allocation as an equilibrium. In other words, our mechanism prevents bank runs.","[Andolfatto, David] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Res Dept, St Louis, MO 63102 USA; [Andolfatto, David] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, Burnaby, BC, Canada; [Nosal, Ed] Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Res Dept, Chicago, IL USA; [Sultanum, Bruno] Fed Reserve Bank Richmond, Res Dept, Richmond, VA USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; Simon Fraser University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Chicago; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Richmond,"Andolfatto, D (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Res Dept, St Louis, MO 63102 USA.",David.Andolfatto@stls.frb.org; ed.nosal@gmail.com; bruno@sultanum.com,"Andolfatto, David/I-5738-2016","Andolfatto, David/0000-0003-0703-3967; Sultanum, Bruno/0000-0002-5469-383X",Social Sciences and Humanities Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"Any opinions or views expressed in this article are not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago, Richmond, or St. Louis, or of the Federal Reserve System.

We consider two sources of imperfect information: counterfeit coins and clipping. With counterfeits, coin assaying reduces the extent of inefficiencies associated with imperfect recognizability of coins (namely lower traded quantities and lower trading frequencies). Yet coin assaying does not necessarily increase welfare, because it unmasks counterfeits that then trade at a discount, reducing total output. With clipping, we show that agents clip for two reasons: in the hope of passing an inferior coin for a superior one, and to reduce the purchasing power of coins that are too valuable.

Morris argues that the predominant value systems of human societies are cultural adaptations to the organizational structures of the societies themselves, their institutions, and ultimately to their modes of production. In particular, the book contains a careful analysis of how the hunting-gathering mode of production induces egalitarian values and relatively favorable attitudes toward violent resolution of conflicts, while farming induces hierarchical values and less favorable attitudes toward violence, and in turn the fossil fuel (that is, industrial) mode of production induces egalitarian values and nonviolent attitudes. The narrative in the book is rich, diverse, and ultimately entertaining. Morris's analysis is very knowledgeable and informative: arguments and evidence are rooted in history, anthropology, archeology, and social sciences in general. Nonetheless, the analysis falls short of being convincing about the causal nature of the existing relationship between modes of production and moral value systems.","[Bisin, Alberto] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",New York University,"Bisin, A (通讯作者)，NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA.",,,,,,,,44,3,3,0,6,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

The experience of countries like India, which is investing in the services sector, and failures of industrialization in Africa and Latin America have led to scepticism about the effectiveness of manufacturing to foster development. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, with the use of GMM techniques to treat the endogeneity bias and a sample of 80 countries for the period 1980-2010, the paper provides new evidence supporting the role of the manufacturing sector as an engine of growth. Second, the paper investigates which fuel is best for the engine. By applying a LMDI (Log Mean Divisia Index) technique, we decompose the manufacturing sector's growth rate into components of structural transformation and employment scale. Whereas structural transformation refers to an increase of manufacturing value added based on drivers that strengthen manufacturing industries (in terms of manufacturing productivity and manufacturing labour share), the employment scale component refers to an increase of manufacturing value added based on a driver (total employment) that does not promote a transition in which the manufacturing sector assumes a leading role. We find that structural transformation rather than employment scale effects enhances economic growth and that not every dollar for additional industrialization matters for development.

The present paper argues that the author overlooked the implicit requirement of using a consistent product classification, leading to overestimation of the new goods margin. After replicating Dalton's results and recalculating the trade share of the new goods margin using a consistent product classification, this paper shows the magnitude of the overestimation (up to 20 or 30 decimal points of the trade share).","[del Rosal, Ignacio] Univ Oviedo, Dept Appl Econ, Ave Cristo Sn, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain",University of Oviedo,"del Rosal, I (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Dept Appl Econ, Ave Cristo Sn, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain.",irosal@uniovi.es,"Del Rosal, Ignacio/AAH-5353-2019","Del Rosal, Ignacio/0000-0002-3047-398X","Consejeria de Educacion, Cultura y Deporte del Principado de Asturias","Consejeria de Educacion, Cultura y Deporte del Principado de Asturias","Financial support from the Consejeria de Educacion, Cultura y Deporte del Principado de Asturias is acknowledged.",,5,2,2,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

J,"del Valle, A; Dueñas, P; Wogrin, S; Reneses, J",,,,"del Valle, Aurora; Duenas, Pablo; Wogrin, Sonja; Reneses, Javier",,,A fundamental analysis on the implementation and development of virtual natural gas hubs,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Natural gas virtual hubs; Market liberalization; Entry-exit access system; Mathematical modeling,MARKET; COMPETITION; EUROPE; POWER,"The ongoing gas market liberalization in Europe has brought up a new competitive environment in which shippers (i.e., companies that are responsible for conveying gas from producers to consumers) must adapt their behavior to the changing conditions. The development of gas virtual hubs increases market interactions among shippers, but the oligopolistic market structure may give room for strategic behavior. The market is in addition segmented by type of costumer. Each shipper maximizes its profit by supplying gas to households, businesses and industries (conventional costumers), participating in the electricity market, trading in the global LNG spot market and interacting with the rest of shippers in a virtual hub. During the hub implementation and development, the following questions arise: How do shippers behave at the different levels of hub maturity? And, to what extent does the implementation of virtual hubs in entry-exit systems diminish the barriers to entry of new market players, provides more flexibility and fosters competition? With this aim, the decision-making process of the different shippers is simulated under different market structures, representing four stages of the market liberalization process at different levels of hub maturity. First, the proto-liberalization case includes the global LNG spot market which is represented as a perfectly competitive market, the electricity market which is represented as an oligopoly, and the conventional demand which is assumed to be captive (i.e., monopolized). Second, a hub is implemented, which provides transparency and reduces information costs by revealing the gas price. Third, switching rates are expected to grow as consumers have access to a transparent gas price; hence, the conventional demand is no longer considered as captive. Fourth, wholesale (procurement) and retail activities are unbundled, and a wholesale market is established where the retailers presumably buy gas from the shippers; thereby wholesale and retail activities acquire importance and market transactions (i.e., liquidity) increase. From the simulation and the analysis of the different market equilibria, the following conclusions emerge. First, with the introduction of the virtual hub, the marginal cost of all shippers reaches a unique value, i.e., the transparent gas hub price. Second, the aggregated profit of the shippers is increasing even when anticompetitive behavior is not explicitly represented, due to the flexibility gained by shippers with the hub.

In this economy the unique equilibrium satisfies lexicographic maximization. We show that relaxing the assumptions on consumption sets and preferences slightly, allocations other than lexicographic maximizers can be jungle equilibria. We attribute this result to single unilateral taking where a stronger agent takes goods from only one weaker agent. Once multiple unilateral takings are introduced, we show that jungle equilibria coincide with lexicographic maximization under weak assumptions. However, we also present examples of equilibria that are Pareto inefficient, where voluntary gift giving by stronger agents is needed to achieve Pareto efficiency and even voluntary trade has a role in the jungle.","[Houba, Harold] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Tinbergen Inst, Dept Econometr, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Luttens, Roland Iwan] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Univ Coll, Dept Econ, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Weikard, Hans-Peter] Wageningen Univ, Wageningen Sch Social Sci, Postbox 8130, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Wageningen University & Research,"Luttens, RI (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Univ Coll, Dept Econ, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",harold.houba@vu.nl; r.i.luttens@vu.nl; hans-peter.weikard@wur.nl,"Weikard, Hans-Peter/O-1120-2013","Weikard, Hans-Peter/0000-0002-5209-9845; Houba, Harold/0000-0001-9085-7339; Luttens, Roland Iwan/0000-0001-5316-8956",,,,,4,1,1,0,7,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,1434-4750,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

The resource price is modelled as a regime switching process, which is calibrated to oil futures prices. A Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is specified that describes the profit maximization decision of the firm. The model is applied to a problem of optimal investment in a typical oils sands in situ operation, and solved for critical levels of oil prices that would motivate a firm to make the large scale investment needed for oil sands extraction, as well as to operate, mothball or abandon the facility. Regime shifts can have an important effect on the optimal timing of investment and extraction.

Based on Helpman et al. (Econometrica 78:1239-1283, 2010), I raise the concern that if the probability of displacing workers by imports depends on their wage level, job destruction is likely to reduce the negative effects of import competition on average industry wage. To connect Helpman, Itskhoki, and Redding to my empirical analysis, I focus on variations in workers' residual wages obtained from estimating the Mincerian wage equation. This is because Helpman, Itskhoki, and Redding focus on the wage distribution of workers with the same observed characteristics. I find that the lower the job destruction is than average, the more significant and sizeable the negative effect of import competition on the average residual wage, while the effect of import competition on the average residual wage is positive but insignificant at the 10% level at maximum job destruction. The robustness checks support this evidence. The findings imply that unemployment by increased imports leads to underestimating workers' anxiety about the negative wage effects of imports.","[Kang, Youngho] Soongsil Univ, Dept Econ, Sangdo Ro 369, Seoul 156743, South Korea",Soongsil University,"Kang, Y (通讯作者)，Soongsil Univ, Dept Econ, Sangdo Ro 369, Seoul 156743, South Korea.",yhkang@ssu.ac.kr,,,,,,,24,2,2,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

The results indicate that the urban labor market experienced a direct effect in terms of a reduction in employment of the group vulnerable to the epidemic while the rural labor market experienced an indirect effect on its economy through a reduction in employment resulting from a decline in consumption and leisure activities. If one looks into the employment in the accommodation and leisure industry, which sustained the most severe blow, dropped to its lowest level right after the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak. The rural leisure and accommodation industries are highly likely to be dependent on consumption and spending from urban areas. The results suggest that the rural labor market was influenced by the spillover/external effects caused by behavioral changes among people in urban areas due to fear of infection. Thus, this empirical analysis can be used to customize policy to support regions that can be negatively impacted by spillovers due to epidemic in order to respond against economic stresses.

Switching from dirty to clean innovation leads to ongoing reductions in the relative costs of producing clean investment goods, making them ever cheaper to purchase and so encouraging clean investment. At the same time, falling replacement costs imply falling asset values. Consequently, continuing innovation in capital-embodied clean technologies also generates obsolescence costs, which are borne by users of clean capital. The negative effect of obsolescence costs on demand for clean investment and consequently on the speed of transition to clean growth has been neglected in the literature on directed technical change. We show theoretically and using numerical simulations that optimal policies differ in our model of embodied technological change, relative to an otherwise comparable model of disembodied technological change. With embodied technologies: (i) optimal emissions taxes start higher and rise faster; (ii) much higher clean research and development subsidies are required to effect the switch to clean innovation; and (iii) climate damages under optimal policies are greater. We suggest that more attention should be paid to the role of obsolescence costs in modelling transitional effects of climate policies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Here we derive and compare two large-sample methods for obtaining such intervals. They both require good distribution-free estimates of the quantile density at the quantiles of interest, and such estimates have recently become available. Simulation studies for various sample sizes are carried out for Pareto, lognormal and exponential distributions, as well as fitted generalized lambda distributions, to determine the coverage probabilities and widths of the intervals. Robustness of the estimators to contamination or a positive proportion of zero incomes is examined via influence functions and simulations. The motivating example is Australian household income data where ratios of quantiles measure inequality, but of course these results apply equally to data from other countries.","[Prendergast, Luke A.; Staudte, Robert G.] La Trobe Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia",La Trobe University,"Staudte, RG (通讯作者)，La Trobe Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia.",luke.prendergast@latrobe.edu.au; r.staudte@latrobe.edu.au,"Prendergast, Luke A/G-8376-2011; , Robert/HTQ-1071-2023; , Robert Staudte/GYV-1793-2022","Prendergast, Luke A/0000-0002-9122-5429; staudte, robert/0000-0003-1281-7387",,,,,28,4,4,1,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

This experimental field study analyzes the gambling behavior of 917 casino customers who face real losses. We find that customers who received free play at the entrance showed not higher but significantly lower levels of risk-taking behavior during their casino visit, expressed through lower average wagers. This study thus provides field evidence against the house money effect. Moreover, as a result of lower levels of risk seeking, endowed customers yield better economic results in the form of smaller own-money losses when leaving the casino.","[Rudisser, Maximilian; Flepp, Raphael; Franck, Egon] Univ Zurich, Affolternstr 56, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Rüdisser, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Affolternstr 56, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland.",maximilian.ruedisser@business.uzh.ch,,,,,,,36,13,14,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

This review essay reconsiders that legacy and places it in the context within which it developed. While the early generations of scholars who founded the economics profession in the United States and trained in its departments did indeed hold and express retrograde views on those subjects, those views were common to a broad swath of the intellectual elite of that era, including the progressives' staunchest opponents inside and outside academia. Moreover, Leonard anachronistically intermingles a contemporary critique of early-twentieth-century progressive economics and the progressive movement writ large, serving to decontextualize those disputes-a flaw that is amplified by the book's unsystematic approach to reconstructing the views and writing it attacks. Notwithstanding the history Leonard presents, economists working now nonetheless owe their progressive forebears for contributions that have become newly relevant: the credibility revolution, the influence of economic research on policy and program design, the prestige of economists working in and providing advice to government agencies and policy makers, and the academic freedom economists enjoy in modern research-oriented universities are all a part of that legacy.","[Steinbaum, Marshall I.] Roosevelt Inst, New York, NY 10022 USA",,"Steinbaum, MI (通讯作者)，Roosevelt Inst, New York, NY 10022 USA.",,,,,,,,28,8,8,0,3,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

In this paper, an instance-based learning (IBL) model that can capture the recency, hot stove and payoff variability effects embedded in travelers' day-today learning processes is developed for route-choice based on the power law of forgetting and practice. Experiments based on synthetic datasets show that the true parameter values of the IBL model can be consistently retrieved and the model can potentially predict different traffic patterns compared to non-learning models. The IBL model is compared with a baseline learning model using an experimental dataset of repeated route-choice. Estimation results show that the IBL model reveals higher sensitivity to perceived travel time and achieves better model fit. Cross validation experiments suggest that the forecasting ability of the IBL model is consistently better than the baseline learning model. Practical considerations for choice modeling are further discussed.","[Tang, Yue] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 139 Marston Hall, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Gao, Song] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 214C Marston Hall, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Ben-Elia, Eran] Univ Negev, Dept Geog & Environm Dev Ben Gurion, POB 653, IL-8410501 Beer Sheva, Israel",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Ben Gurion University,"Gao, S (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 214C Marston Hall, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",yuet@umass.edu; sgao@umass.edu; benelia@bgu.ac.il,"Ben-Elia, Eran/R-8312-2019","Ben-Elia, Eran/0000-0002-4169-7129",,,,,61,10,12,0,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

To test this conjecture, the real GDP growth rate is regressed on the interaction terms between measures of central bank characteristics and the proxy for macroeconomic uncertainty, i.e. stock market volatility. To address potential endogeneity concerns, stock market volatility is instrumented in a Two Stage Least Squares model by plausibly exogenous natural disaster, terrorist attack, political coup and revolution shocks. The estimation results provide strong evidence that central bank independence reduces the adverse effect of uncertainty shocks. There is also evidence for the moderating impact of transparency. However, due to the limited availability of transparency data, the result is less conclusive.","[Yildinm-Karaman, Secil] Istanbul Kemerburgaz Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey",Altinbas University,"Yildinm-Karaman, S (通讯作者)，Istanbul Kemerburgaz Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey.",secil.yildirim@kemerburgaz.edu.tr,"Yıldırım, Seçil/AAA-6894-2022",,,,,,36,8,8,1,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0939-3625,1878-5433,,ECON SYST,Econ.

Using hourly wholesale market data from 2008 to 2014, we find that firms exercise substantial market power in the highest demand hours with limited excess production capacity. The degree of market power execution in all other hours is low. Market inefficiencies are larger in the high demand hours and elevate production costs by 6.7%-19% above the competitive benchmark, with an average of 13%. This reflects 2.1% of the average market price across all hours. A recent regulatory policy clarifies that certain types of unilateral market power execution is permitted in Alberta. We find evidence that suggests that strategic behaviour changed after this announcement. Market power execution increased. We illustrate that the observed earnings are often sufficient to promote investment in natural gas based technologies. The rents from market power execution can exceed the estimated capacity costs for certain generation technologies. However, we demonstrate that the energy market profits in the presence of no market power execution are generally insufficient to promote investment in new generation capacity. This stresses the importance of considering both short-run and long-run electricity market performance measures.","[Brown, David P.] Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2M7, Canada; [Olmstead, Derek E.

Potential members cannot ascertain precisely beforehand their quality (dependent endogenously on the club's facility investment and number of users, itself dependent on its prices). Members with unsatisfactory initial experiences discontinue visits. We show that a monopoly profit maximizer never offers a free trial period for such goods. For quality functions homogeneous of degree of at least minus one, a welfare maximizer, motivated by distributional concerns to mitigate disappointed consumers' losses, always does. We demonstrate the robustness of this finding by showing that (i) without qualitative uncertainty (thus, no disappointed customers), neither welfarist nor monopolist offers free trials; and (ii) if the planner pursues an objective mixing welfare maximization with profit maximization, the likelihood of free trials increases with the weight put on welfare maximization. Regarding club quality and usage, the monopolist provides a socially excessive level of quality to repeat buyers when the quality function is homogeneous of degree zero.

On average, all types of happiness are preferred to other attributes except health.

These agents may acquire information prior to choosing an investment that has a property of no-arbitrage, and each piece of information bears a corresponding cost. We associate a numeric index to each information purchase (information-cost pair). This index describes the normalized value of the information purchase: it is the risk-aversion level of the unique CARA agent who is indifferent between accepting and rejecting the purchase, and it is characterized by a duality principle that states that agents with a stronger preference for information should engage more often in information purchases. No agent more risk-averse than the index finds it profitable to acquire the information, whereas all agents less risk-averse than the index do. Given an empirically measured range of degrees of risk aversion in a competitive economy with no-arbitrage investments, our model therefore comes close to describing an inverse demand for information, by predicting what pieces of information are acquired by agents and which ones are not. Among several desirable properties, the normalized-value formula induces a complete ranking of information structures that extends Blackwell's classic ordering. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

J,"Cesaratto, S",,,,"Cesaratto, Sergio",,,Alternative interpretations of a stateless currency crisis,CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,European crisis; Political and currency unions; ECB; Balance-of-payments crisis; Mercantilism,PAYMENTS; BALANCE; AREA,"A number of economists warned that a political union was a prerequisite for a viable currency union. This paper disputes the feasibility of such a political union. A fully fledged federal union, which would likely please peripheral Europe, is impracticable since it implies a degree of fiscal solidarity that does not exist. A Hayekian minimal federal state, which would appeal to core Europe, would be refused by peripheral members, since residual fiscal sovereignty would be surrendered without any clear positive economic and social return. Even an intermediate solution based on coordinated Keynesian policies would be unfeasible, since it would be at odds with German 'monetary mercantilism'. The euro area is thus trapped between equally unfeasible political perspectives. In this bleak context, austerity policies are mainly explained by the necessity to readdress the euro area balance-of-payments crisis. This crisis presents striking similarities to traditional financial crises in emerging economies associated with fixed exchange regimes. Therefore, the delayed response of the European Central Bank (ECB) to the sovereign debt crisis cannot be seen as the culprit of the euro area crisis. The ECB's monetary refinancing mechanisms, Target 2 and the ECB's belated Outright Monetary Transactions intervention impeded a blow-up of the currency union, but could not solve its deep causes. The current combination of austerity policies and moderate ECB intervention aims to rebalance intra-eurozone foreign accounts and to force competitive deflation strategy.","[Cesaratto, Sergio] Univ Siena, Siena, Italy",University of Siena,"Cesaratto, S (通讯作者)，Piazza San Francesco 7, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",Cesaratto@unisi.it,"Cesaratto, Sergio/JEF-9123-2023",,,,,,97,14,14,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The model is based on the present value restriction that links a country's external position to future trade flows and financial conditions in the absence of arbitrage opportunities and Ponzi schemes. It features the role played by the stochastic discount factor, the trade and valuation adjustment channels and provides a decomposition of the U.S. external position into secular and cyclical components. The model shows that shocks operating via the valuation channel are the dominant drivers of cyclical dynamics, accounting for approximately 80% of the variance over the 60-year sample. This channel works primarily via capital gains and losses on U.S. foreign assets and is closely tied to the international value of the U.S. dollar. In contrast, there is no evidence that valuation channel adjustments contribute to the secular dynamics, but differences between the average returns on foreign assets and liabilities raise the steady-state debt-to-GDP ratio from approximately 12 to 15%. The long-term deterioration in the U.S. position represents a move towards the steady-state before the early 1990s and a move away from the steady-state thereafter. I quantify the expected improvement in future U.S. trade balances needed to justify this as a sustainable path and show that they are very different from its actual behavior during the last 60 years. I also study the behavior of the U.S. position during the 2007-2008 financial crisis. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Evans, Martin D.

First, it considers a frequency domain expression for the Kullback-Leibler distance between two DSGE models and shows that global identification fails if and only if the minimized distance equals 0. This result has three features: (1) it can be applied across DSGE models with different structures; (2) it permits checking whether a subset of frequencies can deliver identification; (3) it delivers parameter values that yield observational equivalence if there is identification failure. Next, the article proposes a measure for the empirical closeness between two DSGE models for a further understanding of the strength of identification. The measure gauges the feasibility of distinguishing one model from another based on a finite number of observations generated by the two models. It is shown to represent the highest possible power under Gaussianity when considering local alternatives. The above theory is illustrated using two small-scale and one medium-scale DSGE models. The results document that certain parameters can be identified under indeterminacy but not determinacy, that different monetary policy rules can be (nearly) observationally equivalent, and that identification properties can differ substantially between small and medium-scale models. For implementation, two procedures are developed and made available, both of which can be used to obtain and thus to cross validate the findings reported in the empirical applications. Although the article focuses on DSGE models, the results are also applicable to other vector linear processes with well-defined spectra, such as the (factor-augmented) vector autoregression.","[Qu, Zhongjun] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Tkachenko, Denis] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore",Boston University; National University of Singapore,"Qu, ZJ (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",,"Tkachenko, Denis/AAV-1036-2020; Malyutina, Tatiana/AAF-5268-2019","Tkachenko, Denis/0000-0002-0255-5152; Malyutina, Tatiana/0000-0002-0144-6464",Singapore Ministry of Education AcRF Tier 1 [FY2015-FRC2-009],"Singapore Ministry of Education AcRF Tier 1(Ministry of Education, Singapore)","We are grateful to the editor Stephane Bonhomme and three anonymous referees for their stimulating comments and suggestions.

Instrumental variables estimates account for endogenous graduation timing. A single percentage point increase in regional unemployment causes an increase in the probability of overeducation of 1.6-1.7 percentage points for university graduates.

The agents face individual decision problems under uncertainty, make reversible adoption choices and interact locally, so that each agent affects only her neighbors. We find that the optimal targeting strategy depends on two parameters: (i) the likelihood of the action being more successful than its alternative and (ii) the planner's patience. More specifically, for an infinitely patient planner, the optimal strategy is to cluster all the targeted agents in one connected group when her preferred action has higher probability of being more successful than its alternative; whereas it is optimal spreading them across the population when this probability is lower. Interestingly, for an impatient planner the optimal targeting strategy is exactly the opposite. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Our results suggest that suicide rates are pro-cyclical with respect to the business cycle (measured by changes in the unemployment rate) after extensively controlling for divorce and fertility rates. Unemployment has symmetric long-run effects on the age-adjusted suicide rate and four age-specific (from ages 25-34 to 55-64) suicide rates, while the effect of an economic expansion on suicide rates for those aged over 45 is greater than the effect of an economic recession. These findings imply that the effect of an economic expansion on the decrease of the suicide rate is higher than the effect of an economic recession on the increase of the suicide rate for individuals aged over 45. Therefore, intervention designed to reduce suicidal behaviors should emphasize periods of economic recession more than periods of economic expansion for those of middle age and beyond.

Our results show that removing trade barriers not only results in higher welfare and GDP as well as lower prices due to efficiency gains, but also reduces emissions of greenhouse gases in terms of CO2 equivalent. Emissions reductions stem from changes in output composition and lower energy use, despite an offsetting increase in emissions induced by the final consumption of non-energy products due to higher income. Particularly, removing import barriers completely (i.e. full liberalization) would increase Iran's GDP by 8.9%, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in CO2 equivalents by 3%. It would generate a welfare gain of 13.2% and 9.3% for urban and rural households, respectively, suggesting that removing the trade barriers would increase the inequality between households in favour of urban and high income groups.","[Farajzadeh, Zakariya; Bakhshoodeh, Mohammad] Shiraz Univ, Coll Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Shiraz, Iran; [Zhu, Xueqin] Wageningen Univ, Environm Econ & Nat Resources Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Shiraz University; Wageningen University & Research,"Zhu, XQ (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Environm Econ & Nat Resources Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",zakariafarajzadeh@gmail.com; xueqin.zhu@wur.nl; bakhshoodeh@gmail.com,"Farajzadeh, Zakariya/W-8340-2018; Bakhshoodeh, Mohammad/Y-8112-2019; Zhu, Xueqin/K-9471-2013","Farajzadeh, Zakariya/0000-0002-5971-947X; Bakhshoodeh, Mohammad/0000-0001-8217-3535; Zhu, Xueqin/0000-0002-5772-1090",Iranian government,Iranian government,"We highly appreciate the very useful comments from the four reviewers on improving the quality of this paper.

Our study shows how the optimal tax system is affected by the weight attached to the newborn child by a social planner. We obtain an unacceptable outcome for the current generation. That is, a high planner's weighting on the newborn's welfare makes the optimal capital income tax rate more regressive. In addition, the total tax burden of the highest-productivity parent is decreasing with the planner's weight. Thus, a low-productivity parent incurs a larger share of parents' welfare loss. This result follows from the trade-off between incentives for high-productivity parents and insurance for the newborn child. (C) 2017 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland.

This is certainly a matter of great concern for Romania, currently Europe's largest sender of migrants to Western Europe. Considering that the educational system should be of the uttermost priority, we addressed the issue of emigration propensity among Romanian teachers making use of data from our own nationwide survey. Bivariate logistic models were employed to identify the main factors behind the emigration decisions of pre-university teachers. Aiming to enrich the narrow economic perspective, we adopted a novelty approach by focusing on an overlooked determinant in emigration research studies, namely ethnicity in relation to nationality. Among Romania's minorities, Hungarians are the most important ethnic group, accounting for 6.1% of the population, hence we explored their migration behaviour compared to Romanian ethnics. The results from the logistic regression models indicate significant differences regarding the factors that trigger the intention to initiate the emigration process for our subjects, based on their ethnicity. We found that teachers of Hungarian ethnicity display 50.6% less propensity to emigrate compared to the ones of Romanian ethnicity and we were able to shape distinct emigration profiles for the two groups.","[Goschin, Zizi] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Stat & Econometr, Bucharest, Romania; [Haisan, Angel-Alex] 1 Decembrie 1918 Univ Alba Iulia, Fac Law & Social Sci, Alba Iulia, Romania; [Avornicului, Mihai] Babes Bolyai Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Econ & Business Adm Hungarian Language, Cluj Napoca, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; 1 Decembrie 1918 University Alba Iulia; Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Goschin, Z (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Stat & Econometr, Bucharest, Romania.",haisan-angel@hotmail.com; zizi.goschin@csie.ase.ro; mavornicului@yahoo.com,"Avornicului, Mihai-Constantin/ABC-1291-2020; Haisan, Angel-Alex/AAX-7837-2020; GOSCHIN, ZIZI/Y-1227-2019; Haisan, Angel-Alex/HNJ-4307-2023","Haisan, Angel-Alex/0000-0002-0565-405X; GOSCHIN, ZIZI/0000-0002-9030-7772; Haisan, Angel-Alex/0000-0002-0565-405X; Avornicului, Mihai-Constantin/0000-0003-1302-5357",,,,,49,1,1,0,8,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

To date, the literature has primarily focused on explaining the rapid rise in medical consumption relative to output, with only limited attention given to understanding the long-run macroeconomic implications of this trend. In this study, I modify the standard Neoclassical growth framework to include health capital accumulation, public and private health insurance, and GHH utility. After calibrating the model to match US data for the period 1996-2013, I systematically investigate the response of output, physical and health capital, medical and non-medical consumption, and household time allocation to one-time exogenous shocks to various potential determinants of medical expenditure growth. I find that a 10% increase in final goods and medical sector productivity shocks each have a positive effect on aggregate welfare. On the other hand, a 10% increase to the endogenous depreciation rate of health capital, or to either the public or the private health insurance share are all found to be welfare reducing.

Our main results identify two intuitive conditions on binary voting trees, ensuring that sincere voting at each stage forms an ex post perfect equilibrium. In particular, we uncover a strong rationale for content-based agendas: if the outcome should not be sensitive to beliefs about others, nor to the deployment of strategic skills, the agenda needs to be built from the extremes to the middle so that more extreme alternatives are both more difficult to adopt, and are put to vote before other, more moderate options. An important corollary is that, under simple majority, the equilibrium outcome of the incomplete information game is always the Condorcet winner. Finally, we aim to guide the practical design of schemes that are widely used by legislatures and committees and we illustrate our findings with several case studies.","[Kleiner, Andreas] Arizona State Univ, Dept Econ, POB 879801, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Moldovanu, Benny] Univ Bonn, Dept Econ, Lennestr 37, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of Bonn,"Kleiner, A (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Dept Econ, POB 879801, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",andreas.kleiner@asu.edu; mold@uni-bonn.de,,,German Science Foundation; European Research Council,German Science Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)),"We wish to thank Gabriel Carroll, Alex Gershkov, Sean Horan, Meg Meyer, Xianwen Shi, Alexander Westkamp, and various seminar participants for insightful comments and suggestions.

Our first key finding is that shocks to volatility with response shorter than one week are increasingly important to the transmission mechanism over the studied period. Second, demand-side shocks to volatility are becoming increasingly important in creating short-run connectedness.

This paper develops a macro-dynamic model of a small open economy with cross-border labor mobility emphasizing fiscal policy. The flow of remittances is the result of a household's optimizing decision to migrate. We examine the macroeconomic responses to fiscal policies. First, we show that an economy with international migration is more resilient to demand shocks resulting from fiscal contraction, Second, the short-run association between remittances and domestic output depends on the sources of the shocks. Third, our results indicate that the equilibrium impact of a tax on remittances can be expansionary and welfare-improving when an economy is initially close to full employment. The presence of utility-enhancing government expenditure and a potential negative externality from over-allocation of labor abroad (over migration) justify the presence of distortionary taxes.

This paper addresses the following two questions: what are the causes of such perverse consequences, and when we can effectively implement affirmative action policies without unsatisfactory outcomes. Using the minority reserve policy in the student optimal stable mechanism as an example, I show that two acyclicity conditions, type-specific acyclicity and strongly type-specific acyclicity, are crucial for the effective implementations of minority reserve policies. I further illustrate how restrictive these two acyclicity conditions are, and the intrinsic difficulty of embedding diversity goals into stable matching mechanisms. Under some regularity conditions, I demonstrate that the minority reserve policy is very unlikely to cause welfare losses on any minority students when the number of schools is sufficiently large.","[Liu, Yun] Shandong Univ, Ctr Econ Res, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China",Shandong University,"Liu, Y (通讯作者)，Shandong Univ, Ctr Econ Res, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China.",yliueco@gmail.com,,"Liu, Yun/0000-0002-0560-1804",Center for research in the Foundations of Electronic Markets (CFEM); Danish Council for Strategic Research,Center for research in the Foundations of Electronic Markets (CFEM); Danish Council for Strategic Research(Danske Strategiske Forskningsrad (DSF)),"This paper is based on Chapter 1 of my Ph.D. dissertation.

We use the idea of virtual trade in intermediates induced by non-overlapping time zones and show how trade can increase the equilibrium optimal rate of growth. In this structure the trade impact goes beyond the level effect and directly causes growth. Typically standard models of trade cannot generate an automatic growth impact. Virtual trade may allow production to continue uninterrupted in separated time zones such as between the USA and India, and that can lead to higher growth for both countries. Later we extend the model to incorporate the accumulation of skills which becomes necessary for sustaining steady state growth.","[Marjit, Sugata] CSSSC, Ctr Studies Social Sci, Kolkata, W Bengal, India; [Marjit, Sugata] CSSSC, Ctr Training & Res Publ Finance & Policy, Kolkata, India; [Mandal, Biswajit] Visva Bharati Univ, Dept Econ & Polit, Santini Ketan, W Bengal, India",Visva Bharati University,"Marjit, S (通讯作者)，CSSSC, Ctr Studies Social Sci, Kolkata, W Bengal, India.;Marjit, S (通讯作者)，CSSSC, Ctr Training & Res Publ Finance & Policy, Kolkata, India.",marjit@gmail.com,"Mandal, Biswajit/AAT-5513-2020","Mandal, Biswajit/0000-0001-7634-9864",RBI endowment at CSSSC,RBI endowment at CSSSC,"This is a revised version of a paper (with a different title) presented in a conference at the University of Kobe in November, 2014, on Fragmentation, Time Zone and their Dynamic Consequences.

This paper first considers the possible justifications for subsidies - namely normalisation of accounts, public service obligations, economies of density, relief of externalities on other modes, wider economic benefits and option values. It then considers the alternative ways of giving subsidies in the form of contributions to infrastructure costs, investment grants and subsidies to services. It concludes that there are good reasons for subsidising railways - in particular a first best argument for subsidising infrastructure will usually exist and a failure to do so will lead to fewer services being operated than are economically justified - but there is a need to ensure subsidies are used efficiently. Ways of achieving this include the setting of clear objectives and financial constraints, decentralisation of decision taking to focussed sector management, regulation and benchmarking of infrastructure costs and the introduction of competition for and in the market. Together these should reduce or eliminate the link between subsidies and inefficiency observed in earlier times.","[Nash, Chris] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Nash, Chris] Masaryk Univ, Brno, Czech Republic; [Nash, Chris] Ctr Regulat Europe, Brussels, Belgium",University of Leeds; Masaryk University Brno,"Nash, C (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.;Nash, C (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Brno, Czech Republic.;Nash, C (通讯作者)，Ctr Regulat Europe, Brussels, Belgium.",C.A.Nash@its.leeds.ac.uk,,,,,,,34,5,5,1,13,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

Studies of energy futures depicted the full geologic extent of coal as a virtually unlimited backstop energy supply, drawing justification from legacy ratios of reserves-to-production (R-P) on the order of several centuries. Annual consumption and market prices for hard coal have doubled since 1990, providing an opportunity to recalibrate the next century's reference case with an empirically constrained outlook for this important industrial fuel source. Over the last two decades, improving knowledge of world coal deposits refined estimates of their recoverable portion, reducing assessed reserves by two-thirds. Coal supply costs during this period increased much faster than anticipated by models which mapped total geologic occurrences with long and flat supply curves. Consequently, underlying assumptions no longer hold for many multi-decade global energy reference cases depicting a rapid expansion of coal production-the conceptual framework for these scenarios needs revision. Energy system outlooks underlying pathways of future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions provide a case study, since the climate change research community commonly uses business-as-usual scenarios with a strong carbon signal from coal combustion many times higher than current reserve estimates. In this paper, we explain why vast expansion in 21st-century coal consumption should not be used to describe any plausible reference case of the global energy future. Illustrating coal as a practically unlimited backstop supply is inconsistent with the current state of coal markets, technology, and reserve estimates. Future coal production faces many uncertainties, but the key uncertainty for long-term scenarios is the recoverable portion of reserves, not how many total geologic resources will eventually become reserves.

Results show that the share of temporary contracts in the labor market becomes more important as firing costs increase. Simultaneously, temporary contracts negatively affect the frequency with which regular jobs arrive and offset any positive effect of firing costs on unemployment. Finally, temporary contracts increase flexibility and generate increasing welfare gains as labor protection becomes more stringent.","[Tejada, Mauricio M.] Univ Alberto Hurtado, ILADES, Erasmo Escala 1835, Santiago, Chile",Universidad Alberto Hurtado,"Tejada, MM (通讯作者)，Univ Alberto Hurtado, ILADES, Erasmo Escala 1835, Santiago, Chile.",matejada@uahurtado.cl,"Tejada, Mauricio/HHT-0385-2022","Tejada, Mauricio/0000-0003-1598-1385",,,,,44,5,6,5,14,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5371,1879-1034,,LABOUR ECON,Labour Econ.,JUN,2017,46.0,,,,,,26,46,,10.1016/j.labeco.2017.03.002,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EZ4QN,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404697700003,0

We find that the incomplete IRPT mechanism of deposit markets shows an asymmetric adjustment in the short run and symmetric adjustments in the long run. The deposit rate is rigid downward, which supports the customer reaction hypothesis. Moreover, we find that both the short-run and the long-run IRPT channels from the policy rate to the lending rate are also incomplete in the short run but not in the long run.

Innovators develop technology of varying quality or productivity. Firms acquire technology after paying a search cost to find high productivity technology. The resulting model has mixed equilibria with productivity dispersion. However, such mixed equilibria are unstable under the logit dynamic from evolutionary game theory. Instead, the economy converges to limit cycles, whose existence we verify numerically. We conclude, therefore, that mixed equilibria is not a robust explanation of productivity dispersion in our model. Instead, such productivity dispersion is a cyclical phenomenon. An additional implication is that cyclical productivity dispersion contributes to endogenous fluctuations in aggregate output. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Does the redistributive impact of inflation depend on the extent of financial development? Should optimal monetary policy vary across countries with different levels of financial development? In order to address these questions, we develop a monetary growth production model with heterogeneous agents. In our economy, optimal policy needs to weigh the effects of policy across two groups capital owners and individuals who hold liquid assets. In this environment, we compare various economies that are identical in every aspect except for their level of financial development. Interestingly, we generally find that economies at the highest stages of financial development (economies in which money, bonds, and claims to capital are traded) experience the highest amount of capital formation and social welfare as long as inflation is low. Yet, regardless of the extent of financial development, there are generally redistributive consequences from inflation. Moreover, the model tends to predict that economies with relatively small stock markets produce the highest levels of income inequality. Empirical work examining the role of money growth and the implications of financial development across countries is consistent with predictions from the model.","[Ghossoub, Edgar A.] Univ Texas San Antonio, San Antonio, TX USA; [Reed, Robert R.] Univ Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA); University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Reed, RR (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",rreed@cba.ua.edu,,,,,,,43,17,18,5,39,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

This paper contributes to this debate by estimating the effect of openness to international trade on inflation with panel data from Sub-Saharan Africa. Employing instrumental variable techniques that correct for endogeneity bias of trade openness, the empirical evidence suggests that within-country variations in trade openness restrict inflation: a 1 percentage point increase in the ratio of trade over gross domestic product is associated with a decrease in inflation of approximately 0.08 percentage points per year. These results are robust to additional controls, different measurements of trade openness and alternative instruments.

It is argued in the present paper: (i) that Ng's own assumptions imply not that first-best conditions should be established under these circumstances, but that the status quo should be maintained; (ii) that when Ng's key assumption is altered to be empirically relevant, all policy decisions become fully context-specific; and (iii) that Woo's argument for accepting Ng's conclusions in spite of point (ii) is incorrect.

We manipulated the composition of groups to achieve a wide range of support, and assigned students-conditional on their prior ability-randomly to these groups. The data support a specification in which the impact of group composition on achievement is captured by the mean and standard deviation of peers' prior ability, their interaction, and interactions with students' own prior ability. When we assess the aggregate implications of these peer effects regressions for group assignment, we find that low-and medium-ability students gain on an average 0.19 SD units of achievement by switching from ability mixing to three-way tracking. Their dropout rate is reduced by 12 percentage points (relative to a mean of 0.6). High-ability students are unaffected. Analysis of survey data indicates that in tracked groups, low-ability students have more positive interactions with other students, and are more involved.

In addition, it is of great interest to see if the CEE emerging markets are correlated with other emerging ones, as well as to analyse the correlation with the developed markets, for optimizing investment portfolios. Using a CEE group approach (regional index) and daily data from 2002 to 2015, the results suggest that markets react differently to similar negative and positive returns, except for the rapid growth period, when the greed sentiment dominates the markets. Furthermore, the structural break dates affect volatility, the highest asymmetric coefficient being recorded for the pre-crisis period. For the bivariate approach, the emerging markets and developed markets indexes provided by the Morgan Stanley Capital International (hereinafter referred to as MSCI) have been considered and the results suggest that CEE stock markets are correlated with emerging stock markets rather than developed ones. For both pairs, the correlation is consistently higher for the break dates characterized by an increase in volatility, which is in line with the literature that claims that the co-movements increase when international factors dominate the national ones, and influence stock markets.","[Botoc, Claudiu] West Univ Timisoara, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Finance, Timisoara, Romania",West University of Timisoara,"Botoc, C (通讯作者)，West Univ Timisoara, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Finance, Timisoara, Romania.",claudiu.botoc@e-uvt.ro,"Botoc, Claudiu/N-6663-2014","Botoc, Claudiu/0000-0002-1216-1413",European Social Fund through Sectorial Operational Programme Human Resources Development [POSDRU/159/1.5/S/142115],European Social Fund through Sectorial Operational Programme Human Resources Development,"This work was supported by the European Social Fund through Sectorial Operational Programme Human Resources Development 2007-2013, Project No. POSDRU/159/1.5/S/142115, Project Performance and Excellence in Postdoctoral Research in Romanian Economics Science Domain.

Therefore, in this study, we estimate those border effects exclusively for transactions for final consumption, in which such agglomeration forces will be weak, in China and Japan. As a result, we found larger international border effects and could not find a significant role for producer agglomeration in the estimates of border effects.

For top income recipients, I estimate inequality and mean income by fitting Pareto models to the tax data, examining specification issues in depth, notably whether to use ParetoI or ParetoII (generalized Pareto) models, and the choice of income threshold above which the Pareto models apply. The preferred specification is a ParetoII model with a threshold set at the 99th or 95th percentile (depending on year). Conclusions about aggregate UK inequality trends since the mid-1990s are robust to the way in which tax data are employed. The Gini coefficient for individual gross income rose by around 7% or 8% between 1996/7 and 2007/8, with most of the increase occurring after 2003/4.

We present several novel empirical regularities that paint a complex picture. Although Europe has experienced both systematic economic convergence and an increased coordination across national and subnational business cycles since 1980, this has not been accompanied by cultural or institutional convergence. Such persistent heterogeneity does not necessarily spell doom for further political integration, however. Compared with observed heterogeneity within EU member states themselves, or in well-functioning federations such as the United States, cultural diversity across EU members is of a similar order of magnitude. The main stumbling block on the road to further political integration may not be heterogeneity in fundamental cultural traits, but other cleavages, such as national identities.","[Alesina, Alberto] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Tabellini, Guido] Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy; [Trebbi, Francesco] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada",Harvard University; Bocconi University; University of British Columbia,"Alesina, A (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"Trebbi, Francesco/GVS-4548-2022; Trebbi, Francesco/AAD-5940-2019",,Bocconi University; Canadian Institute for Advanced Research; European Research Council,Bocconi University; Canadian Institute for Advanced Research(Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR)); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)),"We are grateful to our editor, James Stock; to our discussants, Markus Brunnermeier and Elias Papaioannou; and to many conference participants for detailed comments and suggestions.

The model was calibrated to match broad, stylized facts common across a large set of remittance recipient countries. The calibration exercise reveals that output does not respond as much to remittance shocks relative to technology shocks. The model predicts that temporary inflows of worker remittances positively affect GDP per capita while a permanent increase of remittances does not. Cross country econometric evidence is consistent with the theory: there is a significant and positive correlation between the temporary component of remittances and growth; and permanent component of remittances do not affect output growth.

The OECD's saving-investment correlation dropped to a record low just before the 2008 crisis began, reflecting the perceived 'end' of the FH puzzle in some studies. But since the onset of the crisis, our results indicate that this correlation has increased, suggesting the puzzle's return. The puzzle for net capital-importing and net capital-exporting countries differs, with the relationship being more significant for the exporters compared to the importers, reflecting the asymmetry in terms of the degree of shocks across countries.

The paper additionally argues that insight into the sustained emphases that Smith and James place upon the role of psychological satisfaction as a motivating factor in societal and personal progress can aid current efforts to draw upon their work and to reconcile the disciplines that they are widely credited with founding.","[Glaze, Simon] Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Glaze, S (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",s.glaze@warwick.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/I03615X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,101,3,3,0,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

To guide market designers faced with constraints, we propose new stability concepts. A matching is strongly stable if satisfying blocking pairs inevitably violates a constraint. We show that a strongly stable matching may not exist, and that existence is guaranteed if and only if all distributional constraints are trivial. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a more permissive concept, weak stability. We demonstrate a weakly stable matching always exists, implies efficiency, and is characterized by standard normative axioms. These results are obtained in a more general environment than those in existing studies, accommodating a wide variety of applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Flipping tends to take place in sluggish and tight, but not in moderate, markets. To follow is the possibility of multiple equilibria. In one equilibrium, most, if not all, transactions are intermediated, resulting in rapid turnover, a high vacancy rate, and high housing prices. In another equilibrium, few houses are bought and sold by middlemen. Turnover is slow, few houses are vacant, and prices are moderate. Moreover, flippers can enter and exit en masse in response to the smallest interest rate shock. The housing market can then be intrinsically unstable even when all flippers are akin to the arbitraging middlemen in classical finance theory. In speeding up turnover, the flipping that takes place in a sluggish and illiquid market tends to be socially beneficial. The flipping that takes place in a tight and liquid market can be wasteful as the efficiency gain from any faster turnover is unlikely to be large enough to offset the loss from more houses being left vacant in the hands of flippers.

In equilibrium, large margins of victory convey mandates for candidates to make bold policy changes. To communicate extreme policy views, citizens support extreme parties that may be unlikely to win office. To convey moderate views, citizens deliberately abstain from voting, thereby avoiding the signaling voter's curse of encouraging overextremism. In large elections, mandates can identify the optimal policy from an entire continuum, thereby greatly strengthening Condorcet's (1785) classic jury theorem. Behavioral patterns are consistent with otherwise puzzling empirical features of elections, and can also apply to other political activities, such as public protests or writing letters to elected officials.

The work covers design, evaluation, and revision to facilitate valid experiments. A focus group study and statistical analysis were used to test the clarity of instructions and difficulty of choices.

However, over the last 40 years the US total fertility rate has been rather stable while female wages have continued to grow. Over the same period, women's hours spent on housework have declined, but men's have increased. I propose a model in which households are not perfectly specialized, but both men and women contribute to home production. As the gender wage gap narrows, the time allocations of men and women converge, and while fertility falls at first, the decline stops when female wages are close to male's. Rising relative wages increase women's labor supply and due to higher opportunity cost lower fertility at first, but they also lead to a reallocation of home production and child care from women to men, and a marketization. I find that both are important in understanding why fertility did not decline further. In a further quantitative exercise I show that the model performs well in matching fertility over the entire 20th century, including the overall decline, the baby boom, and the recent stabilization.

I characterize pooling and separating equilibria and their existence and determine when these involve limit pricing. For some parameter constellations, the unique equilibrium surviving a D1 type refinement involves immediate separation on monopoly prices. For others, there are limit price equilibria surviving the refinement in which different types may initially pool and then (possibly) separate. Separation involves setting prices such that the inefficient incumbent's profits from mimicking are negative.

Financialization refers to the increased power of financial institutions. The government protects the incomes and assets of financial institutions, but it does little to protect the incomes and assets of households, which are necessary for people to afford healthcare, education, emergencies, retirement, and so on. Polanyi criticized nineteenth-century civilization for transforming land, labor, and the means of production into commodities, using economic insecurity to motivate humans. The development of intangible property allowed business to expand the market in two ways: (i) restricting output to drive up profits and (ii) liquefying consumer assets to provide credit to consumers to increase spending. The implications of that process manifested themselves in the financial crisis of 2008. Market capitalism represented the attempt to organize commodities based on economic rationality. Similarly, the twentieth- and twenty-first-century capitalism represents the effort to rationally organize society according to the value of intangible assets. Both efforts failed, indicating the continued relevance of Polanyi's thesis.","[Watkins, John P.] Westminster Coll, Econ, Salt Lake City, UT USA",,"Watkins, JP (通讯作者)，Westminster Coll, Econ, Salt Lake City, UT USA.",,,,,,,,41,10,10,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Our econometric analysis implies that political orientation in the USA is by far more relevant for general climate change beliefs and beliefs in anthropogenic climate change than in Germany and China. Furthermore, US and German citizens with a conservative, but not green identification significantly less often support publicly financed climate policy, while US and German respondents with a social-green identification and Chinese respondents belonging to the Communist Party have a significantly higher willingness to pay a price premium for climate-friendly products. However, our econometric analysis overall reveals that environmental values, which are measured by a New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scale, are the major factors for climate change beliefs and attitudes in all three countries and thus play an even more dominant role than political orientation. In addition, environmental values weaken the differences in several climate change beliefs and attitudes between a right-wing and a left-wing identification. These interaction effects between political orientation and the NEP scale are especially strong in the USA, only relevant for the support of publicly financed climate policy in Germany, and negligible in China. Our estimation results suggest alternative strategies such as specific communication campaigns in order to reduce the climate change skepticism in conservative and right-wing circles in the USA and to increase the support of climate policies among such population groups.

We test two important related hypotheses: (1) deregulation of electricity price does not promote energy conservation, and (2) demand-price relationship is not an inverted U-shaped. The Stock and Watson dynamic OLS is used to address the so-called second-order bias. The result showed that, deregulation of electricity price in Ghana has induced behaviours that are more consistent with energy conservation improvements. The demand-price relationship is an inverted U, which suggests that there is a price range that end-users can tolerate further price rise and still increase their consumption of electricity. However, the degree of price tolerability is higher for residential consumers than industrial consumers. The simulation results showed that, further economic growth is likely to compromise energy conservation but more in the industrial sector than the residential sector. On the other hand, future crude oil price is likely to deteriorate energy conservation in the initial years after 2016, but this trend is likely to reverse after the year 2020. Pricing mechanisms are potent to induce energy conservation but inadequate. The results suggest that they should be complemented with other stringent policies such as a mandatory energy reduction policy, investment in renewables, and personalization of energy efficiency programs.

The relevant parameters are voting power, risk aversion, and pessimism. Voters who feel powerful prefer lower thresholds, while risk averters and those who feel pessimistic about the majority prefer higher thresholds. We also analyze the effects of loss aversion and overconfidence. The former leads voters to prefer more protective voting rules, a manifestation of their bias towards the status quo. The latter leads them to prefer overly low (high) protection when they receive good (bad) news about how others will vote. Finally, we study constitutional agreements on the voting rule. Members of the constituent assembly are heterogeneous in the parameters above. Weak and minority members anticipate high expropriation risk in future decisions.

Using data for the 1978-2013 period, we first test for the necessary condition, i.e. whether there is a long-run cointegrating relationship in the economic development of the Republic of Cyprus (RC) and Greece, and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) and Turkey. We then test for the sufficient condition, i.e. whether periphery-economy per capita income series to be weakly endogenous, while those of patron economies are weakly exogenous. Our results indicate strong dependency within the periphery/patron economy pairs of the RC/Greece and the TRNC/Turkey. Further, we show that economic growth in the periphery economies is largely driven by that of the patron economies. Using a Markovswitching vector autoregressive (MS-VAR) model of the short-run business cycle, we demonstrate that the RC/Greece and the TRNC/Turkey co-move in the short-run, and that business cycles with each pair are synchronized.

A random coefficient model is estimated to measure the effect of the course over a ten-month period, controlling for confounding factors and individual heterogeneity. We find that eco-driving training induced average city and highway fuel consumption reductions of 4.6% and 2.9% respectively. The effects are highly heterogeneous between individuals, with standard deviations of about 5%. Drivers' socio-demographic characteristics are not helpful to explain these discrepancies but we find that drivers of vehicles with manual transmissions achieve significantly larger reductions: 10% on city roads and 8% on highways. Finally, we show that reductions faded gradually after the course. City reductions go from 4.6% to 2.5% within ten months. Highway fuel use decreases average 3.5% in the first ten weeks after the course but become statistically insignificant after about thirty weeks. Overall, the average impact translates into an annual fuel saving cost of about 60$ per driver. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We ask first how many of those in the lowest levels of life-satisfaction suffer from unemployment, poverty, physical ill health, and mental illness. The largest proportion suffers from mental illness. Multiple regression shows that mental illness is not highly correlated with poverty or unemployment, and that it contributes more to explaining the presence of misery than is explained by either poverty or unemployment.

In practice, implementing concrete consolidation measures appears to meet with public resistance, suggesting that the success of consolidation efforts strongly depends on the popularity of the chosen measures. To identify public attitudes toward fiscal consolidation and alternative consolidation measures, we conducted a survey among 2,000 German citizens. Applying ordered and multinominal logit models, we test theory-based hypotheses about the determinants of individual attitudes toward public debt. We find that, inter alia, personal economic situation, time preferences, fiscal illusion, and trust in politicians exert a significant impact on attitudes toward fiscal consolidation and preferences for alternative consolidation measures.","[Hayo, Bernd; Neumeier, Florian] Philipps Univ Marburg, Sch Business & Econ, D-35032 Marburg, Germany",Philipps University Marburg,"Hayo, B (通讯作者)，Philipps Univ Marburg, Sch Business & Econ, D-35032 Marburg, Germany.",,,,,,,,49,16,17,2,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,FEB,2017,70.0,1,,,,,42,69,,10.1111/kykl.12130,0.0,,,28,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EM6FP,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000395408500003,0

Preferences for welfare provision by ethnicity,JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Altruism; Government; Charity; Ethnicity; Indigenous; Minorities; Experiment,ALTRUISM,"There is debate about whether charity or government is better for alleviating poverty. While in many cases government agencies and private charity serve similar purposes, they can be perceived very differently by the public. This is particularly true for issues such as minority welfare where government spending has been historically ineffective. This paper investigates the role of recipient ethnicity in preferences for giving to private charity and government agencies. I present a real donation experiment where donors can donate to government organisations and private charities assisting a population in general, or assisting a particular ethnic group in that population. I find that giving depends not only on the organisation type but also the ethnicity of the beneficiary. Perceptions of organisational effectiveness are also found to affect giving. The findings of the experiment suggest that if the government is unable to improve outcomes it may need to consider outsourcing to private charity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, the standard international business cycle framework cannot replicate this finding, uncovering the trade-comovement puzzle. Modeling trade using more sophisticated micro level assumptions does not help resolve the puzzle. This happens because for a large class of trade models, under certain macro-level conditions, output comovement is determined by the same factor structure. We show that in such models comovement can be explained by three factors: (i) the correlation between each country's TFP; (ii) the correlation between each country's share of expenditure on domestic goods; and (iii) the correlation between each country's TFP and the partner's share of expenditure on domestic goods. An empirical investigation of the link between trade and each of the three factors shows that the trade-comovement relation is in large part explained by the second factor while in the theoretical model this factor reacts counterfactually to changes in trade costs.

For instance, a majority of consumers tend to choose too low a level of deductible for homeowners insurance and automobile insurance, and purchase excessive warranties for electronics and other durable products such as automobiles and furniture. The analysis demonstrates that overinsurance decreases consumer welfare and increases insurers' profits. This tendency of overinsurance stems from lack of information about the probability and magnitude of loss, and it calls for policies that require insurers or third-party organizations to provide more, albeit not perfect, information and data for consumers before they make insurance-purchase decisions.

Different proxies for financial integration were employed to verify the interaction. The empirical results demonstrate the significance of the interaction terms and largely validate the hypothesis.

The aim is to shed light on the most appropriate policy mix to achieve the resilience of the banking sector and foster macroeconomic stability. Simulation results show that a triple-mandate Taylor rule, focused on output gap, inflation and credit growth, and a Basel III prudential regulation is the best policy mix to improve the stability of the banking sector and smooth output fluctuations. Moreover, we consider the different levers of Basel III and their combinations. We find that minimum capital requirements and counter-cyclical capital buffers allow to achieve results close to the Basel III first-best with a much more simplified regulatory framework. Finally, the components of Basel III are non-additive: the inclusion of an additional lever does not always improve the performance of the macro-prudential regulation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It assumes that individual evaluates each act on the basis of its minimum expected utility over this class of distributions. In this paper, we attempt to generalize the model to social decision making. It is assumed that the society's belief is formed through a linear aggregation of individual beliefs and society's values through a linear aggregation of individual values. We propose principles which characterize such separate aggregation procedures. We also generalize Choquet expected utility model, which posits a nonadditive measure over events and a utility function to represent belief and values, respectively.

This paper reviews the ECB's evolving response from mid-2007 to early-2015, showing how it combined the standard tool of adjusting its policy interest rates with nonstandard passive and active balance-sheet measures, accompanied by a forward guidance of its intended monetary stance. Altogether, the ECB stayed focused on price stability while fulfilling the two classical roles of lender of last resort to resolve money market tensions and market maker of last resort to repair monetary transmission. Addressing the many challenges was complicated by the nexus between fragile banks and vulnerable governments, the ensuing financial fragmentation and the complex institutional and political structure of the eurozone. Looking ahead, the new reinforced European financial architecture could make the ECB's monetary policy task of maintaining price stability for the eurozone easier to accomplish.","[van Riet, Ad] Directorate Monetary Policy European Cent Bank, Sonnemannstrasse 20, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"van Riet, A (通讯作者)，Directorate Monetary Policy European Cent Bank, Sonnemannstrasse 20, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany.",ad.van_riet@ecb.europa.eu,"van+Riet, Ad/ABE-6012-2021","van+Riet, Ad/0000-0003-4267-8867",,,,,45,0,0,1,15,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

However, the extent to which welfare loss is caused by the disparity between perceived and scientific risks is unclear. Based on this gap in the literature, we conduct a discrete choice experiment to estimate the welfare loss. At the same time, we must tackle two issues arising in the estimation: endogeneity and ambiguity in the perceived risk. We construct an empirical model based on maxmin expected utility to consider ambiguity and apply a control function approach to alleviate endogeneity bias. The results show that 1) the disparity between perceived and scientific risks causes a significant welfare loss; 2) the ambiguity in the perceived risk exacerbates the welfare loss; and 3) endogeneity largely biases welfare measurement.","[Watanabe, Masahide] Osaka Univ Econ, Dept Econ, Higashiyodogawa Ku, 2-2-8 Osumi, Osaka 5338533, Japan; [Kawata, Yukichika] Kindai Univ, Fac Econ, 4-1 Kowakae 3 Chome, Higashiosaka, Osaka 5778502, Japan",Kindai University (Kinki University),"Watanabe, M (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ Econ, Dept Econ, Higashiyodogawa Ku, 2-2-8 Osumi, Osaka 5338533, Japan.",wmasa@osaka-ue.ac.jp; ykawata@kindai.ac.jp,"Kawata, Yukichika/AAF-4024-2019","Kawata, Yukichika/0000-0001-9511-6863; Watanabe, Masahide/0000-0003-2504-7238","JSPS KAKENHI Grant [25780176]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17K03737, 25780176] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI Grant(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 25780176.,,54,1,1,0,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-6108,1935-1682,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Non-linearity in the interest rate term structure is captured by the three-factor model of interest rate level, slope, and curvature. We observe that financial firms have negative exposures to the interest rate level, while non-financial firms have positive exposures. This finding suggests that financial firms need to hedge against rising interest rates, while non-financial firms need to hedge against falling interest rates. Small banks and insurance companies have a positive risk exposure to the slope factor, while real estate firms have a negative risk exposure to the curvature factor. Though the interest rate level is the most important factor, ignoring the slope and curvature factors could lead to underestimating a financial firm's overall interest rate risk exposure. These findings are robust to controlling for the orthogonalized market return, time-varying equity risk premium, and the global financial crisis. This study offers practical tools to regulators, such as the Reserve Bank of Australia and Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority for assessing interest rate risk exposures of the financial and non-financial sectors.","[Akhtaruzzaman, Md.; Shamsuddin, Abul] Univ Newcastle, Newcastle Business Sch, SR118, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia",University of Newcastle,"Akhtaruzzaman, M (通讯作者)，Univ Newcastle, Newcastle Business Sch, SR118, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",Md.Akhtaruzzaman@newcastle.edu.au,Akhtaruzzaman/AAC-1070-2020,"Akhtaruzzaman/0000-0001-7795-1451; Shamsuddin, Abul/0000-0003-3109-4989",,,,,68,3,3,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The paper presents the results of research regarding the problems pertaining to employment common to Russian young opera singers after graduating from musical universities. The research revealed following problems. Firstly, major contingent of graduates are unable to completely implement professional competences received during their educational period, and as a result, a large number of graduates engaged in areas ancillary to their field of expertises. Secondly, specific conditions complicate the transition of a young professional into the labour market. Thirdly, certain factors were uncovered which effectively predetermine that young specialists withdraw from the profession. The research allows us to make following conclusions. For developing effective methods of regulating employment in the cultural and art spheres, it is indispensable to actively introduce the practice of sample surveys into the realized market monitorings (especially in-depth interviews). We also suggest specific mechanisms for professional integration in this field.","[Anikina, Elena; Shubat, Oksana] Ural Fed Univ, 19 Mira St, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia; [Anikin, Valentin] Natl Theatre Mannheim, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany",Ural Federal University,"Anikina, E (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, 19 Mira St, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia.",e.l.anikina@urfu.ru; o.m.shubat@urfu.ru; anikin_valiko@mail.ru,"Shubat, Oksana/M-7443-2013","Shubat, Oksana/0000-0002-0929-8144","Act 211 Government of the Russian Federation [02, A03.21.0006]",Act 211 Government of the Russian Federation,"The work was supported by Act 211 Government of the Russian Federation, contract No 02.A03.21.0006.",,10,0,0,1,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,10,18,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455325300002,0

A non-existence example is provided when, in the second context, some DM is too optimistic. We furthermore show that at an individually rational Pareto optimum at most one strictly optimistic DM will avoid ruin at each state or date. Considering a risky context, this entails that even if risk averters will share risk in a comonotonic way as usual, at most one classical strong risk lover will avoid ruin at each state or date.

We exploit variation in distance to nearby gas wells in home sale prices to estimate this effect. In contrast to previous studies, we focus on a relatively densely populated area, a section of the Dallas-Ft. Worth-Arlington urban area. Using a dataset of 127,556 observations from Tarrant County, Texas over the period 2005-2011, we find robust evidence that increased proximity to a well leads to reduced home sale prices.

However, intermarriage itself can change participation options and heterogeneously so for men and women. Using data from the 2010 American Community Survey, we find that the raw impact of intermarriage is to reduce labour-force participation for men and increase it for women. However, upon controlling for observable and unobservable selection into intermarriage, the gains from intermarriage for women are reversed. The importance of human capital controls of education and experience in determining the labour-force participation of married immigrants is underscored. Birthplace fixed effects play an important role in explaining the gender differences in labour-force participation among intermarried immigrants.","[Basu, Sukanya] Vassar Coll, Dept Econ, 124 Raymond Ave, Poughkeepsie, NY 12604 USA",Vassar College,"Basu, S (通讯作者)，Vassar Coll, Dept Econ, 124 Raymond Ave, Poughkeepsie, NY 12604 USA.",subasu@vassar.edu,,,,,,,16,1,1,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

At first, we examine whether innovative (product and process innovation) SMEs seek more external finance than the non-innovative firms and then we examine the likelihood of being successful with a loan application. This study uses the dataset from the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS V), which was conducted by the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) during the period of 2012-2014. With respect to firm-level analysis, we find that innovative SMEs are likely to seek external finance to support their innovative ideas but the results are not statistically significant. We also did not find any evidence that innovative SMEs experience more credit constraints as compared to non-innovative firms. However, a country-level analysis suggests that firms in the Slovak Republic and Hungary are more likely to seek external finance for process and product innovation. Further, we find that mature firms, firms having audited financial statements, and risky borrowers are highly likely to apply for external finance while service-oriented firms are less likely to apply for bank finance. Finally, we find that loan application of the experienced borrowers and service firms are more likely to be accepted.","[Belas, Jaroslav; Rahman, Ashiqur] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic; [Rahman, M.

Accordingly, this article tries to fill this gap by investigating the relationship between leverage and human capital examined through the investment in employee-related expenditure. The analysis focuses on a sample of French listed small businesses before and during the recent global crisis. The empirical findings show that leverage serves as a monitoring mechanism of corporate managers prone to over or underinvest in employee-related expenditure to obtain private benefits. Due notably to the availability of debt, this monitoring is more effective before the crisis period, especially for low growth firms. Overall, these results provide support to the theory that leverage has a disciplining role. Simultaneously, they lead to moderate the strength of this role according to the global crisis. Thus, they should provide useful insights for academics, regulators, managers and credit institutions.","[Benkraiem, Ramzi] Audencia Business Sch, 8 Route Joneliere, F-44312 Nantes 3, France; [Bouattour, Mondher] Univ Toulouse, La Rochelle Business Sch, Toulouse, France; [Bouattour, Mondher] Univ Toulouse, LGCO, Toulouse, France; [Miloudi, Anthony] Univ Poitiers, La Rochelle Business Sch, Poitiers, France; [Miloudi, Anthony] Univ Poitiers, CRIEF, Poitiers, France; [Vigneron, Ludovic] Univ Valenciennes, Valenciennes, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Universite de Poitiers; Universite de Poitiers; Universite Polytechnique Hauts-de-France,"Benkraiem, R (通讯作者)，Audencia Business Sch, 8 Route Joneliere, F-44312 Nantes 3, France.",rbenkraiem@audencia.com,"Benkraiem, Ramzi/I-7865-2019; Bouattour, Mondher/AFS-0698-2022","Benkraiem, Ramzi/0000-0002-3931-0546; Bouattour, Mondher/0000-0001-5902-0485; Miloudi, Anthony/0000-0003-0126-5783",,,,,27,1,2,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The results indicate that structural breaks cannot explain the inability of the flexible price monetary model to outperform the random walk. The only plausible explanation for the Meese-Rogoff puzzle is that forecasting accuracy is traditionally assessed by magnitude-only measures.

It appears that deployment significantly increases the possibility of terrorist actions in the home country. In particular, if country A decides to send troops to nation B, then citizens of the former country are more likely to fall victim of an attack carried out by a terrorist organisation originating from the latter country. Contributing to this line of literature, we further refine this relationship by distinguishing between regions where the troops are sent as well as by introducing differences between types of deployment. Our results indicate that missions to Asia and the Middle East are more dangerous than missions to other regions as reflected by the terrorist threat in the home country. Robustness tests do however show that the significance of the location variable Asia is predominantly attributed to the mission to Afghanistan. As for types of deployment, only ad hoc missions seem to increase the risk of an attack, whereas no significant results are found for other missions such as operations under UN and NATO flag. Leaving out the missions to Iraq and Afghanistan however also increases the danger resulting from missions by fixed coalitions. Our results find however no evidence that 'wearing a blue helmet' increases the probability of a terrorist attack at home.","[Buts, Caroline] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Appl Econ, Brussels, Belgium; [Buts, Caroline] Research Fdn Flanders FWO, Brussels, Belgium; [Du Bois, Cind] Royal Mil Acad, Dept Econ Management & Leadership, Brussels, Belgium",Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Buts, C (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Appl Econ, Brussels, Belgium.",carobuts@vub.ac.be,,"Buts, Caroline/0000-0002-1551-6611; du bois, cind/0000-0002-7423-928X",,,,,23,0,0,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

The study covers panel data of between 35 and 100 countries for the period 1980-2014. The panel cointegration tests suggest that FDI inflow and IPRs with the other control variables are cointegrated for full countries and high-income group. Their estimated (long-run) coefficients are 0.04 and 0.18, respectively, but insignificant in the short-run. The impact (short-run) of TRIPS agreement is positive for full countries, but negative for low-income group. Non-causality tests further support the role of IPRs on FDI. Various transmission channels have been identified, in particularly for low-income countries. This study enlightens policymakers about the policy on creating a conducive and sustainable environment for IPRs in order to encourage FDI inflows to their countries.","[Chan, Siew Mei; Tang, Tuck Cheong] Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Tang, TC (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Bandar Sunway, Malaysia.",tangtuckcheong@um.edu.my,"Tang, Tuck Cheong/H-6636-2014","Tang, Tuck Cheong/0000-0001-7978-0684",,,,,68,2,2,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

The Environmental Performance Index is used for the first time to evaluate the environmental quality on economic growth. By employing both 'static' and 'dynamic' panel models, we find that environmental performance is positively related to economic growth and is more significant in non-Organization for Economic Cooperation Development (OECD) countries. Moreover, when corruption is incorporated, the empirical estimation results indicate that although lower corruption helps economic growth in non-OECD countries, the negative coefficients of the three interactive terms show that the positive effect of environment performance on economic growth will drop, while greater environmental performance combined with natural resource abundance inevitably leads to inefficient bureaucracies and hence disadvantageous economic growth. As a result, policymakers in non-OECD countries should carefully ensure better government quality when they exhibit strong environmental performance so as to avoid any disadvantageous impact upon economic growth.","[Chang, Chun-Ping] Shih Chien Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Mkt Management, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Chang, Chun-Ping] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Xian, Shannxi, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yu] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yu] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yu] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Elect Vehicles Beijing, Beijing, Peoples R China",Shih Chien University; Xi'an Jiaotong University; Beijing Institute of Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology,"Hao, Y (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Hao, Y (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Hao, Y (通讯作者)，Collaborat Innovat Ctr Elect Vehicles Beijing, Beijing, Peoples R China.",haoyuking@bit.edu.cn,"Hao, Yu/ABF-4628-2021","Hao, Yu/0000-0001-8394-4215","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403015, 71521002]; MOST [104-2410-H-158-001]; Scientific Research Foundation for Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, State Education Ministry of China [20152132001]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [9162013]; Excellent Young Scholars Research Fund of Beijing Institute of Technology [20142142005]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); MOST; Scientific Research Foundation for Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, State Education Ministry of China(Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese ScholarsMinistry of Education, China); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); Excellent Young Scholars Research Fund of Beijing Institute of Technology","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China: [Grant Numbers 71403015 and 71521002]; MOST: [Grant Number 104-2410-H-158-001]; Scientific Research Foundation for Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, State Education Ministry of China: [Grant Number 20152132001]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [Grant Number 9162013]; Excellent Young Scholars Research Fund of Beijing Institute of Technology: [Grant Number 20142142005].",,76,51,53,3,50,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

They also show that the orientation of public investment changed after the start of the 'Socialist Market Economy' in 1992: government capital became more complementary to nongovernment capital as it focused more on infrastructure and withdrew from industrial production, intervening only in times of crisis, for stabilization purposes, indirectly via the state banks.","[Chen, Xiaodong; Minford, Patrick; Zhou, Peng] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Minford, Patrick] CEPR, London, England; [Tian, Kun] Xiangtan Univ, Xiangtan, Peoples R China",Cardiff University; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Xiangtan University,"Chen, XD (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.",chenxd514@hotmail.com,"Zhou, Peng/ABI-2373-2020","Zhou, Peng/0000-0002-4310-9474; Tian, Kun/0000-0002-9526-074X; Minford, Anthony Patrick L./0000-0003-2499-935X",China National Social Science Fund [11CJL017]; Social Science Funding of Hunan Province [2010YBA215],China National Social Science Fund; Social Science Funding of Hunan Province,"The authors thank the financial support from China National Social Science Fund (Grant No. 11CJL017), and the Social Science Funding of Hunan Province (Grant No. 2010YBA215)",,40,1,1,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Using a recently developed measure of economic policy uncertainty, we estimate - for the United States of America, from 1973 to 2014 - the uncertainty impact upon economic activity volatility, as captured by a Nonlinear ARCH model. We learned that inflation volatility exerts the largest overall impact, followed by personal consumption expenditure volatility, while the commercial and industrial loans produce a small (although significant) effect. We found evidences of a U-shaped impact of policy uncertainty upon volatility. However, the net effect is direct: an increase in uncertainty leads to an overall increase in economic volatility. We conclude that a stable and predictable economic policy is critical for the economic growth.","[Dima, Bogdan; Dima, Stefana Maria] West Univ Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania; [Dinca, Marius Sorin; Dinca, Gheorghita] Transilvania Univ Brasov, Brasov, Romania",West University of Timisoara; Transylvania University of Brasov,"Dinca, MS (通讯作者)，Transilvania Univ Brasov, Brasov, Romania.",bogdandima2001@gmail.com; msdinca@yahoo.com; stefana.dima@ecreb.ro; gheorghita.dinca@unitbv.ro,"Dima, Bogdan/N-1048-2016; Dinca, Marius Sorin/Q-2388-2015; DIMA, STEFANA M./N-1626-2016; Dinca, Marius Sorin/AAE-6395-2019","Dima, Bogdan/0000-0002-0820-9904; DIMA, STEFANA M./0000-0003-0452-7216; Dinca, Marius Sorin/0000-0003-0527-3297",,,,,30,8,8,1,16,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

The modification of the estimators and/or of the standard deviations of a given model parameter when identical specifications and computational algorithms are applied on different statistical samples is considered to be its main manifestation. Several sources generating such a phenomenon may be identified: (0 statistical properties of the initial sample (mean, skewness, kurtosis, variance, outliers); (ii) econometric specification (selected explanatory factors and their functional connection with the dependent variables); (iii) changes in statistical data due to revisions; and (iv) dynamic instability, resulted from inherent changeability of real economic behaviours (consumer preferences, risk aversion of investors, households saving propensity, input-output coefficients and sectoral inter-flows, taxation system, domestic institutional context, foreign trade, international financial markets, and many other similar circumstances). For all these types, specific indicators and quantifying methodologies are proposed. As an illustration, we analysed the last version (2012) of the Romanian model, the macroeconomic parameters of which (182) were estimated using two computational algorithms (OLS and 2SLS) for seven samples: initial data for 1990-2011, the same series updated, and subsequent from 1990 to 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016. Possible solutions to attenuate the parameter instability implications are also described, exemplifying them on the Romanian macromodel predictive simulations for 2017-2018 years. Some practical recommendations and further research topics are commented in the final part of the paper.","[Dobrescu, Emilian] Romanian Acad, Costin C Kiritescu Natl Inst Econ Res, Ctr Macroecon Modelling, Bucharest, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences; National Institute for Economic Research Costin C.

However, his definition of preferences as 'total comparative evaluations', I argue, plays into the general disregard that economists have for human psychology. My alternative definition of preferences as 'overall comparative evaluations' - and hence as one of the many factors that influence people's behavior - allows for more adequate causal explanations of people's dutiful, committed, and norm-guided actions. Against Hausman but in agreement with Sen, it also allows for (motivated) counterpreferential choice.","[Engelen, Bart] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Sch Humanities, Tilburg Ctr Log Eth & Philosophy Sci TiLPS, Warandelaan 2, NL-5037 AB Tilburg, Netherlands",Tilburg University,"Engelen, B (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Sch Humanities, Tilburg Ctr Log Eth & Philosophy Sci TiLPS, Warandelaan 2, NL-5037 AB Tilburg, Netherlands.",b.engelen@uvt.nl,"Engelen, Bart/AAS-5476-2021","Engelen, Bart/0000-0002-8915-9768",,,,,53,8,8,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

It is not so often mentioned that people with lower income are very often people with lower education level. And it is well known that mortality of these people is relatively much higher than mortality of people with higher education level. It results in the fact that people with lower income have relatively higher pension but receive it for shorter period in comparison with higher income people. This paper gives model estimations of the total average amount of pension insurance contributions and the total average amount of old-age pension paid distinguished by the level of education.

On the other hand, it may discourage older workers for psychological and sociological reasons. Applying our model to the German labour market, these hypotheses could be confirmed. Even for men, about whom only a few empirical studies on this issue are available, distinguishing between STU and LTU reveals added worker as well as discouragement effects.","[Fuchs, Johann] Inst Employment Res, Res Dept Forecasts & Struct Anal, Weddigenstr 20, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany; [Weber, Enzo] Univ Regensburg, Fac Business Econ & Management Informat Syst, Regensburg, Germany; [Weber, Enzo] Inst Employment Res, Nurnberg, Germany",University of Regensburg,"Fuchs, J (通讯作者)，Inst Employment Res, Res Dept Forecasts & Struct Anal, Weddigenstr 20, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany.",johann.fuchs@iab.de,,,,,,,35,9,10,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Similar to other forms of child care, availability of grandparent-provided child care has positive effects on fertility and mothers' employment. However, grandparent-provided child care requires residing close to parents or in-laws which may imply spatial restrictions for labor markets. We find that West German mothers who reside close to parents or in-laws have lower wages. We build a model of residence choice, fertility decisions, and female labor force participation that can account for the observed relationships. We simulate our model to analyze how women's decisions would change if the availability of grandparent-provided child care or family policies were altered. If out-of-pocket child care costs were lowered to the Swedish level, fertility, mothers' labor force participation, and geographical mobility would increase. If more households had access to free grandparent-provided child care, fertility and mothers' labor force participation would also increase, but geographical mobility would be reduced.

By relying on detailed Belgian-linked employer-employee panel data covering the period 1999-2010, our empirical results exhibit a positive and significant impact of over-education on firm productivity. Moreover, they suggest that the effect of over-education is positively enhanced when the firm implements a CSR process, especially when it aims to have: (i) a good match between job requirements and workers' educational level, (ii) a diverse workforce in terms of gender and age, and (iii) a long-term relationship with its workers. When focussing on required education and over-education, the results suggest that CSR, besides representing an innovative and proactive approach for the firms' stakeholders, may also be beneficial for the firm itself through a bigger increase in productivity for each additional year of required education or over-education.","[Giuliano, R.; Mahy, B.; Vermeylen, G.] Univ Mons, Warocque Sch Business & Econ, Mons, Belgium; [Giuliano, R.; Mahy, B.; Vermeylen, G.] Univ Mons, HumanOrg, Mons, Belgium; [Mahy, B.; Rycx, F.; Vermeylen, G.] Univ Libre Bruxelles, DULBEA, Brussels, Belgium; [Rycx, F.; Vermeylen, G.] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Solvay Brussels Sch, EM, Brussels, Belgium; [Rycx, F.; Vermeylen, G.] Univ Libre Bruxelles, CEB, Brussels, Belgium; [Rycx, F.] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Rycx, F.] Catholic Univ Louvain, Econ Sch Louvain, Louvain, Belgium; [Rycx, F.] Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, Louvain, Belgium",University of Mons; University of Mons; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Vermeylen, G (通讯作者)，Univ Mons UMONS, Pl Warocque 17, B-7000 Mons, Belgium.",Guillaume.Vermeylen@umons.ac.be,"Vermeylen, Guillaume/R-6724-2019","Vermeylen, Guillaume/0000-0001-9641-060X",,,,,75,9,9,0,64,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We employ Bayesian vector autoregressive models that make use of various measures of oil prices and compare the forecasting results of these models with those that do not make use of this data. The real oil price data is also disaggregated into positive and negative components to establish whether this would improve upon the forecasting performance of the model. The full dataset includes quarterly measures of output, consumer prices, exchange rates, interest rates and oil prices, where the initial in-sample period extends from 1979q1 to 1997q4. We then perform recursive estimations and one-to eight-step ahead forecasts over the out-of-sample period 1998q1 to 2014q4. The results suggest that the models that include information relating to oil prices outperform the model that does not include this information, when comparing their out-of-sample properties. In addition, the model with the positive component of oil price tends to perform better than other models over the short to medium horizons. Then lastly, the model that includes both the positive and negative components of the oil price, provides superior forecasts over longer horizons, where the improvement is large enough to ensure that it is the best forecasting model on average. Hence, not only do real oil prices matter when forecasting interest rates, but the use of disaggregate oil price data may facilitate additional improvements. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

High interest of clients in mortgage loans continues due to the low interest rates and the announced reduction in LTV from 95 to 90%. Total number of contracts and their volume still increases. This growing trend is not significantly af-fected by the rising price of real estate or the entry of the new Consumer Credit Act which deals with the early repayment of mortgage loans. Yet, banks and clients ex-pect growth of average interest rates. The aim of the article is to analyse the devel-opment of average interest rate of mortgage loans with an emphasis on their devel-opment in individual regions. This paper aims to create a regression model for the amount of mortgage loans and interest rate including their analysis. Correlation analysis demonstrates the level of dependency of the amount of loans on the interest rate.

Has China's patenting ascendancy been propelled by Chinese firms' increasing technological sophistication or their much greater propensity to seek patents? Using a unique and never before used data set, where the State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) patent records have been matched to their applicant firms by SIPO, we differentiate the two potential explanations by estimating a patent production function and by relating a firm's patents in force to its labor productivity. Our main findings are: 1) while the patenting surge has been an acrossthe-board phenomenon, most of the growth has come from the extensive margin of growth - firms that were not actively applying for patents in the past; 2) the correlation between patents and R & D and that between patents and labor productivity have become weaker, particularly for utility models and for the extensive margin of growth. These results suggest that non-innovation related motives for acquiring patents may have played an important role in the patenting surge.","[Hu, Albert G.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper develops a North-South general equilibrium model in which firms' technology adoption and workers' skill-technology matching are endogenous. Technologically heterogeneous firms in the North make explicit delocalization decisions to the South through FDI and heterogeneous workers endogenously sort into different technologies according to their respective comparative advantages. Findings - This paper highlights how globalization-induced technology-upgrading mechanisms of firms and workers increase aggregate productivity and welfare, though at the cost of increased income inequalities. The model shows also that the same technological shock (favoring high-tech firms) leads to different results in closed and open economy: both technology up-and downgrading occur in closed economy, while technology upgrading prevails in open economy. Originality/value - By modeling and exploring the technology-skill links in a North-South setting, this paper provides richer predictions on the implications of outward FDI. In particular, the model highlights that the initial openness degree of the economy matters: the more open the country initially, the more technology upgrading as globalization proceeds, leading to higher aggregate productivity and welfare gains.","[Jung, Jaewon] Korea Econ Res Inst, Seoul, South Korea",,"Jung, J (通讯作者)，Korea Econ Res Inst, Seoul, South Korea.",ecoase@gmail.com,,,,,,,19,2,2,0,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

That limitation may promote more effective monitoring of bank managers by shareholders which can, in turn, explain previous findings of superior performance among Sub-S banks. The present research focuses on the possibility that the shareholder limitation also constrains opportunities for bank growth, or a slow growth hypothesis for Sub-S banks. Using a differences-in-differences regression approach for a sample of community banks (i.e., less than $1b in assets) from 2004 to 2014, and controlling for initial assets and urban location, it is found that annual growth in real assets and equity was significantly higher among banks that never held Sub-S status than for banks that always held Sub-S status, and that banks switching to Sub-S later grew significantly faster than those that always held Sub-S status. Fixed effects regressions show that switching to Sub-S status significantly reduced equity growth, with asset growth significantly reduced after 2008. In conjunction with earlier findings, the results suggest that the availability of Sub-S status helped to protect and strengthen community banks across a time period including substantial financial turmoil.","[Kashian, Russ] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Whitewater, WI 53190 USA; [Cummings, Richard G.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Accounting, Whitewater, WI 53190 USA; [Westort, Peter] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Accounting, Oshkosh, WI 54901 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin System,"Kashian, R (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Whitewater, WI 53190 USA.",kashianr@uww.edu,,,W.K.

The authors carry out empirical analysis on how localization of foreign subsidiaries ultimately affects the performance of foreign subsidiaries. Design/methodology/approach - This study is an empirical analysis on the determinants of staff localization and the relationship between staff localization and corporate performance. In this study, the five hypotheses were proposed and tested using survey data. The authors randomly selected a total of 800 companies as subjects and conducted a survey. The final 222 survey data including HQs and subsidiaries were used for empirical analysis. The statistical analyses such as reliability test, factor analysis and regression were used. Findings - This study shows that there was a higher level of staff localization by the foreign subsidiary when the investment goal was market-oriented investment, the Korean foreign subsidiary had stronger local network embeddedness and there was better HQ-subsidiary communication. In addition, the relationship between localization and subsidiary performance shows an inverted U-shape. Such results will give various implications to companies. Originality/value - The research that takes a multilayered consideration on factors of the HQ, subsidiaries, and the HQ-subsidiary relationship is rare. To overcome such limitations, this study carried out a survey in order to find more in-depth decision factors. Specifically, this study analyzed the effects of three large aspects of investment goals and corporate culture from the aspect of the HQ, local network embeddedness from the aspect of foreign subsidiaries, and the level of HQ-subsidiary communication from the aspect of HQ-subsidiary relations, and how they affect staff localization.","[Kim, Byoung-Goo] Hanshin Univ, Dept Global Business, Osan, South Korea; [Kim, Gyu-Bae] Daejeon Univ, Dept Business Adm, Daejeon, South Korea",Hanshin University; Daejeon University,"Kim, GB (通讯作者)，Daejeon Univ, Dept Business Adm, Daejeon, South Korea.",gyubaekim@empal.com,,,Daejeon University Research Grants,Daejeon University Research Grants,This research was supported by the Daejeon University Research Grants (2015).,,95,4,4,0,26,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

This paper aims to present conclusions from an analysis of principles of non-financial reporting and the prevailing reporting practices employed by enterprises posing risks to the environment. The following research hypothesis is postulated: identification of environmental threats is the cause of non-financial reporting. In order to verify the hypothesis and attain the objectives, the following questions needed to be addressed: What are forms of reporting non-financial information? What is the scope of non-financial information reported? Tanneries have been selected for the purposes of the study. The tanning industry is regarded as a major threat to the natural environment - ranking 4th among the Ten Top Toxic Industries according to the Blacksmith Institute (2016). Environmental considerations have a substantial impact on operation of tanneries, therefore, and, in line with the said hypothesis, this should contribute to non-financial reporting.

Peirce's (1839-1914) philosophical thought and how he articulated these ideas within his understanding of evolution. In this article, I aim to provide a descriptive alternative that enables an articulation of the relationship between Veblen's concept of science and the methodological principles supporting his conception of evolutionary economics. Relatedly, I seek to explain how Veblen developed his vision of the logic of scientific research starting from the association between his 1884 paper, Kant's Critique of Judgment, and the Peircean concept of abductive inference. Referencing a broader set of his works, I present Veblen's understanding of Darwinian evolution, focusing on how he combined the concepts of cumulative causation and unit of selection characterizing his conception of process. Finally, I rely on Carlo Ginzburg's concept of evidential paradigm to show how this idea not only justifies an abductive understanding of science, but also stands as a necessary principle for describing evolutionary processes. In this sense, I point to the evidential paradigm and Veblen's abductive foundation both (i) as a promising epistemological model that integrates Veblenian concepts of science and evolution and (ii) as a descriptive reference for evolutionary economics.","[Luz, Manuel Ramon Souza] Univ Fed ABC, Econ, Santo Andre, SP, Brazil",Universidade Federal do ABC (UFABC),"Luz, MRS (通讯作者)，Univ Fed ABC, Econ, Santo Andre, SP, Brazil.",,"Souza Luz, Manuel Ramon/CAJ-3470-2022",,,,,,46,2,2,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

An empirical illustration shows that deviations from CIP are observed whenever published data are used, but these deviations disappear when transaction data are used instead.

A key question is whether large shocks to macroeconomic variables will have permanent effects-i.e., in econometric terms, do the data contain stochastic trends? Unobserved-components models provide a convenient way to estimate stochastic trends for time series data, with their existence typically motivated by stationarity tests that allow at most a deterministic trend under the null hypothesis. However, given the small sample sizes available for most macroeconomic variables, standard Lagrange multiplier tests of stationarity will perform poorly when the data are highly persistent. To address this problem, we propose the use of a likelihood ratio test of stationarity based directly on the unobserved-components models used in estimation of stochastic trends. We demonstrate that a bootstrap version of this test has far better small-sample properties for empirically relevant data-generating processes than bootstrap versions of the standard Lagrange multiplier tests. An application to U.S. real GDP produces stronger support for the presence of large permanent shocks using the likelihood ratio test than using the standard tests.","[Morley, James] Univ New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Panovska, Irina B.] Lehigh Univ, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Sinclair, Tara M.] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA",University of New South Wales Sydney; Lehigh University; George Washington University,"Sinclair, TM (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Dept Econ, Monroe Hall 340,2115 G St NW, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",tsinc@gwu.edu,"Morley, James C/J-9166-2012; Sinclair, Tara M/I-2772-2019","Sinclair, Tara M/0000-0002-1990-3264; Morley, James/0000-0003-2380-6747; Panovska, Irina/0000-0002-6297-3452","Murray Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy; Institute for International Economic Policy (IIEP) of the Elliott School at George Washington University; UFF/CCAS fund at George Washington University","Murray Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy; Institute for International Economic Policy (IIEP) of the Elliott School at George Washington University; UFF/CCAS fund at George Washington University","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the Murray Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy for this project, as well as support from the Institute for International Economic Policy (IIEP) of the Elliott School and the UFF/CCAS fund at George Washington University.

This paper shows how to utilize such an equilibrium model to improve the efficiency of individual estimators. In comparison with existing related approaches, this simple framework lends itself naturally to modern medium scale dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models. Not only does the derived estimator exhibit smaller asymptotic variance than equation-by-equation GMM, it also tends to be less prone to small sample distortions from weak identification.","[Morris, Stephen D.] Bowdoin Coll, Dept Econ, 9700 Coll Stn, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA",Bowdoin College,"Morris, SD (通讯作者)，Bowdoin Coll, Dept Econ, 9700 Coll Stn, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA.",smorris@bowdoin.edu,,,,,,,49,0,0,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Separately, when an economic crisis arises, expenditure adjustment is a more appropriate fiscal instrument. In the medium and long term, the taxation system for individuals is recommended to be used to control for budgetary deficits during crisis.

On the one hand, this scepticism persists. But the rejection of experiments is not that wide as before. More economists are searching for situations and questions in which an experiment might offer a feasible and desirable approach. In this paper, I will first offer an overview of what experiments are and what goal and design follows.

In this article, we propose a new theoretical model where it is the workers who decide the amount they wish to invest in human capital, taking into account the costs of acquiring those skills, for the purpose of maximizing earnings. In this model, both human capital and marginal productivity are likely to be influenced by the individual's (unobserved) characteristics such as ability or motivation, potentially giving rise to endogeneity problems. In this context, the empirical implementation of our theoretical model allows us, under certain assumptions, to obtain consistent estimates even under the assumption of endogeneity. We present an empirical application to the education sector using data from the Spanish Structure of Earnings Survey 2010.

While total balances in 529 plans now exceed $250 billion, less than 3.0 percent of households have a 529 plan. And the majority of 529 plan accounts are held by the wealthiest households. Low- and middle-income households receive little tax savings from investing in 529 plans, and some states count these plans against financial aid. Also, 529 plans are complicated, rules vary by state, and fund management fees tend to be high.

This paper presents new evidence on the relationship between political factors and tax design in European countries. For the period 1995-2012, we find that, when the country's ruling coalition is left-wing, income taxes become more relevant. Moreover, when the largest government party is more powerful, the share of property taxes over GDP increases, while the number of seats held by the second government party is positively associated with the level of consumption taxes over GDP. We also find that a more powerful government is associated with a lower top tax rate of the personal income tax (PIT). Building upon this evidence, we review the main arguments developed by the empirical political economy literature on taxation and discuss the role of political factors in fundamental issues of taxation: redistribution and progressivity; tax design and its impact on growth; tax complexity; tax administration; tax competition; and the need for tax reforms.","[Profeta, Paola] Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy; [Profeta, Paola; Scabrosetti, Simona] DONDENA, Milan, Italy; [Profeta, Paola] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Scabrosetti, Simona] Univ Pavia, Pavia, Italy",Bocconi University; Bocconi University; Ifo Institut; University of Pavia,"Profeta, P (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy.;Profeta, P (通讯作者)，DONDENA, Milan, Italy.;Profeta, P (通讯作者)，CESifo, Munich, Germany.",,,"SCABROSETTI, SIMONA/0000-0002-0142-6439",,,,,63,6,6,1,8,INST ESTUDIOS FISCALES,MADRID,"AVDA CARDENAL HERRERA ORIA, 378, MADRID, 28035, SPAIN",0210-1173,,,HACIENDA PUBLICA ESP,Hacienda Publica Esp.,,2017,,220,,,,,139,172,,10.7866/HPE-RPE.17.1.5,0.0,,,34,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FQ0CG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418016900005,0

Using Australian panel data, we infer an individual's level of economic insecurity as a function of exposure to various financial risks and employ regression equations to explore its effect upon current period body mass index (BMI) scores. Estimates reveal that a sustained standard deviation increase in economic insecurity raises an individual's BMI at a rate of approximately 0.35 units per year. Quantile regressions are then used to estimate the sensitivity of body weight to insecurity at different percentiles of the distribution and we find that persons who are overweight and obese are much more seriously affected. This implies that shocks that make individuals more financially vulnerable can generate harmful self-sustaining cycles of risk and weight gain. We also model the dynamics of insecurity and show that it is a persistent phenomenon for persons with high levels of exposure and lower incomes. This finding indicates that persons of lower socio-economic status are more likely to encounter vicious cycles of increasing insecurity and obesity, which partially explains why weight-related health problems are unusually highly concentrated amongst these individuals.","[Rohde, Nicholas] Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Gold Coast, Australia; [Tang, K.

The model is adapted from Buraimo and Simmons (2015) who concluded that star quality was an important determinant of television audiences for the EPL over the 2000-2008 period, whereas uncertainty of outcome and championship, Europe and relegation contention were not. Their measures for contention are replaced by indicators based on Scelles et al.'s (2013b, 2016) competitive intensity. Results show a significant positive impact of star quality but also championship and Champions League intensity and no significant impact of Europa League, potential Europa League and relegation intensity. Based on these results, the article suggests that the EPL should encourage both star quality and competitive balance so that all teams can be competitive in terms of the title or qualification for the UEFA Champions League.

Prior studies have found early mover regulatory advantages for drugs. I find the opposite for medical devices, where pioneer entrants spend 34% (7.2months) longer than follow-on entrants in regulatory approval. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that the cost of a delay of this length is upwards of 7% of the total cost of bringing a new high-risk device to market. Considering potential explanations, I find that approval times are largely unrelated to technological novelty, but are meaningfully reduced by the publication of objective regulatory guidelines. Finally, I consider how the regulatory process affects small firms' market entry patterns and find that small firms are less likely to be pioneers in new device markets, a fact consistent with relatively higher costs of doing so for more financially constrained firms.

For example, our results indicate that the productivity premium associated with importing technology-intensive products from Taiwan differs from importing unskilled-labor-intensive products from Switzerland. We show that increasing distance and decreasing levels of development of the origin economy are negatively associated with the productivity premia of importing. Similarly, these premia are larger for technology-intensive goods and smaller for unskilled-labor-intensive goods. This implies that the geographic-intensity markets are unique and cannot be lumped together.

However, considering structural changes in two series, we find that the short-run causal nexus between the actual and expected inflation using full-sample data are fraudulent. By adopting a time-varying rolling-window approach to revisiting the dynamic causal relationships, this article identifies that the actual inflation has both positive and negative impacts on the expected inflation in distinct sub-periods. Nevertheless, inflation expectation exerts only negative effects on the actual inflation. The results point out that the self-fulfilment of inflation expectations does not exist.

We employ a cost-based approach to gauge whether a housing market is delivering appropriately priced units. Specifically, we investigate whether market prices (roughly) equal the costs of producing the housing unit. If so, the market is well-functioning in the sense that it efficiently delivers housing units at their production cost. The gap between price and production cost can be understood as a regulatory tax. The available evidence suggests, but does not definitively prove, that the implicit tax on development created by housing regulations is higher in many areas than any reasonable negative externalities associated with new construction. We discuss two main effects of developments in housing prices: on patterns of household wealth and on the incentives for relocation to high-wage, high-productivity areas. Finally, we turn to policy implications.","[Glaeser, Edward] Harvard Univ, Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Gyourko, Joseph] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Real Estate Finance & Business Econ & Publ Policy, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Harvard University; University of Pennsylvania,"Glaeser, E (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",eglaeser@harvard.edu; gyourko@wharton.upenn.edu,,,Taubman Center for State and Local Government at Harvard University; Zell/Lurie Real Estate Center at the Wharton School,Taubman Center for State and Local Government at Harvard University; Zell/Lurie Real Estate Center at the Wharton School,"Edward Glaeser thanks the Taubman Center for State and Local Government at Harvard University for financial support.

Numerous studies analyse the productivity effects of financial development and frictions. The results suggest the following: (1) Financial development likely has favourable effects on productivity growth, (2) financial frictions that impede the efficient flow of finance can mitigate the positive effects through a variety of channels and (3) the magnitudes of productivity costs of financial frictions generally appear modest in financially developed economies but are considerably larger in developing economies. The paper also reviews studies of the influence of specific mechanisms on productivity, such as human capital, corporate finance, financial sector efficiency, equity finance and venture capital. Some policies that hamper productivity growth include inefficient insolvency regimes that impede exit of low-productivity firms, poorly developed contract monitoring and enforcement systems between banks and firms, collateral constraints that impair resource reallocation and imperfect bank supervisory practices that diminish productive capital reallocation through distorted lending practices.","[Heil, Mark] US Dept Treasury, Washington, DC 20220 USA",United States Department of the Treasury,"Heil, M (通讯作者)，US Dept Treasury, Washington, DC 20220 USA.",mark.heil@treasury.gov,,,,,,,79,16,16,2,66,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

The majority of DCEs use a matrix display with one row per attribute and one column per alternative. A comparison by alternatives implies that respondents process the choice task column-by-column. However, evidence from psychology and judgment and decision making research suggest that learned reading patterns dominate and as such the standard matrix display might induce processing by attributes rather than alternatives. We test this using a split sample survey conducted in France where respondents were randomly allocated into a standard or transposed matrix display group. Our results show that there is no difference in relative scale between the two groups, but that elicited preferences differ. Importantly, ASCs are insignificant in the transposed condition. We find no difference in propensity to use simplifying strategies, but respondents in the standard display condition are more likely to choose according to a random regret minimization (RRM) model rather than random utility model (RUM). We discuss the implications of our findings for future discrete choice experiments.","[Sandorf, Erlend Dancke] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Econ, Ctr Environm & Resource Econ, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Sourd, Romain Crastes Dit] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Sourd, Romain Crastes Dit] Univ Leeds, Choice Modelling Ctr, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Mahieu, Pierre-Alexandre] Univ Nantes, LEMNA, Nantes, France",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; University of Leeds; University of Leeds; Nantes Universite,"Sandorf, ED (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Econ, Ctr Environm & Resource Econ, S-90183 Umea, Sweden.",erlend.dancke.sandorf@slu.se,"Sandorf, Erlend Dancke/AAO-4012-2021","Sandorf, Erlend Dancke/0000-0001-7521-4773",Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius foundation; Tore Browaldh foundation [B2015-0490:1]; European Research Council [615596-DECISIONS],Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius foundation; Tore Browaldh foundation; European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)),"The first author acknowledges funding from the Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius foundation, and the Tore Browaldh foundation grant no.

Many economists at this time emphasized the issue of a seemingly unavoidable inflationary pressure at or even below full employment. In contrast, Milton Friedman was convinced that full employment and price stability are not conflicting policy objectives. This dividing line between the two camps ultimately rested on fundamentally different views about the inflationary process: For economists of the 1950s and 1960s cost-push forces are responsible for the apparent conflict between price stability and full employment. On the other hand, Friedman, who regarded inflation to be an exclusively monetary phenomenon, rejected the notion of ongoing inflationary cost-push pressures at full employment. Besides his emphasis on the full adjustment of inflation expectations, this rejection of cost-push theories of inflation, which implied a decoupling of the two previously perceived incompatible policy objectives, was the other important element in Friedman's attack on the Phillips curve tradeoff in his 1967 presidential address to the American Economic Association.","[Schwarzer, Johannes A.] Univ Hohenheim, Econ, Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Schwarzer, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Econ, Stuttgart, Germany.",schwarzer.econ@gmail.com,,,,,,,72,12,12,1,55,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

To optimize China's energy consumption structure, while simultaneously controlling its carbon emissions, this study proposes two models for the analysis of China's energy configuration and energy consumption structure based on the data envelopment analysis (DEA) method. A fixed-sum input DEA model is proposed with which the energy input frontier is determined under consideration of China's energy shortage constraint. Furthermore, an energy consumption structure measurement model is developed to determine the adjustment direction and potential of the current energy consumption structure. The proposed models are further applied for the practical energy consumption structure evaluation in Chinese provinces. The obtained results show that almost all provinces suffer from an inefficient energy configuration and Eastern China experiences severe energy shortage. In addition, all provinces currently have unreasonable energy consumption structures. In particular, the proportion of gas consumption to total energy usage should be increased in all provinces. Furthermore, Chinese provinces with inefficient energy structures exhibit the geographical feature. The coal adjustment ratios in the central and western regions account for 70% of the total, which is much higher than the coal adjustment rate of the eastern region (50%). Based on these results, policies are also suggested to adjust China's energy consumption structure, such as reducing high carbon energy, implementing energy price reform, carbon tax, and clean energy subsidy.

This literature assumes that legislators decide on all dimensions of government spending once and for all in a period during budget negotiations. However, legislators leave allocation decision of some funds to the executive authority and let it adjust government spending according to changing priorities in a year under certain restrictions. In this paper, the author develops a legislative-bargaining model to investigate the effects of budget flexibility on government spending and welfare. In addition, he analyzes how legislators choose the level of flexibility. He shows that, if legislators decide on all dimensions of government spending, high polarization leads to greater government spending. However, if the executive authority allocates government resources, high polarization leads to lower government spending. Besides, when the executive authority allocates government resources under high polarization, legislators cannot use their political power to induce overprovision of their preferred public good. When legislators can choose the level of budget flexibility, if the probability of polarization is high they prefer to control all dimensions of government spending. The author shows that budget flexibility benefits society only under high probability of polarization.","[Yasar, Sezer] TED Univ, Ankara, Turkey",Ted University,"Yasar, S (通讯作者)，TED Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06420 Ankara, Turkey.",sezer.yasar@tedu.edu.tr,,"Yasar, Sezer/0000-0002-5704-101X",,,,,43,0,0,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Employing a Marxian analytical framework, the article argues that the acceleration of privatization in Turkey in the post-2001 period was the result of a powerful combination of support from the power bloc (i.e., fractions of capital) in Turkey, which has been achieved with a major subordination of labor. The power bloc saw previously unavailable advantages in supporting privatization within the context of the post-2001 domestic capital accumulation regime, and therefore acted to restructure the legal and institutional framework of the state to weaken the resistance of labor and facilitate the participation of potential investors in privatization tenders. This interpretation challenges the dominance of institutionalist accounts, which draw on the legal-institutional framework and/or national interest-based discourses without considering how the changing relations among different fractions of capital and between capital and labor within the constitutive dynamics of domestic capital accumulation exerted significant influence on the acceleration of privatization.","[Zaifer, Ahmet] Univ Kyrenia, Kyrenia, Northern Cyprus, Turkey",,"Zaifer, A (通讯作者)，Univ Kyrenia, Dept Int Relat, Kyrenia, Northern Cyprus, Turkey.",ahmet_zaifer@yahoo.com,"Zaifer, Ahmet/L-2432-2019","Zaifer, Ahmet/0000-0003-0985-5083",,,,,68,6,6,1,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

We observe variations in trade patterns across countries and films and explore how they affect cultural diversity. We find that the EU film market is highly fragmented and cross-border film availability in cinema is low. We explore different aspects of the cultural discount hypothesis by means of a standard Helpman and Krugman (Market structure and foreign trade. Increasing returns, imperfect competition, and the international economy, MIT Press, Cambridge, 1985) trade model with economies of scale and a two-stage Heckman (Econometrica 47(1):153-161, 1979) estimation procedure. Our results show that cultural distance, success in the home market and the size of the film budget influence trade of films between countries. US films have a lower propensity to get into export markets, relative to their success in the home market. Consumer demand for imported films is relatively smaller in large EU economies, except for films imported from the USA that are only marginally affected. We also show that trade patterns in online film distribution are not fundamentally different. As online distribution occurs downstream from theatrical release, online distributors can benefit from cinema market experience to make a better selection of films. This results in a lower impact of domestic market shares on online trade patterns.","[Alaveras, Georgios; Gomez-Herrera, Estrella; Martens, Bertin] European Commiss Joint Res Ctr, Digital Econ Unit, Seville 341092, Spain",,"Gomez-Herrera, E (通讯作者)，European Commiss Joint Res Ctr, Digital Econ Unit, Seville 341092, Spain.",Estrella.GOMEZ-HERRERA@ec.europa.eu,,"Gomez Herrera, Estrella/0000-0002-6662-513X",,,,,42,8,9,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

Using a methodology based on the idea of heterogeneous firms, this paper studies the degree to which firm heterogeneity and resource misallocation can explain the lower TFP in southeast Europe. The results show a significant degree of heterogeneity and resource misallocation, although the results are sensitive to the calibration used. There is evidence that firm-level productivity depends on firm size, while taxation negatively influences it. There is also some evidence that foreign-owned firms are more competitive, as are exporting firms. Results are generally robust across the various specifications used, but less so relative to the measure of productivity used. Additional evidence suggests that infrastructure-related obstacles as well as institutional instability drive the output distortion, while no factor is underlined as a significant driver of capital distortions, suggesting the need for better data sources for the latter.","[Caraiani, Petre] Romanian Acad, Inst Econ Forecasting, Bucharest, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences,"Caraiani, P (通讯作者)，Romanian Acad, Inst Econ Forecasting, Bucharest, Romania.",caraiani@ipe.ro,"Caraiani, Petre/E-9082-2018","Caraiani, Petre/0000-0002-7526-580X",wiiw Global Development Network Southeast Europe-Research Competition 2014/2015,wiiw Global Development Network Southeast Europe-Research Competition 2014/2015,This paper has been funded through wiiw Global Development Network Southeast Europe-Research Competition 2014/2015.,,18,2,2,2,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,NOV,2018,45.0,4,,,,,707,745,,10.1007/s10663-017-9387-1,0.0,,,39,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GX1UO,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447504200004,0

This paper studies the maxmin and Bayesian foundations of dominant strategy mechanisms in general social choice environments with quasi-linear preferences and private values. We propose a condition called the uniform shortest-path tree that, under regularity, ensures the foundations of dominant-strategy mechanisms. This exposes the underlying logic of the existence of such foundations in the single-unit auction setting, and extends the argument to cases where it was hitherto unknown. To prove this result, we adopt the linear programming approach to mechanism design. In settings in which the uniform shortest-path tree condition is violated, maxmin/Bayesian foundations might not exist. We illustrate this by two examples: bilateral trade with ex ante unidentified traders and auction with type-dependent outside option. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We refine the analysis using data at the quarterly-level to define relevant co-integrating relationships across a number of European economies. Housing, GDP and credit cross-sectional averages are included in the analysis to detect the effects of common factors. Empirical results indicate the presence of cross-country heterogeneities and an uneven feedback mechanism between credit and housing - the full loop is established only for several countries in the dataset. Grouping countries for panel-like econometric exercises may lead to spurious regression results, poor inference and misleading policy implications. Short-run dynamics, compared to the long-run may often lead to contradicting policy advice if the order of integration of the house price series is not properly accounted for. Furthermore, the presence of spatial patterns of house prices and credit highlight the need to consider global housing and credit developments for national policy making.

We solve the model numerically and find that price coordination between the two products of the merged firm tends to stimulate innovation, while internalization of the innovation externality depresses it. The latter effect is stronger in our simulations and, as a result, the merger leads to lower innovation incentives for the merged entity, absent cost efficiencies and knowledge spillovers.

An empirical optimal taxation exercise,ECONOMIC MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Basic income; Negative income tax; Optimal tax; Micro-simulation; Welfare,OPTIMAL INCOME TAXATION; WELFARE ANALYSIS; TAX; EMPLOYMENT; BENEFITS; DESIGN,"We present an exercise in empirical optimal taxation applied to a Negative Tax with Flat Tax reform for a sample of eight European countries: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom. Two popular approaches to empirical optimal taxation are the structural analytical approach and the non-tructural sufficient statistics approach. This paper presents a different approach that combines structural microeconometric modelling, behavioural microsimulation and numerical optimization. For each country, we estimate a microeconometric model of labour supply for both couples and singles. A procedure that simulates the households' choices under given tax-transfer rules is then embedded in a constrained optimization program in order to identify optimal rules under the public budget constraint. The optimality criterion is the class of Kohn's social welfare function. The tax-transfer rules considered as candidates are members of a class that includes as special cases various versions of the Negative Income Tax: Conditional (means-tested) Basic Income, Unconditional Basic Income, In-Work Benefits and General Negative Income Tax, combined with a Flat Tax above the exemption level. The analysis in most cases show that: the General Negative Income Tax strictly dominates the other rules, including the current ones; the Unconditional Basic Income policy is better than the Conditional Basic Income policy; Conditional Basic Income policy may lead to a significant reduction in labour supply and poverty-trap effects; In-Work-Benefit policy is strictly dominated by the General Negative Income Tax and by the Unconditional Basic Income. We also exemplify the possibility of identifying the mapping between the contry-specific primitives (social preferences, productivity, public budget constraint, labour supply elasticity and Gini coefficient) and the optimal tax-transfer rules.","[Islam, Nizamul; Colombino, Ugo] LISER, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Colombino, Ugo] Univ Torino, Turin, Italy; [Colombino, Ugo] CHILD, Turin, Italy; [Colombino, Ugo] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Turin; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Colombino, U (通讯作者)，Univ Torino, Dept Econ & Stat, Turin, Italy.",ugo.colombino@unito.it,"Colombino, Ugo/E-9866-2013","Colombino, Ugo/0000-0002-0194-2943; Islam, Nizamul/0000-0002-1152-8623",European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation 'Easi',European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation 'Easi',"This is part of a research project (Optimal Tax Rules in Europe: A Micro -simulation Approach -OTaRiE) at LISER that involves Philippe Van Kerm (LISER and University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg), Nizamul Islam (LISER, Luxembourg), Denise Maria Sologon (LISER, Luxembourg), Ugo Colombino (University of Turin, Italy), Lennart Flood (Gothenburg University, Sweden), Francesco Figari (University of Insubria, Italy).

First, a price cap leads to rationing, which reduces the net surplus in the short-term. Second, under imperfect competition, which is precisely when price caps are required, imposing a price cap may lead to higher installed capacity in the long-term, which could then increase net surplus. To my best knowledge, this article is the first to examine the total impact of price caps on net surplus, combining their impact on rationing and on investment incentives. This analysis clarifies the difference between capacity-and surplus-maximizing caps, and provides a sufficient condition for the existence of price cap yielding higher net surplus than no price cap. On the simple example presented in Section 3, a price cap low enough to be politically acceptable reduces surplus compared to no price cap. Should further research confirms this finding for other specifications, the appeal of price caps for policy makers would be reduced. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

On the contrary, a new class of indicators, comparing credit levels to structural benchmarks, has good capacity to correctly predict financial crises in economies in the early stages of financial development.","[Marchettini, Daniela; Maino, Rodolfo] Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Marchettini, D (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",dmarchettini@imf.org,,,,,,,51,1,1,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

The purpose of this study is to define a quantitative index to determine the sectoral infrastructure that the different states in Mexico have. Methodology: The index is estimated through the weighted average of indicators, proving the suitability of the sample through tests and multivariate analysis techniques, and calculating the specific weights of each indicator through principal components. Results: The estimated composite index allows for a measurement designed exclusively to detect the advance or lag in infrastructure provision. Conclusions: An index to determine the sectoral infrastructure at state level is estimated.

Evidence from a social trading platform,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Social trading; Disposition effect; Scopic regime; Retail trading; Foreign exchange; Behavioral bias,PERFORMANCE; BEHAVIOR,"A scopic regime constitutes a state of permanent reciprocal observation and scrutiny among participants. We investigate whether this environment reduces the disposition effect among retail traders as they are constantly scrutinized by others, thus driving them to realize and limit their losses. We use two anonymous data sets, the first from a popular social trading platform (STP) governed by a scopic regime, and the second from a traditional foreign exchange broker. STPs allow participants to interact and copy each other's trades using mirror trading, thus implicitly creating two groups; trade leaders who execute unique trades to build their performance record, and copiers who allocate funds to be managed by the former. We find ample evidence of a weaker disposition effect among trade leaders in the scopic environment compared to traders in a traditional setting.

In a theoretical framework, we model overleveraging and demonstrate how a highly leveraged banking system can lead to unstable dynamics and downward spirals. Inspired by models developed by Brunnermeier, Sannikov and Stein, we empirically measure the deviation-from-optimal-leverage for a sample of large EU banks. This measure of overleveraging is used to condition the joint dynamics of credit flows and macroeconomic activity in a large-scale regime change model: a Threshold Mixed-Cross-Section Global Vector Autoregressive (T-MCS-GVAR). The regime-switching component of the model is meant to make the relationship between credit and real activity dependent on the extent to which the banking system is overleveraged. We find significant nonlinearities as a function of overleverage. The farther the observed leverage in the banking system from optimal leverage, the more detrimental is the effect of a deleveraging shock on credit supply and economic activity.","[Gross, Marco; Henry, Jerome] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany; [Semmler, Willi] New Sch Social Res, New York, NY 10011 USA; [Semmler, Willi] Univ Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany",European Central Bank; The New School; University of Bielefeld,"Semmler, W (通讯作者)，New Sch Social Res, Dept Econ, Econ, New York, NY 10011 USA.",semmlerw@newschool.edu,,"Gross, Marco/0000-0003-2097-6740; Semmler, Willi/0000-0002-8384-8159",,,,,32,10,10,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

We empirically analyze auto ABS in Europe and the U.S. with a focus on loan and lease transactions. We find that the European market did not differentiate between loan and lease contracts as collateral for ABS, while the U.S. market significantly preferred prime loans over lease contracts. If leasing becomes more common in Europe, too, we expect that investors will react more sensitively to changes in the composition of auto ABS and require higher yields resulting in worse refinancing conditions for European ABS.

Using data on Connecticut's Jobs First experiment, we find no evidence of behavioral-induced participation at the highest conditional quantiles of earnings. We offer a simple explanation for this: women assigned to Jobs First incur welfare participation costs to labor supply at higher earnings where the control group is welfare ineligible. Moreover, as expected, behavioral components and costs of program participation do not seem to play a differential role at other conditional quantiles where both groups are eligible to participate. Our findings show that a welfare program imposes an estimated cost up to 10 percent of quarterly earnings, and these costs can be heterogeneous throughout the conditional earnings distribution. The evidence is obtained by employing a semi-parametric panel quantile estimator for a model that allows women to vary arbitrarily in costs of participating in welfare programs.","[Hartley, Robert Paul] Columbia Univ, Ctr Poverty & Social Policy, 1255 Amsterdam Ave,Room 730, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Lamarche, Carlos] Univ Kentucky, Gatton Coll Business & Econ 223G, Dept Econ, Lexington, KY 40506 USA",Columbia University; University of Kentucky,"Lamarche, C (通讯作者)，Univ Kentucky, Gatton Coll Business & Econ 223G, Dept Econ, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.",rh2845@columbia.edu; clamarche@uky.edu,"Hartley, Robert/ABD-5314-2020","Hartley, Robert Paul/0000-0002-5640-9169",,,,,53,2,2,0,5,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5371,1879-1034,,LABOUR ECON,Labour Econ.,OCT,2018,54.0,,,,,,135,151,,10.1016/j.labeco.2018.08.002,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GX2VC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447577200009,0

Under a constant relative risk aversion assumption, the sample average for the coefficient of relative risk aversion is 3.8 with standard deviation 2.3. This number is then contrasted to that for five other OECD countries where risk attitudes have been measured using the same instrument and also prior to the financial crisis: Chile, France, Italy, the Netherlands and the USA. When we relate this distribution for stated relative risk aversion to that for generosity of social insurance and the risks related to employment and health expenditure, a picture emerges suggesting that more extensive welfare states induce higher risk tolerance for foreground risksa relationship that is in line with the theory on risk vulnerability.","[Schroyen, Fred] NHH Norwegian Sch Econ, Bergen, Norway; [Aarbu, Karl Ove] Tryg Insurance, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Aarbu, Karl Ove] NHH, Bergen, Norway",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Schroyen, F (通讯作者)，NHH Norwegian Sch Econ, Bergen, Norway.",,,,,,,,80,5,5,2,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,OCT,2018,85.0,340,,,,,846,872,,10.1111/ecca.12267,0.0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GS8DK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000443937500007,0

Child labor is not a negligible social phenomenon in China; about 7.74% of children aged from 10 to 15 were working in 2010, and they worked for 6.75 h per day on average, and spent 6.42 h less per day on study than other children. About 90% of child laborers were still in school and combined economic activity with schooling. Our results show that child labor participation is positively associated with school dropout rate. A child living in a rural area is more likely to work. Compared with place of residence, the gender of a child are less important. The educational level of the household head and its interaction with the gender of the household head seem to be unimportant. However, household assets per capita and household involvement in non-agricultural activities are negatively related to the incidence of child labor. A child from a household with more adults is less likely to work. The prevalence of child labor in China exhibits significant regional variations. The child labor incidence is correlated with the development level of each region: the Western region has the highest percentage of child labor, followed by the Eastern and Central regions.

First, the variation in log real hourly wages is decomposed into three components reflecting worker, firm, and job title characteristics and a residual element. It is found that worker permanent heterogeneity is the most important source of wage variation accounting for one third of the wage variance, while firm permanent effects contribute one fourth. Job title fixed effects still explain a considerable one fifth of wage variance. Second, having established that high-wage workers tend to match with high-paying firms, worker fixed effects from the wage equation are next correlated with firm fixed effects from sales and value-added production equations to provide unambiguous evidence on the sign and strength of assortative matching. The correlations are positive and large, indicating that higher productivity workers tend to match with higher productivity firms.","[Torres, Sonia] Stat Portugal, Lisbon, Portugal; [Portugal, Pedro; Guimaraes, Paulo] Banco Portugal, Lisbon, Portugal; [Portugal, Pedro; Guimaraes, Paulo] Univ South Carolina, Columbia, SC USA; [Portugal, Pedro; Addison, John T.; Guimaraes, Paulo] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Addison, John T.] Univ Durham, Durham, England; [Guimaraes, Paulo] Univ Porto, Porto, Portugal; [Portugal, Pedro] Nova SBE, Lisbon, Portugal",Banco de Portugal; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Durham University; Universidade do Porto; Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Guimaraes, P (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Porto, Portugal.",sonia.torres@ine.pt; pportugal@bportugal.pt; ecceaddi@moore.sc.edu; pfguimaraes@bportugal.pt,"Portugal, Pedro/M-7216-2019; Guimaraes, Paulo D/A-7085-2008","Portugal, Pedro/0000-0001-8298-6683; Guimaraes, Paulo D/0000-0002-2992-1028",,,,,49,7,8,0,13,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5371,1879-1034,,LABOUR ECON,Labour Econ.,OCT,2018,54.0,,,,,,47,60,,10.1016/j.labeco.2018.06.004,0.0,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GX2VC,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447577200004,0

We develop a duopoly game and investigate how problem parameters affect the equilibrium outcome. We find that carbon price and consumer awareness level have an additive effect on a firm's emissions abatement effort. However, these two factors have different implications for the firms' prices and profits. In particular, the firms' prices first decrease and then increase with consumer awareness level, while the firms' profits first decrease and then increase with carbon price when there is a moderate emissions cap. From both the consumers' and the firms' standpoints, an appropriate emissions abatement strategy for the central planner is to first push up the carbon price and then promote consumer carbon awareness. Such a strategy provides incentives for firms to invest in carbon abatement activities, without causing drastic changes to product prices and firm profits. Finally, we generalize the base model to consider more than two firms. It has been found that raising carbon price may be a better policy choice than promoting consumer awareness for the central planner who aims at reducing carbon emissions in various industries with different competition levels.

We classify countries based on the fluctuations of economic indicators (GDP, interest rate, inflation, monetary aggregate, unemployment and exchange rate) and according of strategies implemented to deal with adverse effects of the crises. We employ Kohonen Self-Organizing Map (SOM) which is an unsupervised neural network algorithm that projects high dimensional data. Results of SOM show the optimal map represented by 56 micro-classes (cells or neurons) and five areas of grouping countries thus defining five principal different economic situations. Classification was done by level of development, evolutions of economic indicators, and by period. Each group of countries classified in the same cell implies that these countries have suffered similar effects of the crisis on economic indicators or they have applied a same strategy to fight against the crisis. Also, the results showed that changes in GDP, exchange rate, monetary aggregate M2, and inflation are the main characteristics of classification. We define the period of the global shock as running from 2008 to early 2010, which can explain why we find stronger results than earlier papers such as Obstfeld et al.

We show that the impulse responses obtained with the suggested non-recursive identification scheme are quite similar to those conditional on a recursive VAR estimated with pre-1984 data. In contrast, recursive vs. non-recursive identification schemes return different short-run responses of output and investment during the Great Moderation.

Various sources of evidence regarding the time profile of inequality are examined and do not always fit the common view that inequality is trending upward everywhere. Overall, changes in inequality appear to be very country-specific. The same conclusion does obtain when examining the causes of these changes. There is little doubt that there are common forces affecting the distribution of income in most countries, but idiosyncratic factors have enhanced their effects in some cases and offset them in others. Country specificity also holds with regard to policies aimed at correcting inequality, even though globalization imposes constraints on some key redistribution instruments like taxation and the regulation of financial markets. International coordination and, in particular, more transparency in cross-border financial operations are needed for governments to recover some autonomy in these matters.","[Bourguignon, Francois] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France",Paris School of Economics,"Bourguignon, F (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France.",francois.bourguignon@psemail.eu,,,,,,,43,17,19,2,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1610-241X,1612-7501,,CESIFO ECON STUD,CESifo Econ.

We obtain explicit links between persistent gaps in productivity growth and the incentives of resource-exporting (importing) countries to subsidize (tax) domestic resource use. The exporters' incentive to subsidize hinges on slower productivity growth and is disconnected from the importers' incentive to tax resource inflows-i.e., rent extraction. Moreover, faster productivity growth exacerbates the importers' incentive to tax, beyond the rent-extraction motive. In a strategic tax game, the only equilibrium is of Stackelberg type and features, for a wide range of parameter values, positive exporters' subsidies and positive importers' taxes at the same time.","[Bretschger, Lucas] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Econ Res, Zurich, Switzerland; [Valente, Simone] Univ East Anglia, Sch Econ, ARTS 3-50, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of East Anglia,"Valente, S (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Sch Econ, ARTS 3-50, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",s.valente@uea.ac.uk,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Our analyses show that the period 1846-1947 was characterized by economy-wide skill-upgrading due to an increase in the demand for skilled relative to unskilled workers because of skill-biased technological change (SBTC). The period 1947-81 is characterized by particularly high labour market turbulence, in part due to a gradual switch from economywide skill-upgrading to job polarization. Consequently, the impact of the ongoing Digital Revolution on labour markets after 1980 is not uniquely characterized by exceptionally high labour market turbulence but by the nature of changes in the composition of jobs, namely a process of job polarization. To explain job polarization, the paper discusses the hypothesis of Routine-Biased Technological Change (RBTC) that has recently emerged in the academic literature.","[Buyst, Erik] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; [Goos, Maarten; Salomons, Anna] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands",KU Leuven; Utrecht University,"Buyst, E (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.",erik.buyst@kuleuven.be; m.goos@uu.nl; a.m.salomons@uu.nl,,,Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research under the Veni scheme,Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research under the Veni scheme,"We thank John Muellbauer, Abigail Adams, and seminar participants at Oxford University for excellent suggestions.

The optimal mechanism is found by choosing the coefficients of the polynomial subject to a resource constraint.

The method for selecting the smoothing parameter (bandwidth) here is analogous to the plug-in method in kernel density estimation. It requires initial pilot values of the bandwidth to obtain the optimal bandwidth. However, this method has the disadvantage of not being fully data-driven.

When subjects play a random sequence of games with differing order statistics, play is less sensitive to the order statistic than when a fixed order statistic is used throughout. This is consistent with the prediction of a simple learning model with transfer. If subjects play a series of similar stag hunt games, play converges to the payoff dominant equilibrium when a convention emerges, replicating the main result of Rankin et al. (Games Econ Behav 32:315-337, 2000). When these subjects subsequently play a random sequence of order statistic games, play is shifted towards the payoff dominant equilibrium relative to subjects without previous experience.

The main explanatory variables tested are a composite indicator of economic and financial activities, distance, membership of the Eurozone (EZ), and country risk measured by treasury bond yields. The results indicate that Portugal has a high level of integration in the European banking market as distance is not statistically significant, and that the membership of the EZ facilitates the financing of the economy. The economic size of the partner country becomes non-significant after controlling for country fixed effects. The increase in the Portuguese country risk during the European sovereign debt crisis led to a marked decline in external financing, indicating that this is an important channel of transmission of crises.","[da Costa, Raquel R.] Banco Portugal, Lisbon, Portugal; [Lagoa, Sergio] Inst Univ Lisboa, ISCTE, Lisbon, Portugal",Banco de Portugal; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"da Costa, RR (通讯作者)，Banco Portugal, Lisbon, Portugal.",rscosta@bportugal.pt; sergio.lagoa@iscte-iul.pt,,,,,,,27,1,1,0,4,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

However, differences in capital-labor ratios between developed and developing countries create a mismatch between the energy requirements of this capital and developing countries' optimal levels of energy intensity. Using a calibrated macroeconomic model, this paper analyzes the implications of this mismatch for climate policy.

An unprecedented survey of Chinese enterprises operating in North Korea reveals that trade is largely dominated by state entities on the North Korean side, although we cannot rule out de facto privatization of exchange. Little trust is evident beyond the relationships among Chinese and North Korean state-owned enterprises. Formal networks and dispute settlement mechanisms are weak and do not appear to have consequences for relational contracting. Rather, firms rely on personal ties for identifying counterparties and resolving disputes.

These mechanisms come in two forms, one based on subsidies/taxes, the other based on constraints/price caps. In spite of a number of improvements and a good empirical track record simple approaches so far remain imperfect. The current paper comes up with a new proposal, called H-R-G-V, which blends the two traditions and is shown in simulations to apply well to electricity transmission pricing and investment. In particular, it induces immediately optimal pricing/investment but is not based on subsidies. In the transmission application, the H-R-G-V approach is based on a bilevel optimization with the transmission company (Transco) at the top and the independent system operator (ISO) at the bottom level. We show that H-R-G-V, while not perfect, marks an improvement over the other simple mechanisms and a convergence of the two traditions. We suggest ways to deal with remaining practical issues of demand and cost functions changing over time. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Hesamzadeh, M.

Good performances ensure a lengthier contract between drivers and teams. Reversely, humble performances may jeopardize the renewal of drivers' contracts to their teams. This paper will study the capacity of F1 drivers surviving professionally in competition. Considering two major samples of drivers (without points or without victories) and two types of 'exits' (exiting the team or exiting the F1 competition), various regressions of Cox survival models and of parametric regressions have been obtained. The main results suggest that recent worse standings results, higher ages and a higher number of withdrawals contribute to the shortening of F1 careers. It has also been observed that the early decades of competition were not known for providing a higher number of races for drivers. Reversely, adding podium positions (even without winning) ensures a longer professional life in F1. (c) 2018 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Despite economic improvements in the second decade of transition, research has documented that happiness lagged behind. We test whether past unemployment experience can explain this transition happiness gap in the context of Ukraine, a country with a painful delayed transition from planned to market economy. We analyze unique longitudinal data for the period 2003-2012. Current unemployment substantially reduces subjective wellbeing, and the effect is roughly 50% larger for men than for women. The effect of past unemployment is significant, but small in magnitude compared to the effect of current unemployment. However, it does correspond to around 8% of the transition happiness gap found by Guriev and Melnikov (2017), suggesting that past unemployment experience can be considered as a partial explanation.","[Norton, Edward C.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Norton, Edward C.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Nizalova, Olena] Univ Kent, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Nizalova, Olena] IZA, London, England; [Nizalova, Olena] GLO, Torquay, England; [Murtazashvili, Irina] Drexel Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Kent; Drexel University,"Norton, EC (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Norton, EC (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",ecnorton@umich.edu,"Norton, Edward C/B-2211-2009; Nizalova, Olena/K-2319-2019; , Edward/AAQ-1719-2021",", Edward/0000-0003-4555-0631",European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [649496]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [649496] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme,European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(Horizon 2020); H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),This project has been partially supported with funding from the European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement no. 649496.,,20,4,4,1,7,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-5967,1095-7227,,J COMP ECON,J.

Many studies exist, most of which use CGE or Input-Output (10) models. However, the economic mechanisms at play remain unclear. This paper disentangles the channels of job creation and studies to what extent the results of simpler 10 models diverge from CGE results. Using stylized models, we show that a shift in investment creates jobs in 10 if it promotes sectors with a higher share of labour in value added, lower wages or a lower import rate. In CGE, the first two channels also yield job creation, but there is no positive impact of targeting low-imports sectors - unless these do not export. Then we undertake a numerical analysis of two policies: the installation of solar panels and weatherization in France. Both policies have a positive effect on employment, in both models, due to the high share of labour and low wages in these sectors. 10 results provide a good approximation of CGE results for solar (-14% to +34%) and are slightly higher for weatherization (+22% to +87%). Our findings challenge the idea that renewables boost employment by reducing imports, but they also suggest that a double dividend can be achieved by encouraging low-carbon labour-intensive sectors.

The index is constructed from three sources: (1) Disagreement among professional forecasters, (2) a count of international and local newspaper articles discussing economic uncertainty in South Africa and (3) mentions of uncertainty in the quarterly economic review of the South African Reserve Bank. The index shows high levels of uncertainty around the period of democratic transition in 1992-1994, the large depreciation of the currency in 2001 and the financial crisis of 2008. The uncertainty index is a leading indicator of a recession. An unanticipated increase in the index is associated with a fall in GDP, investment, industrial production and private sector employment. Contrary to evidence for the U.S.A and the U.K., uncertainty shocks are inflationary. These results are robust to controlling for global uncertainty shocks, consumer confidence and financial shocks.","[Redl, Chris] Bank England, Threadneedle St, London EC2R 8AH, England",Bank of England,"Redl, C (通讯作者)，Bank England, Threadneedle St, London EC2R 8AH, England.",redl.chris99@gmail.com,,,,,,,39,21,24,1,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

The consumption tariff has only a weak effect on activity. If implemented instantaneously it leads to a negligible reduction in wealth inequality but a substantial increase in income inequality. If gradual, it causes a more significant decline in wealth inequality but a milder increase in income inequality. A comparable reduction in an investment tariff increases activity significantly. It leads to a significant long-run reduction in wealth inequality if implemented instantaneously, which is moderated if introduced gradually. It is associated with a tradeoff between the short-run and long-run effects on income inequality, reducing it in the very short run, while increasing it slightly over time. The simulations are supplemented with extensive sensitivity analysis, suggesting some sensitivity to key structural parameters.","[Turnovsky, Stephen J.] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Rojas-Vallejos, Jorge] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso,"Turnovsky, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",sturn@u.washington.edu,"Rojas-Vallejos, Jorge/X-8693-2019","Rojas-Vallejos, Jorge/0000-0002-5939-3035",Van Voorhis Endowment at the University of Washington; BecasChile Scholarship Program of the Chilean Government; Grover and Creta Ensley Fellowship of the University of Washington,Van Voorhis Endowment at the University of Washington; BecasChile Scholarship Program of the Chilean Government; Grover and Creta Ensley Fellowship of the University of Washington,"We gratefully acknowledge the constructive comments of two anonymous referees and the Co-Editor, Nathan Nunn.

This paper examines the impacts of currency under- and overvaluation on China's exports and the spillover effects of these misalignments toward the exports of 9 Asian main economies. We argue that the exchange rate deviation from the long-run equilibrium value, rather than the exchange rate change, is the main force for global trade imbalances. We find consistent yet mild RMB undervaluation as well as overvaluation across time. Most of the Asian economies in our analyses are impacted by these RMB misalignments. Both bilateral and weighted average real exchange rates are applied to ensure the robustness of the model estimations.

A comparison of traditional and new institutions,JOURNAL OF INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,WEALTH,"The sharing economy has raised hopes that online platforms will usher in a new era of sharing, even though economic theory suggests that income growth may reduce sharing in the long run. This paper presents evidence that that high-income people are less likely than low-income people to use traditional institutions for sharing goods, including carpools, multi-person households, and garage sales. While it first appears that high-income people are equally likely to use new institutions, such as Craigslist, Airbnb, and Zipcar, this partly reflects the fact that many low-income households in the US still lack an internet connection. Conditional on having internet access, this paper finds that online sharing platforms are also disproportionately used by the poor. The future of sharing likely depends on countervailing forces. Economic growth may continue to dampen incentives to share goods, but this effect could be offset by the proliferation of institutions, norms, and preferences that facilitate sharing.","[Fremstad, Anders] Colorado State Univ, Econ Dept, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Colorado State University,"Fremstad, A (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Econ Dept, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",anders.fremstad@colostate.edu,,,,,,,26,7,7,2,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Descriptive analysis of the data indicates a cyclical nature of these defaults over a longer period. Regression results highlight the importance of the international monetary conditions as the volatilities of US treasury bills rates and USD-denominated LIBOR exert significant impacts on defaults. Political uncertainty increases the probability of default. Export (import) growth reduces (increases) the probability of default. Similarly, a 1% increase in inflation would increase the probability of defaults by 7%. Higher debt/GDP ratio is also linked to higher probability of default. A 1% increase in external debt would lead to a five to 7% increase in the probability of default. Higher GDP per capita reduces the probability of default. A previous banking crisis is linked to higher chances of sovereign defaults. Further analysis of entry into (out of) sovereign defaults indicates that higher US treasury rates would initiate sovereign defaults and would make it difficult for countries to come out of default. The same is true for central government debt/GDP, higher current account deficit and exchange rate volatility. (C) 2017 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Furthermore, there are no robust indications that fuel tourism is relevant for Dutch consumers living further than 10 km from either the border with Belgium or Germany. The absence of fuel tourism may be explained by the low level of cross-border commuting by Dutch workers. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

I impose the theoretical regularity conditions in the model that much of the previous literature ignores. I provide the robust estimates of the Morishima elasticities of substitution among currency, demand deposits and time deposits. I find that currency and demand deposits are elastic substitutes in use, while time deposits are inelastic substitutes with the former two. Time deposits are distant from a medium of exchange, and agents treat them as a saving asset, separable from the composite of currency and demand deposits. The results imply that the narrow money Ml is well-defined, while the broad money M2, which assumes perfect substitution of the component assets, is problematic. A monetary aggregate that internalizes the substitution effects should be adopted in China.","[Jin, Man] Oakland Univ, Dept Econ, Rochester, MI 48063 USA",Oakland University,"Jin, M (通讯作者)，Oakland Univ, Dept Econ, Rochester, MI 48063 USA.",mjin@oakland.edu,,,,,,,34,4,5,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

This paper proposes a simple model showing that, in an institution that land is owned and supplied by the state, local governments tend to increase investment in infrastructure when holding a larger share of land conveyance revenue in the total revenue. The main channel is that land conveyance revenue serves as a signal of credit quality of local governments. To test the model of land financing, this paper employs an exogenous event of the deregulation of local government debt in China in 2009. Using county-level data in China, empirical results suggest that counties with a higher initial share of land conveyance revenue were growing faster after 2009. The land-financing effect was persistent and even stronger during 2009 to 2014. Results are robust using geographic plainness as the instrumental variable measuring the amount of developable land resources. There is also consistent evidence on the growth of night light intensity.","[Ma, Jiawei] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Business & Econ, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong,"Ma, JW (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Fac Business & Econ, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jwmo@hku.hk,"Mo, Jiawei/GPK-1779-2022; Mo, Jiawei/AAU-2407-2020","Mo, Jiawei/0000-0002-3786-4713; Mo, Jiawei/0000-0002-3786-4713","University of Hong Kong; Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China [17JJD790003, 16JJD630009]; Shanghai Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science [2017BJL001]","University of Hong Kong(University of Hong Kong); Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Shanghai Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science","Thanks to two editors, three referees, and Shiyuan Chen, Jianyong Fan, Shouying Liu, Larry D.

We argue that heterogeneous prize-valuations in a competing group normally prevent effective use of such selective incentives. To substantiate this claim, we adopt cost-sharing as a means of incentivizing the individual group members. We confirm that homogeneous prize valuations within a group result in a cost-sharing rule inducing the first-best individual contributions. As long as the cost-sharing rule is dependent only on the members' contributions, however, such a first-best rule does not exist for a group with intragroup heterogeneity. Our main result clarifies how unequal prize valuations affect the cost-sharing rule and, in particular, the degree of cost-sharing. If the relative rate of change of the marginal effort costs is decreasing, it is reduced by intragroup heterogeneity. If the rate is increasing, the cost is fully shared, but it cannot induce the first-best contributions for the group.","[Nitzan, Shmuel] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Nitzan, Shmuel] Hitotsubashi Univ, Hitotsubashi Inst Adv Study, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868601, Japan; [Ueda, Kaoru] Nanzan Univ, Fac Econ, Nagoya, Aichi 4660824, Japan",Bar Ilan University; Hitotsubashi University,"Nitzan, S (通讯作者)，Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel.;Nitzan, S (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Hitotsubashi Inst Adv Study, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868601, Japan.;Ueda, K (通讯作者)，Nanzan Univ, Fac Econ, Nagoya, Aichi 4660824, Japan.",nitzans@mail.biu.ac.il; k-ueda@nanzan-u.ac.jp,,,JSPS KAKENHI [JP17K03781]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17K03781] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",The authors are indebted to three anonymous referees for their useful comments and suggestions.

Employing a global perspective, and using six international oil and gas sector equity index returns for North America, Latin America, Developed Europe, Emerging Europe, the Far East, and BRIC alongside the WTI oil futures return, we obtain the following findings. First, we reveal unidirectional return transmission from oil futures to oil equities for Developed Europe, Emerging Europe, the Far East, and BRIC. Second, we find unidirectional return transmission from North American oil equities to oil futures, and mostly bidirectional return transmission between oil futures and Latin American oil equities. Moreover, we reveal unidirectional asymmetric volatility spillover effects from all the six oil equities to oil futures except for the Far East, where we observe mostly bidirectional asymmetric volatility spillovers. Furthermore, using the conditional variances and covariances from our new model, we also compute more precise time-varying optimal hedge ratios and optimal portfolio weights, and clarify that in international markets, hedging oil equities with oil is cheaper than vice versa.","[Tsuji, Chikashi] Chuo Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 742-1 Higashinakano, Hachioji, Tokyo 1920393, Japan",Chuo University,"Tsuji, C (通讯作者)，Chuo Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 742-1 Higashinakano, Hachioji, Tokyo 1920393, Japan.",ctsuji@tamacc.chuo-u.ac.jp,,,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)",The author would like to thank the editor (Paresh Kumar Narayan) and two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments and helpful suggestions on an earlier version of this paper.

Exploiting field-specific differences in economic conditions at graduation, I find that academic graduates suffer a 10% lower wage per percentage point decline in field specific employment at graduation. The wage loss fades out six years after graduation. For vocational graduates I find substantially smaller effects at 6% initially, but they remain persistent at 1% after 8 years on the labor market. Employment effects are small. Poor entry conditions are associated with an increased probability of mismatch and employment at lower paying employers. The primary mechanism through which graduates catch up is mobility across jobs and sectors to better paying employers. Job mobility resolves the mismatch for academic graduates after 4 years on the labor market, while vocational graduates remain persistently more likely to be mismatched.","[van den Berge, Wiljan] CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, POB 80510, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands; [van den Berge, Wiljan] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands",CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"van den Berge, W (通讯作者)，CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, POB 80510, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands.",w.van.den.berge@cpb.nl,"van den Berge, Wiljan/AAR-1145-2021","van den Berge, Wiljan/0000-0002-9147-0862",,,,,49,11,13,0,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5371,1879-1034,,LABOUR ECON,Labour Econ.,AUG,2018,53.0,,,,,,75,96,,10.1016/j.labeco.2018.05.011,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,GT6VX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000444660100006,0

We find that, on average, these listed companies experienced a statistically and economically significant abnormal return (AR) of - 3.6% on the event date, indicating an anticipation that these companies would face a harsher regulatory environment as a result of the administrative reform. The market apparently placed great expectations on the administrative reform in regard to addressing China's environmental pollution problems. In addition, we find that compared to their counterparts in the private sector, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) experienced a smaller price decline during the event window, which suggests that SOEs are more likely to enjoy favourable treatment from regulatory agencies. Our empirical evidence, therefore, shows that the selective enforcement of environmental law is a significant concern that tends to undermine the effects of such reforms.","[Xu, Guangdong; Xu, Wenming; Xu, Shudan] China Univ Polit Sci & Law, 25 West Tucheng Rd, Beijing 100088, Peoples R China",China University of Political Science & Law,"Xu, GD (通讯作者)，China Univ Polit Sci & Law, 25 West Tucheng Rd, Beijing 100088, Peoples R China.",guangdongx@cupl.edu.cn; wenming.xu@cupl.edu.cn; swxsd@163.com,,,Program for Young Innovative Research Teams of the CUPL [16CXTD 09]; Beijing Social Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality [17FXC017],Program for Young Innovative Research Teams of the CUPL; Beijing Social Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality,We would like to thank an anonymous reviewer for his/her very helpful comments that substantially improved this paper.

Downstream production requires an input from imperfectly competitive suppliers. We show that the dominant firm outsources downstream production from fringe firms to gain bargaining clout in the input market. Option contracts are preferred to forwards, because leverage against suppliers is gained at lower contract prices. With no market uncertainty, option contracts do not alter final prices beyond changes caused by unavoidable market power. Whenever demand is uncertain, however, option contracts increase final prices and are therefore harmful for consumers.","[Antelo, Manel] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Fundamentos Anal Econ, Santiago, Spain; [Bru, Lluis] Univ Illes Balears, Dept Econ Empresa, Palma De Mallorca, Spain",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela; Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Antelo, M (通讯作者)，Univ Santiago de Compostela, Fundamentos Anal Econ, Santiago, Spain.",,"Bru, Lluis/L-4809-2017","Bru, Lluis/0000-0002-5726-4977; Antelo, Manel/0000-0003-1846-6872",Xunta de Galicia [2016 GPC GI-2060]; Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2013-48496-C4-1-R],Xunta de Galicia(Xunta de Galicia); Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government),The authors are very grateful to two anonymous referees and the Editor (Antonio Nicolo) whose comments and suggestions greatly contributed to improve the manuscript.

However, when local governments depend on national resources, the central government may have incentives to manipulate intergovernmental transfers to favor politically aligned mayors, in order to use their help to mobilize voters in the next national election. This generates an indirect Political Budget Cycle (iPBC). This paper documents the presence of an iPBC in Chile. We show that, during municipal election years, the government increases the overall amount of transfers to municipalities (local governments), and that these additional resources are allocated to the politically aligned mayors. We also report that transfers to aligned mayors are higher when the local races are tighter, suggesting that the government prefers to deviate resources towards swing municipalities. Finally, we show that transfers are correlated with municipal spending during electoral years, and with both local and national political electoral outcomes.","[Corvalan, Alejandro] Univ Diego Portales, Av Santa Clara 797, Santiago, Chile; [Cox, Paulo] Univ Talca, Santa Elena 2222, Santiago, Chile; [Osorio, Rodrigo] Univ Santiago Chile, Fac Humanidades, Av Alameda Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 3363, Santiago, Chile",University Diego Portales; Universidad de Talca; Universidad de Santiago de Chile,"Cox, P (通讯作者)，Univ Talca, Santa Elena 2222, Santiago, Chile.",alejandro.corvalan@udp.cl; paulocox@utalca.cl; rosoriof@gmail.com,"Cox, Paulo/GWV-5402-2022","Osorio, Rodrigo/0000-0002-7365-5054; Corvalan, Alejandro/0000-0001-9281-8018","Institute for Research in Market Imperfections and Public Policy [ICM IS130002]; Ministerio de Economia, Fomento y Turismo; Chilean National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research Conicyt [Fondecyt 1161719, Fondecyt 1171051]","Institute for Research in Market Imperfections and Public Policy; Ministerio de Economia, Fomento y Turismo; Chilean National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research Conicyt(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT))","We would like to thank Juan Pablo Luna, Patricio Navia and Sergio Vicente for their valuable feedback.

Current empirical evidence supports the existence of a negative effect of the Italian ban on smoking prevalence and consumption in the general population. Our analysis shows that the apparent success of the ban is due to the fact that existing results do not take into account seasonal differences in smoking behaviour. Using quarterly data from the 1999/2000 and 2004/2005 Italian Health Surveys and adopting a difference-indifference approach that nets out monthly variation in smoking rates, we show that the Italian smoking ban had no impact on smoking behaviour for the population as a whole but only on some subgroups. This result notwithstanding, we find that the smoking ban increased the overall well-being of non-smokers.","[Del Bono, Emilia] Univ Essex, ISER, Colchester, Essex, England; [Del Bono, Emilia] Univ Bergen, Bergen, Norway; [Vuri, Daniela] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Econ & Finance, Rome, Italy",University of Essex; University of Bergen; University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Vuri, D (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Econ & Finance, Rome, Italy.",daniela.vuri@uniroma2.it,,"Del Bono, Emilia/0000-0002-1551-3074",British Academy/Leverhulme Small Research Grants [SG111344]; Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Research Centre on Micro-Social Change (MiSoC) at the University of Essex [ES/L009153/1]; ESRC [ES/L009153/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L009153/1] Funding Source: researchfish,British Academy/Leverhulme Small Research Grants; Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Research Centre on Micro-Social Change (MiSoC) at the University of Essex(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by the British Academy/Leverhulme Small Research Grants [grant number SG111344] and the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Research Centre on Micro-Social Change (MiSoC) at the University of Essex [grant number ES/L009153/1].,,49,5,6,2,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

This is somewhat surprising given the recent policy focus on Guaranteed Basic Income programs. An annual lump-sum payment, the Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD) is available to almost all Alaska residents, is clearly exogenous with respect to work effort, and - while relatively predictable - varies over time and across households (since it increases linearly with family size). This paper estimates the nonlabor income elasticity of labor supply using exogenous variation from the Alaskan PFD and data from the American Community Survey (ACS). The analysis finds that men have elasticities between -0.15 and -0.10, depending on the specification. Single women have elasticities between -0.14 and -0.09, while married women have somewhat larger elasticities between -0.18 and -0.11.","[Feinberg, Robert M.] Amer Univ, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Kuehn, Daniel] Urban Inst, Washington, DC 20037 USA",American University; Urban Institute,"Feinberg, RM (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",feinber@american.edu,,"Feinberg, Robert/0000-0001-8087-3853",,,,,26,9,10,2,17,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

To do this we compare social and asocial versions of the Gill and Prowse experiment, where the latter treatment removes the scope for social comparisons. If disappointment aversion simply reflects an asymmetric evaluation of losses and gains we would expect it to survive in our asocial treatment. Alternatively, if losing to or winning against another person affects the evaluation of losses/gains, as we show would be theoretically the case under asymmetric inequality aversion, we would expect treatment differences. We find behavior in social and asocial treatments to be similar, suggesting that social comparisons have little impact in this setting.

One might ask why the traditional Keynes-Kalecki or structuralist (KKS) model would bear any relationship to the multi-agent modeling approach. This paper shows how KKS models might benefit from agent-based microfoundations, without sacrificing traditional macroeconomic themes, such as aggregate demand, animal spirits and endogenous money. Above all, the integration of the two approaches gives rise to the possibility that a KKS systemstable over many consecutive time periodsmight lurch into an uncontrollable downturn, from which a recovery would require outside intervention. As a by-product of the integration of these two popular approaches, there emerges a cogent analysis of the network structure necessary to bind real and financial agents into an integrated whole. It is seen, contrary to much of the existing literature, that a highly connected financial system does not necessarily lead to more crashes of the integrated system.","[Gibson, Bill] Univ Vermont, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Setterfield, Mark] New Sch Social Res, New York, NY 10011 USA",University of Vermont; The New School,"Setterfield, M (通讯作者)，New Sch Social Res, Econ Dept, New York, NY 10003 USA.",mark.setterfield@newschool.edu,,,,,,,33,5,5,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,JUL,2018,69.0,3,,,,,566,592,,10.1111/meca.12201,0.0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GL0TN,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000436803900003,0

By employing two alternative classifications of the dynamic trajectories of disability, we are able to explicitly consider the influence of disability exit in addition to examining onset by chronicity and severity. After controlling for unobserved individual heterogeneity, we find pronounced declines in the probability of employment and life satisfaction at disability onset. Further, while individuals are found to recover rapidly and completely from a one-period disability, there is little evidence of recovery even after 10 years for those whose disability is chronic, defined as evident for three or more years post-onset, and severe.","[Jones, Melanie] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Jones, Melanie; Mavromaras, Kostas; Sloane, Peter J.] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Mavromaras, Kostas; Wei, Zhang] Univ Adelaide, Future Employment & Skills Res Ctr, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Mavromaras, Kostas] GLO, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Sloane, Peter J.] Swansea Univ, WELMERC, Swansea, W Glam, Wales",Cardiff University; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Adelaide; Swansea University,"Wei, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Future Employment & Skills Res Ctr, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",zhang.wei@adelaide.edu.au,"Wei, Zhang/JSK-6014-2023; Sloane, Peter/AAA-6427-2021",,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L009099/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/L009099/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,24,12,13,1,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

In the data stock prices and investment correlate poorly precisely when stock prices and inflation move in opposite directions. Therefore, this New Keynesian Q (NKQ) theory can rationalize parsimoniously the time-varying correlation between investment and stock prices, and hence the time-series failure of the benchmark Q theory of investment. To estimate and test the NKQ equation, I rely on weak implications of the theory with strong economic and statistical content by matching the volatility and return forecasting ability of predicted and actual stock prices. Formal tests cannot reject the hypothesis that stock prices and a linear combination of investment and inflation move on the same news about the future. Along many dimensions the simple NKQ equation links well asset prices and macroeconomic variables. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Several authors have argued recently, however, that even if demand and growth are profit-led in many individual countries, the global economy is likely to be wage-led since the planet as a whole runs balanced trade. This paper shows that this argument, while intuitively appealing, does not hold up to careful examination. Although the world economy as a whole is a closed system, it is not isomorphic to a closed economy, thanks to repercussion effects, relative price movements, and cross-country heterogeneity. Using asymmetries in consumption as a simple illustrative device I show that, in a two-country world, the effects of global redistribution depend on the nature of the constituent economies. This conclusion holds in spite of balanced trade at a planetary level, and regardless of whether one or both economies have excess capacity or whether zero-sum effects are present or not.","[Razmi, Arslan] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Razmi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",arazmi@econs.umass.edu,,,,,,,15,3,3,0,1,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

We find that if a strict Nash equilibrium exists in a model with an infinite number of voters, then nearby equilibria should exist for similar large, but finite, electorates. If the votes are independent random events, then equilibria will not depend on the utility functions of the candidates. Our results have implications for existing models of redistributive politics and spatial competition, as the properties of pure-strategy equilibria in such games carry over to equilibria in games with arbitrary candidate preferences. On the other hand, candidate utility functions will matter if the individual voting decisions are correlated. In the presence of aggregate uncertainty, such as changing economic conditions or political scandals, the preferences of parties and candidates with respect to shares of votes will have an effect on political competition.

Evidence from OECD countries,ECONOMIC MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Government efficiency; Energy efficiency; Energy intensity; OECD,ECONOMIC-GROWTH; PANEL-DATA; STRUCTURAL BREAKS; RENEWABLE ENERGY; ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE; EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; POLITICAL-ECONOMY; POLICY FORMATION; NATIONAL-INCOME; STATE-LEVEL,"This study investigates the effect of government efficiency on energy efficiency by employing data from a panel of 31 OECD countries covering the periods 1990-2014 using the group-mean dynamic common correlated estimator (DCCE) regression, panel cointegration test as well as vector error correction model (VECM). Overall, our evidence suggests that government efficiency does significantly influence energy efficiency. In particular, greater government efficiency leads to a reduction in energy intensity by enhancing energy efficiency in OECD countries, and similar findings are supported in robustness tests. The estimation results also indicate that left-wing parties in a government, a lower level of corruption, higher real per capita GDP, and greater gross capital formation all contribute to the improvement of energy efficiency, whereas more industrial production, higher imported-oil prices, and stricter energy market regulation lead to an increase in energy intensity. Our robust analysis provides consistent results with the exception of former Communist countries.","[Chang, Chun-Ping] Shih Chien Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Mkt Management, Kaohsiung 845, Taiwan; [Wen, Jun; Zheng, Mingbo; Dong, Minyi] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Dong, Minyi] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Finance, Ostrava, Czech Republic; [Hao, Yu] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yu] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, 5 Zhongguancun South St, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yu] Sustainable Dev Res Inst Econ & Soc Beijing, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yu] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Elect Vehicles Beijing, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yu] Beijing Key Lab Energy Econ & Environm Management, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Shih Chien University; Xi'an Jiaotong University; Technical University of Ostrava; Beijing Institute of Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology,"Hao, Y (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, 5 Zhongguancun South St, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",cpchang@g2.usc.edu.tw; wjun1978@163.com; mingbo1992@l26.com; sherrydong@stu.xjtu.edu.cn; haoyuking@bit.edu.cn,"Zheng, Mingbo/AGE-0822-2022; Hao, Yu/ABF-4628-2021; Wen, Jun/N-8547-2016","Wen, Jun/0000-0002-7544-1076; Hao, Yu/0000-0001-8394-4215","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403015, 71521002]; Beijing Social Science Foundation [17JDYJA009]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [9162013]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFA0602801, 2016YFA0602603]; Beijing Municipal Commission of Education",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Social Science Foundation; Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); National Key Research and Development Program of China; Beijing Municipal Commission of Education(Beijing Municipal Commission of Education),"Yu Hao acknowledges financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71403015, 71521002), the key research program of Beijing Social Science Foundation (17JDYJA009), Beijing Natural Science Foundation (9162013), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFA0602801, 2016YFA0602603) and the Joint Development Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education.

A structural VAR (SVAR) model and a time-varying parameter VAR (TVP-VAR) model are estimated, using six indicators that reflect economic and financial uncertainty. The findings of the study reveal that static frameworks (SVAR) do not show the full dynamics of the oil price shocks effects to the US economic/financial uncertainty. This is owing to the evidence provided by the time-varying framework (TVP-VAR), which convincingly shows that uncertainty responses to the three oil price shocks are heterogeneous both over time and over the different oil price shocks. In particular, uncertainty responses seem to experience a shift in the post global financial crisis period. Thus, the conventional findings that economic fundamentals response marginally, positively or negatively to supply-side, aggregate demand and oil specific demand shocks, respectively, do not necessarily hold at all periods. Rather, they are impacted by the prevailing economic conditions at each time period. The findings are important to policy makers and investors, as they provide new insights on the said relationships.","[Degiannakis, Stavros; Panagiotakopoulou, Sofia] Pante Univ Social & Polit Sci, Dept Econ & Reg Dev, 136 Syggrou Ave, Athens 17671, Greece; [Degiannakis, Stavros] Hellen Open Univ, Postgrad Dept Business Adm, Aristotelous 18, Patras 26335, Greece; [Fills, George] Bournemouth Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, 89 Holdenhurst Rd, Bournemouth BH8 8EB, Dorset, England",Panteion University; Hellenic Open University; Bournemouth University,"Fills, G (通讯作者)，Bournemouth Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, 89 Holdenhurst Rd, Bournemouth BH8 8EB, Dorset, England.",gfilis@bournemouth.ac.uk,"Degiannakis, Stavros/AAD-2502-2019; Degiannakis, Stavros/AAF-2415-2021",,European Union [658494]; Marie Curie Actions (MSCA) [658494] Funding Source: Marie Curie Actions (MSCA),European Union(European Union (EU)); Marie Curie Actions (MSCA)(Marie Curie Actions),"The authors would like to thank Prof. Paresh Narayan (Editor), Prof. Russell Smyth (Associate Editor) and the seven anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments on a previous version of this paper.

What is puzzling, however, is that non-euro area countries with an equally large and in some cases even larger public debt-to-GDP ratios have not been subject to attacks. This fact, together with the convex non-linear behavior exhibited by interest rates have been explained by observing that euro area countries could not rely on a lender of last resort, and this made possible the occurrence of self-fulfilling speculative attacks. The model proposed in this article applies the target zones methodology relative to exchange rates, developed in the late 1980s early 1990s, to the case of the interest rate, given that public debt stability will only be assured if the former does not exceed a given upper bound. The novelty of the paper is that, by considering the presence of a public debt demand stochastic shock that may originate from different sources it is possible to endogenize the determinants of the credibility of the interest rate target zone and, as a result, of public debt stability, something that in a previous paper, still based on the idea of interest rate target zones, had to be taken exogenously. Public debt stability, then, is shown to depend on the potential liquidity that the central bank can create thanks to its role of lender of last resort. Full/partial credibility is obtained when such liquidity is expected to be sufficient/insufficient to absorb completely the demand shock. The expected absence of liquidity determines the non-credibility of the interest rate target, while the expectation of a public debt increase produces a destabilizing non-credibility determining the convex interest rate non-linearity that characterized the euro area crisis.","[Della Posta, Pompeo] Dipartimento Econ & Management, Via Ridolfi 10, I-56124 Pisa, Italy",,"Della Posta, P (通讯作者)，Dipartimento Econ & Management, Via Ridolfi 10, I-56124 Pisa, Italy.",pompeo.della.posta@unipi.it,"Posta, Pompeo Della/AAU-7424-2020","DELLA POSTA, POMPEO/0000-0002-5379-7338",,,,,16,8,8,1,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0164-0704,1873-152X,,J MACROECON,J.

This paper uses a 16-country or region numerical general equilibrium model with trade cost and exogenous trade imbalance to explore this three-country economic sanction game payoffs, and simulate the effects of sanctions on individual countries. Our analysis find that all sanction involved countries will be hurt, but comparatively Russia will be hurt more, and the US and EU will be hurt less. Sanction measures of EU have larger impacts to Russia than the US measures, and meanwhile Russian counter-sanction measures will generate larger impacts on the EU than on the US. From the economic perspective, the optimal choice for US and EU is to give up sanction measures to Russia, and retaliation is Russia's optimal choice when faced with sanction measures. Countries out of the sanction game will gain because of trade diversion effects.","[Dong, Yan; Li, Chunding] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, 5 Jianguomen Nei St, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Chunding] Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies, Res Ctr Int Trade & Econ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; Guangdong University of Foreign Studies,"Li, CD (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, 5 Jianguomen Nei St, Beijing, Peoples R China.",dongyan@cass.org.cn; lichd@cass.org.cn,,,Chinese National Social Science Foundation [15ZDC017],Chinese National Social Science Foundation,We are grateful to the Chinese National Social Science Foundation (15ZDC017) for financial support.,,14,20,22,11,77,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Initially, we propose an indicator of the degree of conservativeness of a central bank and, then, we characterise its optimal value. We find that the central bank has to be more conservative than the government, except with complete tax inefficiency. Furthermore, we show that the relationship between the optimal relative degree of conservativeness of the central bank and tax efficiency is affected by the volatility of supply shocks. Concretely, when these shocks are not important, the central bank should be less conservative if tax efficiency gets worse. However, this result may not hold when the shocks are relevant. Finally, we examine under which conditions the government would be willing to dedicate more efforts to improve tax efficiency.","[Manzano, Carolina] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Av Univ 1, Reus 43204, Spain; Univ Rovira & Virgili, CREIP, Av Univ 1, Reus 43204, Spain",Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Manzano, C (通讯作者)，Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Av Univ 1, Reus 43204, Spain.",carolina.manzano@urv.cat,"Ferre, Montserrat/B-7428-2011","Ferre, Montse/0000-0003-4959-608X","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2013-42884-P, ECO2016-75410-P]; Generalitat de Catalunya [2014 SGR 631]; Universitat Rovira i Virgili",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya); Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Let us first thank two anonymous referees for their comments which helped improve the quality of this paper.

However, the rise of passive funds and their surprisingly good results, especially when taking into account their low fees, triggered the discussion. Recent years have brought more and more studies, conducted mostly for the American market, discrediting high-charging, aggressive funds. First analyses in Poland also indicate that the level of fees is not always linked with the fund's performance. Purpose of the article: The purpose of the study is to investigate the relation be-tween the fees imposed by the mutual funds and the funds' performance. The idea is to verify, whether higher management fees are associated with top performance and whether it is rational to pay more for capital management. Methods: In the first step of the study, linearity and direction of the dependency was explored, using scatterplots and correlation analysis. In the second part, the linear regression was created to verify the strength of the relation. One-factor models have been built with the rate of return and standard deviation as independent variables for 1-, 3- and 5-year time horizons. Moreover, two-factor models, including both rate of return and risk has been created, to compare the significance of return and risk factor. Findings & Value added: The results indicated that more expensive Polish mutual funds in 2015 tended to perform worse in all tested time horizons - both in terms of lower rates of return and higher risk. Especially unexpected are the results of rates of return regression analysis - it turns out that within a sample 1% higher fee implied over 0.6% lower rate of return before fees (in yearly period). Nonetheless, the risk turned out to be more important, explaining the charges variability much better than the rate of return. Another interesting finding of the study is that merely two simple factors (return and risk) explain even as much as 60% of the management fee variability.","[Fras, Alicja] Poznan Univ Econ, Fac Econ, Dept Monetary Policy & Financial Markets, Aleja Niepodleglosci 10, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Fras, A (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ, Fac Econ, Dept Monetary Policy & Financial Markets, Aleja Niepodleglosci 10, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland.",alicja.m.fras@gmail.com,,,,,,,20,2,2,0,7,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

What is less known is whether this resurgence has translated into a gradual process of convergence to the U.S. level. With the benefit of major upgrades in the source data, we employ well-tested and familiar methods in the development literature to sort out the quantitative importance of the fundamentals behind the process of convergence. While the SSA growth revival has generated local pride, foreign envy and enthusiasm from international policy makers, our results suggest a more sober tone. In 2010, per capita income and labour productivity levels relative to the U.S. are well below those reported during the pre-1990 period. Regardless of the way in which human capital is measured, relative factor input endowments constitute the primary force that held back the SSA relative labour productivity-a major departure from conventional wisdom. While the story from the sectoral level remains broadly consistent with the one obtained from the aggregate level, additional insights emerge. These include disproportionately lower relative levels of sectoral labour productivity that led to a considerably slow and atypical process of structural transformation. Although relative intersectoral labour productivity gaps have been reduced, sources of allocative inefficiency remain large. We argue that all indications point to a combination of favourable shocks behind the SSA wakening pulse rather than a set of economic fundamentals that feature a genuine economic development. The burst of the commodity prices in the mid-2014 that coincided with a sharp weakening of the performance of this economy constitutes a compelling counterfactual.","[Harchaoui, Tarek M.] Global Econ & Management, Fac Econ & Business, Nettelbosje 2, NL-9747 AE Groningen, Netherlands; [Ungor, Murat] Univ Otago, Dept Econ, POB 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand",University of Otago,"Üngör, M (通讯作者)，Univ Otago, Dept Econ, POB 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand.",murat.ungor@otago.ac.nz,"ÜNGÖR, MURAT/B-4217-2016","ÜNGÖR, MURAT/0000-0002-9217-4221",,,,,50,9,9,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Inspection of the rise and spread of this tax shows that it is contagious: the probability of introduction is increasing in the number of neighboring municipalities that have already introduced this taxing scheme. A possible rationale is that the tax encourages the dumping of waste in neighboring municipalities. These municipalities may then introduce a similar tax to prevent dumping (spillover effect). Using panel data and a recently developed spatial probit approach (Elhorst et al. in J Appl Econom 32:422-439, 2017), it is possible to distinguish this spillover effect from time-specific effects. The results indicate the presence of strong spillovers.","[Heijnen, Pim; Elhorst, J.

However, [Cordella, T and E Levy Yeyati (2003). Bank bailouts: moral hazard vs. value effect. Journal of Financial Intermediation, 12, 300-330.] proposed that government support offered during crises may increase bank franchise value, resulting in less risk-taking. This paper presents additional theoretical results on the franchise value effect. The franchise value effect can dominate over the moral hazard effect even when there are no specific crisis periods. The franchise value effect dominates if bank shareholders have a weak time preference and if the decision on the intensity of risk monitoring is a long-term choice.","[Kauko, Karlo] Bank Finland, POB 160, Helsinki 00101, Finland",Bank of Finland,"Kauko, K (通讯作者)，Bank Finland, POB 160, Helsinki 00101, Finland.",karlo.kauko@bof.fi,,,,,,,11,0,0,2,12,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

We examine the extent of such convergence by estimating the proportion of all pairwise convergent gaps in a panel of 48 combined state-local governments (SLGs) over the period 1981-2013 using a novel methodology. We found no evidence of convergence in tax revenue capacity or tax effort. However, about half of the revenue effort gaps were convergent when revenue was more broadly defined. At a given revenue capacity level, SLGs significantly varied with respect to the revenue effort and incidence of its convergence. Our results caution against inferring convergence as a sample wide phenomenon based on conventional tests, reveal a potential challenge to devolution in the absence of redistribution of federal grants, and are consistent with desire for fiscal diversity.","[Mahdavi, Saeid] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Econ, San Antonio, TX USA; [Westerlund, Joakim] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Lund, Sweden",University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA); Lund University,"Westerlund, J (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Lund, Sweden.",saeid.mahdavi@utsa.edu; joakim.westerlund@nek.lu.se,,,,,,,36,3,3,1,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Yet articles addressing institutions make up a large portion of the climate adaptation literature. With a wealth of institutionally relevant knowledge in the adaptation literature, organizing such knowledge in institutionally meaningful ways can advance the present understanding of the link between institutions and adaptation. Knowing which aspects of this link are well researched, and where in contrast research gaps lie, can provide guidance to institutional economists interested in adaptation. We contribute to this through a systematic review of the adaptation literature, assessing the consideration adaptation scholars give to different elements of the Institutional Analysis and Development framework. Results show a strong focus on collective choice and on adaptation by public actors, with an emphasis on rules in use, social interactions and, to a lesser extent, attributes of the community. Research gaps rather encompass operational and constitutional choice, private adaptation, physical interactions and biophysical conditions.","[Roggero, Matteo] Humboldt Univ, Resource Econ Grp, Berlin, Germany; [Bisaro, Alexander] Global Climate Forum, Berlin, Germany; [Villamayor-Tomas, Sergio] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, ICTA, Barcelona, Spain",Humboldt University of Berlin; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Roggero, M (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Resource Econ Grp, Berlin, Germany.",matteo.mancini.roggero@gmail.com; sandy.bisaro@globalclimateforum.org; villamayortomas@gmail.com,,"Bisaro, Alexander/0000-0003-4281-0012","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, BMBF [FKZ 03EK3523C]; EU [642018]","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, BMBF(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); EU(European Union (EU))","We gratefully acknowledge funding by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, BMBF (grant agreement FKZ 03EK3523C) and by the EU (Green Win project, grant no. 642018).

But how do firms incentivize quantity and quality to meet these dual goals, and what role do behavioral factors, such as loss aversion, play in the tradeoffs workers face? We address these questions with a theoretical model and an experiment in which participants are paid for both quantity and quality of a real effort task. Consistent with basic economic theory, higher quality incentives encourage participants to shift their attention from quantity to quality. However, we also find that loss averse participants shift their attention from quality to quantity to a greater degree when quality is weakly incentivized. These results can inform managers of appropriate ways to structure contracts, and suggest benefits to personalizing contracts based on individual behavioral characteristics.","[Rubin, Jared] Chapman Univ, Argyros Sch Business & Econ, One Univ Dr, Orange, CA 92866 USA; [Samek, Anya] Univ Southern Calif, Dornsife Coll Letters Arts & Sci, 635 Downey Way, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Sheremeta, Roman M.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Weatherhead Sch Management, 11119 Bellflower Rd, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",Chapman University System; Chapman University; University of Southern California; University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University,"Sheremeta, RM (通讯作者)，Case Western Reserve Univ, Weatherhead Sch Management, 11119 Bellflower Rd, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",rms246@case.edu,,"Sheremeta, Roman/0000-0001-8386-8494",,,,,49,13,14,1,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

We show that the presence of home production, which is a nontaxed sector, reinforces the intratemporal and intertemporal substitution effects of balanced-budget rules. As a result, it strengthens the destabilization effect of factor income taxes and weakens the stabilization effect of consumption taxes. Moreover, our calibration shows that the number of OECD countries' tax-rate combinations that fall into the instability region rises when home goods account for a larger share of aggregate consumption, and hence persistent cycles can easily occur following a fundamental shock or a sunspot shock.","[Xue, Jianpo] Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yip, Chong K.] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Xue, JP (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jpxue@ruc.edu.cn,"XUE, Jianpo/JGD-3964-2023; YIP, Chong/AAU-7049-2020","Xue, Jianpo/0000-0002-8567-5685; Yip, CHONG KEE/0000-0003-2950-2461","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Research Funds of Renmin University of China [16XNB002]; GRF grant from the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China [CUHK 14502914]","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Research Funds of Renmin University of China; GRF grant from the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China","We are grateful for the valuable comments and suggestions of Ping Wang, the Co-Editor, and the participants at 2015 International Conference on Trade, Financial Integration and Economic Growth at Kobe University and 2016 Taipei International Conference on Growth, Trade, and Dynamics.

An event analysis of subsidy incidence,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Ethanol; Subsidy; Tax credit; Policy; Incidence; Event study; Futures price,MARKET; POLICY,"At the end of 2011, the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit (VEETC), which had subsidized the blending of ethanol in gasoline, was allowed to expire. During its tenure, the subsidy was the subject of intense scrutiny concerning who benefited from its existence. Using commodity price data, we estimate the subsidy incidence accruing to corn farmers, ethanol producers, gasoline blenders, and gasoline consumers around the time of expiration. Our empirical approach contributes methodologically to the event studies literature by analyzing futures contract prices (as opposed to spot prices) when possible. Ultimately, we find compelling evidence that, at the date of VEETC expiration, ethanol producers captured about 254 of the 454 subsidy per gallon of ethanol blended. We find suggestive, albeit inconclusive, evidence that a portion of this benefit (about 50 per gallon) was passed further upstream from ethanol producers to corn farmers.

We study TBFG within a stochastic version of the workhorse New Keynesian model. We show that TBFG can be used to provide temporary stimulus, while also limiting the time inconsistency of policy promises. Existence of a unique equilibrium requires the policymaker to specify how the thresholds should be interpreted, as well as their values. With an appropriate choice of thresholds, TBFG outperforms forward guidance based purely on calendar time and substantially reduces welfare losses compared to the optimal time-consistent policy.

These results rely on agents' reacting solely to the economic content of these pressure tactics, ignoring any behaviorally based responses search deterrence may evoke. To test the validity of this assumption, this paper examines an experimental market where profit-maximizing strategy dictates that sellers should exercise one form of search deterrence, exploding offers. Sellers demonstrate a reluctance to use such offers against human buyers, but they are less reluctant to use them against computerized buyers. Human buyers are three times more likely to deviate from optimal strategy by rejecting rather than accepting these offers. Survey responses are consistent with other-regarding-preference-based reasons for sellers' actions but not buyers'. Taken together, these results suggest the benefits of tactics that rely on pressuring decision-makers may be more nebulous than previously thought. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, not all the industries nor all firms within an industry are affected in the same way. In this paper, we investigate the effects of emission taxes, uniform emission standards, and performance standards on the size distribution of firms. Our results indicate that, unlike emission taxes and performance standards, emission standards introduce regulatory asymmetries favoring small firms. On the contrary, emission taxes and performance standards reduce to a lower extent profits of larger firms but they do modify the optimal scale of firms. We also show that when the regulatory asymmetries created by emissions standards are taken into account, the profitability of emissions reducing technologies is higher under emission standards than under market-based instruments.

This offshore grid is a multilevel, multi-actor system requiring a governance decision-making approach, but there is currently no proven governance framework for it, or for the expansion planning of the European power system in general. In addition, existing offshore expansion planning models do not endogenously include governance considerations, such as country vetoes to integrated lines. We develop a myopic Mixed-Integer Linear Programming model of offshore generation and transmission expansion planning to study the effect of integrated governance constraints. These constraints limit investments in integrated lines: non-conventional lines linking offshore wind farms to other countries or to other farms. Each constraint affects the system (including the main transmission corridors), transmission technologies and welfare distribution differently. We apply our model to a long-term case study of the 2030-2050 offshore expansion pathways using data from the e-Highway2050 project. Results confirm that the offshore grid is beneficial to society. Integrated governance constraints induce a modest loss of social welfare, but do not change significantly the existing welfare distribution asymmetry between countries and actor groups. They do strongly affect the interaction of line technologies and types (conventional or integrated), so the impact of the integrated governance constraints is more visible on the grid topology than on welfare levels and distribution. We highlight the need to consider technology and type interactions in expansion planning, especially between multiterminal HVDC and integrated transmission lines. Also, an offshore governance framework should address the use of multiterminal HVDC in a non-integrated grid, but this is a second-best option compared to an integrated grid. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

We build a directed search model with symmetric incomplete information on worker types and non sequential search by firms. Sorting due to firms' testing of applicants in the past makes expected productivity fall with duration, which induces firms to rank applicants by duration. In equilibrium callback and exit rates both fall with unemployment duration.

The diversity across EU member states enables us to test this hypothesis across various institutional, economic and policy contexts. Drawing on the EU LFS and EU SILC datasets, we study the relationship between residual wage premia as a measure of skill shortages in different occupation-industry-country cells and the shares of immigrants and natives working in these cells. We find that immigrants' responsiveness to skill shortages exceeds that of natives in the EU15, in particular in member states with low GDP, higher levels of immigration from outside EU, and more open immigration and integration policies; but also those with barriers to citizenship acquisition or family reunification.

An empirical implementation reveals that the primitive asset structure and interbank connections are main drivers of each bank's systemic risk. In addition, different types of interbank linkages (debt or share) make significant differences in affecting an individual bank's systemic risk.","[Lin, Junshan] Shandong Univ, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China",Shandong University,"Lin, JS (通讯作者)，Shandong Univ, Sch Econ, 27 Shandanan Rd, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China.",linjunshan@gmail.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71472110]; Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China [15YJC790138],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China,"The author is very grateful to the anonymous referee(s) and the editor for their constructive comments and suggestions that have greatly helped to improve the paper.

On the basis of the relevant literature, a framework was proposed comprising firm-specific, experience and industry factors. Linear regression analysis was conducted to examine the relationships between the factors, entry timing and subsequent performance. This study also investigated the timing of initial investment in a foreign market. The final sample contained 174 listed companies from various service industries in Taiwan. The latest financial data collected were from the year 2015. Based on the entry information of listed Taiwanese companies, the empirical results indicated that older firms exhibiting higher levels of internationalisation, having lower debt ratios and originating from more competitive sub-industries tend to enter new international markets earlier than other firms. Service industry companies exhibit superior performance if they enter the markets later. Furthermore, the study results support the idea that entry timing is a mediator between the factors and international performance, which helps companies achieve greater performance.","[Lo, Fang-Yi; Alena, Kletsova] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Int Business, Taichung, Taiwan",Feng Chia University,"Lo, FY (通讯作者)，Feng Chia Univ, Dept Int Business, Taichung, Taiwan.",fylo@fcu.edu.tw,"Lo, Fang-Yi/JBI-9492-2023","Lo, Fang-Yi/0000-0002-6546-1583",,,,,90,4,4,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

I show that when the setting involves a single good, or multiple goods but with singleminded bidders, there is a unique mechanism, called truncation Vickrey-ClarkeGroves (VCG), that is individually rational, incentive compatible, and Pareto optimal. Truncation VCG works by first truncating valuations at budgets, and then implementing standard VCG on the truncated valuations. I also provide maximal domain results, characterizing when it is possible to implement Pareto optimal outcomes and, if so, providing an implementing mechanism. Whenever there is at least one multi-minded constrained bidder and another multi-minded bidder, implementation is impossible. For any other domain, however, implementation is possible.","[Phuong Le] Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA 02199 USA",Analysis Group Inc.,"Le, P (通讯作者)，Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA 02199 USA.",lp3ides@gmail.com,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,4,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1555-7561,,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

Our distributional national accounts capture 100% of national income, allowing us to compute growth rates for each quantile of the income distribution consistent with macroeconomic growth. We estimate the distribution of both pretax and posttax income, making it possible to provide a comprehensive view of how government redistribution affects inequality. Average pretax real national income per adult has increased 60% from 1980 to 2014, but we find that it has stagnated for the bottom 50% of the distribution at about $16,000 a year. The pretax income of the middle class-adults between the median and the 90th percentile-has grown 40% since 1980, faster than what tax and survey data suggest, due in particular to the rise of tax-exempt fringe benefits. Income has boomed at the top. The upsurge of top incomes was first a labor income phenomenon but has mostly been a capital income phenomenon since 2000. The government has offset only a small fraction of the increase in inequality. The reduction of the gender gap in earnings has mitigated the increase in inequality among adults, but the share of women falls steeply as one moves up the labor income distribution, and is only 11% in the top 0.1% in 2014.","[Piketty, Thomas] Univ Calif Berkeley, Paris Sch Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Natl Bur Econ Res, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Piketty, T (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Paris Sch Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,"MOTREB, ayoub EL/AAB-1710-2019",,"Center for Equitable Growth at UC Berkeley; Institute for New Economic Thinking; Laura and John Arnold foundation; NSF [SES-1156240, SES-1559014]; Russell Sage foundation; Sandler foundation; European Research Council under European Union [340831]",Center for Equitable Growth at UC Berkeley; Institute for New Economic Thinking; Laura and John Arnold foundation; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Russell Sage foundation; Sandler foundation; European Research Council under European Union(European Research Council (ERC)),"We acknowledge financial support from the Center for Equitable Growth at UC Berkeley, the Institute for New Economic Thinking, the Laura and John Arnold foundation, NSF grants SES-1156240 and SES-1559014, the Russell Sage foundation, the Sandler foundation, and the European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme, ERC Grant Agreement No. 340831.",,69,388,436,15,175,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Capacity reserves protect consumers against blackouts and extreme prices, but distort the market. Market integration reduces supply imbalances, but requires network investment. Equilibrium capacity reserves can be too high or low, but network investment is always insufficient relative to the total welfare maximizing level. Capacity reserves are smaller when there are financial markets or when aimed at solving domestic supply constraints. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Incumbent firms invest in incremental technology improvements with the aim of reducing production costs. Market entrants develop breakthrough product designs in order to capture the market from vintage product lines. The competing objectives of the two types of innovation generate product cycles within an environment of creative destruction, as new products displace old and are then manufactured using production technologies that are continuously refined. Investigating the relationship between innovation incentives and the average length of product cycles, we characterized three stable patterns of product evolution: incremental innovation alone, breakthrough innovation alone, and product cycles with both types of innovation. Numerical examples suggest that when the market exhibits stable product cycles, subsidies to either type of innovation raise the rate of economic growth and improve welfare.","[Davis, Colin] Doshisha Univ, Inst Liberal Arts, Kamigyo Ku, Kyoto 6028580, Japan; [Tomoda, Yasunobu] Kobe City Univ Foreign Studies, Nishi Ku, 9-1 Gakuen Higashimachi, Kobe, Hyogo 6512817, Japan",Doshisha University,"Davis, C (通讯作者)，Doshisha Univ, Inst Liberal Arts, Kamigyo Ku, Kyoto 6028580, Japan.",cdavis@mail.doshisha.ac.jp; tomoda@inst.kobe-cufs.ac.jp,,,"JSPS; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K03444, 15K03367] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We are grateful for helpful comments from the associate editor, two anonymous referees, and participants of the 13th SAET Conference on Current Trends in Economics (2013).

Rather big episodes of expansion and contraction are relatively frequent. More technically, this is revealed by the fat-tailed distributions of growth rates. This applies across different levels of sectoral disaggregation, across countries, over different historical periods for which there are available data. What determines such property? In Dosi et al. (The footprint of evolutionary processes of learning and selection upon the statistical properties of industrial dynamics. Industrial and corporate change. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2016) we implemented a simple multi-firm evolutionary simulation model, built upon the coupling of a replicator dynamic and an idiosyncratic learning process, which turns out to be able to robustly reproduce such a stylized fact. Here, we investigate, by means of a Kriging meta-model, how robust such ubiquitousness feature is with regard to a global exploration of the parameters space. The exercise confirms the high level of generality of the results in a statistically robust global sensitivity analysis framework.","[Dosi, G.; Pereira, M. C.; Virgillito, M.

We disentangle the role of economic growth from that of changes in the economic structure by augmenting an EKC relation and take into account heterogeneous responses between metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas. To this purpose, we use a panel approach on a dataset of Italian provinces (NUTS-3) sampled every ten years between 1960 and 2010. We find that tertiarization has contained the land consumption process explaining approximately one third of its total slowdown. We also find that a U-shaped EKC relation between land consumption and economic development exists but it is mostly driven by metropolitan areas. In other provinces the relation is L-shaped. From the policy point of view, we show that economic growth per se seems unable to contain land consumption. Fostering the tertiarization process can sustain more compact and concentrated urbanization models.","[Esposito, Piero] LUISS Guido Carli Univ, LUISS Sch European Polit Econ SEP, Via Villa Emiliani 14, I-00197 Rome, Italy; [Patriarca, Fabrizio] Rome Tre Univ, Dept Law, Via Ostiense 161, I-00154 Rome, Italy; [Salvati, Luca] Consiglio Ric Agr & Anal Econ Agr CRA, Via Navicella 2-4, I-00184 Rome, Italy",Luiss Guido Carli University; Roma Tre University; Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA),"Esposito, P (通讯作者)，LUISS Guido Carli Univ, LUISS Sch European Polit Econ SEP, Via Villa Emiliani 14, I-00197 Rome, Italy.",pesposito@luiss.it; fapatri@hotmail.com; luca.salvati@entecra.it,"Salvati, Luca/AAS-6179-2021; Patriarca, Fabrizioa/AAZ-9890-2020","Esposito, Piero/0000-0002-5616-8545; Patriarca, Fabrizio/0000-0002-3840-492X",,,,,39,19,19,1,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Although this was accompanied by an information campaign advising employees to make the transfer, only a minority of them did so. We analyze the heterogeneity in employees' choices using micro panel data from the Bank of Italy household survey. Two are the main findings. First, the decision to transfer and pension fund participation after the reform are more likely for more (financially) educated and older individuals, with high household income and wealth, and less likely for female employees, in the South, and in small firms. Second, framing the analysis within the Elaboration Likelihood Model highlights that the cognitive processes underlying the decision on pension fund participation may be quite different. The decision consciousness is lower for employees working in small firms, where employers have an incentive to stimulate workers to deny the transfer. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

To understand these differences, I present a stylized model of how a dictator responds to mass protests for democratization in a polarized country with two ethnic or religious groups. In this model, the dictator's response crucially depends on oil revenues and his affiliation to either the majority or the minority group. I document that the model's predictions are consistent with the observed differences in the Arab dictators' responses. Hence, ethnic politics and religious divides may play an important role in political transitions and regime changes.

I find strong evidence consistent with China having intervened and reducing shipyard costs by 13-20%, corresponding to 1.5 to 4.5 billion US dollars, between 2006 and 2012.

We link integrated risk factors of the private sector to the overall sovereign risk of state governments in conjunction with additional financial variables. Using data on Moody's KMV expected default frequencies (EDFs) on corporate default risk, we derive credit risk indicators for different industries. Building on these measures, we then develop state level credit risk indicators encompassing industry compositions to explain the behaviour of credit default swap (CDS) spreads for individual states. We find that market-based measures of private sector credit risk are strongly associated with subsequent shifts in sovereign credit risk premiums, as measured by CDS spreads. The developed credit risk indicators are highly significant in forecasting sovereign CDS spreads at weekly and monthly sampling frequencies. Overall, our findings suggest a strong predictive link between market expectations of private sector credit quality and expectations of sovereign credit quality - a connection that is not directly discernible from scoring models.","[Liu, Feng; Kalotay, Egon; Truck, Stefan] Macquarie Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia",Macquarie University,"Liu, F (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",lydia.liu@mq.edu.au,,"Trueck, Stefan/0000-0002-5302-3850",,,,,42,4,4,3,35,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

The results suggest that the increase was mainly caused by a positive shift in the demand for risky senior workers (workers with prior sick-leave and blue-collar workers).

The A.R.D.L. bounds testing approach to co-integration is applied to investigate the existence of the long-run relationship. The causality was investigated among the variables using Granger causality under the V.E.C.M. framework. The A.R.D.L. bounds testing approach to co-integration confirms a long-run relationship between electricity consumption and its regressors. The empirical estimation indicates the existence of a positive and statistically significant impact of economic growth, trade and urbanisation on electricity consumption for Iceland, not only in the long-run, but also in the short-run. Furthermore, electricity consumption converges to its long-run position by 45.63% speed of adjustment using the channels of urbanisation, trade and economic growth. The results of Granger causality imply the presence of a feedback causal relationship between urbanisation and electricity consumption in the long-run, thus validating the feedback hypothesis. However, economic growth is causing trade, thus validating the growth-led trade hypothesis in the short-run. Additionally, no causal relationship was found between electricity usage and economic growth, which confirms the neutrality hypothesis. Implementing the energy conservation policy will have no damaging effect on economic growth for Iceland.","[Faisal, Faisal; Tursoy, Turgut; Resatoglu, Nil Gunsel] Near East Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Nicosia, Cyprus; [Berk, Niyazi] Bahcesehir Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Besiktas, Turkey; [Faisal, Faisal] Abdul Wali Khan Univ, Inst Business Studies & Leadership, Mardan, Pakistan",Near East University; Bahcesehir University; Abdul Wali Khan University,"Faisal, F (通讯作者)，Near East Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Nicosia, Cyprus.;Faisal, F (通讯作者)，Abdul Wali Khan Univ, Inst Business Studies & Leadership, Mardan, Pakistan.",faisal.faisal@neu.edu.tr,"Faisal, Faisal/F-4972-2016; faisal, M/GQB-4757-2022; Tursoy, Turgut/W-4001-2018","Faisal, Faisal/0000-0003-1818-3418; Tursoy, Turgut/0000-0002-6404-5748; F, Faisal/0000-0001-6129-2084",,,,,65,37,39,1,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We also demonstrate that our financial frictions are capable of significantly amplifying adverse shocks during severe downturns.

It starts with a synthesis of available evidence on the drivers and consequences of privatization and nationalization. Then it develops a dynamic model of the choice between private and national regimes for the ownership of natural resources. The choice is driven by a basic equality-efficiency trade-off: national ownership results in more redistribution of income and more equality but undermines incentives for effort. We discuss how the resolution of the trade-off depends on external variables-such as the commodity price-and domestic ones-such as the tax system. The model thus identifies the determinants of the observed cycles of privatization and nationalization and is consistent with key stylized facts.,"[Chang, Roberto] Rutgers State Univ, New Brunswick, NJ USA; [Chang, Roberto] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hevia, Constantino] Univ Torcuato Tella, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Loayza, Norman] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; National Bureau of Economic Research; Universidad Torcuato Di Tella; The World Bank,"Chang, R (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Dept Econ, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",chang@econ.rutgers.edu,,,World Bank's Knowledge for Change Program; Latin America and Caribbean Flagship Report,World Bank's Knowledge for Change Program; Latin America and Caribbean Flagship Report,"For excellent research assistance, we are grateful to Luis Fernando Castro, Teresa Fort, Claudia Meza-Cuadra, and Tomoko Wada.

First, we conduct an event study to assess the impact of conventional and unconventional monetary policy on stock returns. Second, within the VAR framework of Campbell and Ammer (1993), we decompose excess stock returns into news regarding expected excess returns, future dividends and future real interest rates. We measure conventional monetary policy shocks using futures markets data. Our main findings are that the overall variation in German excess stock returns mainly reflects revisions in expectations about dividends and that the stock market response to monetary policy shocks is dependent on the prevailing interest rate regime. In periods of negative real interest rates, a surprise monetary tightening leads to a decrease in excess stock returns. The channels behind this response are news about higher expected excess returns and lower future dividends. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

It has also been shown that wage growth differentials have significantly lowered the co-movement of EA countries' business cycles the most widely used meta-criterion for optimum currency areas. Against this background, this paper develops a wage-setting benchmark that aims to keep the economy in internal equilibrium and to maintain price stability, while it also exhibits the capacity to correct for external imbalances. The proposed wage benchmark is very simple and may serve as an anchor for the macroeconomic dialogue in Economic and Monetary Union. In order to demonstrate the potentially beneficial effects of such a wage benchmark we present some simulations showing how current account balances and labor costs would have developed across EA countries if the rule had served as a benchmark already in the run up to the crisis.

Most previous studies use unit values, which are subject to several biases and reflect economizing choices made by households, so may not reliably estimate the bulk discount schedule. Instead, individual transaction records in household expenditure diaries are used, which report expenditure, quantity, brand, unit size and number purchased per transaction. The bulk discount schedule is estimated for four foods (rice, canned meat, canned fish and chicken) that make up one-third of the total food budget in a survey in urban Papua New Guinea. For each food we use the dominant brand(s) so there is no quality variation and the estimated price schedule only reflects discounts due to variations in purchase quantity.

The Democratic Firm and the Transition to Socialism,REVIEW OF RADICAL POLITICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,democratic firms; historical materialism; transition to socialism,,"Determinism is considered to be the doctrine teaching that a particular aspect or part of the social whole has a predominating influence on all the others. Several authors hold that economic determinism reflects the idea of a linear causality, i.e. of direct relations between a paramount economic cause and the effects that passively flow from it. Due to this linear notion of causality-they argue-the economic base is the necessary and, in itself, sufficient cause, whereas the super-structure is stripped of its autonomous role and production relations are the direct offshoot of the prevailing state of technology. In fact, this conception is typical of mechanistic, rather than Marxian, materialism, and as it tends to obliterate the role of super-structural factors, it is unable to account for the rise of existing forms of society and their different characteristics. The author's arguments against the characterization of historical materialism as a deterministic approach are linked to his claim that socialism can be implemented by creating a system of democratically managed firms.","[Jossa, Bruno] Univ Naples Federico II, Polit Econ, Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"Jossa, B (通讯作者)，Piscicelli 77, I-80121 Naples, Italy.",bruiossa@unina.it,,,,,,,90,2,2,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

For crude oil and heating oil, we find the quantile hedge ratios to have inverted U shape using daily data. However, for natural gas, the quantile hedge ratios are mostly below the MV hedge ratio which is significantly lower compared to naive hedge ratio. Such behavior of hedge ratios for daily data is consistent with our empirical results which suggest that price discovery mostly takes place in the futures market for natural gas. We also estimate the hedge ratios for weekly and four-weekly hedging horizons using non-overlapping data. For the longer horizon, we use wavelet analysis to decompose the return time series into different components with respect to different time-scales. We find that, eventually for longer hedging horizons, the quantile hedge ratios converges to MV hedge ratio. The crude oil takes the shortest time-scale to achieve the convergence and the natural gas takes the longest time-scale. Finally, consistent with other studies, we find the hedging effectiveness to increase with hedging horizon. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Two econometrical methods, which are time series (Autoregressive Distributed Lag (A.R.D.L.) bounds testing approach and Granger Causality) and Panel data methods (Pedroni test, Panel Johansen test and Panel Causality test) were used to determine the cointegration relationship between the variables. A.R.D.L. and Granger Causality methods were practiced for Albania, Bulgaria and Romania for the 1981-2014 period. Panel Cointegration and Causality methods were applied for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Czech Republic, Hungary, Macedonia and Slovak Republic for the 1991-2014 period; and Croatia, Estonia, Latvia and Slovenia for the 1995-2014 period. According to the results, while short-run and long-run causality results demonstrate that the conservation hypothesis is valid for Albania and the countries in group 1, evidence of the growth hypothesis is supported for Bulgaria, Romania and the countries in group 2.

A relevant indicator of economic development and economic performance is the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Although this indicator is the most widely used, it has recently been subject to a wave of criticism. Therefore it is necessary to evaluate the economic success, taking into account other variables, which in themselves imply social indicators: net economic welfare, Human Development Index (HDI), Index of Competitiveness, Index of Economic Freedom (IEF), Prosperity Index, Corruption Perception Index and others. The subject of this article is to evaluate the economic performance of the Visegrad Group countries using GDP per capita and selected socioeconomic indicators.

We find that the disclosure of the study in 1972 is correlated with increases in medical mistrust and mortality and decreases in both outpatient and inpatient physician interactions for older black men.

Funds sponsored by Banks exhibit lower fees and superior return performances, on average, over those sponsored by Insurers, Financial cooperatives, and Independents even after controlling for various fund and sponsor characteristics. Higher benchmark-adjusted returns for bank-sponsored funds are consistent with their lower fees and informational advantages, mainly due to their nationwide, lower-cost distribution/service channels, and their affiliate activities.

We examine the determinants of optimal redistributive policies in the context of a developing country that can only implement linear tax policies due to administrative reasons. Further, the reduction of poverty is typically the expressed goal of such countries, and this feature is also taken into account in our model. We derive the optimality conditions for linear income taxation, commodity taxation, and public provision of private and public goods for the poverty minimization case and compare the results to those derived under a general welfarist objective function. We also study the implications of informality on optimal redistributive policies for such countries.

We derive time-varying national and global systematic risks for the portfolios compiled on the basis of residual state ownership and examine how these risks are priced while controlling for structural changes exogenously and endogenously. Through anchoring our analysis to the portfolios capturing this institutional factor, we observe mostly positive pricing of the systematic risks, instead of the negative pricing often found in the literature on emerging markets. Within this well-controlled framework, some interesting points emerge. While full privatisation does not eliminate exposure to the national systematic risk, more heavily privatised firms (i.e., those with the least residual state ownership) tend to price only the global risk more often than less privatised ones. Hence, among partly-privatised firms, integration with the global market strengthens as state ownership decreases. These results suggest that emerging economies pursue rigorous privatisation and yet governments keep small stakes in privatised firms in order to ensure integration with the global market.

Using Chinese Household Income Project (CHIP) survey data and the results based on the Brown decomposition method, the results indicate that the influence of intra-industrial differentials is greater than the influence of inter-industry differentials in both 2002 and 2013. The influence of the explained component of the intra-industry differentials is larger in both 2002 and 2013, and the influence of the unexplained component of the intra-industrial differentials rises steeply from 2002 to 2013. These results show that the individual characteristic differentials (e.g. human capital) in the same industry sector is the main factor causing the wage gap in both 2002 and 2013, and the problem of discrimination against migrants in the same industry sector became more serious from 2002 to 2013.","[Ma, Xinxin] Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, 2-1 Naka, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868603, Japan",Hitotsubashi University,"Ma, XX (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, 2-1 Naka, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868603, Japan.",maxx@ier.hit-u.ac.jp,,,"JSPS (Japan Society for the Promotion Science) KAKENHI [JP16K03611]; project grand of Joint Usage and Research Center Program at the Institute of Economic Research, Hitotsubashi University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K03611] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS (Japan Society for the Promotion Science) KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); project grand of Joint Usage and Research Center Program at the Institute of Economic Research, Hitotsubashi University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This research was supported by JSPS (Japan Society for the Promotion Science) KAKENHI (Grant Number JP16K03611), and the project grand of Joint Usage and Research Center Program at the Institute of Economic Research, Hitotsubashi University.

However, the residential sector, which is the largest emitter of carbonaceous aerosols in China, has been treated exogenously and neglected in the context of consumption-based thinking. This study aims to extend the endogenous input-output system by incorporating residential PM2.5 emissions in China into the consumption -> production -> income process. I find that households engaged in high income industries such as other services, agriculture and construction in Sichuan, Shangdong, Guangxi and Anhui mainly contributed their own residential PM2.5 emissions. Furthermore, the final demand of urban areas for construction, transport equipment and agriculture drove rural areas' residential emissions through production of commodities such as nonmetal products, coal mining, agriculture, and metallurgy.

To this end we designed an original experimentation protocol. With the help of the French Wikimedia Foundation, we questioned a large sample (n = 13,000) of Wikipedia users (whether contributors or not). They were invited, after having expressing their feelings about Wikipedia, to play a Dictator Game. A large proportion of respondents, including those who were merely users, chose an equal split (66% of the sample). This surprising result suggests that they have adhered to a social norm of sharing. Investigating the determinants of this result, we prove that an involvement measured by usage (intensity and variety), as well as by attachment to, and time spent, on Wikipedia, is correlated with the choice of the 50/50 split in the dictator game (DG). Furthermore, the method of instrumental variables gives an indication that adherence to the social norm of sharing may be endogenously determined by involvement in the open online community. Our result highlights the importance of interactions with the institutional and technical frameworks of the community.","[Nguyen, Godefroy Dang; Jullien, Nicolas] IMT Atlantique, LEGO M Rsouin, UBL, Brest, France; [Dejean, Sylvain] Univ La Rochelle, CEREGE, La Rochelle, France",IMT - Institut Mines-Telecom; IMT Atlantique; La Rochelle Universite,"Dejean, S (通讯作者)，Univ La Rochelle, CEREGE, La Rochelle, France.",sylvain.dejean@univ-lr.fr,"Jullien, Nicolas/AAH-4310-2020","Jullien, Nicolas/0000-0002-9039-9021; dejean, sylvain/0000-0003-3736-4599",Agence Nationale de la Recherche (French NSF),Agence Nationale de la Recherche (French NSF)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"We would like to thank the two anonymous referees and the editor for their very helpful comments and suggestions.

We simulate the effect of tax reform on the housing market. Eliminating the mortgage interest deduction causes house prices to decline, increases homeownership, decreases mortgage debt, and improves welfare.

In order to keep the treatment and the control groups as comparable as possible for ensuring credible identification, the firms that applied to be audited and made the take up decision before the crisis are compared to those that applied right before the crisis and had to decide after the crisis started.

Our main result is that increasing funding to schools as their size increases penalizes the most deprived students. This is because the school size, although related to the educational supply, does not reflect the distribution of deprivation within schools. Thus, although in the Northern Irish context the largest welfare gains are possible if funds are redistributed among middle-size schools, our general result indicates an excessive support of small-size schools at the expenses of large-size schools.","[Angioloni, Simone; Wu, Ziping; Sherry, Erin] Agri Food Biosci Inst, Agr & Food Econ, Headquarters18a,Newforge Lane, Belfast BT9 5PX, Antrim, North Ireland",Agri-Food & Biosciences Institute,"Angioloni, S (通讯作者)，Agri Food Biosci Inst, Agr & Food Econ, Headquarters18a,Newforge Lane, Belfast BT9 5PX, Antrim, North Ireland.",simone.angioloni@afbini.gov.uk,"Sherry, Erin/C-1662-2015; Angioloni, Simone/AAC-7941-2019; Wu, Ziping/HTQ-0518-2023","Sherry, Erin/0000-0003-4952-246X; Angioloni, Simone/0000-0001-9549-4055; Wu, Ziping/0000-0003-3661-0110","Department of Agricultural, Environment and Rural Affairs Northern Ireland [15/2/05]","Department of Agricultural, Environment and Rural Affairs Northern Ireland","This study was funded by a grant from the Department of Agricultural, Environment and Rural Affairs Northern Ireland, Evidence and Innovation Project 15/2/05: Developing a More Effective Rural Proofing and Rural Champion Model.",,12,0,0,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

While the former holds that foreign exchange inflows and outflows affect the domestic money base and constrain monetary policy under non-floating regimes unless capital controls are adopted, the latter purports that endogenous sterilisation of foreign exchange flows invalidates this trade-off. The predictions of both theories are empirically evaluated for five East Asian economies using central bank balance sheets, vector error correction models and impulse response functions. The findings indicate that the dynamics for the economies studied correspond more closely to the Compensation view than the Trilemma view, suggesting that it is a sustained loss of foreign exchange reserves, not the adoption of a non-floating exchange rate regime, that imposes a relevant constraint on autonomy.","[Angrick, Stefan] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Tokyo, Japan",National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies,"Angrick, S (通讯作者)，Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Minato Ku, 7-22-1 Roppongi, Tokyo 1068677, Japan.",contact@stefanangrick.net,,,Japanese Monbukagakusho scholarship,Japanese Monbukagakusho scholarship,"National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies (GRIPS).

The fate after 15 years of a quarter of a million UK firms born in 1998,JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Firm growth; Firm age; Firm size; Firm survival; Birth cohort,BUSINESS GROWTH; JOB-CREATION; SIZE; SURVIVAL; FACTS,"The theory of firm growth is in a rather unsatisfactory state. However, the analysis of large firm-level datasets which have become available in recent years allows us to begin building an evidence base which can, in turn, be used to underpin the development of more satisfactory theory. Here we study the 239 thousand UK private sector firms born in 1998 over their first 15 years of life. A first, and quite striking, finding is the extraordinary force of mortality. By age 15, 90% of the UK firms born in 1998 are dead, and, for those surviving to age 15, the hazard of death is still about 10% a year. The chance of death is related to the size and growth of firms in an interesting way. Whilst the hazard rate after 15 years is largely independent of size at birth, it is strongly affected by the current (age 14) size. In particular, firms with more than five employees are half as likely to die in the next year as firms with less than five employees. A second important finding is that most firms, even those which survive to age 15, do not grow very much. By age 15 more than half the 26,000 survivors still have less than five jobs. In other words, the growth paths - what we call the 'growth trajectories' - of most of the 26,000 survivors are pretty flat. However, of the firms that do grow, firms born smaller grow faster than those born larger. Another striking finding is that growth is heavily concentrated in the first five years. Whilst growth does continue, even up to age 15, each year after age five it involves only a relatively small proportion of firms. Finally, there are two groups of survivors which contribute importantly to job creation. Some are those born relatively large (with more than 20 jobs) although their growth rate is quite modest. More striking though, is a very small group of firms born very small with less than five jobs (about 5% of all survivors) which contribute a substantial proportion (more than one third) of the jobs added to the cohort total by age 15.","[Anyadike-Danes, Michael; Hart, Mark] Aston Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",Aston University,"Anyadike-Danes, M (通讯作者)，Aston Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",m.anyadike-danes@aston.ac.uk,,"Hart, Mark/0000-0002-0402-4128","Economic and Social Research Council [ES/R010129/1, ES/K00400X/1, ES/K006614/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K00400X/1, ES/R010129/1, ES/K006614/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,55,18,19,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Given these propositions, this contribution has two objectives. The first is to develop a Keynesian type of macroeconomic policy able to stimulate investment and effective demand, and, as a result, mitigate unemployment. The idea is to offer alternative macroeconomic policy prescriptions in relation to the New Consensus Macroeconomics one. This proposal aims to establish the role, according to the Post Keynesian view, the logic of operation of each policy, and the proper coordination among these Keynesian macroeconomic policies.

We test a) if individuals who enter tournaments in the presence of an Affirmative Action policy remain competitive after the policy has been removed, and b) whether having been exposed to the policy generates unethical behavior and spite against subjects from the category who has benefited from the policy. We find that this policy substantially increases the beliefs on being a winner and the competitiveness of the backward caste members. However, we find no spillover effect on confidence and competitiveness once Affirmative Action is withdrawn. Furthermore, the discrimination by the dominant category against the backward category is not significantly aggravated by Affirmative Action, except when individuals learn that they have lost the previous competition.

The analysis presented here is based on work that supported the commission by estimating the budgetary impact of its proposed reforms.

First, I find that individuals who enjoyed greater market access in 1880 were more likely to work in higher-paying occupations. Importantly, this result holds across all sectors of employment, for younger and older workers, and for migrants and non-migrants, suggesting that any market size effects on occupational upgrading were not specific to any one group. I also provide results showing that workers were more likely to switch industries within agriculture, but are less likely to do so from manufacturing or services. Finally, I find some evidence of changes to sectoral reallocation, principally away from agriculture, being associated with higher market access. My findings suggest that the expansion of the transportation network in played an important role in determining the type of work Americans performed in the nineteenth century.","[Chan, Jeff] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Waterloo, ON, Canada",Wilfrid Laurier University,"Chan, J (通讯作者)，Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",jeffchan185@gmail.com,"Chan, Jeff/Y-3232-2019","Chan, Jeff/0000-0003-3782-1542",,,,,26,0,0,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Generally, forecasters slowly adjust their prior belief and behave stubbornly. Moreover, the individual forecaster also presents substantial and heterogeneous anchoring bias. A robustness analysis using Eurozone data is consistent with the findings mentioned above.","[Chang, Tzu-Pu] Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, 123 Univ Rd,Sec 3, Touliu 64002, Yunlin, Taiwan; [Chou, Ray Yeutien] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, 128 Acad Rd,Sec 2, Taipei 11529, Taiwan",National Yunlin University Science & Technology; Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Chang, TP (通讯作者)，Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, 123 Univ Rd,Sec 3, Touliu 64002, Yunlin, Taiwan.",,"Chou, Ray Yeutien/C-3201-2011; Chou, Ray Yeutien/S-7788-2019","Chang, Tzu-Pu/0000-0003-4040-5208","Ministry of Science and Technology [105-2410-H-224-004, 106-2410-H-224-008-MY2]",Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government),The authors are grateful to two anonymous referees for their valuable comments.

J,"Chybalski, F",,,,"Chybalski, Filip",,,POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND CONSUMPTION SMOOTHING IN EUROPEAN PENSION SYSTEMS: CONVERGENCE OR DIVERGENCE?,ARGUMENTA OECONOMICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,pension; retirement; consumption smoothing; poverty; redistribution; income,ADEQUACY,"Since pension systems have undergone reforms due to ageing populations, some changes linked to the relations between the objectives of pensions may also be expected. The two main social goals of pensions are poverty relief and consumption smoothing. In this paper the relationship between these two goals in 30 European countries using Eurostat data for the years 2007-2013 is investigated. Two different poverty measures: the at-risk-of-poverty rate and severe material deprivation ratio, and two different measures reflecting consumption smoothing: aggregate replacement ratio and relative median income ratio, are used. The method employed in the analysis is based mostly on the regression models for cross-section and panel data, however trend analysis and correlation analysis are also implemented. The results of the study suggest that despite deteriorating demographics and pension finance sustainability, the two analysed objectives seem to be still more convergent than divergent. In the majority of the studied countries, measures reflecting poverty are positively correlated with measures reflecting consumption smoothing. The other interesting conclusion is that there are many countries where relative poverty is not correlated with absolute poverty, or is even negatively correlated, which means that these two types of poverty may be quite different phenomena. This is probably caused by the ineffective redistribution which supports to a greater extent poor people instead of the poorest. The results also suggest that today's workers are paying for the generosity of pension systems, therefore intergenerational redistribution may be a more important tool to ensure adequate pensions than an intragenerational one.","[Chybalski, Filip] Lodz Univ Technol, Dept Management, Lodz, Poland",Lodz University of Technology,"Chybalski, F (通讯作者)，Lodz Univ Technol, Dept Management, Lodz, Poland.",,"Chybalski, Filip/N-2595-2018","Chybalski, Filip/0000-0001-9555-8741",National Science Centre (Poland) [DEC-2013/09/B/HS4/01516],National Science Centre (Poland),This paper forms a part of the project funded by the National Science Centre (Poland) under grant number DEC-2013/09/B/HS4/01516,,27,1,1,2,17,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

This is in sharp contrast with previous studies, which all rely on models based on indirect observation and require strong identifying assumptions. Second, it presents estimates of the effect of patent protection on the depreciation rate. Results suggest that the depreciation rate is in 2-7% range.

A Decomposition Analysis (DA) of the data on Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions in the European Union (EU) in 2008 - 2014 was carried out using the Log-Mean Divisia Index Method (LMDI). To detect the factors behind de/coupling of GHG emissions from Gross Value Added (GVA) in the EU-28, changes of GHG emissions were divided into three effects. The negative intensity effect showed the highest absolute magnitude in the overall period 2008 - 2014 and the two partial periods 2008 - 2011 and 2011 - 2014. The composition effect also helped reduce GHG emissions, but to a lesser extent. The scale effect boosted increases of GHG emissions except for two years, 2009 and 2012, which was related to the effects of the economic crisis. Transportation and storage along with the Agriculture, forestry and fishing activities should be addressed more significantly in relation to GHG emissions.","[Drastichova, Magdalena] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Reg & Environm Econ, Sokolska 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Drastichová, M (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Reg & Environm Econ, Sokolska 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic.",magdalena.drastichova@vsb.cz,"Drastichová, Magdaléna/ABE-6264-2020","Drastichova, Magdalena/0000-0003-0441-9725",,,,,47,2,2,3,10,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

Our model imposes a Malthusian constraint on food, but introduces a second good to the analysis that affects living standards without affecting population growth. We show that technological change does a good job explaining historical consumption patterns and population dynamics, including the Neolithic Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, and the Great Divergence. Our theory stands in contrast to models that assume a single composite good and a Malthusian constraint. These models generate negligible growth prior to the Industrial Revolution. However, recent revisions to historical data show that historical living standards-though obviously much lower than today's-varied over time and space much more than previously thought. These revisions include updates to Maddison's dataset, which served as the basis for many papers taking long-run stagnation as a point of departure. This new evidence suggests that the assumption of long-run stagnation is problematic. Our model shows that when we give theoretical accounting of these new observations the Industrial Revolution is much less puzzling.","[Dutta, Rohan] McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada; [Levine, David K.] European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, Econ, I-50014 Fiesole, Fiesole, Italy; [Levine, David K.] European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, RSCAS, I-50014 Fiesole, Fiesole, Italy; [Levine, David K.] European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Levine, David K.] Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Papageorge, Nicholas W.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Econ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",McGill University; European University Institute; European University Institute; Washington University (WUSTL); Johns Hopkins University,"Dutta, R (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada.",rohan.dutta@mcgill.ca; david@dklevine.com; papageorge@jhu.edu; leminwu@pku.edu.cn,,,NSF Grant [SES-08-51315],NSF Grant(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We are grateful to NSF Grant SES-08-51315 for financial support.

The impact of these policies differs greatly across countries. In the literature, the quality of formal institutions has been identified as an important source of this heterogeneity, as countries with a weak institutional environment generally fail to benefit from financial liberalization. Using panel data covering 82 countries for the period 1973-2008, we find evidence that social capital may substitute for formal institutions as a prerequisite for effective financial liberalization policies. In particular, we find that during the post Washington-consensus period countries with a high prevailing level of social capital can ensure that financial liberalization positively influences financial development, despite the poor quality of their formal institutions.","[Elkhuizen, Luuk; Hermes, Niels; Jacobs, Jan; Meesters, Aljar] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Hermes, Niels] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Solvay Business Sch, Brussels, Belgium",University of Groningen; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Hermes, N (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",c.l.m.hermes@rug.nl,"Jacobs, Jan/GRX-7316-2022","Jacobs, Jan/0000-0002-7994-5175","Economic and Social Research Council [ES/N013344/2, ES/N013344/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/N013344/2, ES/N013344/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,53,18,20,3,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We find that accounting for cross-sectional dependence by means of (estimated) factors considerably alters the predictive significance of monetary policy surprises depending on the sample period being studied. Concretely, during the period 1990-2000, monetary policy has no influence on future stock returns when cross-sectional dependence is accounted for by means of common factor augmentation. By contrast, the predictive power of monetary policy is even boosted when introducing common factors into the model when the period of analysis covers 2002-2007.","[Floro, Danvee] Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Inst Stat & Econometr, Olshausenstr 40-60, D-24118 Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Floro, D (通讯作者)，Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Inst Stat & Econometr, Olshausenstr 40-60, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",dfloro@stat-econ.uni-kiel.de,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [DE 1617/4-1],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),The author gratefully acknowledges the support of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) grant DE 1617/4-1.,,17,2,2,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

As the Czech Republic is an open economy and also a WTO member, the object of the paper is to depict how the volume and structure of trade between Czechia and China has changed after China's entrance into the WTO and if the trade liberalization between both countries has contributed to more intra-industry trade or extra-industry trade. The results of the trade analysis are correlated with the lowering of tariffs in China and removing other barriers to trade. Besides the analysis, comparison and correlation of statistical data, the Grubel-Lloyd index was used in order to calculate the level of infra-industry trade between the considered countries. The trade analysis showed Czechia's lasting trade deficit with China in goods as well as services, especially due to the significant growth of Czech imports from China The original hypothesis about in Ira-industry trade was not confirmed.","[Fojtikova, Lenka; Meng, Yajun] VSB TU Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska 33, Ostrava 70200, Czech Republic; Hebei GEO Univ, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, Peoples R China",Technical University of Ostrava; Hebei GEO University,"Fojtíková, L (通讯作者)，VSB TU Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska 33, Ostrava 70200, Czech Republic.",lenka.fojtikova@vsb.cz; yajun.meng@vsb.cz,"Fojtikova, Lenka/JCD-8885-2023",,Czech Science Foundation [17-22426S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"The research for this article was supported by the Czech Science Foundation, project No. [17-22426S] Law Aspects of China's Incorporation into the Global Trade System.",,34,2,2,0,1,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-289-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,76,85,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BN6JE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000485363200009,0

The empirical results, applying parametric approaches, provide evidence of mean reversion in the REERs in the cases of Nicaragua, Belize, Costa Rica, Guyana and Paraguay and lack of it for the remaining seven countries. Employing semiparametric methods, the evidence of mean reversion covers the following countries: Belize, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador and Mexico. Thus, only for Belize and Guyana do we obtain consistent evidence of mean reversion in the real exchange rates. At the other extreme, lack of mean reversion, and thus, lack of PPP, is obtained with both methods in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela. For the remaining six countries, the results are ambiguous. The results for the PPP theory in Belize and Guyana may show the importance of promoting policies based on exchange rate flexibility and economic liberalization to reach a long-run stability scenario that leads to greater international competitiveness and lower external vulnerability.","[Gil-Alana, Luis A.] Univ Navarra, Pamplona, Spain; [Sauci, Laura] Univ Huelva, Huelva, Spain",University of Navarra; Universidad de Huelva,"Gil-Alana, LA (通讯作者)，Univ Navarra, Fac Econ, Edificio Amigos, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain.;Gil-Alana, LA (通讯作者)，Univ Navarra, ICS NCID, Edificio Amigos, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain.",alana@unav.es,"Sauci, Laura/HCH-4017-2022","Sauci, Laura/0000-0002-6901-959X",Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2014-55236],Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government),This work was supported by the Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2014-55236].,,71,2,2,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Population ageing is impacting all the world's developed countries and, in general, it is accepted that the solution to the problems surrounding ageing is to be found at the municipal rather than the central level since the former is directly involved with senior citizens. In addition to the health and economic situation of seniors, a further significant problem affecting the elderly is that of social isolation (loneliness). The aim of the article is to determine the extent of the risk of the social isolation of seniors in the Czech Republic employing data obtained from the Czech Statistical Office, studies conducted abroad and the authors' own questionnaire survey. It was concluded that the most important role of municipalities with concern to active ageing lies in the coordination of the various interested actors and organisations. Well-tuned measures exert a direct impact on improving the quality of life of both seniors themselves and the local communities in which they live as well as on the balanced development of a socially responsible society.","[Godarova, Jana; Beran, Vlastimil] Res Inst Labour & Social Affairs, Delnicka 213-12, Prague 17000 7, Czech Republic",Research Institute for Labour & Social Affairs,"Godarová, J (通讯作者)，Res Inst Labour & Social Affairs, Delnicka 213-12, Prague 17000 7, Czech Republic.",jana.godarova@vupsv.cz; vlastimil.beran@vupsv.cz,,,Technology Agency of the CR [TD03000156],Technology Agency of the CR,The authors express their gratitude to the Technology Agency of the CR for the financial support provided for the TD03000156 Preferences of Seniors and the Reality of their Economic Situation in Comparison with the Activities of Municipalities within the Active Ageing Programme - Manual for the Social Departments of Selected Municipalities project.,,19,0,0,1,9,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-289-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,86,95,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BN6JE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000485363200010,0

Because skills are not perfectly transferable, the Diamond-Mirrlees theorem (according to which the second-best entails production efficiency) fails: social welfare can be increased by inducing some agents to join the sector in which their productivity is not the highest. At the optimum, income taxes balance the marginal losses from inter-sector migration with the marginal gains from tailoring tax schedules to the distribution of productivities in each sector (tagging). A calibrated model indicates that sector-specific taxation generates substantive welfare gains when skill transferability decreases with income, as it enables the government to increase average taxes on high earners with large wage premia.","[Gomes, Renato; Lozachmeur, Jean-Marie] Univ Toulouse Capitole, CNRS, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Pavan, Alessandro] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Northwestern University,"Lozachmeur, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse Capitole, CNRS, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.",Jean-marie.lozachmeur@tse-fr.eu,,,,,,,43,17,21,1,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Our results demonstrate that both positive productivity shocks and endogenous innovation have a negative effect on subsequent endogenous innovation. These self-destructive effects of endogenous innovation might account for the IT productivity paradox and productivity slowdown seen in advanced countries. Furthermore, it is shown that there are both neutral and non-neutral properties of monetary policy shocks. They are neutral in terms of the growth effect, but non-neutral in terms of the level effect.

In contrast, this paper examines sanctions when the sender and target are embedded in a network of linkages to other agents and each agent's utility is a function of the size of the agent's component. Efficacy of sanctions is then a function of two factors: the network structure binding the sender and target, and the concavity/convexity of utility in the component size. We consider both unilateral sanctions and multilateral sanctions. We demonstrate how the network architecture, together with the specification of utility, qualifies and sometimes reverses the main tenets of the dyadic approach. We add to the recent work on identifying network architectures that sustain cooperation via the threat of exclusion by showing that the utility specification matters. Thus the same network can be efficacious for sanctions if utility is convex in component size but not if it is concave. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, the mortgages that they issue are dramatically less likely to be insured, particularly so for female clients who never had an insured loan with the bank.","[Jurajda, Stepan; Janhuba, Radek] CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague,"Jurajda, S (通讯作者)，Czech Acad Sci, Politickych Veznu 7, Prague, Czech Republic.",stepan.jurajda@cerge-ei.cz,"Jurajda, Stepan/H-2886-2014; Janhuba, Radek/W-1748-2017","Jurajda, Stepan/0000-0001-6176-2656; Janhuba, Radek/0000-0001-7676-2341",Czech Science Foundation [P402/12/G130],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),This research has been supported by the Czech Science Foundation [grant P402/12/G130].,,12,0,0,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We estimate size thresholds required to support different numbers of firms for several retail and professional service industries in a large number of geographic markets in Slovakia. The 3 time periods in the analysis (1995, 2001 and 2010) characterize different stages of the transition process. Specific emphasis is given to spatial spill-over effects between local markets. Estimation results obtained from a spatial ordered probit model suggest that entry barriers have declined considerably (except for restaurants) and that the intensity of competition has increased on average. We further find that demand spill-overs and/or the effects associated with a positive correlation in unobservable explanatory variables seem to outweigh negative spill-over effects caused by competitive forces between neighbouring cities and villages. The importance of these spatial spill-over effects differs across industries.","[Labaj, Martin; Morvay, Karol; Silanic, Peter] Univ Econ Bratislava, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Weiss, Christoph; Yontcheva, Biliana] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria",University of Economics Bratislava; Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Yontcheva, B (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria.",biliana.yontcheva@wu.ac.at,"Lábaj, Martin/ADP-5704-2022","Lábaj, Martin/0000-0003-0000-8048; Weiss, Christoph/0000-0001-5260-6520; Morvay, Karol/0000-0001-5790-9694",Austrian National Bank (OeNB) Anniversary Fund [16016]; European Union OP Education [26140230005],Austrian National Bank (OeNB) Anniversary Fund; European Union OP Education,This work was supported by the Austrian National Bank (OeNB) Anniversary Fund [16016] and European Union OP Education [26140230005];,,40,6,6,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Declining real estate values ignited an increase in loan defaults and mortgage foreclosures that led to a surge of bank failures at a rate not experienced by the U.S. banking industry since the 1980s. A total of 509 bank failures were recorded by the FDIC from January 2007-December 2014, with nearly 60% of these failures occurring in 2009 and 2010. In contrast, there were only 24 bank failures in the U.S. during the 7-year period prior to 2007. This study analyzed certain components of operating decisions made by banks that either survived or became critically insolvent during the late 2000s financial crisis using an Input Distance Stochastic Frontier function to estimate the technical efficiency (TE) and allocative efficiency (AE) between agricultural banks and non-agricultural banks. This efficiency analysis was applied to a 7-year pre-recession period and is designed to final out any early warning signals that decrease the efficiency level of banks. Results suggest that survival banks were more technically efficient than critically insolvent banks, and banks' tendency to utilize cheaper inputs were more likely to stand the economic crisis.","[Li, Xiaofei; Brewer, Brady; Escalante, Cesar] Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Brewer, B (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",bebrewer@uga.edu,"Escalante, Cesar/GLV-6777-2022; Li, xiaofei/GXF-7187-2022","Escalante, Cesar/0000-0002-0789-8330",,,,,38,0,2,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Our results show that a tight relationship between an SME and its main bank increases both the firm's probability of exporting and its export intensity.

One essential ingredient is the impact factors calculated in RePEc which differ from the standard ones. RePEc reports the ratio of the cumulative citations of all articles of a journal and the number of listed items. The continuously updated RePEc impact factors account for the whole journal and citation history. This approach gives rise to a potential free-riding of authors who profit from journal ranking established in the past. In this article, we demonstrate how the rankings of economists change if one calculates yearly impact factors. The distribution of gains and losses is most pronounced among middle-field ranked authors while the top group shows relative persistence.","[Meyer, Justus] Univ Munich, Econ Dept, Munich, Germany; [Wohlrabe, Klaus] Univ Munich eV, Ifo Inst Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Munich, Germany",University of Munich; Ifo Institut; University of Munich,"Wohlrabe, K (通讯作者)，Univ Munich eV, Ifo Inst Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Munich, Germany.",wohlrabe@ifo.de,"Wohlrabe, Klaus/R-9102-2016","Wohlrabe, Klaus/0000-0002-5651-2641",,,,,15,3,3,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Although cooperation seems to be a favourable choice for these smallholders, it did not develop as perhaps expected. This article explores the factors that determine the formation of the intention of Romanian vegetable farmers to join marketing cooperatives in the form of so called producer groups. Our theoretical framework refers to Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behaviour, which we model with a structural equation model. We identified as main intention drivers the expectation for better prices and easier access to capital. Perceived family support is another significant factor. The level of distrust is high. Although our trust variable is not significant as a predictor of the intention to cooperate in the model, we find qualitative indications that trust plays a role when the intention is translated into actual behaviour.","[Moellers, Judith; Traikova, Diana; Wolz, Axel] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, Dept Agr Policy, Halle, Saale, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO),"Möllers, J (通讯作者)，Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, Dept Agr Policy, Halle, Saale, Germany.",moellers@iamo.de,", IAMO/G-2328-2012; Policy, Department Agricultural/X-9655-2019","Nedanov, Aleksandar/0000-0002-4238-9275",,,,,55,16,16,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2018,30.0,1,,,,,56,77,,10.1080/14631377.2017.1361697,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FS6KV,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000419907200004,0

In order to carry out the research study, the daily data of three stock indices of Pakistan such as: KSE-100, LSE-25 and ISE-10 are collected from 2003 to 2014. After the application of tests such as ARCH and GARCH, it was found that returns series of KSE-100, LSE-25 and ISE-10 indices exhibit mean reversion, indicating that the returns revert back to their historical value after reaching an extreme value. Further, the mean reversion rate shows that KSE100 index has the slowest mean reversion, however, the ISE-10 index has the fastest mean reversion among the three indices. Therefore, the results of the study concluded that KSE-100 index, due to the slowest mean reversion rate has higher volatility over a longer period of time. On the contrary, since, ISE-10 index has exhibited the fastest mean reversion with the lowest volatility as compared to others. But due to fast mean reversion rate, it will help investors to gain profits over a shorter period of time. Thus, it can be recommended that the investor willing to bear the risk of time and looking for long-term investment should invest in KSE-100 index. However, investors looking for higher profits in a shorter period can invest in the ISE-10 index but with higher risk-returns trade-off.","[Palwasha, Rana Imroze] Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Inst Sci & Technol, 90 Clifton, Karachi, Pakistan; [Ahmad, Nawaz] Inst Business Management IoBM, Creek Rd, Karachi 75190, Pakistan; [Ahmed, Rizwan Raheem] Indus Univ, Fac Management Sci, Block 17, Karachi 75500, Pakistan; [Vveinhardt, Jolita; Streimikiene, Dalia] Lithuanian Sports Univ, Inst Sport Sci & Innovat, Sporto G6, LT-4422 Kaunas, Lithuania",Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Institute of Science & Technology; Lithuanian Sports University,"Streimikiene, D (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Sports Univ, Inst Sport Sci & Innovat, Sporto G6, LT-4422 Kaunas, Lithuania.",dalia.streimikiene@lsu.lt,"Streimikiene, Dalia/AAD-7762-2020; Ahmed, Rizwan Raheem/B-9632-2016; Vveinhardt, Jolita/AAB-6754-2020; Palwishah, Rana Imroze/AAY-6192-2021; Ahmad, Dr Nawaz/J-5017-2019","Ahmed, Rizwan Raheem/0000-0001-5844-5502; Vveinhardt, Jolita/0000-0001-6231-9402; Palwishah, Rana Imroze/0000-0001-8865-7530; Ahmad, Dr Nawaz/0000-0002-6029-7868",,,,,65,4,4,1,4,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

In this respect, we employ a dynamic panel data model using the GMM approach in the EU member states during the period from 1999 to 2012. As compared to other similar studies, our analysis checks for differences regarding the impact of FDI on trade in both the manufacturing and the services sectors. Also, the countries' sample is divided into two groups: the new EU member states, which share a common history of economic transition, and the old EU member states, usually the most developed in the EU. In this way, we identify the potential disparities in the types of FDI and are able to suggest how public policies should be designed in order to foster both FDI and exports. Our empirical results suggest that the effect of FDI on exports is different depending on the group of countries and the type of economic activity.","[Popovici, Oana Cristina] Romanian Acad, Inst Econ Forecasting, Bucharest, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences,"Popovici, OC (通讯作者)，Romanian Acad, Inst Econ Forecasting, Bucharest, Romania.",popovici.oana@yahoo.com,"Popovici, Oana Cristina/I-1825-2014",,,,,,27,9,9,0,3,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

Recently deflation is indeed characterizing the eurozone. The renewed concern about deflation is due in part to the historical association of deflationary episodes with financial crises, recession, stagnation, and even depression. In deflationary conditions, nominal interest rates are more volatile because uncertainty increases and they may come close to their lower limit of zero: If a liquidity trap is at work, monetary policy is incapable of stimulating aggregate demand. This article seeks to show that to avoid a Japanization of the eurozone it is urgent to implement adequate economic policies in accordance with the post Keynesian approach. The European Central Bank in recent times has tried to do its best to save the situation through espansive monetary policies adopting both quantitative and qualitative easing.

This paper investigates the international risk transmission mechanism between the US and major Asian stock markets. By, applying two recently introduced test statistics based on cross-quantilogram function, we confirm the existence of risk spillover from the US to major Asian stock markets, as well as the feedback effect. Furthermore, we apply the multivariate quantile regression model (VAR for VaR) to quantitively uncover these tail-interdependency patterns, showing how the extreme downside risk transmits between the US and Asian markets. Our results suggest these stock markets are highly integrated in terms of risk transmission. The shocks in the US market substantially increase the Value at Risk (VaR) in the Asian markets, except China and Russia. On the other hand, price drops in the Asian markets also have a weaker but significant predictive power for risk in the US market. By investigating the time-varying pattern of the risk interdependency structure, we further show a rising trend of cross-country risk linkages over time. We also document considerable asymmetric patterns in the international transmission mechanism of stock market movements, highlighting the underlying weakness of adopting volatility to measure the market risk.","[Shen, Yifan] Nanjing Audit Univ, Inst Polit & Econ, 86 Yushan Rd, Nanjing 211815, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing Audit University,"Shen, YF (通讯作者)，Nanjing Audit Univ, Inst Polit & Econ, 86 Yushan Rd, Nanjing 211815, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",shenyifan1989@gmail.com,,,,,,,33,22,22,2,30,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

While traditional literature has attempted to explain structural changes by using autarkic models, recent literature has emphasised the importance of deriving theories of structural change using open economy settings. We elaborate on the impacts of intermediate trade on sector structure. In particular, we study how import of intermediate products, which is increasingly feasible due to improvements in transport technology and political integration, affects sector structure in a multi-sector growth model with capital accumulation. This topic has not been studied in the previous literature on structural change in open economies, despite the fact that intermediate imports and capital accumulation are central aspects of modern developing and developed economies. We show that the impacts of intermediate trade on sector structure depend on three factors: productivity gains from trade, specialisation in international trade and development stage. Depending on the constellation of these factors, intermediate trade may accelerate, decelerate or have no effect on structural change. Thus, the effects of intermediate trade may vary strongly across countries.","[Stijepic, Denis; Wagner, Helmut] Univ Hagen, Dept Macroecon, Hagen, Germany",Fern University Hagen,"Stijepic, D; Wagner, H (通讯作者)，Univ Hagen, Dept Macroecon, Hagen, Germany.",denis.stijepic@fernuni-hagen.de; helmut.wagner@fernuni-hagen.de,"Stijepic, Denis/AEL-6113-2022",,,,,,38,4,4,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

This postulate has been a main conceptual concern for 'old' institutional economics (OIE) and has lately also been tested through neoclassically inspired econometric techniques. This conceptual foundation has been confirmed in several quantitative studies on developed countries, in particular cases from the USA, Germany, and Italy. In less developed regions with a wealth of cultural heritage, particularly in South-East Europe, this postulate is still an underexplored issue from the perspective of advanced econometric approaches. Our goal is to examine the impact of the so-called South-East European cultural corridors on welfare and especially on total employment at the local or regional level. Accounting for gross value added and sectoral specialization, we examine the effect of such corridors by considering the distance to a cultural corridor: namely, the East Trans-Balkan Road (crossing Romania, Bulgaria, and Greece) as an explanatory factor for regional development, particularly employment. Using the European University Institute (EUI) European Regional Dataset (ERD), as well as the geo-data from the Cultural Corridors of the South-East Europe website, we estimate a regression model using a 2SLS instrumental variable (IV) approach, with a pooled dataset at the NUTS 3 level (Eurostat) from 1980 to 2011. We then triangulate the results by using the distance to the cultural corridor concerned as a treatment effect in a propensity-score-matching and difference-in-differences exploratory analysis. The findings confirm the importance of distance to the cultural corridor under investigation as a strong predictor for local socio-economic development. The results further suggest that the slow evolution of culture over time is likely to lead to the gradual emergence of new geographical cultural centers and a new cultural path-dependence build-up of persistence chains.","[Tubadji, Annie] Univ West England, Bristol, Avon, England; [Nijkamp, Peter] Tinbergen Inst Amsterdam, Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Nijkamp, Peter] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Poznan, Poland",University of West England; Adam Mickiewicz University,"Tubadji, A (通讯作者)，Univ West England, Bristol, Avon, England.",,"Tubadji, Annie/IUP-4828-2023","Nijkamp, Peter/0000-0002-4068-8132; Tubadji, Annie/0000-0002-6134-3520; kourtit, karima/0000-0002-7171-994X",,,,,109,8,9,3,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

In this article, we examine the impact of major legislative changes which were designed to induce competition in the energy sector: the three liberalization packages. Competition was expected to benefit the industry by phasing out inefficient firms. EU citizens were also expected to benefit as competition was likely to promote a more efficient energy sector and more consumer choice of energy products and services. However, this legislative change occurred during a period of extreme market turmoil. We examine the impact of all these changes on the risk profile of the sector. Our results show that the liberalization legislation significantly increased systematic risk exposure of the sector, reducing its role as a defensive investment asset. We also show that commodities had relatively little impact on sector returns, but this was expected as utilities can offset commodity risk in hedging markets. We compare our results to those obtained in neighbouring EU sectors and find the impacts are isolated to the energy sector. This article makes a major contribution to energy policy by empirically showing the change in risk as a result of sector liberalization.","[Tulloch, Daniel J.] Univ Oxford, Smith Sch Enterprise & Environm, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Diaz-Rainey, Ivan; Premachandra, I.

By highlighting the impact of such behaviours on people in social interactions, the study analyses what socioeconomic aspects can be seen as the effects of harassment and bullying as well as their impact on the well-being of individuals and the society. Given the growing impact on the national economy and the health of the population, the sports sector has been selected for deeper analysis. The aim of this research was to analyse the socio economic aspects of bullying and harassment. To achieve this, research that fries to calculate the socio-economic damage caused by bullying and harassment as antisocial behaviour is firstly analysed; secondly, research evaluating the socioeconomic aspects of bulling and harassment in sport sector is studied. Research method in this article was literature review involving analysis and synthesis of scientific literature. The analysis performed revealed that the phenomenon of bullying and harassment can be seen in terms of various socio-economic aspects as well. These aspects manifest themselves both at the micro-individual or organizational levels, and at the macro-societal level, and lead to a number of social or economic problems. However, there is a tendency observed that, with quite clearly highlighted social consequences of bullying and harassment, cost estimation remains difficult, especially considering the tolerated aggression in sports sector and unconditional competition, which requires a clear ethical framework between abusive and fair play. The article proposes criteria on the basis of which the social and economic harm of bullying and harassment could be considered and evaluated in a complex way.","[Vveinhardt, Jolita; Fominiene, Vilija Bite; Jeseviciute-Ufartiene, Laima] Lithuanian Sports Univ, Sporto 6, Kaunas, Lithuania",Lithuanian Sports University,"Vveinhardt, J (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Sports Univ, Sporto 6, Kaunas, Lithuania.",Jolita.Vveinhardt@lsu.it; Vihja.Fominiene@lsu.lt; Laima.Jeseviciute-ufartiene@lsu.lt,"Fominiene, Vilija/AAF-4495-2019; Vveinhardt, Jolita/AAB-6754-2020; Jeseviciute-Ufartiene, Laima/A-1442-2018","Vveinhardt, Jolita/0000-0001-6231-9402; Jeseviciute-Ufartiene, Laima/0000-0001-9054-368X",European Social Fund [09.3.3-LMT-K-712],European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)),This article and its research are funded by the European Social Fund according to the activity 'Improvement of researchers' qualification by implementing world-class R&D projects' of Measure No. 09.3.3-LMT-K-712,,67,1,1,1,10,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

However, previous studies ignore systematic research on the condition, duplicity and consequences of environmental disclosures. This article studies how geographical distance and peer imitation influence managers' selection of soft and hard environmental disclosures and their economic consequences based on cost-benefit trade-off models and empirical data. The results indicate that when public pressure increases sharply, geographical distance has a negative influence on hard environmental disclosures, and peer imitation has a positive influence on soft environmental disclosures. Under the joint effect of two factors, managers tend to disclose soft environmental information more than hard environmental information, which cannot only mitigate potential risks but also ensure good economic consequences. To restrict managers' opportunistic disclosure behaviour and improve the disclosing level and quality of environmental information, detailed standard norms and heavy punishment measures should be established, and regulating departments should regulate the disclosure behaviour of distanced firms and check the redundancy of soft environmental information to ensure whether the same information is repeatedly disclosed in the annual reports.","[Yao, Sheng; Li, Shiyi] China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Management, 1 Daxue RD, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",China University of Mining & Technology,"Yao, S (通讯作者)，China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Management, 1 Daxue RD, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",yaosheng@cumt.edu.cn,"Yao, Sheng/AAH-8567-2019",,,,,,37,13,13,5,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We argue that this intuitive fact acts as a strong stabilizing force in electoral competition dynamics when candidates are office motivated (pure strategy equilibria may exist, unlike when all voters favor the same candidate). Perhaps more importantly, it affects candidates' platform moderation incentives in a rather intriguing manner. When voters are evenly split, in terms of their candidates' quality valuations, then both candidates have incentives to locate sufficiently near - but not necessarily exactly at - the center of the policy space. However, as the number of voters who favor the same candidate rises, (maximum) equilibrium differentiation follows a non-trivial U-shaped pattern. It is first decreasing and then increasing in the fraction of voters who prefer the more popular candidate. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A universal no questions asked public transfer would be simple and have the advantage that no-one would be left without support. But an unconditional payment to everyone at meaningful but fiscally realistic levels would likely require tax rises as well as reductions in existing benefits. We develop a comprehensive BI scenario that facilitates an assessment of the resulting fiscal and distributional effects in a comparative context, undertake a microsimulation study to quantify them, and propose a simple decomposition to identify the mechanisms that drive effects in different country contexts. Results illustrate the challenges, but also the strengths, of existing social protection systems. A BI would fix benefit coverage gaps that exist in many countries, but would require very substantial tax rises if it were to be set at a meaningful level. As support would not be targeted on those most in need, it would not be a cost-effective way of directly reducing income poverty.","[Browne, James] OECD, Paris, France; [Immervoll, Herwig] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Immervoll, H (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.",herwig.immervoll@oecd.org,,,European Union,European Union(European Union (EU)),"The opinions expressed and arguments employed herein are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official views of the OECD or of its member countries.

The government sets its expenditure-debt policy optimally. The need to sell large quantities of bonds every period leaves the government vulnerable to self-fulfilling crises in which investors, anticipating a crisis, are unwilling to buy the bonds, thereby provoking the crisis. In this situation, the optimal policy of the government is to reduce its debt to a level where crises are not possible. If, however, the economy is in a recession where there is a positive probability of recovery in fiscal revenues, the government also has an incentive to smooth consumption and increase debt. Our exercise identifies conditions on fundamentals for which the incentive to smooth consumption dominates, giving rise to a situation where governments optimally gamble for redemption, running fiscal deficits and increasing their debt, thereby increasing their vulnerability to crises.","[Conesa, Juan Carlos] SUNY Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Kehoe, Timothy J.] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Kehoe, Timothy J.] Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN 55480 USA; [Kehoe, Timothy J.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Federal Reserve System - USA; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kehoe, TJ (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.;Kehoe, TJ (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN 55480 USA.;Kehoe, TJ (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",tkehoe@umn.edu,,"Kehoe, Timothy/0000-0002-3762-5528",European Union [612796]; National Science Foundation [SES-0962993],European Union(European Union (EU)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank Tito Cordella, Isabel Correia, Patrick Kehoe, Narayana Kocherlakota, David Levine, Thomas Lubik, Fabrizio Perri, and Pedro Teles, as well as participants at numerous conferences and seminars, for helpful discussions.

This paper investigates the effects of rural-urban migration on consumption expenditure patterns of rural households of Vietnam. The econometric analysis of a 3-year panel data set of about 2000 households (about 6000 observations) shows that rural migrant households increase their overall expenditures. Migrant households without remittances spend more on food, health care and other non-food items, but less on education of their children, while migrant households with remittances spend more on housing and other non-food items. The results indicate that migration and remittances bring a good opportunity for rural industries and services such as construction and health care. However, migration and remittances do not influence rural education. To promote rural development in the long-run, we suggest that other financial sources should be established to enhance rural education for improving human capital.

Emission is modeled as a by-product of goods production. An abatement technology is available to the plants for reducing emission. We compare an emission tax with an emission intensity standard. The tax is shown to dominate the standard in welfare for all values of market power if either productivity is sufficiently dispersed or the abatement technology is not effective. On the other hand, if productivity dispersion is small and the abatement technology is effective, there exists sufficiently strong market power so that the standard will dominate the tax in welfare.

Firstly, we identify major problems in the literature stemming from wide-spread data deficiencies in data. Specifically, the reliability of previous research results has been limited by data sets that do not identify the final destination for Chinese investment, nor suitably differentiate between different ownership types. By augmenting the project-level data from the China Global Investment Tracker with detailed ownership information for each firm, this study reveals that large-scale investment in natural resource investment, which surged after 2008, is dominated by state-owned enterprises controlled by China's central government. But it also reveals a newer wave of non-resource investment after 2009 in which non-state enterprise plays the leading role. Further, we investigate the destination selection of large-scale Chinese investment to 192 countries from 2005 to 2015 to test the extent to which SOEs might be attracted to poorer institutional host environments. We find that Chinese SOE investment in resources, regardless of ownership type is attracted to countries with political stability, but is negatively related to the rule of law measure. For non-resource investment, we find no strong institutional preferences.

Using the multivariate generalized autoregressive conditionally heteroskedastic-Baba, Engle, Kraft and Kroner (GARCH-BEKK) model, we find no evidence of mean spillover effects between patents filed and productivity growth. However, the results support the existence of the variance spillover effect, which illustrates that the innovations may affect productivity in the long-run. Moreover, bidirectional causality in the mean and variance between innovation and productivity growth is non-existent. We find that R&D/GDP, skilled labour force and economic freedom are the significant factors affecting technological advancements in the country. We also determine that R&D/GDP and economic freedom are the important factors affecting patent activities in Pakistan. Our findings suggest that the government needs to emphasize the regulations of the patent system to safeguard the interests of investors, which ultimately promotes economic growth.","[Mumtaz, Muhammad Z.] Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Smith, Zachary A.] St Leo Univ, St Leo, FL USA",National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan; Saint Leo University,"Mumtaz, MZ (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Social Sci & Humanities, Sect H12, Islamabad, Pakistan.",zubair@s3h.nust.edu.pk,"Mumtaz, Muhammad Zubair/AAA-8292-2020","Mumtaz, Muhammad Zubair/0000-0003-0319-2282",,,,,44,3,3,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

The picture that emerges using absolute,' and even centrist' measures of inequality, is very different from the results obtained using standard relative' inequality measures such as the Gini coefficient or Coefficient of Variation. Relative global inequality has declined substantially over the decades. In contrast, absolute' inequality, as captured by the Standard Deviation and Absolute Gini, has increased considerably and unabated. Like these absolute' measures, our centrist' inequality indicators, the Krtscha measure and an intermediate Gini, also register a pronounced increase in global inequality, albeit, in the case of the latter, with a decline during 2005 to 2010. A critical question posed by our findings is whether increased levels of inequality according to absolute and centrist measures are inevitable at today's per capita income levels. Our analysis suggests that it is not possible for absolute inequality to return to 1975 levels without further convergence in mean incomes among countries. Inequality, as captured by centrist measures such as the Krtscha, could return to 1975 levels, at today's domestic and global per capita income levels, but this would require quite dramatic structural reforms to reduce domestic inequality levels in most countries.","[Nino-Zarazua, Miguel; Tarp, Finn] United Nations Univ, World Inst Dev Econ Res, Katajanokanlaituri 6 B, Helsinki, Finland; [Roope, Laurence] Univ Oxford, Univ Off, Wellington Sq, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Niño-Zarazúa, M (通讯作者)，United Nations Univ, World Inst Dev Econ Res, Katajanokanlaituri 6 B, Helsinki, Finland.",miguel@wider.unu.edu; Finn@wider.unu.edu,"Niño-Zarazúa, Miguel/C-2357-2014; Tarp, Finn/T-9651-2017","Niño-Zarazúa, Miguel/0000-0003-4713-3890; Tarp, Finn/0000-0002-6247-4370",,,,,0,62,65,2,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

It examines the future potential for environmental tax reform in view of the need to integrate the economic and environmental demands while taking into account social inclusiveness. Demographic change will have significant budgetary implications for some EU Member States, creating pressures for increased expenditure (e.g. on pensions and health care) while undermining revenues due to a reduction in the labour force. Environmental tax reform potentially offers a response to this challenge. However, there are uncertainties over whether environmental tax revenues, in particular those linked to carbon emissions, will be sufficient to meet the growing expenditures linked to population ageing. Successfully reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80-95% by 2050 compared to 1990 will shrink the tax base for energy taxes and carbon pricing. It is therefore questionable whether increases in energy tax rates and a high carbon price would enable governments to sustain environmental tax revenues as a share of GDP, let alone increase them as proponents of environmental tax reform envisage.","[Speck, Stefan] Univ Ferrara, SEEDS, Ferrara, Italy",University of Ferrara,"Speck, S (通讯作者)，Univ Ferrara, SEEDS, Ferrara, Italy.",Stefan.u.speck@gmail.com,,,,,,,38,7,7,1,27,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

Nearly all series appear to display strong regime switching that could possibly be induced by 'bubble' processes, but in each case the type of model that best describes each price differs substantively. We pay particular attention to whether these series contain transient explosive roots, a feature which has been suggested to exist in several bubble formulations. Bayesian model averaging is employed which allows us to average across a range of submodels, so that our empirical findings are not based on only one well performing model. We show that explosive regimes may exist in many submodels, but only when the flexibility of the model is limited in other important respects. In particular, when Markov switching models allow for switching levels of error variance, explosive root regimes occur in only a minority of the series.","[Balcombe, Kelvin] Univ Reading, Reading, Berks, England; [Fraser, Iain] Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Canterbury CT2 7NP, Kent, England; [Fraser, Iain] La Trobe Univ, Bundoora, Vic, Australia",University of Reading; University of Kent; La Trobe University,"Fraser, I (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Canterbury CT2 7NP, Kent, England.",i.m.fraser@kent.ac.uk,"Balcombe, Kelvin G/F-8418-2010",,,,,,37,16,17,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Two different kinds of memory are considered, one where the players take into account the current and the previous payoffs in order to decide the strategy chosen in the next period, and the other one where the players consider the whole series of payoffs observed in the past through a discounted sum with exponentially fading weights. Both the memory representations proposed lead to an analytically tractable two-dimensional dynamical system, so that analytical results can be given for the stability of the Nash equilibrium. However, a global analysis of the models - performed by numerical methods and guided by the analytical results - shows that some complexities arise for intermediate values of the memory parameter, even if the stabilization effect of uniform memory is stated in both cases.","[Bischi, Gian Italo] Univ Urbino Carlo Bo, Urbino, Italy; [Merlone, Ugo] Univ Torino, Turin, Italy",University of Urbino; University of Turin,"Merlone, U (通讯作者)，Univ Torino, Turin, Italy.",ugo.merlone@unito.it,"Merlone, Ugo/AAZ-2635-2021","Merlone, Ugo/0000-0002-8559-4914",DESP-University of Urbino; Department of Economics of Chuo University in Tokyo,DESP-University of Urbino; Department of Economics of Chuo University in Tokyo,Work developed in the framework of the research project on Dynamic Models for behavioural economics financed by DESP-University of Urbino.

To steer money market rates, these central banks have been absorbing liquidity from, rather than providing it to, the banking sector in their regular monetary policy operations. When interest rates in countries with major reserve currencies are low, the yield on foreign reserves is low. A higher interest rate on liquidity-absorbing operations may expose central banks to losses. Although a central bank is not a profit-maximizing institution, central bank losses can undermine the independence of the central bank. Using data for a large panel of central banks, this paper provides some evidence that central banks tend to apply low-remunerated reserve requirements when profitability is at stake.","[Hoffmann, Andreas] Univ Leipzig, Inst Econ Policy, Grimma Str 12, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany; [Loeffler, Axel] Deutsch Bundesbank, Frankfurt, Germany",Leipzig University; Deutsche Bank,"Hoffmann, A (通讯作者)，Univ Leipzig, Inst Econ Policy, Grimma Str 12, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany.",ahoffmann@wifa.uni-leipzig.de,,,,,,,24,2,2,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Low mortgage spreads are associated with an increase in the household debt to GDP ratio and a decline in subsequent GDP growth, highlighting the importance of credit supply shocks. Economic forecasters systematically over-predict GDP growth at the end of household debt booms, suggesting an important role of flawed expectations formation. The negative relation between the change in household debt to GDP and subsequent output growth is stronger for countries with less flexible exchange rate regimes. We also uncover a global household debt cycle that partly predicts the severity of the global growth slowdown after 2007.

Optimal performance pay contracts yield non-degenerate wage distributions among co-workers, enabling the analysis of two conceptually distinct and empirically relevant dimensions of wage dispersion: between-firm and within-firm inequality. The latter remains virtually unexplored in the literature. As an application, I characterize analytically the impact of trade liberalization on within-firm inequality, highlighting a new channel through which international trade can contribute to residual wage dispersion. To motivate the theory, I show that the model is consistent with cross-firm empirical patterns in residual wage dispersion and performance pay using nationally representative, matched employer-employee data from Canada.

The estimates indicate that new drugs launched during 1991-2001 reduced the age-standardized cancer mortality rate by 16%, i.e., at an average annual rate of about 1.6%. I estimate that 105,661 life-years before age 70 were gained in 2013 due to cancer drugs launched during 1991-2001, and that the cost per life-year gained was in the neighborhood of $2146. By the standards of the World Health Organization, new cancer drugs have been very cost-effective in Mexico. The contribution of cancer drug innovation to Mexican longevity growth has been valuable, but, perhaps, it could have been even larger. Only half as many new cancer drugs were launched in Mexico during 2010-2014 as were launched in the US. In addition, when new drugs are launched in Mexico, their diffusion tends to be quite slow.","[Lichtenberg, Frank R.] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Lichtenberg, Frank R.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Columbia University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Lichtenberg, FR (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Lichtenberg, FR (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",frl1@columbia.edu,,,,,,,17,4,4,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2198-3526,2196-436X,,LAT AM ECON REV,Latin.

We analyse vote and turnout shares across 380 local authority areas in the United Kingdom. We find that exposure to the EU in terms of immigration and trade provides relatively little explanatory power for the referendum vote. Instead, we find that fundamental characteristics of the voting population were key drivers of the Vote Leave share, in particular their education profiles, their historical dependence on manufacturing employment as well as low income and high unemployment. At the much finer level of wards within cities, we find that areas with deprivation in terms of education, income and employment were more likely to vote Leave. Our results indicate that a higher turnout of younger voters, who were more likely to vote Remain, would not have overturned the referendum result. We also compare our UK results to voting patterns for the far-right leader Marine Le Pen in the 2017 French presidential election. We find similar factors driving the French vote. An out-of-sample prediction of the French vote using UK estimates performs reasonably well.","[Novy, Dennis] Ctr Competit Adv Global Econ CAGE, Coventry, W Midlands, England; Univ Warwick, Coventry, W Midlands, England; CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [Becker, Sascha O.] CESifo, Munich, Germany; Ifo, Munich, Germany; IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Becker, Sascha O.] ROA, Bonn, Germany; Univ Warwick, Ctr Competit Adv Global Econ CAGE, Coventry, W Midlands, England; SERC, London, England; CEP LSE, London, England",University of Warwick; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Ifo Institut; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Warwick; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Novy, D (通讯作者)，Ctr Competit Adv Global Econ CAGE, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",d.novy@warwick.ac.uk,"Becker, Sascha O./B-2463-2012",/0000-0002-0672-4865,ESRC initiative The UK in a Changing Europe; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC initiative The UK in a Changing Europe; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This paper was presented at the 65th Panel Meeting of Economic Policy in April 2017.

We conduct two different, but complementary, approaches: analyzing price dispersion and testing for convergence to the law of one price via panel unit root tests. The 1997 Asian crisis and, to a lesser extent, the 2008 global crisis appear to have caused a considerable disruption in the process of market integration. Despite significant tariff reduction under the ASEAN Free Trade Area commitments in the past two decades, the level of price dispersion across ASEAN is higher in 2013 than in 1990. Panel unit root tests accounting for cross-section dependence show that convergence to the law of one price holds for only a minority of retail prices, including those of traded goods, in the ASEAN markets. We also consider a nonlinear exponential smooth transition autoregressive approach and a structural break as alternative adjustment dynamics in the panel unit root tests. Overall, our results suggest that there is much to be done in ASEAN to achieve a meaningful ASEAN economic community.","[Dang, Vinh Q.

If both economic and political power are evenly distributed across individuals, then regulatory and tax policies are efficient, but if they are unevenly distributed and positively correlated, then regulatory policy is used by subnational governments to redistribute income in favor of individuals with higher economic and political power at the expense of productivity and output. Consequently, the national government has to raise the tax rate to finance public expenditure. Moreover, if there exists a positive correlation between economic and political power, then the higher the fiscal gap, the larger the gap between equilibrium and efficient policies because subnational governments underestimate more the fall of public revenues caused by inefficient policies.","[Del Rio, Fernando; Lores, Francisco-Xavier] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ, Fac CC Econ & Empresariais, Ave Burgo Nacions S-N, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela,"Del Rio, F (通讯作者)，Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ, Fac CC Econ & Empresariais, Ave Burgo Nacions S-N, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain.",fernando.delrio@usc.es; franciscoxavier.lores@usc.es,"Lores, Francisco-Xavier/ABE-6894-2020","Lores, Francisco-Xavier/0000-0003-1597-4062",Xunta de Galicia research program [GPC2013-045]; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2013-48884-C3-1-P],Xunta de Galicia research program; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)(European Union (EU)); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from Xunta de Galicia research program GPC2013-045 and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), as well as from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness research program ECO2013-48884-C3-1-P.",,44,6,6,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

In this paper, we use quantitative theory to study the dynamic implications of informality on wage inequality, human capital accumulation, child labor, and long-run growth. Our model can generate transitory informality equilibria or informality-induced poverty traps. Its calibration reveals that the case for the poverty-trap hypothesis arises: although informality serves to protect low-skilled workers from extreme poverty in the short run, it prevents income convergence between developed and developing nations in the long run. Then we examine the effectiveness of different development policies to exit the poverty trap. Our numerical experiments show that using means-tested education subsidies is the most cost-effective single policy option. However, for longer time horizons, or as the economy gets closer to the poverty trap threshold, combining means-tested education and wage subsidies is even more effective.","[Docquier, Frederic] Catholic Univ Louvain, FNRS, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Docquier, Frederic] Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Mueller, Tobias] Univ Geneva, Geneva Sch Econ & Management, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; [Naval, Joaquin] Univ Girona, Girona 17003, Spain",Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite Catholique Louvain; University of Geneva; Universitat de Girona,"Docquier, F (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, FNRS, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.;Docquier, F (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",frederic.docquier@uclouvain.be; tobias.mueller@unige.ch; joaquin.naval@udg.edu,"Naval, Joaquin/AAR-4121-2021","Naval, Joaquin/0000-0002-3605-5877; Docquier, Frederic/0000-0003-3581-6141",ARC convention on Geographical Mobility of Workers and Firms [09/14-019],ARC convention on Geographical Mobility of Workers and Firms,"We thank Jordi Caballe and two anonymous referees for very helpful comments and suggestions.

We assess alternative policies to achieve this goal in a world divided into two regions, one regulated with emissions pricing and one unregulated, supplied by multiple resource pools with different extraction costs and a carbon-free backstop whose costs decline over time. Global emissions can be reduced by combinations of three policies: (1) increasing the size of the regulated coalition, (2) raising the tax (or tightening the cap) within the regulated coalition, and (3) accelerating cost reductions of the clean technology. We ask how combinations achieving the same cumulative CO2 emissions (the carbon budget) affect the discounted surplus of regulated and unregulated consumers and the wealth of the extractors. We first evaluate these policy alternatives in a two-pool, theoretical model with high and low-cost extractors and, once tradeoffs are illuminated, in a calibrated oil market model. A global CO2 tax is both cost-effective and the best policy for regulated consumers. Extractors and unregulated consumers, however, prefer a technology only policy. When the regulating coalition is subglobal, support for the clean substitute is desired and often required. But the preferred policy portfolio of the coalition involves a tighter cap and less technology policy than is globally optimal, leaving room for bargaining over who pays for clean innovation.

The studied problem is a nonlinear multi-objective problem which has been solved by a variety of heuristic and metaheuristic techniques. In this article, a metaheuristic optimiser, the multi-objective water cycle algorithm (MOWCA), is represented to find efficient frontiers associated with the standard mean-variance (M-V) portfolio optimisation model. The inspired concept of WCA is based on the simulation of water cycle process in the nature. Computational results are obtained for analyses of daily data for the period January 2012 to December 2014, including S&P100 in the US, Hang Seng in Hong Kong, FTSE100 in the UK, and DAX100 in Germany. The performance of the MOWCA for solving portfolio optimisation problems has been evaluated in comparison with other multi-objective optimisers including the NSGA-II and multi-objective particle swarm optimisation (MOPSO). Four well-known performance metrics are used to compare the reported optimisers. Statistical optimisation results indicate that the applied MOWCA is an efficient and practical optimiser compared with the other methods for handling portfolio optimisation problems.","[Moradi, Mohammad] Univ Tehran, Fac Management, Tehran, Iran; [Sadollah, Ali] Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Young Researchers & Elites Club, Tehran, Iran; [Eskandar, Hoda] Islamic Azad Univ, Cent Tehran Branch, Fac Econ & Accounting, Dept Accounting, Tehran, Iran; [Eskandar, Hadi] Univ Semnan, Fac Mech Engn, Semnan, Iran",University of Tehran; Islamic Azad University; Islamic Azad University; Semnan University,"Eskandar, H (通讯作者)，Islamic Azad Univ, Cent Tehran Branch, Fac Econ & Accounting, Dept Accounting, Tehran, Iran.",heskandar@ut.ac.ir,"Sadollah, Ali/H-1199-2011","Sadollah, Ali/0000-0002-7782-4126; , hoda/0000-0002-4461-8860; moradi, mohammad/0000-0001-9519-3367",,,,,44,9,9,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

By contrast, the value of ordinary alternatives is subject to regret. The calculus of regret for ordinary alternatives is identical to that in Sarver's (2008) anticipated regret model, despite the fact that the primitives of the two theories are different.

However, these incentives have not been responsive to market conditions or price signals, imposing in some cases a great financial burden on consumers when Renewable Energy Sources reached significant levels. A way out of this problem could be a market mechanism where incentives respond to the level of investment on renewables. We explore this issue comparing a regulatory system based on Tradable Green Certificates, able to react to market changes, to a Feed-in-Tariffs incentive scheme. We model the strategic interaction between participants in the electricity pool and the Tradable Green Certificates market and focus on the optimal regulation for the retailer segment, which generates the desired demand for green certificates as a decreasing function of the certificate price. We then calibrate our theoretical model with data from the Spanish electricity system for the period 2008-2013. Simulations show that a green certificate scheme could both achieve the 2020 targets for renewable electricity and reduce regulatory costs. However, the role of regulators is still important, since setting the right target for renewable electricity affects the cost burden of the system. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We document a statistically significant and robust positive relation between risk aversion and the demand for redistribution that is also economically important. We show that previously used proxies for risk aversion (such as being an entrepreneur or having a history of unemployment) do not capture the effect of our measure of risk aversion but have distinctly different effects on the demand for redistribution.

All four approaches are criticized, especially (2) which used to be the standard academic model, and (4) which is now taking over as the consensus approach. Instead, I argue that banking is a service industry, which sets the terms and conditions whereby the private sector can create additional money for itself. The problem is that such money creation tends to be highly procyclical, so the question then becomes finding the best trade-off between official control of that process and allowing sufficient flexibility for the private sector. I conclude by reviewing how Lord King's reform proposals, in his book on The End of Alchemy, might fit into this broader analysis.","[Goodhart, C. A.

Its aim is to provide new insights into the role and importance of cooperatives among poor rural populations. We analyse cooperatives' inclusiveness of smaller herders and farmers and cooperatives' governance structures. The research is based on data collected in selected provinces of the central Tov region. The data were collected for three distinctive target groups - cooperative board members, cooperative members and non-members. We found that the cooperative sector in Mongolia is strongly affected by the governmental policy regarding wool subsidies, which provides subsidies only to cooperative members and has consequently caused rapid growth in the number of new, free-riding cooperative members and led to very low levels of members' self-identification with their cooperatives. This policy also affects the inner organizational structures of cooperatives. Further, we found indications that poorer farmers tend not to be members of cooperatives and that the overall benefits for non-members and the general community arising from local cooperatives are rather low.","[Hilliova, Marketa; Hejkrlik, Jiri; Mazancova, Jana] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Prague, Czech Republic; [Tseren, Tserendavaa] Mongolian Univ Life Sci, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Mongolian University of Life Sciences,"Hejkrlik, J (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.",hejkrlik@ftz.czu.cz,"Mazancová, Jana/AAK-2685-2020; Tseren, Tserendavaa/AAB-3892-2021; Hejkrlik, Jiri/L-9689-2013","Tseren, Tserendavaa/0000-0001-5328-2521; Hejkrlik, Jiri/0000-0002-1337-5261; Mazancova, Jana/0000-0002-7735-5606",,,,,39,2,3,2,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

The data set includes the voting behavior of 257 MPs in 218 roll-call votes. Our results do not show that parties account for the voting behavior by punishing politicians who have voted against the party line.

The study finds a significant contribution of individual-specific social capital to the wage level. In particular, larger individual social networks and workers' positive attitudes toward social capital significantly increase the wage level. Moreover, the effect of social capital on the wage level is much larger for men than for women. The results indicate that construction of individual social capital could increase workers' wages. However, efforts are needed to reduce the unequal contributions of social capital between men and women.","[Liu, Yang] Res Inst Econ Trade & Ind, IAA, METI, Chiyoda Ku, 11th Floor,1-3-1 Kasumigaseki, Tokyo 1008901, Japan",,"Liu, Y (通讯作者)，Res Inst Econ Trade & Ind, IAA, METI, Chiyoda Ku, 11th Floor,1-3-1 Kasumigaseki, Tokyo 1008901, Japan.",liu-yang@rieti.go.jp,,"Liu, Yang/0000-0002-2941-0025",,,,,25,3,3,1,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

Using the PIAAC database, our results suggest that both years of education and skills contribute to determine wages, with higher returns to years of education as the level of skills increases. Educational and skills mismatches appear to be two different phenomena, with educational mismatch lying behind wages. It is also found that the higher the level of skills achieved by an individual, the higher the returns to years of required education or to years of overeducation. Policy implications are derived as regards educational mismatch, which reflects inefficiencies in the allocation of the educational resources, and as regards the relevance of cognitive skills, leaving room for improving the quality of education to fully take advantage of educational investments.

Differently from existing literature, the analysis is led on the basis of the two main macroeconomic regions that today characterize the euro area: its north-east (German-centric) and south-west halves. The observation period is 2008-2013, mainly featured by the financial and economic crisis. The empirical findings evidence that in the north-east half of the euro area the cooperative banks leveraged the effects of the reduction in the interest rates in terms of new lending. In this respect, they differentiated from commercial and savings banks, which showed a more neutral impact on the transmission of the monetary policy decisions. These results highlight the distinctive role of the cooperative banks in terms of credit provision in Germany and in the whole north-east half of the euro area. Nevertheless, this cooperative banking effect did not emerge for the south-west half of the continent, particularly hit by the crisis. This may suggest that the bank's business model tend to be neutral to the transmission of the monetary policy in economies characterized by prolonged recessions.","[Migliorelli, Marco] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Paris, France; [Migliorelli, Marco] European Union, Brussels, Belgium; [Brunelli, Sandro] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Migliorelli, M (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Paris, France.;Migliorelli, M (通讯作者)，European Union, Brussels, Belgium.",marcomigliorelli@libero.it,,"Brunelli, Sandro/0000-0002-7932-3026",,,,,25,3,3,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

The causal relationship among the variables is investigated by applying the vector error correction method (VECM) causality framework. The study covers the period of 1970-2012. The results confirm the presence of cointegration among the variables. Furthermore, the EKC hypothesis is valid in China both in short and long runs. Coal consumption increases carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions significantly. The overall index and sub-indices of globalization indicate that globalization in China is decreasing CO2 emissions. The causality results reveal that economic growth causes CO2 emissions confirming the existence of the EKC hypothesis. The feedback effect exists between coal consumption and CO2 emissions.

In the model, I consider an economy in which entrepreneurs and financial intermediaries engage in their respective innovative activities. Entrepreneurs can invent new products and raise funds for their invention from financial intermediaries and if their invention is successful, they can produce new products. Only financial intermediaries can evaluate entrepreneurial ideas regarding their new products. Moreover, they can invest their capital to improve information about the entrepreneurial ideas and thus, meet successful entrepreneurs with a higher probability. I show that when an economy does not accumulate enough capital, and the level of financial innovation is not sufficiently high, the economy is trapped in a no-entrepreneurial innovation regime. I also show that when the financial innovation slightly develops, the economy fluctuates between the no-entrepreneurial innovation and entrepreneurial innovation regimes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In our model, banks hold claims on each other's liabilities that are marked-to-market on the individual financial leverage of the obligor. The probability of systemic default is determined using a passage-problem approach in a network context and banks are able to internalize the network externalities of contagion through their holdings. Banks do not internalize the social costs to the real economy of a systemic default of the banking system. We investigate the optimal diversification strategy of banks in the face of opposite and persistent economic trends that are ex-ante unknown to banks. We find that the optimal level of risk diversification may be interior or extremal depending on banks exposure the external assets and that a tension arises whereby individual incentives favor a banking system that is over-diversified with respect to the level of diversification that is desirable in the social optimum.

We find that only when measuring inflation with core PCE does monetary policy appear to have been sufficiently active to rule out indeterminacy. We then relax the assumption that inflation in the model is measured by a single indicator and re-formulate the artificial economy as a factor model where the theory's concept of inflation is the common factor to the empirical inflation series. CPI and PCE provide better indicators of the latent concept while core PCE is less informative. Finally, we estimate an extended economy that distinguishes between core and headline inflation rates. This model comfortably rules out indeterminacy and confirms the view that the Federal Reserve put more weight on core PCE inflation when setting the policy rate during this period.

The model is based on the trade-offs among freight costs, qualities of the crude oils traded and the technical configurations of refineries that process the crude oil. Our reference case (based on 2012 data) minimizes the sum of freight costs and the costs of processing sub-optimal grades of crude oil at a refinery. We model a large Middle East exporter allocating its supply regionally as the leader in a Stackelberg game where all other producers and importers are price takers on the competitive fringe. We then examine the ability of a coalition of importers in Asia to make countervailing strategic purchases rather than act as a price taker. We find that large sellers can increase their revenues while diversifying their customer base by allocating volumes to more distant markets if, by doing so, they capture locational rents from more proximate buyers. Large buyers are unable to reduce their costs compared to the competitive market outcome by adopting countervailing purchase strategies but have the potential to disrupt the rent-seeking of large sellers.

We present and analyze a game-theoretic model of art heists that accounts for the strategic interactions between museums' and art thieves' decisions and that incorporates several key features of the black market for stolen art. We find that the equilibrium level of security museums choose need not be monotonic in the true market value or the black market value of artwork, i.e., increasing the value of an art piece-whether it is the true market value or the black market value-does not necessarily lead museums to invest more in protecting their artwork. The effects of parameter changes in the model that reflect a shift of public policy depend critically on what type of policy change is considered. For instance, an increase in the penalty imposed for committing art theft cannot raise the amount of theft in equilibrium and could in fact lead museums to increase their level of security. On the other hand, investing more resources on law enforcement agencies so that they are better able to solve art crimes can actually increase the amount of theft in equilibrium by causing museums to spend less on security.","[Chen, Frederick] Wake Forest Univ, Dept Econ, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA; [Regan, Rebecca] Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA USA",Wake Forest University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - San Francisco,"Chen, F (通讯作者)，Wake Forest Univ, Dept Econ, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA.",chenfh@wfu.edu,,"Chen, Frederick/0000-0003-4746-0752",,,,,9,2,2,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

We address these issues in a dynamic Fama-French three-factor volatility model framework. Consistent with the ICAPM with stochastic volatility (Campbell et al., 2017), we find that the conditional volatility of the size and value factors is significantly related to economic uncertainty. These volatilities are also significant pricing factors. The out-of-sample forecasting analysis further reveals that the conditional volatility can predict stock returns and deliver economic gain in asset allocation.

Specifically, the paper assesses to which extent a country's integration into the international network of economic and political cooperation, the similarity of political systems, and economic interdependence facilitate the adoption of a social security system, its components, and its contributions across economies. The findings suggest that proximity through common policy, geographical neighborhood, and common culture is important for the diffusion of any type of social security scheme among proximate countries.

The statistical findings reveal, firstly, the impact of the employed depreciation methods of capital on the evolutionary pattern (monotonic or sinusoidal) of the series and secondly, the slow convergence of the Greek regional net fixed capital towards its long-run equilibrium value.","[Emmanouilidis, Kyriakos; Karpetis, Christos] Univ Macedonia, Sch Econ & Reg Studies, Dept Balkan Slav & Oriental Studies, 156 Egnatia Str, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Varelas, Erotokritos; Zikos, Spyros] Univ Macedonia, Sch Econ & Reg Studies, Dept Econ, 156 Egnatia Str, Thessaloniki, Greece",University of Macedonia; University of Macedonia,"Emmanouilidis, K (通讯作者)，Univ Macedonia, Sch Econ & Reg Studies, Dept Balkan Slav & Oriental Studies, 156 Egnatia Str, Thessaloniki, Greece.",kemmanouil@uom.edu.gr,"KARPETIS, CHRISTOS/AAN-5436-2021; Emmanouilidis, Kyriakos/U-7228-2019","Emmanouilidis, Kyriakos/0000-0003-2700-8515",,,,,23,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1573-9414,1574-0277,,ECON CHANG RESTRUCT,Econ.

The underlying logic of such efforts is the belief that women have higher ethical standards than men. To answer this question, we examine the link between gender and policing norms using data from twelve vignette cases assessed by 600 Ugandan police officers. Our empirical strategy is based on a survey experiment that randomly varies the gender of police officers and victims/perpetrators presented in twelve hypothetical cases. Pooling the twelve cases, we obtain a sample of 7,200 observations that allows us to control for individual officer characteristics, case and district fixed effects. We find that the gender of the police officer and the gender of the victim depicted in the cases are not related to the judgement of police malpractice, nor to suggested disciplinary measures. We also assess the association between respondent gender and policing norms. Male respondents tend to be stricter when assessing the hypothetical cases. However, male officers are slightly more lenient when there is a male rogue officer depicted in the vignette cases. The findings point to and complement descriptive evidence on power structures within the police, where men in leading positions are aware of the official rules and know whom to turn to for reports of inappropriate behaviour. But gender perceptions do not differ between male and female police officers. Overall, the results indicate that simply feminising the police force is unlikely to enhance service quality.","[Wagner, Natascha; Rieger, Matthias; Bedi, Arjun; Hout, Wil] Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, Kortenaerkade 12, NL-2518 AX The Hague, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Wagner, N (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, Kortenaerkade 12, NL-2518 AX The Hague, Netherlands.",wagner@iss.nl,"Wagner, Natascha/D-1285-2018; Hout, Wil/H-7497-2014","Wagner, Natascha/0000-0003-0830-6429; Hout, Wil/0000-0002-4470-0653; Matthias, Rieger/0000-0001-5041-6109",Policy and Operations Evaluation Department (IOB) of the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Human Rights Network Uganda (HURINET-U),Policy and Operations Evaluation Department (IOB) of the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Human Rights Network Uganda (HURINET-U),"We would like to thank the Policy and Operations Evaluation Department (IOB) of the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs for supporting this study in the context of a policy review of good governance in Uganda and the Human Rights Network Uganda (HURINET-U) for local support.

The effect exhibits significant heterogeneity: deaths in Iraq decrease recruiting, while deaths in Afghanistan may increase recruiting, and the deterrent is more negative in less populous and more racially diverse counties; it is smaller or even positive in counties that voted for George W.

We show that a content provider provides the premium content exclusively to a platform, regardless of the vertical structure of the industry. However, a vertically integrated content provider has lower incentives to invest in quality than an independent one. With asymmetric platforms, the platform with a competitive advantage in the advertising market obtains the exclusive content, and the content provider invests even less when it is integrated with it. We show that the content provider prefers to merge with the platform with a competitive advantage in the advertising market. Vertical integration reduces both consumer and total surplus. Our results suggest that authorities should carefully assess the effects of vertical mergers on the incentives to invest in content quality, incorporating non-price measures in merger analysis. An intervention at the distribution stage that enforces non-exclusive provision reduces quality and may have adverse effects on consumer and total surplus. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In designing contracts, venture capitalists consider the value of real options and the costs of holdup. This consideration boils down to contract rigidity and flexibility: rigid contracts mitigate the holdup problem of entrepreneurs, but have little option values, whereas flexible contracts create real options for venture capitalists in corporate decision-making, but yield weak bargaining power when ventures appear promising. In optimal contracts, venture capitalists choose flexibility by separating capital into stages and then strategically allocating control rights at each stage. This strategy creates option value in corporate governance, and can protect sunk investments in distress while capturing the potential benefits of good outcomes.","[Gao, Lei] Shandong Univ, Sch Econ, Jinan 250100, Shandong, Peoples R China",Shandong University,"Gao, L (通讯作者)，Shandong Univ, Sch Econ, Jinan 250100, Shandong, Peoples R China.",lgao@sdu.edu.cn,,,National Science Foundation of China [71333009],National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Comments and suggestions from the editor and two anonymous referees are greatly appreciated.

Using Heckman's two-step procedure, this study contributes to examine firms' innovation determinants with a framework that clearly distinguishes between the two steps of innovation model: innovation propensity (probability of being innovative) and innovation performance (patents and innovation sales). In particular, the moderating effects of industrial characteristics on the relationships between R&D intensity, financial incentives and innovation performance are discussed. The findings show that different industrial characteristics generate different impacts on innovation propensity and innovation performance. Firms in capital intensive industries and relative monopoly industries are more likely to innovate. The findings also show that Direct Government Subsidy does not contribute significantly to improve economical innovation performance of firms and Indirect Government Subsidy on innovative economic performance is easier to be influenced by industry characteristics, which have important potential policy implications to guide innovation activities for Chinese policy makers as well as for Chinese firms.

Analysis of key facts and data includes the determinants of asylum applications and trends in public opinion. In this light I evaluate the feasibility of three elements for reform: first, implementing tougher border controls to reduce unauthorised entry; second, promoting direct resettlement of refugees from countries of first asylum; and third, expanding refugee-hosting capacity through enhanced burden-sharing among destination countries.","[Hatton, Timothy J.] Univ Essex, Colchester, Essex, England",University of Essex,"Hatton, TJ (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Colchester, Essex, England.",,,,,,,,72,65,70,0,66,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

A number of studies have examined the association between economic fluctuations and health; however, no consensus on the nature of this relationship has been established. By exploiting the dramatic economic fluctuations following the German Reunification of 1990, which included a sudden change from a socialist to a capitalist system in East Germany, this study examines the association between broad negative economic shocks and health. The article finds that increases in state unemployment rates are associated with large and statistically significant declines in health outcomes. Estimates are stronger for people who became unemployed shortly after reunification, for low-income individuals, and for East Germans, a group confronted with larger economic fluctuations.

In our model, media outlets aim to build a reputation of high adeptness at policy forecasting, and audiences rely on policy information to make better decisions and update their beliefs regarding the quality of each outlet after the election outcome is revealed. The role of social media is incorporated into our model's framework; thus, the chance of a non-partisan individual being informed about each political candidate's proposed agenda depends on the collective mass media coverage of that candidate as well as the number of partisan individuals in favor of that candidate, since it is assumed that partisan voters post politically relevant information on social networks.

Identification comes from an exceptional policy introduced in the city of Maastricht in the Netherlands that discriminated access via licensed cannabis shops based on an individual's nationality. We apply a difference-in-difference approach using administrative panel data on course grades of local students enrolled at Maastricht University before and during the partial cannabis prohibition. We find that the academic performance of students who are no longer legally permitted to buy cannabis substantially increases. Grade improvements are driven by younger students and the effects are stronger for women and low performers. In line with how cannabis consumption affects cognitive functioning, we find that performance gains are larger for courses that require more numerical/mathematical skills. Our investigation of underlying channels using course evaluations suggests that performance gains are driven by an improved understanding of the material rather than changes in students' study effort.","[Marie, Olivier] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Marie, Olivier; Zolitz, Ulf] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Marie, Olivier] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Marie, Olivier] Inst Study Labor IZA, Ctr Econ Performance, Bonn, Germany; [Marie, Olivier] Ctr Econ Studies Ifo, Munich, Germany; [Zolitz, Ulf] IZA, Briq Inst Behav & Inequal, Munich, Germany",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Maastricht University; Tinbergen Institute; IZA Institute Labor Economics; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Marie, O (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands.;Marie, O (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands.;Marie, O (通讯作者)，Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Marie, O (通讯作者)，Inst Study Labor IZA, Ctr Econ Performance, Bonn, Germany.;Marie, O (通讯作者)，Ctr Econ Studies Ifo, Munich, Germany.",,,"Marie, Olivier/0000-0003-4097-7433; Zoelitz, Ulf/0000-0003-0770-6236",Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research [NWO Veni 451.12.005]; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We thank the editor and three anonymous referees for useful suggestions and comments.

We then test for respective empirical links between agricultural yields and economic growth, labor share in agriculture and non-agricultural value added per worker. The identification strategy includes a novel instrumental variable that exploits the unique economic geography of fertilizer production and transport costs to countries' agricultural heartlands. We estimate that a half ton increase in staple yields generates a 14 to 19 percent higher GDP per capita and a 4.6 to 5.6 percentage point lower labor share in agriculture five years later.

The results find that credit booms in developing countries are less likely to be associated with systemic banking crises. Rather, they are more likely to be the result of financial deepening than of dangerous buildups of financial risks; the prevention of credit booms in developing countries may thus be associated with higher opportunity costs in terms of foregone growth opportunities. Random effect probit and tobit regressions find some evidence that credit booms are likely to start when the economy is expanding and if the financial sector is larger. Although monetary and fiscal policies do not help in preventing credit booms in developing countries, we find that prudential regulations and supervision can play a much more effective role in preventing bad booms, while incurring substantially lower costs. Although bad booms are hard to identify ahead of time, the duration and size of booms, as well as the level of credit aggregates, appear to be useful indicators in determining them.","[Meng, Channarith] Natl Bank Cambodia, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Gonzalez, Roberto Leon] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Tokyo, Japan; [Gonzalez, Roberto Leon] RCEA, Rimini, Italy",National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies,"Meng, C (通讯作者)，Natl Bank Cambodia, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.",channarithmeng@nbc.org.kh; rlg@grips.ac.jp,,,National Bank of Cambodia; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26780135] Funding Source: KAKEN,"National Bank of Cambodia; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors highly appreciate helpful comments by two anonymous referees, and the author, Dr. Channarith Meng, is grateful for the research grants provided by the National Bank of Cambodia and research facilities offered by the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies (GRIPS) during his stay as a visiting scholar.",,40,16,16,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

These tariffs have been criticized in the welfare economic literature due to their perceived inefficiency: many of the prices charged under IBTs do not correspond to marginal costs and thus violate the principle of allocative efficiency. In this paper we explore an alternative interpretation of the widespread use of IBTs, in terms of social preferences and fairness considerations. For this, we rely on an extension of the Fehr, E., and K. Schmidt (1999. A Theory of Fairness, Competition, and Cooperation. Quarterly Journal of Economics 114: 817-868.) utility function, including inequality aversion, to which we add another parameter representing a reference for redistribution which reflects a societal preference to correct for income difference perceived as unfair. Additionally, the model includes a variable on household size, finding that, as poor households are on average larger, a simple IBT tariff disregarding household size may not be fair.","[Meran, Georg; von Hirschhausen, Christian] Berlin Univ Technol, Berlin, Germany; [von Hirschhausen, Christian] German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Berlin; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Meran, G (通讯作者)，Berlin Univ Technol, Berlin, Germany.",g.meran@tu-berlin.de; cvh@wip.tu-berlin.de,,,,,,,41,2,3,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The results show that there exist fiscal pressure effects; namely, a positive link between the fiscal pressure faced by a county and its industrial tax dependence on polluting industries. We also investigate the heterogeneity of the fiscal pressure effects and find that fiscal pressure effects are significant only when local fiscal pressure is sufficiently high up to a certain point, and when there are more earmarked transfers. In contrast to the situation in east China, fiscal pressure effects in central and west China are more pronounced.

In light of widely institutionalised ineffectiveness in the field of market and systematic coordination - in Iran as well many other countries - the present investigation presumes that reliance on any of the above doctrines alone is ineffective. An intermediate concept of policy rationales to achieve a comparative structure of policy implications is proposed. Policy rationales (in innovation and technological policy) for neoclassical and evolutionary economics were derived based on a thematic analysis. A spectrum of policy implications of both doctrines was designed and completed in the form of a questionnaire for, together with theoretical foundations and policy rationales by specialists of the field of innovative and technological policy in Iran. Given the institutional conditions and structural frameworks which actually exist, and in spite of wide dissimilarities within the theoretical foundations of neoclassical and evolutionary economics, Clustering of respondents and subsequent test trials show that policy implications of the economics doctrines in the field of innovative and technological policy in Iran are complementary and convergent.","[Ghazinoory, Sepehr; Narimani, Meysam; Khamoushi, Faezeh] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Informat Technol Management, Tehran, Iran; [Kazemi, Hamid] Natl Res Inst Sci Policy, Dept Econ Sci, Tehran, Iran",Tarbiat Modares University,"Ghazinoory, S (通讯作者)，Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Informat Technol Management, Tehran, Iran.",Ghazinoory@modares.ac.ir,"Ghazinoory, Sepehr/M-3915-2019; Ghazinoory, Sepehr/D-6543-2011; Ghazinoory, Sepehr/AGA-3874-2022","Ghazinoory, Sepehr/0000-0002-6761-4694",,,,,40,1,1,1,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The argument relies on the fact that tax evasion is more prevalent in the non-traded sector, which is dominated by services and the self-employed. Heavy reliance on tax-based fiscal consolidations induces a reallocation of economic activity towards the non-traded sector, thus requiring a larger decline in domestic absorption (and output) per unit of improvement in the current account balance. Using International Monetary Fund data for the period 1980-2011, we find that budget consolidations that relied more on tax increases than on spending decreases were associated with larger output costs per unit of current account improvement.","[Adam, Antonis] Univ Ioannina, Dept Econ, POB 1186, GR-45110 Ioannina, Greece; [Moutos, Thomas] AUEB, Dept Int & European Econ Studies, Patiss 76, Athens 10434, Greece",University of Ioannina; Athens University of Economics & Business,"Adam, A (通讯作者)，Univ Ioannina, Dept Econ, POB 1186, GR-45110 Ioannina, Greece.",aadam@cc.uoi.gr; tmoutos@aueb.gr,"Adam, Antonis/AAI-2014-2021; Moutos, Thomas/AAE-2552-2022","Adam, Antonis/0000-0002-9483-1547;",,,,,49,1,1,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1610-241X,1612-7501,,CESIFO ECON STUD,CESifo Econ.

Value creation to merging and acquiring firms and national countries constitute the center of the research. This study distinguishes between specific methodologies employed to gauge M&A performance on a micro- (corporate) and macro-(economy and society) economic levels. The final section of the paper concludes with a theoretical methodological framework integrating methodologies employed to measure M&A performance on a firm level and methodologies measuring consequences and effects of M&A on the economy. The aim of the analysis described in the paper is to ascertain and evaluate theoretically existing methodologies used in empirical studies that would allow proper and critical understanding of the results of various findings in the holistic and global M&A area. Purpose of the article: The purpose of the paper is to investigate and critically discuss the methodologies employed within the M&A performance framework with the focus on specific anticipated outcomes of the M&A deal and methodology measuring this outcome. The following objectives are being raised: 1) To identify recent developments in the M&A market and determine challenges and changes they encompass. 2) To identify and critically discuss anticipated outcomes of the M&A deal and existing methodologies measuring M&A performance on the corporate level; 3) To identify and critically discuss anticipated outcomes of the M&A deal on the economy and methodologies measuring consequences and effects of M&As on the macro-economic level; 4) To integrate methodologies measuring M&As performance on a micro-and macro-economic levels into theoretical methodological framework enabling scholars and practitioners to evaluate M&A performance from a holistic perspective. Methods: Based on previous studies, the authors conduct a structured literature review aimed to critically discuss and evaluate developments and challenges of measuring M&A performance on corporate and macroeconomic levels. The research is carried out as a structured assessment of past literature. The findings from scientific articles and studies by various scholars are being categorized, grouped and summarized to discern a meta-analytic view of the work carried out to date. Finally, deep analysis of scientific literature, logical comparative analysis, systematization of scientific article and business cases are employed in the article. Findings &Value added: The paper evidences developments and challenges of measuring M&A performance on corporate and macroeconomic levels. The re-search elaborates on several key developments in M&A methodology and performance studies carried out in empirical works during the last two decades. The findings help to independently and objectively assess performance of M&A from a holistic perspective.","[Andriuskevicius, Karolis; Ciegis, Remigijus] Vilnius Univ, Kaunas, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Andriuskevicius, K (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Muitines Str 8, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania.",karolis.andriuskevicius@gmail.com,,"Andriuskevicius, Karolis/0000-0002-0398-3140; Ciegis, Remigijus/0000-0001-9303-7205",,,,,45,3,5,7,47,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

The procedure is easily extended to test for changes in other parameters. Tests of empirical size and power are investigated by Monte Carlo experiment, and the test is applied to a model of exchange rate pass through, with clear results.","[Angulo, Ana; Mur, Jesus] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Econ, Zaragoza, Spain; [Burridge, Peter] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York, N Yorkshire, England",University of Zaragoza; University of York - UK,"Burridge, P (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York, N Yorkshire, England.",peter.burridge@york.ac.uk,"Mur, Jesus/P-4040-2014",,Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (MINECO)/Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER) [ECO-2015-65758-P],Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (MINECO)/Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER),J.

The revolving door is a common phenomenon, and it is unlikely that most of it can be explained by 'regulatory capture, a practice that is unlawful. Therefore, there is a need for a new framework. This paper proposes a framework wherein conflicts of interest arising from the revolving door are not unlawful, as is in the case of regulatory capture, but still lead to economic distortions. The paper introduces a market for bureaucratic capital, which explains why in equilibrium, the government allows this unethical, yet not unlawful, conflict of interest to persist. Our first result is that the political elite finds it optimal to allow the existence of the revolving door, as well as the creation of bureaucratic capital. The second result is that in equilibrium, the revolving door leads to an excessive level of bureaucratic capital. As a consequence, the interconnection of elites and the existence of the revolving door actually lead to lower economic growth. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Data rich technique employed is the factor-augmented vector autoregressive (FAVAR) approach using 179 data series; whereas the small-scale technique uses five data series. Conclusions drawn are ambiguous. Exploiting estimated factors improves the forecasting ability, but including too many factors tends to exacerbate probabilistic forecasts performance. Factors, however, may add information about seasonality for forecasting natural gas withdrawals.

Combined with the maximum likelihood estimation, the model provides a proper method of volatility estimation specialized in ultra-high-frequency analysis. Empirical studies based on the model using the ultra-high-frequency data of stocks in the S&P 500 are performed. The performance of the volatility measure, intraday estimation, and the dynamics of the parameters are discussed. A new approach of diffusion analogy to the symmetric Hawkes model is proposed with the distributional properties very close to the Hawkes model. As a diffusion process, the model provides more analytical simplicity when computing the variance formula, incorporating skewness and examining the probabilistic property. An estimation of the diffusion model is performed using the simulated maximum likelihood method and shows similar patterns to the Hawkes model. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The methods produce outcomes for a variety of different household types by downscaling the aggregate quantities from an economic growth model with a representative household. This approach uses household survey data and long-term population projections for different household types to compare the performance of the downscaling methods vs. a general equilibrium model with multiple household groups under a variety of conditions, including demographic change, technological change, and a carbon tax. Both recursive-dynamic and forward-looking downscaling methods produce results that approximate well a multiple household model run. The recursive-dynamic downscaling method is applied to an illustrative example estimating impacts of a carbon tax on aggregate CO2 emissions and the energy demand of different household groups for a middle of the road development scenario.

The results indicate that the ERF budget can only help Australia to buy 85% of the required abatements, subject to its 2020 target, and that the implementations of ETSs in the other economies would not greatly affect either the emissions levels or the MAC curves in Australia.

In January 2014, the Israeli government passed a new regulation prohibiting the use of non 0-ending prices, bringing an end to 9-ending prices. We find that seven months after 9-ending prices have disappeared, 90-ending prices acquired the same status as 9-ending prices had before the new regulation was adopted.

We present a two-country overlapping-generations model that explores the relationship between the magnitude of pension guarantees and the resulting portfolio choices of workers. The existence of a payas-you-go pension system lowers the wealth of the young workers, who consequently borrow from abroad to supplement their current consumption, and lowers the overall riskiness of their lifetime wealth, prompting them to invest in risky equity financed by the selling of safe bonds. In particular, we are able to replicate and explain the venture capitalist (positive net equity accompanied by negative net debt) portfolio profile of the United States. More broadly, we find empirical support for our results in a cross-country analysis using data from 110 economies: greater amounts of pension spending are associated with international indebtedness, long equity positions, and short debt positions.

However, in most of these studies, informational asymmetries were part of the experimental design, and therefore no clear conclusion on whether the obtained results were driven by overconfidence or informational asymmetries could be made. The article addresses this issue by analysing individual financial decisions based on the study of Michailova and Schmidt, who ran an asset markets experiment with no informational asymmetries. Additionally, the study controls for differences in individual risk aversion. The data revealed that, in this setting, individual trading activity and performance were influenced by overconfidence only for female participants. Mistakes in future price forecasting, which were negatively correlated with overconfidence, partially accounted for this result. Risk aversion was uncorrelated with overconfidence and had no influence on experimental outcomes.","[Michailova, Julija] Kozminski Univ, Ctr Econ Psychol & Decis Sci, Warsaw, Poland; [Maciulis, Alminas] Off Govt Republ Lithuania, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Tvaronaviciene, Manuela] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Business Management Fac, Vilnius, Lithuania",Kozminski University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Michailova, J (通讯作者)，Kozminski Univ, Ctr Econ Psychol & Decis Sci, Warsaw, Poland.",julija_michailova@yahoo.com,"/I-3713-2019; Tvaronaviciene, Manuela/GVT-4155-2022","/0000-0002-9667-3730; Tvaronaviciene, Manuela/0000-0002-9667-3730",,,,,42,13,13,3,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We explore the fact that plants face varying degrees of exposure to the enforcement of labor market regulations, and rely on Brazil's currency crisis in 1999 as an exogenous source of variation in access to foreign markets. Using administrative data on employers and their employees, and on the enforcement of labor regulations at the city level over Brazil's crisis period, we document that the way a currency shock affects employment depends on the stringency of de facto labor market regulations. In particular, we show for Brazil, a country with strict de jure labor regulation, that after a depreciation, plants facing stricter enforcement of the labor law increase employment by less than plants facing looser enforcement. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that, in the context of strict de jure labor market regulations, increased enforcement limits the plant-level productivity gains associated with a more global market. Therefore, increasing the flexibility of de jure regulations may allow for broader access to the gains from trade.","[Almeida, Rita K.] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Almeida, Rita K.; Poole, Jennifer P.] IZA, Washington, DC USA; [Poole, Jennifer P.] Amer Univ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",The World Bank; American University,"Poole, JP (通讯作者)，Sch Int Serv, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",poole@american.edu,,,UCSC Academic Senate Committee on Research,UCSC Academic Senate Committee on Research,"Our special thanks to Paulo Furtado de Castro for help with the RATS data and to the Department of Economics and Academic Computing Services at the University of California, San Diegf4o for assistance with data access.

Prominent examples include the minimum manning requirements at each Army branch in military cadet matching and diversity considerations in school choice, whereby school districts impose constraints on the demographic distribution of students at each school. Standard assignment mechanisms implemented in practice are unable to accommodate these constraints. This leads policymakers to resort to ad hoc solutions that eliminate blocks of seats ex ante (before agents submit their preferences) to ensure that all constraints are satisfied ex post (after the mechanism is run). We show that these current solutions ignore important information contained in the submitted preferences, resulting in avoidable inefficiency. We then introduce new dynamic quotas mechanisms that result in Pareto superior allocations while at the same time respecting all distributional constraints and satisfying important fairness and incentive properties. We expect the use of our mechanisms to improve the performance of matching markets with distributional constraints in the field.","[Fragiadakis, Daniel] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Troyan, Peter] Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of Virginia,"Fragiadakis, D (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",dfragiadakis@tamu.edu; troyan@virginia.edu,,"Troyan, Peter/0000-0002-7468-3065",B.

However, these models often include very little temporal resolution and thus have difficulty in representing the integration costs that arise from mismatches between electricity supply and demand. The global integrated assessment model, MESSAGE, has been updated to explicitly model the trade-offs between variable renewable energy (VRE) deployment and its impacts on the electricity system, including the implications for electricity curtailment, backup capacity, and system flexibility. These impacts have been parameterized using a reduced-form approach, which allows VRE integration impacts to be quantified on a regional basis. In addition, thermoelectric technologies were updated to include two modes of operation, baseload and flexible, to better account for the cost, efficiency, and availability penalties associated with flexible operation. In this paper, the modeling approach used in MESSAGE is explained and the implications for VRE deployment in mitigation scenarios are assessed.

This paper shows how appropriate tariff aggregation can overcome underestimation of both efficiency and terms-of-trade gains from reform. The improvement is shown to result from better measurement of a distortion effect that is most important in the early stages of reform and a weighting effect that becomes more important as protection is reduced. Applications confirm that the technique can be applied relatively easily, andwith elasticity estimates suggested by the available econometric evidencepoint to close to a doubling of the global welfare gains from global trade reform, and dramatic changes in the measured welfare impacts in many individual cases. Sensitivity analysis suggests that, for global trade reform, the ease of substitution between tariff lines is much more important than that between varieties from different countries. We provide an online aggregation tool to allow replication of our analysis or investigation of alternative scenarios for global reform. We hope that this paper will contribute both to wider use of optimal aggregators and improved estimates of the key elasticity parameters.","[Laborde, David; Martin, Will] IFPRI, MTID, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [van der Mensbrugghe, Dominique] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Laborde, D (通讯作者)，IFPRI, MTID, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",d.laborde@cgiar.org; w.martin@cgiar.org; vandermd@purdue.edu,,,"Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Trade at the World Bank; CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions and Markets, led by IFPRI","Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Trade at the World Bank; CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions and Markets, led by IFPRI(CGIAR)","This research was partially funded by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Trade at the World Bank and by the CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions and Markets, led by IFPRI.",,35,8,8,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

This study examined whether public health spending in Ebola affected Sub-Saharan African countries (SSACs) were more likely to decrease compared to non-Ebola affected countries due to IMF bailout program participation. A regression model and its robustness were used to analyse SSACs data from 1994 to 2014. The empirical findings of this study show that IMF bailout can significantly increase the health expenditure of non-Ebola-affected SSACs. But we obtained a significantly negative relationship between health spending and IMF program participation for Ebola-affected SSACs. The study has implications for the methodological design of studies addressing this debatable issue and health spending policy in SSACs. (C) 2017 The Society for Policy Modeling.

Shared ownership is optimal as a joint result of mitigating hold-up and inducing truthful information revelation. Due to the incomplete contracting nature, shared ownership is incentive compatible if it induces truthful information revelation within the relationship as well as when the relationship breaks. Off-the-equilibrium-path incentive compatibility results in the optimality of partnership even for the most efficient type of the informed party. Inefficient investment thus arises. The level of shared ownership depends on the relative magnitude of the information rent effect and the hold-up effect. Shared ownership is robust to semi-truthful information revelation, under which hold-up occurs in equilibrium with an endogenously determined probability related to the revelation strategy.

The acquisition of human capital, jointly determined by parental investment and child effort, is an equilibrium outcome of the intergenerational interactions, which is Pareto efficient within the family. We show that the equilibrium output of human capital is not affected by the parental authority over child behavior, but it is usually lower than the level that maximizes the instantaneous aggregate family welfare. In a family with more than one child, siblings not only compete for parental investments but also directly interact with each other in their effort choices. Exploring intragenerational connections and their interplay with intergenerational forces, we present a more complete theory of family linkages in human development and its implications for the rise and fall of families. Social interactions among children from different families induce intragenerational feedback effects that are further amplified by intrafamily interactions and accelerate regression toward the mean in the economic status of families.

Realistic life tables such as model life tables are mandatory, because the age distribution of mortality matters, notably at infant and juvenile ages. Optimal period school life expectancy varies with life expectancy and fertility.

Second, it could focus on strengthening the financial system as a whole by reducing the probability of large-scale cascading events. This can be achieved by re-shaping the topology of financial networks. We use an agent-based model of a financial system and the real economy to study and compare the consequences of these two options. By conducting three computer experiments with the agent-based model we find that re-shaping financial networks is more effective and efficient than reducing financial fragility.

First, we establish the equivalence between such models and reduced exchange models in which countries directly exchange factor services. This equivalence implies that, for an arbitrary change in trade costs, counterfactual changes in the factor content of trade, factor prices, and welfare only depend on the shape of a reduced factor demand system. Second, we provide sufficient conditions under which estimates of this system can be recovered nonparametrically. Together, these results offer a strict generalization of the parametric approach used in-so-called gravity models.

However, the link between this remarkable growth rate and poverty reduction is neither obvious nor simple. This paper focuses on the elasticity of poverty with respect to GDP growth at the sectoral level and takes into account the fact that economic growth may affect poverty directly as well as indirectly through sectoral labor share intensity. It develops a methodology that sheds light on the contribution of sectoral growth to poverty reduction country-by-country in Africa, guiding policy recommendations. As the composition of growth matters at least as much as its overall intensity, it is key to identify the sectors that have the strongest impact on poverty reduction and unleash their potential; if growth happens to concentrate in sectors with scarce pro-poor potential, like commodity-driven growth, redistributive strategies are necessary to compensate the weak effect on poverty.","[Berardi, Nicoletta] Banque France, 31 Rue Croix des Petits Champs, F-75001 Paris, France; [Marzo, Federica] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",European Central Bank; Bank of France; The World Bank,"Berardi, N (通讯作者)，Banque France, 31 Rue Croix des Petits Champs, F-75001 Paris, France.",Nicoletta.Berardi@banque-france.fr,,"Berardi, Nicoletta/0000-0003-4916-2097",OECD Development Centre; Statistical Office of Algeria; Statistical Office of Botswana; Statistical Office of Burundi; Statistical Office of Cameroon; Statistical Office of Central African Republic; Statistical Office of Republic of the Congo; Statistical Office of Cote d'Ivoire; Statistical Office of Egypt; Statistical Office of Eritrea; Statistical Office of Gabon; Statistical Office of Gambia; Statistical Office of Kenya; Statistical Office of Lesotho; Statistical Office of Madagascar; Statistical Office of Malawi; Statistical Office of Mali; Statistical Office of Morocco; Statistical Office of Mozambique; Statistical Office of Namibia; Statistical Office of Nigeria; Statistical Office of Sao Tome and Principe; Statistical Office of Senegal; Statistical Office of Seychelles; Statistical Office of South Africa; Statistical Office of Sudan; Statistical Office of Tanzania; Statistical Office of Tunisia; Statistical Office of Zambia,OECD Development Centre; Statistical Office of Algeria; Statistical Office of Botswana; Statistical Office of Burundi; Statistical Office of Cameroon; Statistical Office of Central African Republic; Statistical Office of Republic of the Congo; Statistical Office of Cote d'Ivoire; Statistical Office of Egypt; Statistical Office of Eritrea; Statistical Office of Gabon; Statistical Office of Gambia; Statistical Office of Kenya; Statistical Office of Lesotho; Statistical Office of Madagascar; Statistical Office of Malawi; Statistical Office of Mali; Statistical Office of Morocco; Statistical Office of Mozambique; Statistical Office of Namibia; Statistical Office of Nigeria; Statistical Office of Sao Tome and Principe; Statistical Office of Senegal; Statistical Office of Seychelles; Statistical Office of South Africa; Statistical Office of Sudan; Statistical Office of Tanzania; Statistical Office of Tunisia; Statistical Office of Zambia,"We thank Joseph Stiglitz and Akbar Noman and the participants of the 2010 Advanced Graduate Workshop on Poverty, Globalization and Development.

However, the literature on this issue has analyzed mainly the privatization of uniproduct public firms. We consider a state holding corporation with two plants that may produce complement or substitute goods. Assuming that private firms are more efficient than the state holding corporation we find the following: If the marginal cost of the state corporation is low, it is not privatized either if goods are substitutes or if they are complements. However, if the marginal cost of the state corporation is high the two plants of the state holding corporation are sold to a single private investor if goods are complements, and to different investors if goods are substitutes. If goods are close substitutes and the marginal cost of the state corporation takes an intermediate value only one plant is privatized. We extend the model to consider that firms are equally efficient, that they face quadratic cost functions and that there are n uniplant private firms producing each good. We find two differences with the previous result: The government never privatizes just one plant of the state corporation, and when goods are complements the two plants of the state corporation are sold to different investors if n is high.","[Carlos Barcena-Ruiz, Juan; Begona Garzon, Maria] Univ Pais Vasco UPV EHU, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ I, Ave Lehendakari Aguirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain",University of Basque Country,"Bárcena-Ruiz, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Pais Vasco UPV EHU, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ I, Ave Lehendakari Aguirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain.",juancarlos.barcena@ehu.es; mariabegona.garzon@ehu.es,"Garzón, María Begoña/AAZ-7360-2021; Garzón, Begoña/Z-4669-2019; Barcena-Ruiz, Juan Carlos/G-6104-2011","Garzón, Begoña/0000-0002-5731-7581; Barcena-Ruiz, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-8808-2543","Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia [ECO2012-32299, ECO2015-66803-P]; Basque Government [IT1124-16]; University of the Basque Country [EHU14/05]",Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia(Spanish Government); Basque Government(Basque Government); University of the Basque Country,"We would like to thank two referees for helpful comments.

We find that economic and fiscal factors dominate the uncertainty landscape over the 3 year and longer time horizons. The near term tends to be dominated by non-fundamental factors, such as measurement errors, that are typically outside of reasonable policy responses. We conclude that medium-term fiscal targets are better placed to support macroeconomic stability than short-term targets. We also quantify the fiscal buffers that may be needed to offset some of the future uncertainty, if policy-makers choose to do so. The analysis is intended to support contingency planning in fiscal management and communication strategy of fiscal targets.","[Fukac, Martin] New Zealand Treasury, Wellington 6011, New Zealand; [Kirkby, Robert] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Econ & Finance, Wellington 6011, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington,"Kirkby, R (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Econ & Finance, Wellington 6011, New Zealand.",robertdkirkby@gmail.com,,"Kirkby, Robert/0000-0002-8242-0513",,,,,9,1,1,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-9018,1467-8462,,AUST ECON REV,Aust.

We run a laboratory experiment in which different levels of group identity are induced through different matching protocols (random or based on individual painting preferences) and the possibility to interact with group members via an online chat in a group task. Risk behaviour is measured by using the Bomb Risk Elicitation Task and peer influence is introduced by giving subjects feedback regarding group members' previous decisions. We find that subjects are affected by their peers when taking decisions and that group identity influences the magnitude of peer effects: painting preferences matching significantly reduces the heterogeneity in risk behaviour compared with random matching. On the other hand, introducing a group task has no significant effect on behaviour, possibly because interaction does not always contribute to enhancing group identity. Finally, relative riskiness within the group matters and individuals whose peers are riskier than they are take on average riskier decisions, even when controlling for regression to the mean.","[Gioia, Francesca] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Econ, 30 Buccleuch Pl, Edinburgh EH8 9JT, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Gioia, F (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Sch Econ, 30 Buccleuch Pl, Edinburgh EH8 9JT, Midlothian, Scotland.",f.gioia@sms.ed.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council; School of Economics at the University of Edinburgh; Economic and Social Research Council [1358750] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); School of Economics at the University of Edinburgh; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We would like to thank Michele Belot, Steven Dieterle, Maria De Paola, Ed Hopkins, Tatiana Kornienko and Graeme Pearce for useful comments on earlier drafts of this paper and Athanasia Arnokourou and Ivan Salter for their help in conducting the experiment.

We examine this by using evidence from a recent tax reform in Finland. The so-called equalization tax (EQT) used to be a regular element of European imputation systems, designed to ensure that dividends were not paid out of untaxed profits. Theoretical analyses have suggested that EQT may distort several financial decisions of MNEs. We find a 23% increase in dividend payments and a similar increase in repatriated foreign profits after the repeal of EQT among Finnish MNEs. We also find evidence that the reported profits increased among foreign subsidiaries of Finnish MNEs, which indicates an effect on profit-shifting.

This GMM estimator incorporates the probit error and the heteroscedasticity of the error term in the first-stage equation in order to construct the optimal instruments. The estimator estimates the structural equation and the first-stage equation jointly and, based on this joint moment condition, is efficient within the class of GMM estimators. To estimate the heteroscedasticity of the error term of the first-stage equation, we use the k-nearest neighbour (k-nn) non-parametric estimation procedure. Our Monte Carlo simulation shows that in the presence of heteroscedasticity and endogeneity, our GMM estimator outperforms the two-stage conditional maximum likelihood estimator. Our results suggest that in the presence of heteroscedasticity in the first-stage equation, the proposed GMM estimator with optimal instruments is a useful option for researchers.","[Kawaguchi, Daiji] Univ Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; [Matsushita, Yukitoshi] Tokyo Inst Technol, Tokyo, Japan; [Naito, Hisahiro] Univ Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan",University of Tokyo; Tokyo Institute of Technology; University of Tsukuba,"Kawaguchi, D (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.",,"Matsushita, Yukitoshi/B-8862-2015","Kawaguchi, Daiji/0000-0002-0595-9443","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K03501, 16H03630, 16K13369, 15H03334] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,13,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1352-4739,1468-5876,,JPN ECON REV,Jpn.

However, to incorporate them into economic models is not always straightforward. Moreover, relying only on R&D data does not capture well innovation in the services sector. To counter these problems, this paper builds an augmented macro-theoretical growth model where, besides R&D, non-R&D innovation activities play a key role as main drivers of TFP. The model is estimated for a sample of EU-26 countries over the period 2004-2008, showing that the distinction between R&D and non -R&D innovation activities is significant for a number of different issues. First, we find both R&D and non -R&D to be statistically significant and economic important in technological catch-up. Second, there is a differential sizable impact of R&D and non -R & D; the impact of R&D on TFP growth is found to be twice as big as that of non -R&D. And third, the two types of innovation cannot strictly been seen as complementary, at least for the case of countries with high R&D intensities or high non -R&D intensities. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We apply Ordered Logit and Probit models, and we propose the Bayesian Network (BN) framework to explore the causal effects of survivor benefits using observational data. The results show that the widowed mothers who receive the benefits are more likely to report higher levels of health status by 0.11 units on a scale between 1-5.

An optimal policy rule with the ratio of weight on output gap to in ation gap higher than in the standard Taylor rule and a exible in ation targeting framework turns out to be welfare maximising for India. Lower interest rate smoothing or quicker monetary policy responses than estimated from the past data may be warranted to increase society's welfare. While a policy rate in the range of 6.25-6.70 appears to be best suited under the macroeconomic situation prevailing during 2015-16, rates lower than 6.25% would lie outside the policy efficiency frontier.

Very few studies estimate recreational use value of beaches particularly for those living close (less than 10 km) to the beach (locals). They typically have dissimilar visit patterns and low or zero travel costs because of their proximity to the recreation site. This study uses the latent class framework to extend the standard count data models to estimates the economic value of beaches for locals in the Capricorn Coast region of the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland. Results indicate that values for beach use among the locals differ depending on their visit patterns.

The results for the entire period provide no evidence of an asymmetric return-volatility relation in the Bitcoin market. The authors test if there is a difference in the return-volatility relation before and after the price crash of 2013 and show a significant inverse relation between past shocks and volatility before the crash and no significant relation after. This finding shows that, prior to the price crash of December 2013, positive shocks increased the conditional volatility more than negative shocks. This inverted asymmetric reaction of Bitcoin to positive and negative shocks is contrary to what one observes in equities. As leverage effect and volatility feedback do not adequately explain this reaction, the authors propose the safe-haven effect (Baur, Asymmetric volatility in the gold market, 2012). They highlight the benefits of adding Bitcoin to a US equity portfolio, especially in the pre-crash period. Robustness analyses show, among others, a negative relation between the US implied volatility index (VIX) and Bitcoin volatility. Those additional analyses further support the findings and provide useful information for economic actors who are interested in adding Bitcoin to their equity portfolios or are curious about the capabilities of Bitcoin as a financial asset.","[Bouri, Elie; Azzi, Georges] Holy Spirit Univ Kaslik, Jounieh, Lebanon; [Dyhrberg, Anne Haubo] Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",University College Dublin,"Bouri, E (通讯作者)，Holy Spirit Univ Kaslik, Jounieh, Lebanon.",eliebouri@usek.edu.lb,"Bouri, Elie/ABC-4197-2020; Bouri, Elie/N-1368-2015","Bouri, Elie/0000-0003-2628-5027; Bouri, Elie/0000-0003-2628-5027",,,,,24,155,159,1,63,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,FEB 16,2017,11.0,,,,,,,,20172,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2017-2,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EL1NO,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000394387300001,0

Theory suggests that the determinants of growth at low and high income levels may be different. If countries struggle to transition from growth strategies that are effective at low income levels to growth strategies that are effective at high income levels, they may stagnate at some middle-income level; this phenomenon can be thought of as a middle-income trap.' Defining income levels based on per capita gross domestic product relative to the United States, we do not find evidence for (unusual) stagnation at any particular middle-income level. However, we do find evidence that the determinants of growth at low and high income levels differ.

We then systematkally vary the monthly price volatility of each plan across choice scenarios. Our results suggest that price volatility in monthly rates significantly impacts respondents' plan choices and, specifically, their decision to adopt the green power plan. In particular, increased volatility in the green power plan reduces the likelihood of respondents choosing the green plan, while increased volatility in the conventional plan increases the likelihood of respondents choosing the green plan. Moreover, the documented effects of price volatility are robust across different price premiums for the green power plan. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We start with a basic model in which a firm with a production technology can license its new technology to a potential rival who can use the technology to produce a differentiated product and compete with the incumbent firm. It is found that for any given technology level, Bertrand competition is necessarily more profitable but less socially desirable, due to its higher royalty rate. By contrast, if the licensee firm is an incumbent firm, the results hold if the technology level is high. Furthermore, if we assume the licensor firm can engage in product innovation and choose its optimal technology endogenously and the R&D efficiency is high (low), the welfare ranking is reversed (still holds).","[Chang, Ray-Yun] Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Hwang, Hong] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Hwang, Hong] Acad Sinica, RCHSS, Taipei, Taiwan; [Peng, Cheng-Hau] Fu Jen Catholic Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan",Chinese Culture University; National Taiwan University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan; Fu Jen Catholic University,"Peng, CH (通讯作者)，Fu Jen Catholic Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan.",chpon@mail.fju.edu.tw,,"Peng, Cheng-Hau/0000-0002-7522-7002; Hwang, Hong/0000-0001-5103-8947",,,,,28,2,2,1,16,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

By aligning the global interest of the planner and the local interests of the doers by applying suitable penalty functions, a degree of internal harmony (measured quantitatively by the expected cost of self-coordination) can be achieved by the self-coordination policy. We establish an axiom system for modified preferences, under which the self-coordination policy can be obtained by solving a corresponding optimization problem.

The base script, used for both treatment and control, included a standard qualitative story about an individual beneficiary. Adding scientific impact information has no effect on average likelihood of giving or average gift amount. However, we find important heterogeneity: large prior donors both are more likely to give and also give more, whereas small prior donors are less likely to give. This pattern is consistent with two different types of donors: warm glow donors who respond negatively to analytical effectiveness information, and altruism donors who respond positively to such information.

We compute the number of employees of foreign establishments in each of Vietnam's provinces for each year, and use that as a measure of local FDI. We estimate the effects of FDI on local households' living standards as reported in the data, broken down by educational background to allow us to analyze effects on inequality. Estimates based on the repeated cross section indicate that rising FDI in a province is associated with a slight decline in living standards for households there if they do not have a member employed by the foreign enterprises, with only modest gains for households who do have a member employed by the foreign enterprises. These estimates may reflect composition effects, however, since we find large movements of people toward the provinces receiving the FDI. The findings show that measuring the effect of FDI on household welfare is more difficult than measuring the effect of trade policy, and may pose a difficulty for the view of FDI as a general anti-poverty strategy.

In each country, the delegate (the government) is elected by means of majority voting. Thereafter, delegates of each country choose their environmental policy, which becomes a public input to the global common good. In equilibrium, the median voter deliberately elects a delegate whose preferences differ from his/her own, to pursue advantages in international decision making. In this paper we use the social composition function to capture various cases of environmental problems with complementarity (imperfect substitutability). Our analysis shows the following results: with sufficient complementarity of the public inputs, strategic delegation can lead to the delegation of decisions to a greener politician. However, with almost perfect substitutability of public inputs, the only equilibria may involve asymmetric provision of public inputs to the global common good, even if the countries are identical.","[Nishimura, Yukihiro] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7 Machikaneyama Cho, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan; [Terai, Kimiko] Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Minato Ku, 2-15-45 Mita, Tokyo 1088345, Japan",Osaka University; Keio University,"Nishimura, Y (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7 Machikaneyama Cho, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan.",ynishimu@econ.osaka-u.ac.jp; kterai@econ.keio.ac.jp,,"Terai, Kimiko/0000-0002-3309-175X","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology [24530348, 15K03511, 23530382]; Strategic Young Researcher Overseas Visits Program for Accelerating Brain Circulation from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [J2402]; Research Grant from Zengin Foundation for Studies on Economics and Finance; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26285059, 24530348, 23530382, 15H01952, 17K03772, 26380370, 15K03511, 26285065] Funding Source: KAKEN; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [J2402] Funding Source: Austrian Science Fund (FWF)","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Strategic Young Researcher Overseas Visits Program for Accelerating Brain Circulation from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Research Grant from Zengin Foundation for Studies on Economics and Finance; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF))","The authors wish to thank the Editor-in-Chief (Andreas Haufler) and an anonymous referee for their useful comments.

Non-parametric frontier approach has been widely used by researchers for such a purpose. This paper proposes an extended non-parametric frontier approach to studying economy-wide energy efficiency and productivity performances by accounting for sectoral heterogeneity. Relevant techniques in index number theory are incorporated to quantify the driving forces behind changes in the economy-wide energy productivity index. The proposed approach facilitates flexible modelling of different sectors' production processes, and helps to examine sectors' impact on the aggregate energy performance. A case study of China's economy-wide energy efficiency and productivity performances in its 11th five-year plan period (2006-2010) is presented. It is found that sectoral heterogeneities in terms of energy performance are significant in China. Meanwhile, China's economy-wide energy productivity increased slightly during the study period, mainly driven by the technical efficiency improvement. A number of other findings have also been reported. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Wang, H.; Ang, B.

In the first experiment, framing a one-time donation opportunity as an opt-out as opposed to opt-in decision significantly increases donations to an environmental non-profit. In the second experiment, an automatic donation mechanism is provided that allows subjects to self-select into an opt-out framing; when combined with incentive-neutral, social-norm supporting activities (cheap talk and voting), automatic donations sustain increased contributions over a ten-month study period to an HIV/AIDS-related charity. In the third experiment, we study the extent to which the mention of HIV/AIDS in the charity's informational material impacts the emotions and donations of potential donors. In this case the connection to HIV/AIDS does not elicit stigma, but we do find that changes in mood from exposure to the charity's informational material predict increased donations, and that donors experience an improved mood from donating.

Specifically, we consider a model where a monopolist sells a base product with an add-on valuable only if it is consumed along with the base product. An important feature of this model is that this additional value is contingent on the valuation of the base product. We show that separation, in which case only the base product is sold, yields a higher profit than integration, where only a bundled package is sold, if and only if the range of the add-on value exceeds a threshold value and that separation is more likely to become optimal as the degree of positive contingency increases. As for welfare, consumer surplus in case of separation is always lower than that when the seller is constrained to sell the bundled package.","[Adachi, Takanori; Hanazono, Makoto] Nagoya Univ, Sch Econ, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan; [Ebina, Takeshi] Shinshu Univ, Fac Econ, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan",Nagoya University; Shinshu University,"Adachi, T (通讯作者)，Nagoya Univ, Sch Econ, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.",,"Adachi, Takanori/I-6487-2014; Ebina, Takeshi/E-2239-2014","Adachi, Takanori/0000-0001-5046-7993; Ebina, Takeshi/0000-0002-1902-4788","Japan Economic Research Foundation; Japanese Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, and Culture [23243049, 24730205, 15K17047, 24530264, 25245031]; Inamori Foundation; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K17047, 24730205, 25245031, 15K13005, 24530264, 15H03346, 15K03363, 23243049] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Economic Research Foundation; Japanese Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, and Culture(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Inamori Foundation; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","An earlier version of this paper was entitled 'Option Package Bundling'.

Similarly, the degree of exposure to commodity price fluctuations does not seem to significantly affect the housing market cycle. However, we find that housing booms are shorter when oil prices increase than housing busts when oil prices decrease.

We investigate the reasons for this apparent puzzle by studying the time-varying nature of the relationship between real effective exchange rates of five oil exporters and the real price of oil in the aftermath of the oil price shocks of the last two decades. Accordingly, we rely on a time-varying parameter VAR specification, which allows the responses of real exchange rates to different oil price shocks to evolve over time. We find that the reason of the mixed results obtained in the empirical literature is that oil currencies follow different hybrid models in the sense that oil countries' real exchange rates may be driven by one or several sources of oil price shocks that furthermore can vary over time. In addition to structural changes affecting oil countries, structural changes arising from the oil market itself through the various, time-varying sources of oil price shocks are found to be crucial.","[Allegret, Jean-Pierre; Couharde, Cecile; Mignon, Valerie; Razafindrabe, Tovonony] Univ Paris Ouest, EconomiX CNRS, Nanterre, France; [Mignon, Valerie] CEPII, Paris, France",Universite Paris Saclay,"Mignon, V (通讯作者)，EconomiX CNRS, 200 Ave Republ, F-92001 Nanterre, France.",valerie.mignon@u-paris10.fr,,,"French Energy Council (Conseil Francais de l'Energie), Paris, France [CFE76]","French Energy Council (Conseil Francais de l'Energie), Paris, France","This work was supported by the French Energy Council (Conseil Francais de l'Energie), Paris, France [CFE76].",,55,2,2,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The present paper focuses on measuring financial cycle length for a series of developed as well as emerging economies by applying Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) techniques, which have the ability to decompose time series on a wide range of frequencies and identify statistically significant cyclical behavior. Using credit-to-GDP data collected by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) for 13 countries, our results confirm the established hypothesis that financial cycles are significantly longer than business cycles, in the, case of developed economies, underpinning the European framework for setting the countercyclical buffer rates. Using Wavelet Coherence measures, we find statistically significant co-movement in time-frequency between several EU members, as well as tighter relationships between euro area members. The main conclusion is that policymakers from emerging economies should monitor financial cycle dynamics more closely, using the additional assumption of shorter cycles, in order to identify the build-up of systemic risk through excessive credit growth in a timely manner.","[Altar, Moisa] Romanian Amer Univ, Bucharest, Romania; [Kubinschi, Matei; Barnea, Dinu] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Altar, M (通讯作者)，Romanian Amer Univ, Bucharest, Romania.",altarm@gmail.com; matei.kubinschi@bnro.ro; dinu.barnea@bnro.ro,"Kubinschi, Matei/IAO-1252-2023","Kubinschi, Matei/0000-0002-3938-1168","Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research, CNCS - UEFISCDI [PN-II-RU-TE-2014-2499]","Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research, CNCS - UEFISCDI","This work was supported by a grant of the Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research, CNCS - UEFISCDI, project number PN-II-RU-TE-2014-2499, entitled Coordinating Monetary and Macroprudential Policies.",,17,12,12,0,9,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

It starts by extending the U.S. evidence of Malmendier and Nagel (2011) to euro area households, and shows that experienced stock market returns matter in a statistically significant and economically substantial fashion: better experiences make households more willing to take financial risk and increase their stock market participation, even if euro area households seem to be discounting the past more quickly than those in the United States. Subsequently, the paper moves on to show that there are additional effects stemming from the experience of stock market crashes which are different from those of stack market booms. Crashes stay in household's memory and lower stock market participation, whereas booms raise participation, but their effect eventually fades out. Furthermore, households in countries that witnessed a particularly severe 2008 stock market crash give substantially more weight to the most recent experience, suggesting that in these Countries an even more pronounced under investment in the stock market should be expected in the years to come.","[Ampudia, Miguel; Ehrmann, Michael] European Cent Bank, D-60640 Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Ampudia, M (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, D-60640 Frankfurt, Germany.",miguel.ampudia@ecb.europa.eu; michael.ehrmann@ecb.europa.eu,,,,,,,31,21,25,0,11,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0014-2921,1873-572X,,EUR ECON REV,Eur.

Among different production inputs, land has the highest production elasticity. Land fragmentation and land slope are positively associated with inefficiency, whereas extension service, rented in land and credit have negative associations.

Once established, firms compete for market shares, selling to consumers with heterogeneous tastes for quality. The equilibrium of the pricing game exists and is unique within our setup. Exogenous productivity growth induces firms to enter the market sequentially at the top end of the quality spectrum. A central feature of the model is that optimization problems of consecutive entrants are self-similar so that new firms enter in constant time-intervals and choose qualities that are a constant fraction higher than incumbent qualities. The asymmetries of quality choice, which inevitably arise because the quality spectrum has top and a bottom, are thus overcome by sequential entry. Our main contribution lies in handling these asymmetries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Using the traditional surplus accounting method, the Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth rates are divided into their price change components in order to determine the stakeholders who do or do not receive price advantages. An initial analysis showed that TFP of US industries increased at an average trend of 0.8% and established that remunerations to employees and firms' profitability constituted 49% and 39%, respectively, of the accumulated economic surplus from the productivity gains. Suppliers of intermediate inputs retained 12.1% of the surplus. Finally, customers, equipment and structure providers were the losers in the distribution of economic surplus via, respectively, a significant growth of relative final demand prices and a substantial price decrease of these assets. A second step analysis underlined that industries with high TFP growth rates mainly benefited customers and firms via output price decreases and profitability improvements while industries with low or negative TFP changes hurt customers through significant output price increases. The sectoral level analysis also showed that employees' remunerations depend only slightly on productivity gains produced within their industrial sectors.","[Boussemart, Jean-Philippe] Univ Lille, IESEG Sch Management, CNRS, UMR LEM 9221, 3 Rue Digue, F-59000 Lille, France; [Leleu, Herve] Univ Lille, IESEG Sch Management, CNRS, UMR LEM 9221, Lille, France; [Mensah, Edward] Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL USA; [Mensah, Edward] IESEG Sch Management, Chicago, IL USA",Universite de Lille; IESEG School of Management; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); IESEG School of Management; Universite de Lille; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Boussemart, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Lille, IESEG Sch Management, CNRS, UMR LEM 9221, 3 Rue Digue, F-59000 Lille, France.",jp.boussemart@ieseg.fr,"Mensah, Edward/L-3706-2019; Boussemart, Jean-Philippe/X-3545-2019; Leleu, Hervé/B-5729-2013","Boussemart, Jean-Philippe/0000-0001-7932-6940; Leleu, Hervé/0000-0003-4027-5175",,,,,21,4,4,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We used the propensity-score matching method to analyse data from a survey carried out in 2011, and found that the improvement project cut the cost of water neighbourhood-wide by 94 CFA francs per cubic meter, reduced the portion of this expense by 1% of the average household budget, and cut the daily time to collect water by 10-13 min. The results that we obtained through the propensity-score matching method differ from those obtained by simply comparing the averages of the neighbourhoods participating in the project to those that did not participate.

He hypothesizes and shows that the clustering of payment dates at the end of the month results in a stock return regularity that is related to increased liquidity and monetary policy. This article introduces investor behaviour into Ogden's TOM liquidity hypothesis where higher TOM returns depend not only on the availability of increased liquidity but also on investors' willingness to invest new funds. The empirical evidence is consistent with the argument. When confidence is high, investors' willingness to invest the increased liquidity results in a TOM regularity. But when confidence is low, a TOM regularity is absent as investors park the increased liquidity. This additional measure of investor confidence provides a more complete explanation of Ogden's liquidity hypothesis.","[Burnett, John E.] Univ Alabama, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Huntsville, AL 35899 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Huntsville,"Burnett, JE (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Huntsville, AL 35899 USA.",burnettj@uah.edu,,,,,,,16,4,4,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Polanyi's theoretical and methodological achievements suggest a wide comparative outlook and offer a critique of economics, in addition to being deeply connected with his political philosophy. Polanyi's approach seems to be nearer to the original institutional thought - from Karl Marx to Thorstein Veblen, from Max Weber to Adolf Lowe and Karl William Kapp - than to current neo-institutional tendencies in economics, sociology, and historiography. The hard problems society presently faces suggest the need to adhere to Polanyi's radical point of view - that is, to a radical approach to Polanyi's thought.","[Cangiani, Michele] Univ Ca Foscari Venezia, Econ Sociol, Venice, Italy",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Cangiani, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ca Foscari Venezia, Econ Sociol, Venice, Italy.",,,,,,,,72,5,5,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

A fixed-effects estimator is employed over a panel of 15 European Union countries during the period 1990-2012. The results show that spending on public services increases during fiscal consolidations, while spending on defence, public order, health, education and social protection is significantly cut. A more disaggregated analysis proves that fiscal consolidations are harmful for important social expenditures, in particular, for those related to citizens' safety, health assistance, social protection and investment in human capital. This evidence is even stronger in a particular group of countries, known in the literature as PIIGS. Hence, fiscal consolidations can have important implications on the living standards of the more economically vulnerable citizens.","[Castro, Vitor] Univ Coimbra, Fac Econ, Av Dias da Silva 165, P-3004512 Coimbra, Portugal; [Castro, Vitor] Econ Policies Res Unit NIPE, Braga, Portugal",Universidade de Coimbra,"Castro, V (通讯作者)，Univ Coimbra, Fac Econ, Av Dias da Silva 165, P-3004512 Coimbra, Portugal.",vcastro@fe.uc.pt,"Castro, Vitor/D-3812-2018",,Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [SFRH/BSAB/113588/2015]; COMPETE; QREN; FEDER; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BSAB/113588/2015] Funding Source: FCT,Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); COMPETE; QREN; FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"The author acknowledges the helpful comments and suggestions from the editor and two anonymous referees.

Accounting for the shifts in trend for the forward premium reveals that currency excess returns for the Canadian dollar, Swiss franc, euro and pound against the US dollar are significantly predictable irrespective of the sample period selected. Another advantage of detrending the forward premium is that we can obtain more consistent slope coefficient estimates in the predictive regression, which enables us to make more consistent, dependable inferences about the excess return predictability.","[Cho, Dooyeon] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Chun, Sungju] Gachon Univ, Dept Business Adm, Gyeonggi Do 13120, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Gachon University,"Chun, S (通讯作者)，Gachon Univ, Dept Business Adm, Gyeonggi Do 13120, South Korea.",sjchun@gachon.ac.kr,"; Chun, Sungju/E-7030-2016","Cho, Dooyeon/0000-0003-2588-9347; Chun, Sungju/0000-0001-6882-9155",,,,,26,3,3,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Agricultural producers face a variety of significant risks; historically, only government-subsidized products have achieved widespread adoption. A recent contractual innovation, which links insurance payouts to realized weather rather than farmer indemnity, has spurred substantial research in the past decade. This review begins by describing the experience in developed economies and then turns to developing countries, covering the following topics: farmers' adoption of AI, how AI affects their decision to invest in risky assets, and the extent to which AI helps farmers smooth income and consumption. We conclude with suggestions for future research and practice related to AI in developing countries.","[Cole, Shawn A.] Harvard Sch Business, Finance Unit, Boston, MA 02163 USA; [Xiong, Wentao] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; Harvard University,"Cole, SA (通讯作者)，Harvard Sch Business, Finance Unit, Boston, MA 02163 USA.",scole@hbs.edu; wxiong@fas.harvard.edu,,,,,,,105,45,52,13,106,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4609-6,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

However, cities around the world show different levels of intermingle, and it is very uncommon to observe fully segregated urban patterns even when segregation is high. We argue that individuals do not take into account only their neighbours characteristics for making a location decision. In particular, if residential segregation generates ghettos of low-skilled labourers, the societal level of production would diminish and, consequently, individuals' level of consumption too, affecting all society members' well-being. When agents care about the impact of segregation on their own consumptions, we prove that the set of system's equilibria can be one containing states of residential integration. Besides, using simulations, we compare the aggregated utility related to these equilibria with the maximum level of aggregated utility.","[Conejeros, Raul] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Escuela Ingn Bioquim, Valparaiso, Chile; [Vargas, Miguel] Univ Diego Port, Dept Econ, Ave Santa Clara 797, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso; University Diego Portales,"Vargas, M (通讯作者)，Univ Diego Port, Dept Econ, Ave Santa Clara 797, Santiago, Chile.",miguel.vargas@udp.cl,"Conejeros, Raul/ABG-5517-2020; Conejeros, Raul/A-2466-2011; Vargas Roman, Miguel/Q-2091-2015","Conejeros, Raul/0000-0002-1273-535X;",,,,,30,0,0,0,5,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Using facility-level criteria air emission data in the US manufacturing industry, we find the industry-specific effects of export status on emission intensity, measured by emissions per value of sale. In some industries, there is consistent and robust evidence supporting the superior environmental performance of exporters relative to non-exporters in terms of emission intensity for all criteria air pollutants tracked. In other industries, we find weak evidence that exporters appear to have a higher emission intensity than non-exporters. This industrial heterogeneity in the effects of exporting on the environment is closely related to industrial characteristics including pollution abatement capital expenditure, trade costs, capital intensity and others.","[Cui, Jingbo] Wuhan Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Qian, Hang] Mathworks Inc, Boston, MA USA",Wuhan University; MathWorks,"Cui, JB (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",jbcui@whu.edu.cn,,"Qian, Hang/0000-0001-6185-3275",National Natural Science Fund of China [71603191],National Natural Science Fund of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),National Natural Science Fund of China [grant number 71603191].,,36,10,12,2,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

To redress this oversight, we investigate this relationship using intraday data from the oil and gas markets - the most liquid energy markets in the world. In this way, the current article extends the previous studies through the use of a frequency approach to propose an original analysis of the relationship between volume and volatility. More specifically, we employ a continuous wavelet transform to identify the lead-lag phase between volatility and volume. This framework supplants usual time series modelling, as it uses a measure of coherence for different frequencies and time-scales to capture further changes and time variation in the volume-volatility relationship. Our results provide supportive evidence for the well-known positive relationship between realized volatility and TV, thereby supporting the mixture distribution hypothesis. In particular, our results show that volume causes volatility only during turbulent times', while volatility causes volume during good times'. Furthermore, there is no relationship between volume and volatility in the long term, due to the absence of noise traders and liquidity traders in the long run. These findings are helpful for investors and policymakers as they contribute to better forecast the TV and price volatility during turbulent and calm periods and over several investment horizons.","[Ftiti, Zied] EDC Paris Business Sch, OCRE Lab, Paris, France; [Jawadi, Fredj] Univ Evry, Dept Finance, Evry, France; [Louhichi, Wael] ESSCA Sch Management, Dept Finance, Angers, France",Universite Paris Saclay; ESSCA School of Management,"Jawadi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Evry, 2 Rue Facteur Cheval, F-91000 Evry, France.",fredj.jawadi@univ-evry.fr,"Ftiti, Zied/J-6533-2019","Ftiti, Zied/0000-0002-6216-1104; JAWADI, Fredj/0000-0003-3655-8391",,,,,50,13,14,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Studies using such type of data are of significant relevance because the concentration in large cities of regions can be reinforced by trade. The results of our panel model show that the effect of trade on the spatial concentration of population depends upon the characteristics of regions. On the one hand, trade enhances the spatial agglomeration within regions with large home market and location advantages. On the other hand, trade induces dispersion within regions that lack access to international trade or historical disadvantage. These results hold when controlling for the natural course of agglomeration, congestion effects in cities, road infrastructure and historical factors.","[Guevara-Rosero, Grace Carolina] Escuela Politec Nacl, Fac Ciencias, Dept Matemat, Quito, Ecuador; [Guevara-Rosero, Grace Carolina] Univ Lyon, Villeurbanne, France",Escuela Politecnica Nacional Ecuador,"Guevara-Rosero, GC (通讯作者)，Escuela Politec Nacl, Fac Ciencias, Dept Matemat, Quito, Ecuador.;Guevara-Rosero, GC (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon, Villeurbanne, France.",carolina.guevara@epn.edu.ec,"Guevara, Carolina/HSF-6444-2023; Guevara Rosero, Grace Carolina/HPH-2113-2023","Guevara, Carolina/0000-0001-7605-1443; Guevara Rosero, Grace Carolina/0000-0001-7605-1443",,,,,44,2,2,0,8,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

Using linked employer-employee data for Brazil, we show that much of overall wage inequality arises within sector-occupations and for workers with similar observable characteristics; this within component is driven by wage dispersion between firms; and wage dispersion between firms is related to firm employment size and trade participation. We then extend the heterogenous-firm model of trade and inequality from Helpman et al. (2010) and estimate it with Brazilian data. We show that the estimated model provides a close approximation to the observed distribution of wages and employment.

Using a comprehensive database of 40 countries: the OECD country-members plus Argentina, China, Romania, Russian Federation, Singapore and South Africa, from 1998 to 2012, we find that PR&D has a positive effect on VC Investment. PR&D can affect some factors that could increase or reduce the expected rate of return for VC investments, but our outcomes indicate a net effect positive and PR&D does seem to generate value through fostering VC activity in the economy. This is especially true in countries with higher institutional quality and higher level of articles published by the scientific community. This could indicate two things: first, that PR&D is more efficient and strategically addressed in countries with high institutional quality; and second, it confirms that scientific production works in partnership with PR&D in generating VC opportunities. PR&D is more important for the generation of VC investments in countries with lower infrastructure; in these countries, the government decision for increasing PR&D takes more relevance in fostering active VC markets. The above conclusions are confirmed for early stage (ES), high technology (HT) and manufacturing sector (MS) venture capital investments, indicating that PR&D is specifically important for these three kinds of VC investments, however infrastructure availability remains definitive to increase MS venture capital investments. The results are based on a panel study controlling endogeneity with a generalized method of moments (GMM) dynamic panel estimator model with a collapsed instrument matrix and two lags.","[Herrera-Echeverri, Hernan] EAFIT Univ, Carrera 49 7 Sur 50, Medellin, Colombia",Universidad EAFIT,"Herrera-Echeverri, H (通讯作者)，EAFIT Univ, Carrera 49 7 Sur 50, Medellin, Colombia.",hherrer2@eafit.edu.co,,,,,,,59,9,10,2,12,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Decomposing inequality into factors categorized by degree of personal responsibility, education explains over twice as much of inequality today as 45 years ago. However, neither hours worked nor education, industry, marital status, or geographical location can explain the rise in income inequality. In fact, 'unfair' inequality (income disparity derived from non-responsibility factors) has risen faster than 'fair' inequality (income disparity derived from responsibility factors), regardless of the set of variables chosen as fair sources of inequality. We further examine income inequalities within gender and racial groups, finding substantial heterogeneity.

With the progress of trade liberalization, there has been a shift of focus to NTMs as alternative or potential trade barriers. Design/methodology/approach - In order to quantify an NTM on tea trade and implement its empirical application, this study designed an index of differences in maximum residue levels (MRLs) for the pesticide endosulfan and introduced it into a gravity trade model. The estimation challenges in the presence of heteroscedasticity and many zero-trade flows are resolved by taking the Heckman and Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood estimators. Findings - This study found that differences in MRLs, arising from the stricter standards in importing countries lead to a significant decrease in tea trade value. This negative impact of differences in MRLs is found to be slightly less than that of tariffs, implying that in this case, the NTM acts as a policy substitute for import tariffs in the global tea trade. Originality/value - The main contribution of this study is to suggest and quantify the differences in MRLs across countries as a substantial NTM on the global tea trade and provide its empirical application.","[Hwang, Chae Won] Samsung Econ Res Inst, Seoul, South Korea; [Lim, Song Soo] Korea Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Samsung; Korea University,"Lim, SS (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",songsoo@korea.ac.kr,"Lim, Song Soo/Q-1560-2015; Lim, Song Soo/AAQ-7712-2020","Lim, Song Soo/0000-0002-2894-1879",,,,,51,5,5,6,67,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

In the text, peacekeeping deployments and their impact on the economy were analyzed in Congo, Georgia and Iraq during 1989-2015. Macroeconomic indicators, such as GDP, inflation, unemployment rate and balance of payments, were taken into account, first before the effect of peacekeeping deployments, then during peacekeeping deployments and after the peacekeeping deployment. Statistical data show both, positive and negative impact on the hostile country' economy. To sum it up, peacekeeping deployments can contribute to creating suitable conditions for national economic policy implementation.","[Hynkova, Vendula; Krc, Miroslav; Vodakova, Jana; Boulaouad, Jana] Univ Def, Kounicova 65, Brno 66210, Czech Republic",University of Defence - Czech Republic,"Hynková, V (通讯作者)，Univ Def, Kounicova 65, Brno 66210, Czech Republic.",vendula.hynkova@unob.cz; miroslav.krc@unob.cz; jana.vodakova@unob.cz; jana.boulaouad@unob.cz,"Krč, Miroslav/AAZ-1851-2021; Vodáková, Jana/AAB-4325-2021","Vodáková, Jana/0000-0003-2923-6132",,,,,9,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,538,547,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455325300053,0

The goods are not only commodities, and they can influence utility through retention as an alternative to consumption. Perfect foresight is relinquished in a rolling horizon approach to markets which lets agents pursue long-term interests without being sure of future prices. The framework is that of an economy operating in a fiat currency that agents find attractive to retain, in balance with other needs. The attractiveness comes from Keynesian considerations about uncertainty which until now have not been brought in. The existence of equilibrium is established directly-not just generically-and moreover under weaker assumptions on endowments than before, except that utility functions are taken to be concave. Agents do not need to start out with, or end up with, positive amounts of everything. With a single currency denominating the units of account in all states, price indeterminacy is avoided and all contracts issued in the financial markets can be interpreted as real contracts. Derivative instruments and collateralized contracts based on money prices are thereby encompassed for the first time. Transaction costs on sales of contracts, generated endogenously, lead to bid-ask spreads and in particular to a gap between interest rates for lending and borrowing money.","[Jofre, A.] Univ Chile, Ctr Math Modelling, Casilla 170-3,Correo 3, Santiago, Chile; [Jofre, A.] Univ Chile, Dept Engn Math, Casilla 170-3,Correo 3, Santiago, Chile; [Rockafellar, R.

Counterfactual exercises show that the analyzed channel accounts for about 23% of a decrease in lending following a monetary policy impulse. This is another piece of evidence showing that the financial accelerator works in both the nonfinancial and the financial sector.

However, it has numerous common aspects with the neoclassical tradition, for example the economy selfregulation with full deployment of production sources, the Say's law of markets, separated real and monetary sector of economy, etc. These aspects of neoclassical tradition are subject of J.M. Keynes's criticism. Schools of thought are formed even against the teleological theory (institutionalism and others). The doctrine of J.M. Keynes was the most significant among them. Its most important representative was Josef Macek. Professor Macek was successful in connection of what seemed to be impossible in economic thought. The connection of Say's law of markets with the Keynes's doctrine of purchasing power effective demand. Macek's specific usage of Keynes's doctrine on the one hand and accuracy of overcoming of disputes and problems of Braf's doctrine and approach to economic science in teleological noetics and teleological theory of Karel Englis on the other hand resulted among others to the fact that the teleological theory as a theoretical basis broke through at the majority of universities and other institutions (the National Bank, financial administsration and others).","[Krames, Jaroslav] Univ Econ, Fac Bussiness Adm, Dept Microecon, Prague Winston Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Krames, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Bussiness Adm, Dept Microecon, Prague Winston Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",Krames@vse.cz,,,Faculty of Business Administration Competitiveness [VSE IP 300040],Faculty of Business Administration Competitiveness,This article is provided as one of the outputs of the research project of the Faculty of Business Administration Competitiveness (VSE IP 300040).,,11,0,0,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,771,780,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455325300077,0

The top pairs are transferred to an out-of-sample trading period, and traded with individualized exit thresholds. In particular, we differentiate between pairs exhibiting mean-reversion and momentum effects and apply idiosyncratic take-profit and stoploss rules. For the top 5 mean-reversion pairs, we find out-of-sample returns of 7.98% per year; the top 5 momentum pairs yield 7.22% per year.

The experience in company crisis solving shows that for SMEs the qualitative indicators like quality of management, personnel, finance management, competitive position and others might have much more severe effect on company's ability to perform and to avoid crisis. Therefore, the crisis identification and intervention solutions in case of SMEs require to take into account more specific factors, which would stress the qualitative characteristics of the business and company. Focusing solely on the quantitative criteria for SMEs will not allow correct identification of company's situation and could lead to a misinterpretation of possible crisis signals. To improve the crisis management for SMEs, in this paper the crisis management by intervention model is presented which define the concept of intervention in SMEs management in case of crisis. The core of the presented model is the set of hard ( quantitative) and soft ( qualitative) criteria which are relevant for the crisis identification in SMEs and sector, and the multidimensional assessment method, which enables the assessment of the importance of all criteria and selection of relevant criteria in every specific case. In such a way, the identification and management of SMEs crisis can be focused on the root causes of the crisis, including managerial experience and organisation issues of the company, which can be identified by a specific set of quantitative or qualitative criteria. Although the model is based on the research in German SMEs sector, but it can also be adopted in other countries, taking into account the specificities related to business management in each country.","[Kurschus, Ralph-Jorn] Kurschus Lawyers & Managers Bankruptcies, Ziegelbergstr 35, DE-17033 Neubrandenburg, Germany; [Sarapovas, Tadas] ISM Univ Management & Econ, Ausros Vartu St 7A, LT-01304 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Pilinkiene, Vaida] Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",ISM University of Management & Economics; Kaunas University of Technology,"Kurschus, RJ (通讯作者)，Kurschus Lawyers & Managers Bankruptcies, Ziegelbergstr 35, DE-17033 Neubrandenburg, Germany.",ralph-joern-kurschus@zikura.de; tadsar@ism.lt; vaida.pilinkiene@ktu.lt,,,,,,,28,5,9,2,26,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

All forms of employment deviating from it, may be regarded as non-standard. Nonstandard employment is divided into partial, temporary, impermanent, incomplete, secondary employment, over employment, self-employment, contingent employment, remote employment, etc. Traditionally, non-standard employment is viewed as detrimental for the most vulnerable groups in the labor market. At the same time, it is proved that in periods of economic recession nonstandard employment can smooth the possible increase of unemployment, and in periods of economic growth is the source of labor for standard jobs. On the other hand, choosing the option of non-standard employment, the employee can better meet his needs in comparison with standard employment. In this connection it is interesting to analyze job satisfaction of non-standard workers.

The necessity of more inspections is conditioned by the fact that governmental authorities do not trust them and primarily consider them to be dishonest.","[Levickova, Vera; Mickova, Eva] Inst Hosp Management Prague, Prague, Czech Republic",,"Levicková, V (通讯作者)，Inst Hosp Management Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.",levickova@vsh.cz; mickova@vsh.cz,,,,,,,5,1,1,0,3,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-664-3,,,,2017,,,,,,,520,527,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI4CR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000411661000061,0

The empirical framework, following on ideas in the research of Zvi Griliches at the NBER and commonly labeled CDM (the acronym of the three authors' names, Crepon, Duguet and Mairesse) is one of the most influential contributions in recent literature on economics of innovation. The original CDM paper and papers inspired by its framework have received hundreds of citations in the empirical innovation literature. Whether directly linked or not to the CDM framework, the flow of studies improving on and enlarging the scope and methods of the empirical literature on R&D, innovation and productivity is continuing. Some of them, for example, focus on financing innovation, innovation and employment, innovation and trade, competition, or intellectual property; some adopt a managerial perspective, while others prefer an innovation system approach in a Schumpeterian tradition, etc. This introduction to the special issue of EINT surveys a collection of 12 papers on the CDM model by 25 authors from eight countries. The papers take stock of the evolution of research based on the original CDM model launched 20 years ago, linking it to the previous literature, and proposing developments and generalizations of it in various dimensions.","[Loof, Hans] Royal Inst Technol, CESIS, Stockholm, Sweden; [Mairesse, Jacques] CREST ENSAE, Paris, France; [Mairesse, Jacques; Mohnen, Pierre] Maastricht Univ, UNU MERIT, Maastricht, Netherlands",Royal Institute of Technology; Institut Polytechnique de Paris; Maastricht University,"Lööf, H (通讯作者)，Royal Inst Technol, CESIS, Stockholm, Sweden.",hans.loof@indek.kth.se,"Lööf, Hans/AAN-5394-2020; Lööf, Hans/C-2137-2017; Mohnen, Pierre/ACL-4047-2022","Lööf, Hans/0000-0002-5871-8571; Mohnen, Pierre/0000-0002-2289-7379",Swedish government agency VINNOVA,Swedish government agency VINNOVA(Vinnova),We thank the Swedish government agency VINNOVA for financial support.,,4,55,57,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

We focus on selected countries in Indo-Pacific Asia - an economically diverse but increasingly prosperous region with pockets of strategic competition and growing milex. We confirm the robustness of SIPRI's milex data by corroborating it with defence budget data published by Australia's Defence Intelligence Organisation (ADIO). We find no conclusive evidence of an arms race in the region. It is the growing economic prosperity that accounts for most of the growth in Indo-Pacific Asia's milex. But we also find wide variations in the economic burden imposed by milex at the national level and that milex' high level of aggregation masks important changes in national military capabilities. We argue that such capabilities can increase despite a constant or even declining milex burden and, hence, prejudice the peaceful resolution of international conflicts and, thus, undermine the fragile regional stability. We propose limited disaggregation of milex to highlight national spending on military force structure and preparedness so as to facilitate better understanding of military capability formation.","[Markowski, Stefan; Chand, Satish; Wylie, Robert] Univ New South Wales, Sch Business, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Markowski, Stefan] Univ Informat Technol & Management, Dept Management, Rzeszow, Poland",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Information Technology & Management Rzeszow,"Markowski, S (通讯作者)，Univ New South Wales, Sch Business, Canberra, ACT, Australia.;Markowski, S (通讯作者)，Univ Informat Technol & Management, Dept Management, Rzeszow, Poland.",s.markowski@adfa.edu.au,,,,,,,24,14,14,0,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

Existing evaluations of the LCL treat the introduction of the LCL as being exogenous. We show that labor market tightening and individuals' self-selection into jobs which comply with the Law have affected migrant labor market outcomes. Taking these factors separately into account suggests that, the LCL has had varying effects on labor market outcomes: a negative effect on wages and hours; an unclear effect on having a written contract, and a positive effect on social insurance participation.

In contrast with previous research, return reversals are more pronounced for past winners, suggesting that the market overreacts to a greater extent to good news. These contrarian returns are particularly elevated when portfolios are formed using quartiles and during tranquil and bull markets. The optimum contrarian strategy involves skipping the first 6months of the holding period and implementing the contrarian strategy for a period of 18months, as returns exhibit continuation followed by reversal. The profitability of the contrarian investment strategy is robust to adjustments for risk and seasonalities. It is the tranquil times and not the crisis/volatile times that generates a significant and profitable contrarian strategy. The recent credit crisis and resulting stock market falls, resulted in extreme movements in some Greek stocks and testing of the contrarian strategy problematic, especially when portfolios are decile ordered. Our findings also highlight the importance of survivorship bias and also suggest that contrarian strategies that just use market beta may be ill-equipped to take into consider extreme market movements, illiquidity and short-sales constraints.","[O' Keeffe, Cormac] Waterford Inst Technol, Sch Business, Waterford, Ireland; [Gallagher, Liam A.] Dublin City Univ, DCU Business Sch, Dublin 9, Ireland",South East Technological University (SETU); Dublin City University,"Gallagher, LA (通讯作者)，Dublin City Univ, DCU Business Sch, Dublin 9, Ireland.",liam.gallagher@dcu.ie,,"Gallagher, Liam/0000-0002-3513-8013; O'Keeffe, Cormac/0000-0002-9074-5924",,,,,28,1,2,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This effect is often justified by the authors as a consequence of contagion, but the evidence is that contagion can be confused with the integration effect since both have a tendency to increase correlations among markets, especially during down-market periods. The main goal of this paper is to examine the effect of increasing cross-market correlations during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis on the largest European stock markets (i.e. the U.K., France and Germany), in the context of the influence of the 2007 U.S. subprime crisis. The crisis periods are formally established based on the statistical method of dividing market states into bullish and bearish markets. The evaluation of contagion is carried out by applying both standard contemporaneous cross-market correlations and volatility-adjusted cross-correlations (Forbes, Rigobon 2002). The results are consistent with the literature and confirm that heteroskedasticity in market returns biases tests for contagion based on correlation. Moreover, an integration test is performed using the Larntz-Perlman (1985) procedure for testing the equality of correlation matrices computed over non-overlapping subsamples: the pre-crisis and crisis periods in the group of investigated markets. No reason was found to reject the research hypothesis of no integration effect during the recent global crisis. The study might be viewed as a contribution to the debate concerning the causes of increasing cross-market correlations during periods of turmoil.","[Olbrys, Joanna] Bialystok Tech Univ, Bialystok, Poland; [Majewska, Elzbieta] Univ Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology; University of Bialystok,"Olbrys, J (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Bialystok, Poland.",,"Majewska, Elzbieta/AAB-6039-2021; Olbrys, Joanna/P-8237-2018","Majewska, Elzbieta/0000-0002-2914-7941; Olbrys, Joanna/0000-0002-0928-0040",Bialystok University of Technology [S/WI/1/2014]; Ministry of Science and Higher Education,"Bialystok University of Technology; Ministry of Science and Higher Education(Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Poland)",The contribution of the first named author was supported by the grant S/WI/1/2014 from Bialystok University of Technology and funded from the resources for research by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education.,,34,3,4,2,11,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

There is explained the importance of education to the successful functioning of any individual on the labour market.

However, the existing theoretical literature focuses on the functional distribution of income and ignores the distribution of wages. This paper shows how the distribution of wages affects whether an economy is wage- or profit-led. Since the distribution of wages impacts personal income distribution, that explains why income inequality can also impact regime character. Increases in workers' wage share always increase growth and capacity utilization regardless of the economy's character. Furthermore, an increase in workers' wage share can flip an economy from being profit-led to wage-led.",,,,mail@thomaspalley.com,,,IMK,IMK,"Independent economist, Washington, DC.

To test these method authors conducted the evaluation of knowledge generation transaction efficacy at several Russian universities. The theoretical importance of this research is in formulating and testing university performance efficacy criteria allowing for the further formulation of methodological recommendations on improving academic activities at higher educational institutions. The practical importance of obtained results is that they can be used in analysis and design of institutional knowledge generation environment at the University.

We study the political consequences of such public income volatility. As is standard, in out model political incentives create inefficient policies to increase re-election probabilities, but we show that making public income uncertain creates specific new effects. Future volatility reduces the benefit of being in power, making policy more efficient. Yet at the same time it also reduces the re-election probability of an incumbent and since some of the policy inefficiencies are concentrated in the future, this makes inefficient policy, such as patronage public employment, less costly. Our model highlights a new political economy connection between the volatility of the public budget and economic growth. In the case where volatility comes from natural resource prices, a characteristic of many developing countries, we show that volatility in itself may be a source of inefficient resource extraction, jointly interacting with increased patronage employment.

Moreover the impact on G.D.P. growth of other variables connected with money demand is assessed using Bayesian techniques. The results indicated a bidirectional relationship between G.D.P. variations and rate of real money demand in the mentioned period. The Granger causality test combined with stochastic search variable selection indicated that active interest rate and discount rata mostly explained G.D.P. variations. According to results based on Bayesian regime-switching models, contrary to expectations, the interest rate increases continued to generate higher output variations, the consumption being the engine of economic growth in Romania.

IT came into prominence in the 1990s and 1 central bank after another adopted this regime in the 1990s and 2000s. Proponents of IT mainly argued that IT regime was successful on the grounds that it resulted in lower inflation rates and hence better economic performances. However, inflation rates in the world were in a downward trend from the 1980s well into the 2000s, and both IT and non-IT regimes managed to decrease their inflation rates. In addition, focusing too much on price stability through IT paved the way for permanently higher than necessary interest rates and disinflationary tight monetary policy periods when inflation rate was above an arbitrarily targeted level. Tight monetary policy can and do affect the real economy negatively and overemphasizing price stability may hurt the economy in terms of lower potential output, decreasing investment and more unequal income distribution. Post Keynesians offer valuable alternatives within the framework of parking-it approach to the existing monetary policy paradigm. Our main conclusion is that central banks should set the policy interest rate as low as possible and keep it there, in line with Keynesian cheap money policy.","[Tatliyer, Mevlut] Istanbul Medipol Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Medipol University,"Tatliyer, M (通讯作者)，Istanbul Medipol Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Istanbul, Turkey.",,"Tatlıyer, Mevlüt/G-3106-2018; Tatlıyer, Mevlüt/ABD-1230-2020","Tatlıyer, Mevlüt/0000-0001-8115-7226;",,,,,79,2,2,2,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Domestic climate policies alter the structure of domestic and foreign production and thereby innovation incentives across countries. Implementing sustainable growth requires redirecting global innovation to the nonpolluting sector. If most innovation takes place in the foreign country, policies must redirect foreign innovation by relocating clean production to the foreign country. A calibration exercise suggests that the US or EU alone are too small to implement sustainable growth. A coalition of Annex I countries that ratified the Kyoto protocol can implement sustainable growth, yet required tax rates are very high.","[van den Bijgaart, Inge] Univ Gothenburg, Vasagatan 1, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"van den Bijgaart, I (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Vasagatan 1, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",inge.van.den.bijgaart@gu.se,,"van den Bijgaart, Inge/0000-0003-0180-8792",Norwegian Research Council [209698],Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),"I would like to thank to Sjak Smulders and Reyer Gerlagh for helpful discussions and comments.

Although there are some tools trying to measure effectiveness of lobbying regulation and/or quality of lobbying, they lack to cover the lobbying issue in its complexity. Moreover, they do not specifically focus on transparency in lobbying. This paper is a first part of broader research on transparency in lobbying and its aim is to develop methodological fundament presented earlier. Following this, for any later evaluation it is necessary to design indicators of transparency in lobbying, or more precisely in this paper, to design indicators dealing with one side of lobbying contact the lobbyists only. For that reason, analysis of existing rules, documents, recommendations, research papers, experience and also expert critique of lobbying is used; there is a strong empirical background used for deriving all indicators. The author finally identifies 31 relevant indicators that are divided into four groups - Register, Codes, Disclosures, Open diaries - that mostly take the binominal value yes/no. All presented indicators are presented as preliminary and opening the space for next discussion about measuring this phenomenon. Only well discussed and clear indicators (together with those not developed yet) can create a solid base for the evaluation of transparency in lobbying on real countries' data later on.","[Vymetal, Petr] Univ Econ, Fac Int Relat, Dept Polit Sci, Winston Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Vymetal, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Int Relat, Dept Polit Sci, Winston Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",vymetal@vse.cz,"Vymětal, Petr/AAE-4021-2021",,Czech Science Foundation [16-11210S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"This paper has been elaborated as one of the outcomes of research projects supported by the Czech Science Foundation, project No. 16-11210S Corruption Opportunity Space in the Czech Republic.",,8,0,0,0,4,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-349-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,474,480,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6CS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426486500053,0

However, this article may be the first attempt to study how the diversity of beliefs affects stock price informativeness. The framework of the noisy rational expectations model shows that stock informativeness is determined by both the precision and use of private information in trading. If private beliefs about the value are highly diverse, the aggregate average opinion revealed in a stock's price will be more accurate and, thus, more informative. As the price becomes more informative, however, individual investors will rely less on their private information. When this occurs, less private information will be absorbed in price, which, in turn, reduces price informativeness. Our model shows that the relationship between belief diversity and price informativeness is U-shaped in equilibrium.","[Wei, Xu] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Wei, X (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China.",xuwei@cufe.edu.cn,,,"School of Finance, Central University of Finance and Economics","School of Finance, Central University of Finance and Economics","This work was supported by the School of Finance, Central University of Finance and Economics.",,14,3,3,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

However, the implementation of such systems in developing countries presents problems for their key stakeholders. On the one hand, property owners are hesitant to purchase insurance or invest in retrofit projects due to cost considerations. On the other hand, insurers are reluctant to cover potential seismic losses, because of uncertainties about the risk. This study introduces an innovative Public-Private Partnership framework for property owners, insurers and governments to facilitate decisions related to hazard insurance and structural retrofit of vulnerable buildings. This framework can also help insurance firms reduce the level of corporate financial assets available for payment of compensation to their clients, as required by regulations aimed at reducing the risk of insurer insolvencies. Property owners are motivated to participate in the framework by extra mitigation subsidies from the government. While the government will be reimbursed for part of the cost of these retrofit projects by insurance firms, whose own savings will be achieved through reductions to legally mandated corporate capital. A case study is presented to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach for mitigating seismic risk to residential buildings in a rural area.","[Yao, Xijun; Wei, Hsi-Hsien; Skibniewski, Miroslaw J.] Univ Maryland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Shohet, Igal M.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Struct Engn, Beer Sheva, Israel",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Ben Gurion University,"Wei, HH (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",hhweing@gmail.com,"Wei, Hsi Hsein/AAR-4108-2020; Skibniewski, Miroslaw J./P-5310-2018; SHOHET, IGAL M./AAY-7020-2020","SHOHET, IGAL M./0000-0002-9128-5317; Skibniewski, Miroslaw/0000-0002-7102-753X; Wei, Hsi-Hsien/0000-0002-7024-0726",,,,,31,2,2,0,16,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Based on the Bass model, we combine an intertemporal demand shift pattern and the binary elements of seasonality - weekends and holidays - and propose a model called DISBM. We chose a sample of 58 movies released in China in 2013 to evaluate our proposal. The empirical results suggest that DISBM has better performance than other seasonal models. We demonstrate that the intertemporal demand shift results in weekend fluctuations, while the extra demand causes the seasonal holiday effect.

We explore cross-section mechanisms, that operate at the industry level, and time-series mechanisms, that operate at a general equilibrium level. We argue that firms can substitute formal with informal workers to smooth a negative trade shock. In this setting, industries exposed to larger tariffs cuts could experience increases in informality. In general equilibrium, there can be additional aggregate impacts in both manufacturing and non-traded sectors through workers reallocation among sectors, wage adjustments, and firm entry and exit. Using the cross-section variation of the data and an instrumental variable strategy we explore empirically the cross-section mechanisms. We find that reductions in industry tariffs increase labor informality, and the effect is differentially stronger in industries with a larger share of small-size firms. Using the time-series variation of the data, we are able to identify some of the general equilibrium effects. We find that the fall in the average national tariff decreased aggregate informality in the manufacturing sector but increased it in the non-traded sector.","[Cruces, Guillermo; Viollaz, Mariana] UNLP, Dept Econ, FCE, Ctr Estudios Distrut Laborales & Sociales CEDLAS, Calle 6 E 47 & 48,Piso 3,Oficina 322, La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Cruces, Guillermo] Comis Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Cruces, Guillermo] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Porto, Guido] UNLP, Dept Econ, Calle 6 E 47 & 48,Piso 3,Oficina 322, La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina",National University of La Plata; IZA Institute Labor Economics; National University of La Plata,"Porto, G (通讯作者)，UNLP, Dept Econ, Calle 6 E 47 & 48,Piso 3,Oficina 322, La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina.",guido.porto@depeco.econo.unlp.edu.ar,,"Cruces, Guillermo/0000-0002-1965-5897",R4D on Employment - Swiss National Science Foundation; Swiss Development Cooperation,R4D on Employment - Swiss National Science Foundation; Swiss Development Cooperation,"We thank I.

This loss exceeds what can be explained by marital separation alone. Using a difference in difference approach, I estimate that single fatherhood suppresses men's annual income by more than $8,000 per year, putting these men and their children at increased economic risk. Similar labor market changes are experienced by widower fathers, a subset of exogenous single fathers. The apparent effects show persistence after single fathers remarry, but mostly diminish after children mature and leave the household. These results stand at odds with previous research suggesting that fatherhood increases men's wages and hours, and that male labor market outcomes are not significantly influenced by housework.","[Albert, Aaron] US Air Force Acad, Air Force Acad, Dept Econ & Geosci, Colorado Springs, CO 80840 USA",United States Department of Defense; United States Air Force; United States Air Force Academy,"Albert, A (通讯作者)，US Air Force Acad, Air Force Acad, Dept Econ & Geosci, Colorado Springs, CO 80840 USA.",aaron.albert@usafa.edu,,"Albert, Aaron/0000-0001-9189-561X",,,,,29,1,5,0,40,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

These rules are based on forward-looking models that require instruments for consistent estimation. The use of standard, albeit weak, instruments leads to identification problems in forward-looking rules, preventing reliable policy inference. There are methods to improve instrument strength. When policy rules are estimated with stronger instruments, results are more precise and in closer alignment with theory than standard estimates.","[Bayar, Omer] Univ Evansville, Schroeder Sch Business, 1800 Lincoln Ave, Evansville, IN 47722 USA",University of Evansville,"Bayar, O (通讯作者)，Univ Evansville, Schroeder Sch Business, 1800 Lincoln Ave, Evansville, IN 47722 USA.",ob19@evansville.edu,,,,,,,51,2,2,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0164-0704,1873-152X,,J MACROECON,J.

As shown by Gill and Stone (Games Econ Behav 69:346-364, 2010), however, symmetric equilibria may not exist if contestants are expectation-based loss averse and have choice-acclimating expectations. We show that under choice-unacclimatingi.e., fixedexpectations both symmetric and asymmetric equilibria exist for all degrees of loss aversion. Importantly, a symmetric equilibrium also exists if players follow their preferred credible plan and the weight attached to psychological gain-loss utility does not strongly outweigh the weight put on material utility. Hence, for fixed expectations a focus on symmetric equilibria seems justifiable even if contestants are expectation-based loss averse.","[Dato, Simon; Grunewald, Andreas] Univ Bonn, Inst Appl Microecon, Adenauerallee 24-42, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Grunewald, Andreas] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Management & Microecon, Frankfurt, Germany; [Mueller, Daniel] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Econ, Chair Contract Theory & Informat Econ, Sanderring 2, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany",University of Bonn; Goethe University Frankfurt; University of Wurzburg,"Dato, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Inst Appl Microecon, Adenauerallee 24-42, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",simdato@uni-bonn.de; gruni@uni-bonn.de; daniel.mueller2@uni-wuerzburg.de,,"Dato, Simon/0000-0002-2366-2248",,,,,24,10,10,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Notably, it could reduce information asymmetries, permitting banks to offer better credit terms to the borrower. However, it also entails some costs for both sides. The empirical evidence so far has not been conclusive in determining under what conditions relationship lending can be beneficial or harmful. Most of the studies suggest that SMEs that engage in relationship lending benefit from more credit availability (especially during a financial crisis), and lower interest rates. This occurs when they are served by small banks, are geographically close to the lender, when the bank is adequately decentralized and when it is the dominant creditor of the firm. However, under certain circumstances, banks can extract rents from the borrower or be captured by him. In addition, the consequences and the future of relationship lending will be remarkably affected by the level of competition among banks, their ownership structure, the regulatory framework and the business model that banks will have to adopt accordingly.","[Duqi, Andi] Univ Sharjah, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Tomaselli, Angelo; Torluccio, Giuseppe] Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy; [Tomaselli, Angelo] Univ Amsterdam, Business Sch, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Sharjah; University of Bologna; University of Amsterdam,"Torluccio, G (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy.",giuseppe.torluccio@unibo.it,,"Torluccio, Giuseppe/0000-0002-2520-0688; Duqi, Andi/0000-0002-0869-2377; Tomaselli, Angelo/0000-0003-1796-7413",,,,,138,24,26,2,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

A market to trade levels of fuel efficiency dominates the simple standard regulation and the feebate.

Sales have a large and variable impact on the growth rate of average price paid. Even after aggregating across goods and markets, the monthly growth rate of average price paid is four times as volatile as the regular price because of changes in sale frequency, depth, and quantity response. The impact of sales is positively correlated with the local unemployment rate during recessions. The CPI item indexes used to deflate nominal consumption expenditure do not fully account for variation in sale activity. I show evidence that real consumption growth was understated during the last two recessions.","[Glandon, P.
