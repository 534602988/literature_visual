The perturbation term in the updating equation of the state covariance matrix is weighted by the estimate of the measurement error variance. This avoids the calibration of a design parameter as the perturbation term is scaled by the amount of uncertainty in the data. It is shown by Monte Carlo simulations that this perturbation method is associated with a good tracking of the dynamics of the parameters compared to other online algorithms and to classical and Bayesian methods. The standardized self-perturbed Kalman filter is adopted to forecast the equity premium on the S&P 500 index under several model specifications, and determines the extent to which realized variance can be used to predict excess returns.

Some decisions require careful explanations, which can be challenging to provide when the underlying mathematical model is complex. This is the case when recommendations are based on incomplete expression of preferences, as the decision-aiding tool has to infer despite this scarcity of information. This step is key in the process but hardly intelligible for the user. The robust additive utility model is a necessary preference relation which makes minimal assumptions, at the price of handling a collection of compatible utility functions, virtually impossible to exhibit to the user. This strength for the model is a challenge for the explanation. In this paper, we come up with an explanation engine based on sequences of preference swaps, that is, pairwise comparison of alternatives. The intuition is to confront the decision maker with elementary comparisons, thus building incremental explanations. Elementary here means that alternatives compared may only differ on two criteria. Technically, our explanation engine exploits some properties of the necessary preference relation that we unveil in the paper. Equipped with this, we explore the issues of the existence and length of the resulting sequences. We show in particular that in the general case, no bound can be given on the length of explanations, but that in binary domains, the sequences remain short.","[Belahcene, K.; Mousseau, V.; Ouerdane, W.] Univ Paris Saclay, Cent Supelec, LGI, Chatenay Malabry, France; [Labreuche, C.] Thales Res & Technol, F-91767 Palaiseau, France; [Maudet, N.] UPMC Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, LIP6,UMR 7606, F-75005 Paris, France",Universite Paris Saclay; Thales Group; Sorbonne Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Maudet, N (通讯作者)，UPMC Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, LIP6,UMR 7606, F-75005 Paris, France.",khaled.belahcene@centralesupelec.fr; christophe.labreuche@thalesgroup.com; nicolas.maudet@lip6.fr; vincent.mousseau@centralesupelec.fr; wassila.ouerdane@centralesupelec.fr,"Mousseau, Vincent/E-9078-2012","Mousseau, Vincent/0000-0001-8574-3337; Ouerdane, Wassila/0000-0002-4515-7461",,,,,29,6,6,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,FEB,2017,82.0,2,,,,,151,183,,10.1007/s11238-016-9560-1,0.0,,,33,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,EL2BL,,"Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000394425000001,0

It is worth emphasizing that when life expectancy is above the trend line, then people in those countries live longer, whereas if infant mortality is below the trend line, it shows that obstetrical care in those countries is excellent.","[Biernacki, Marek] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Management Comp Sci & Finance, Dept Math & Cybernet, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Biernacki, M (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Management Comp Sci & Finance, Dept Math & Cybernet, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",marek.biernacki@ue.wroc.pl,,"Biernacki, Marek/0000-0002-7738-2065",,,,,6,1,1,1,1,WYDAWNICTWO UNIW EKONOMICZNEGO & WROCLAWIU,WROCLAW,"UL KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WROCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",2453-9902,,978-83-7695-693-0,APPLI MATH STAT ECON,Applications of Mathematics and Statistics in Economics Conference Proceedings,,2017,,,,,,,7,15,,10.15611/amse.2017.20.01,0.0,,,9,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BP1SD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540714200001,0

Hypercompetition directs the focus of enterprises towards the analysis of each individual consumer. In the mentioned environment, customer relationship management is the key feature of competitiveness. Therefore, enterprises focus not only on the research of a target group of customers, but also on the detailed analysis of competition and market conditions with the aim of determining appropriate prices of their own products or services. The mentioned factors influence price setting. Moreover, each numerical mark in the price has symbolic and visual importance, which should be thoroughly considered while setting the price. In addition to the following statement, enterprises use additional marketing tools for price setting. They also use the aspects of psychological price setting in order to make the price of a product or service more attractive to the consumer. Therefore, it is necessary to analyse the way in which the psychological price influences consumer behaviour and product or service purchase decision-making. The key hypothesis of this paper is: 'Psychological price has a significant influence on consumer behaviour and on purchase decision-making. Research of the impact of the psychological price on consumer's behaviour in practice was carried out with the aim of analysing the above mentioned issue on the market. The research was conducted via questionnaire on the sample of 100 participants. Through the offered questions, the participants showed how they perceive both the price and the importance of the price in product or service purchase decision-making process. The results of the carried out analysis show the importance of the impact of price on consumer's purchase decision-making, as well as strong impact of the psychological price on guiding consumer decisions.","[Bognar, Zrinka Blazevic; Puljic, Nikolina Plesa; Lacko, Tanja] Virovitica Coll, Virovitica, Croatia",,"Bognar, ZB (通讯作者)，Virovitica Coll, Virovitica, Croatia.",zrinka.blazevic@gmail.com; nikolina.plesa.puljic@gmail.com; tanja.lacko@gmail.com,,,,,,,23,2,3,2,8,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,589,597,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8CX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427987300058,0

The treatment of the subject is organized in three parts. Part One has an introductory and essentially de-constructive character. There is a critical examination of the present state of the controversies on the theory of value and capital. The basic idea is that the surplus approach has a limited role to play in a capitalist economy, where commodities are produced for exchange, rather than for direct use. Part Two has a reconstructive character. It deals with the formal treatment of economic complexity in system dynamics and involves a radical change of analytical perspective: the passage from the traditional informal approach to the problem of economic policy to a computer-based mathematical approach conceived in a complex system framework. In Part Three this perspective is further developed and its main implications are considered. The differences between chaos theory and complexity theory are analyzed and the connections of economics with statistical physics and quantum theory are recalled. Finally a set of conclusions on the application of the science of complexity to system analysis in economics are drawn. They go in the direction of an integration of knowledge from various disciplines.","[Cavalieri, Duccio] Univ Florence, Florence, Italy",University of Florence,"Cavalieri, D (通讯作者)，Univ Florence, Florence, Italy.",duccio.cavalieri1@virgilio.it,"CAVALIERI, DUCCIO/T-3097-2017",,,,,,40,0,0,0,9,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

Patients in both the experimental group and the control group were comprehensively assessed in nursing, and hospital nursing plans for them were developed within 24 hours after they were admitted. The patients in the control group were given the conventional discharge guidance and health education, and those in the experimental group were given continuing care by the continuing care group. Patients with chronic renal failure in the two groups were compared in their self-care ability and quality of life between before and after discharge. The experimental group patients with chronic renal failure before discharge compared with the self-nursing ability of patients after discharge showed that self-care skills, sense of responsibility, self-concept and health knowledge score were significantly improved (P<0.01). The research showed that there were no obvious difference between the dimensions of the SF-36 scale of two groups were enrolled in (P>0.05), 3 months after the scales in two groups were higher than that of SF-36 group, there was significant difference (P<0.05), and the scores of experimental group in each dimension were higher than that of the control group (P<0.05). Continuing care can effectively improve the self-care ability of elderly patients with chronic renal failure, and the patients can actively cooperate with doctors and nurses in the treatment and nursing, thereby effectively controlling the progression of the disease, reducing the patients' suffering and economic burden, and improving their quality of life.","[Chen Xueyan] Beihua Univ, Sch Nursing, Jilin, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Huang Wei] Beihua Univ, Clin Hosp 1, Jilin, Jilin, Peoples R China",Beihua University; Beihua University,"Chen, XY (通讯作者)，Beihua Univ, Sch Nursing, Jilin, Jilin, Peoples R China.",455931074@qq.com; 840541181@qq.com,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-402-6,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2017,106.0,,,,,,486,489,,,,,,4,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BI9GR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416081200109,0

Knowing that on European, national and regional level significant financial resources are planned for energy efficiency project, made us believe that inefficiency could be chance for justified investment projects that could have impact on economic growth. The key research questions addressed in this paper are: 1) what are the range of benefits from energy efficiency for regional economic growth, 2) what is the value of investments and payback period, estimated employment and environmental effects of energy efficiency projects after renewal implementation and 3) what are the main policy remarks (challenges) of energy renewal implementation. After defining economic effects of energy efficiency projects, energetic and environmental impacts of implemented energy efficiency projects in seven budget beneficiaries of Osijek-Baranja County of The Republic of Croatia have been analyzed.

The use of geographical location in cooperation may be an additional source of increasing the attractiveness and competitiveness for border regions and enterprises. North-east part of Poland (and of EU) is a region where the factor limiting the possibilities for firms development is the distance from the markets. More intensive development of polish companies is possible through creation cross-border cooperation especially with companies from Belarus. The aim of the article is to present the results of studies which take into account factors affecting the level of cross-border cooperation of enterprises in north-eastern Poland and in neighbouring region of Belarus in the context of increasing their competitiveness. The article uses the method of critical analysis of the literature and statistical analysis of data from a study conducted on a group of companies in leading industries in Poland and in Belarus. The main statistical measures and correlation coefficients were used to interpret the results. The study found a low level of existing cooperation and the low possibility of its strengthening in the near future.

Thus, it might be interesting to check which types of RES develop more than others. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to describe the share of different RES in overall renewable energy (RE) in EU member countries in the period between 1995 and 2014. The results of analysis for the year 1995 are compared with the results obtained for the year 2014, and the comparison indicates which RES gain in importance during the last 20 years. PCA also allows for describing RE development and identifying the direction of progress in this area, including progress resulting from technological advances. The main types of RES include: hydropower, wind energy, solar energy, tide, wave and ocean, biomass and renewable wastes and geothermal sources. The analysis demonstrates that three types of RES - hydropower, bioenergy and geothermal energy - predominate in analysed European countries in 1995. During the next years the share of RE in the energy mix increases, and the distribution of RES changes, with a notable increase of the share of wind and solar energy in the overall share of RES.","[Frodyma, Katarzyna] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Stat, Rakowicka 27 St, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Frodyma, K (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Stat, Rakowicka 27 St, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",frodymak@uek.krakow.pl,"Frodyma, Katarzyna/I-4596-2018","Frodyma, Katarzyna/0000-0003-3201-4805",Faculty of Management at Cracow University of Economics,Faculty of Management at Cracow University of Economics,"Publication was financed from the funds granted to the Faculty of Management at Cracow University of Economics, within the framework of the subsidy for the maintenance of research potential.",,7,2,2,0,0,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-65173-85-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,84,92,,,,,,9,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ0TS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417167000009,0

These reforms very in great part motivated by the recent global economic crisis and the basis for the realisation of reforms were different recommendations of the European Commission, International Monetary Fund and different empirical studies based mostly on the sample of developed OECD economies. Besides developed economies (OECD or EU-15) many other less developed countries realised or still undergo reforms of their tax systems. However, basic problem in conducting the tax reforms in these countries is lack of empirical findings in the field of impact of tax policy changes on overall economic activity. Thus, based on the main components and characteristics of modern tax systems on the effects of tax structure on economic growth, authors research in what extent the results of the existing literature which basis on developed countries can be applicable to these issues in less developed countries. Based on these findings, in the paper, authors present main guidelines and specific recommendations, which should be considered during the tax reform implementation in less developed economies.","[Grdinic, Maja; Drezgic, Sasa] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Rijeka, Croatia; [Stankovic, Jelena] Univ Nis, Fac Econ, Nish, Serbia",University of Rijeka; University of Nis,"Grdinic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Rijeka, Croatia.",maja.grdinic@efri.hr; sasa.drezgic@efri.hr; sjellenna@gmail.com,"Stanković, Jelena J./P-6945-2018; Drezgic, Sasa/GVR-7966-2022; Drezgic, Sasa/S-4114-2018; Grdinic, Maja/R-5094-2018","Stanković, Jelena J./0000-0002-9875-9861; Drezgic, Sasa/0000-0002-7712-8112; Grdinic, Maja/0000-0002-8648-6018",Croatian Science Foundation [IP-2013-11-8174]; University of Rijeka [13.02.1.2.02],Croatian Science Foundation; University of Rijeka,This work has been supported by the Croatian Science Foundation under the project number IP-2013-11-8174 and by the University of Rijeka under the project number 13.02.1.2.02.,,9,1,1,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,2,9,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8CX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427987300001,0

This suggests that, in Information Technology outsourcing activities, distance is not dead-actually, distance is seen as a source of challenges that can hurt the project overall health. In order to reduce these risks keeping an effective cost, proximity offshoring (nearshoring) is getting more used over the past two decades, but the academic literature on the subject is still on its beginnings. Using an Information Technology project, part of a large business transformation program that took place in Geneva (Switzerland), done by a vendor that delivered more than 2500 days in consulting as the main case study, this paper analyzes and discusses the benefits and challenges of incorporating nearshoring practices in these types of initiatives. The analysis starts by suggesting that nearshoring can add value to Information Technology projects if managed the right way-when compared to traditional services delivery (onsite consultants), nearshoring practices can have an outstanding result, with a very positive financial impact, showing considerable savings and avoiding a significant increase of risks or losses in quality, leading to an increased return on investment (ROI). Finally, some recommendations are suggested as the starting point for a framework for nearshore usage, pointing directions for further research. A similar analysis was already published by the same authors for a training project, aiming to understand if the same trends are applicable in several types of services delivered using nearshoring practices.","[Guedes, Jorge F.; Pereira, Leandro] Univ Lisbon, ISCTE Inst, BRU IUL, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"Guedes, JF (通讯作者)，Univ Lisbon, ISCTE Inst, BRU IUL, Lisbon, Portugal.",Jorge_Fernando_Guedes@iscte-iul.pt,"Pereira, Leandro F./Z-4046-2019","Pereira, Leandro F./0000-0002-4920-0498; Guedes, Jorge/0000-0002-0164-2924",,,,,9,0,0,1,12,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-39919-5; 978-3-319-39918-8,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,4.0,,,,,,325,340,,10.1007/978-3-319-39919-5_25,0.0,,,16,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2AH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000407615400025,0

In addition to potential appreciation, individual households benefit over time from a housing dividend defined as the difference between the market rent for the individual household's housing unit and the household's actual house ownership costs. The purchase of a house can substantially fix a household's recurring housing related expenditures and generates a hedge (implied housing dividend) that increases with ownership tenure. This expenditure hedge (dividend) to home ownership is documented using pooled, cross-year samples from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX). The housing dividend delivers a non-trivial effect on household non-housing expenditures after controlling for housing value, housing equity, financial assets and income.","[Guo, Sheng] Florida Int Univ, Dept Econ, Coll Arts & Sci, 11200 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Hardin, William G., III] Florida Int Univ, Tibor & Sheila Hollo Sch Real Estate, Coll Business Adm, 1101 Brickell Ave,1100S, Miami, FL 33131 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida International University; State University System of Florida; Florida International University,"Hardin, WG (通讯作者)，Florida Int Univ, Tibor & Sheila Hollo Sch Real Estate, Coll Business Adm, 1101 Brickell Ave,1100S, Miami, FL 33131 USA.",sheng.guo@fiu.edu; hardinw@fiu.edu,,,,,,,66,5,5,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

It looks at the use of tactics in negotiations between priests and believers. The article sees negotiations, prevalent in domestic religiosity and embodied practices, as a continuation of everyday Soviet tactics, particularly informal networks (Blat) and moonlighting (Khaltura). To understand how negotiations lead to greater control and an increase in religiosity, the article explores important features of the Georgian Orthodox Church and its specific development.

We made an empirical analysis of successful implementation of the CRM system in one of the largest domestic consortium in BiH which is also one of the domestic pioneers in CRM implementation. In order to explore both sides of the coin, we investigated customer and employee satisfaction. The research was conducted via two online questionnaires designed for both groups of respondents. The final samples included 46 employees and 214 customers. The research findings indicate that the employees did not have any major problems in getting used to the new system (CRM system) or in communicating with customers. It is evident that the employees involved in the CRM implementation understand the process and that they are dedicated to the CRM success, but most of them (96 %) believe that a successful implementation would not be possible without external expert involvement. This indicates that a lack of vision, leadership, and training of employees often results in failed implementation. On the other hand, customers are satisfied with services and communication with employees during the sales and post-sales processes. However, regarding the customer loyalty, as many as 49% of respondents said that they would not leave the company while 35% might leave, whereas 17% of the surveyed customers said that they intend to leave the company. These 35% of customers should not be lost and it is essential to investigate the causes of customer reluctance. In this regard, we provided concrete recommendations.","[Habul, Aida; Pilav-Velic, Amila] Univ Sarajevo, Sch Econ & Business, Dept Management & Informat Technol, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg; [Fejzic, Amina] Univ Sarajevo, Sch Econ & Business, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Sarajevo; University of Sarajevo,"Pilav-Velic, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sarajevo, Sch Econ & Business, Dept Management & Informat Technol, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg.",amila.pilav-velic@efsa.unsa.ba,"Pilav-Velic, Amila/JAC-1971-2023",,,,,,12,0,0,0,6,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-39919-5; 978-3-319-39918-8,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,4.0,,,,,,401,411,,10.1007/978-3-319-39919-5_29,0.0,,,11,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2AH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000407615400029,0

It finds that, in recent years, the use of non-cash payment instruments has been growing rapidly, driven by commercial, technological and regulatory developments, as well as by changing customer needs. In this dynamic environment, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) ensures an orderly development and the safety and efficiency of payment arrangements via regulations, the oversight of payment systems, instruments and service providers, as well as by providing payment infrastructure itself, such as the Internet Banking Payment System. With it, the PBoC responds not only to the rapid growth of Internet and mobile payments, but also to the increasing demand for instant payments, which is a global trend. The next technological shift might be a gradual one from electronic to digital money. In this area, the PBoC is also active, by overseeing and regulating Bitcoin and assessing digital currencies in general, including the potential issuance of a digital Yuan.","[Hess, Patrick] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Hess, P (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany.",patrick.hess@ecb.int,,,,,,,23,2,2,1,21,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0921-8580,2197-1889,978-3-319-59846-8; 978-3-319-59845-1,FINAN MON P,,,2017,44.0,,,,,,117,131,,10.1007/978-3-319-59846-8_8,0.0,,,15,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL1NM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447914500008,0

In conformity with the government agenda, university has always been recognised as a core to provide for new innovative development. It is very important for university to set their target to be considered as a highly creative and innovative university. Although many efforts have been put forward to encourage for promoting innovation, nevertheless there are some aspects which are not fully utilised especially on the role of intellectual property rights towards innovation in the university context. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to examine to what extent that intellectual property rights play in promoting innovation and what challenges face by the university in promoting their innovation through intelletual property rights. For the purpose of the study, interviews were conducted with seven academics researchers who have developed their innovation in terms of viable research products. This study identified that intellectual property rights play significant role in promoting innovation for the university. Nevertheless, it was also found that intellectual property rights provide challenges for university to foster its innovation. Findings of this study can be used as a guidance for academic researchers to strategically plan for a dynamic and successful innovative development in the university. These findings are also valuable for policy makers in the university and government to promote innovative development for Malaysia as a whole.","[Ismail, Norain] Univ Tekn Malaysia Melaka, Durian Tunggal, Malaysia",University Teknikal Malaysia Melaka,"Ismail, N (通讯作者)，Univ Tekn Malaysia Melaka, Durian Tunggal, Malaysia.",norain@utem.edu.my,,,Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka [FRGS/1/2016/SS01/FPTT/02/F00322],Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka,The author would like to express her sincere gratitude to the Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka for supporting this study under a grant of FRGS/1/2016/SS01/FPTT/02/F00322,,38,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,174,183,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8SX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428763000018,0

I investigate both direct and indirect causes of the 2007 GFC and the possibility of limiting it, in some aspects, through the development of social banking and social economy. In order to achieve the research objective, the cognitive approach was applied based mainly on observations. The content analysis was also conducted, which was based mainly on the desk research of digital and documentary sources. The results indicate that the influence of social banking was weakened before the GFC. These findings are consistent with the assessment of numerous research, however, in my research I suggest how to avoid such an enormous negative impact through developing of social banking (through quantitative as well as qualitative development). In my research I also emphasize the role of a regulator in selected areas.","[Janik, Bogna] WSB Univ, Poznan, Poland",,"Janik, B (通讯作者)，WSB Univ, Poznan, Poland.",bogna.janik@wsb.poznan.pl,,"Janik, Bogna/0000-0002-3765-4783",,,,,9,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,92,99,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8CX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427987300010,0

We hypothesize that transit use is related to the perceived usefulness and the ease-of-use of the system, which are related to information quality and real-time information availability. The hypothesized relations are anchored theoretically in the Technology Acceptance Model and validated empirically in two case-studies: (i) Copenhagen (Denmark), characterized by a highly integrated transit system with an advanced web-based information system; (ii) Recife and Natal (Brazil), characterized by a lower perceived level-of-service and non-integrated information sources. Data from a tailor-made survey of 1123 university students were collected. Structural equation models were employed for explaining the use of transit as a function of the observed respondent characteristics and the latent constructs. The results show that: (i) information search quality and source explain transit use; (ii) information quality underlies level-of-service and familiarity; (iii) the use of real-time information links to information quality and familiarity; (iv) general transit use and non-routine use during night and to unfamiliar places are correlated; and (v) the behavioral framework is confirmed with the two case-studies.

This study contains an analysis of some examples of convertible bonds issued on the Polish Catalyst market that operates on the transaction platforms of the Warsaw Stock Exchange and of BondSpot. The data come from reports published by companies on the Catalyst. As research method applied is a case study. The analyses performed allow the indication of increasing utilization of convertible bonds by economic operators to raise capital. The applied solutions concern varied situations in which companies found themselves. In extreme cases it concerned companies that were unable to pay off their liabilities generated by issued bonds. Including bonds convertible into shares into financing strategy of a company allows to obtain borrowed capital cheaply in comparison with traditional bonds or a bank loan, in exchange for the possibility of their conversion into shares. The level of the development of Poland's capital market indicates opportunities for further growth in using convertible bonds by companies as an instrument for collecting funds and in the case of investors for investing capital.","[Kolosowska, Bozena; Huterska, Agnieszka] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Econ Sci & Management, Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Huterska, A (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Econ Sci & Management, Torun, Poland.",huterska@umk.pl,"Huterska, Agnieszka/AAC-9799-2021","Huterska, Agnieszka/0000-0002-4722-2853",,,,,43,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-39919-5; 978-3-319-39918-8,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,4.0,,,,,,55,66,,10.1007/978-3-319-39919-5_5,0.0,,,12,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2AH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000407615400005,0

Already from the very beginning of existence of universities in Europe they differed with their methods of management. Gradually, along with the development of universities, various new organs of universities appeared which were equipped with suitable managerial competences. One must stress that currently the system of university managment is still evolving, which is to lead to its effective management. One may also see that certain organs of the university which even recently had held competences, currently are representative organs, which aimed at maintenance of university traditions of previous centuries, however, the real power is transferred to other or new bodies of the university. Along with development of enterprises, and therefore - of various forms of commercial companies, one can currently perceive a tendency among employers to model themselves at the level of generally applicable law and the internal law generally applicable and the internal law of the university just pursuant to corporate governance principles. These tendencies lead to formation of new organs of university modelled after organs of commercial companies. In Poland, in the draft amendment of the act of 27 July 2005 - Higher Education Act - one may perceive an idea of a change of a university management system modelled after corporate governance, what is to lead to effective university mangement. This paper aims at presentation of the currently existing model of academic governance in Poland, as well as draft amendments directed towards corporate governance as a base of academic governance, taking into account the analysis of adavantages and disadvantages of particular models of academic governance from the point of view of university management effectiveness.","[Kozien, Ewa] Cracow Univ Econ, Fac Econ & Int Relat, Dept Management Strategy & Org, Ul Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland; [Kozien, Adam] Jagiellonian Univ, Ul Golebia 24, PL-31007 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics; Jagiellonian University,"Kozien, E (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Fac Econ & Int Relat, Dept Management Strategy & Org, Ul Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",koziene@uek.krakow.pl; a.kozien@student.uj.edu.pl,"Kozien, Ewa/M-3851-2018; Kozien, Adam/M-3977-2018","Kozien, Ewa/0000-0002-5876-2804; Kozien, Adam/0000-0002-9301-9645",,,,,19,3,3,1,14,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,38,47,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8CX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427987300005,0

Consumers are known to have a strong relationship with brands congruent with their identities. People with predominantly independent self-construal see themselves as independent, distinct from the group, and tend to place high value on uniqueness, accomplishments, and achievement. Sophisticated brands are considered as upper class and charming which may symbolize high achievement; therefore, one would expect that biculturals with a more accessible independent self-construal are more likely to have a higher brand liking toward sophisticated brands compared to less independent ones. This hypothesis is examined across two studies, one of which is a survey and the other is an experiment where brand personality was manipulated. The results show that biculturals' brand evaluations vary with the level of independent self-construal. Specifically, more independent biculturals evaluate sophisticated brands more favorably than less independent biculturals. There is no significant effect of independent self-construal on evaluations for a sincere brand.","[Kubat, Umut] Yildirim Beyazit Univ, Business Sch, Ankara, Turkey",Ankara Yildirim Beyazit University,"Kubat, U (通讯作者)，Yildirim Beyazit Univ, Business Sch, Ankara, Turkey.",ukubat@ybu.edu.tr,"Kubat, Umut/I-9766-2017",,,,,,32,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-39919-5; 978-3-319-39918-8,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,4.0,,,,,,525,536,,10.1007/978-3-319-39919-5_39,0.0,,,12,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2AH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000407615400039,0

The PRC and India imitated this system selectively, aware of its dangerous centrifugal tendency.

Indicators describing income, consumption and wealth are so far available for countries only, although step by step more and more attention is paid also to the regional level. Yet official regional statistics is usually limited to several main indicators due to demanding character of indicators' estimation. We have done academic research and extended the range of available indicators, e.g. regional consumption expenditures in Czech regions. Our subsequent research has been focusing on regional wealth of households whose estimation is more complicated. There are very few possible data sources therefore several models have to be applied. The aim of the paper is to estimate regional wealth of households in 14 Czech NUTS 3 regions. Our results are compared to other indicators published in regional accounts. Also, the analysis of incompatibility of indicators is carried out. Regional differences in wealth may vary from differences in income or expenditure as the nature of indicators is dissimilar. On one hand, wealth expresses status on the particular date resulting from the previous accumulation as well as from households' preferences (e.g. living in own or rented dwelling). On the other hand, income and expenditure describe transactions occurring during the given period regardless previous transactions. The results may lead to slightly different assessment of regional well-being of households.","[Musil, Petr; Kramulova, Jana; Zeman, Jan; Vrabec, Vaclav] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Econ Stat, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 3, Czech Republic",,"Musil, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Econ Stat, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 3, Czech Republic.",petr.musil@vse.cz; jana.kramulova@vse.cz; jan.zeman@vse.cz; xvrav00@vse.cz,"Musil, Petr/HSB-9652-2023","Musil, Petr/0000-0002-8457-4559","University of Economics, Prague Internal Grant Agency [IGA 52/2016]; Institutional Support for Long Period and Conceptual Development of Research and Science at Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague","University of Economics, Prague Internal Grant Agency; Institutional Support for Long Period and Conceptual Development of Research and Science at Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague","The paper has been prepared under the support of the University of Economics, Prague Internal Grant Agency; project No. IGA 52/2016 Indicators of Households' Standard of Living with Respect to the Regionalization and Social Groups and by Institutional Support for Long Period and Conceptual Development of Research and Science at Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague.",,18,0,0,1,2,WYDAWNICTWO UNIW EKONOMICZNEGO & WROCLAWIU,WROCLAW,"UL KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WROCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",2453-9902,,978-83-7695-693-0,APPLI MATH STAT ECON,Applications of Mathematics and Statistics in Economics Conference Proceedings,,2017,,,,,,,319,329,,10.15611/amse.2017.20.26,0.0,,,11,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BP1SD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540714200026,0

However, reform of systems of vocational education and training (VET) poses severe challenges for aligning the interests of schools, firms, households, and governments, even in societies with relatively efficient markets for labor and education. Where market institutions are poorly developed, these challenges are particularly acute, resulting in endemic mismatches between the supply and demand of skill. Currently governments in many countries, including the United States, Russia, and China, are seeking to adopt elements of the German dual education model. The Russian federal government has undertaken several initiatives designed to upgrade VET by encouraging closer cooperation of vocational schools and firms at the regional level, including the adoption of dual education programs. This paper focuses on one such project: a 2013 pilot program administered by the Russian Agency for Strategic Initiatives, to foster the development of new models of dual education. The paper compares the 13 pilot regions with regions that submitted proposals but were not selected and with all other regions along multiple economic, social, demographic, and institutional dimensions. The findings suggest hypotheses about the conditions that enabled the pilot regions to take advantage of federal policies encouraging the adoption of dual education. More generally, the paper sheds light on institutional solutions to collective action dilemmas in skill formation in transitional and developing societies.","[Remington, Thomas F.] Emory Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Remington, Thomas F.] Natl Res Univ, Int Ctr Study Inst & Dev, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia",Emory University; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Remington, TF (通讯作者)，Emory Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.;Remington, TF (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ, Int Ctr Study Inst & Dev, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia.",polstfr@emory.edu,,,Russian Science Fund [16-18-10425]; Russian Science Foundation [16-18-10425] Funding Source: Russian Science Foundation,Russian Science Fund(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)); Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)),"This research was conducted with the support of a grant from the Russian Science Fund (project number 16-18-10425), Private-Public Partnerships in Secondary Vocational Education: The Case of Firms in Russia and China.",,56,20,20,2,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

Until then, they were considered only as an American phenomenon. Countries worldwide are interested in attracting venture capital investments because of their undisputable effects on the economy. The effects of the investments are visible through the impact on innovation, creation of new companies, jobs, economic growth, corporate governance and etc. Venture capital is a subset of Private equity focused on start-up companies and companies having difficulties in attracting necessary capital. It represents an equity investment made for the launch, early development, or expansion of a business. The countries of former Yugoslavia (Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia - FYROM, Montenegro, Slovenia and Serbia) are part of the Central and Eastern Europe countries and represent relatively a new market for venture capitalists. They moved from the planned economies to a free market system in the 90s of 20 century. As well as other countries in the World, these countries are also interested in attracting venture capital because of the proven impact on economic growth. Despite the presence of Venture capital and Private equity funds in this region for more than twenty years, the venture capital and private equity market in the countries of former Yugoslavia is underdeveloped compared to other countries of CEE. Indeed, the venture capital investments are so small for some countries of former Yugoslavia that the data about venture capital investment are published jointly. The objective of this paper is to examine and analyze the development of Venture Capital market in countries o former Yugoslavia. The research is both qualitative and quantitative, and involves an identification, analysis and comparison of PE/VC investments data for selected countries. The time frame for this research is between 2007 and 2014. The total volume of venture capital investments per year, the number of companies invested and the ratio of PE investments to the gross domestic product (GDP) will be used to demonstrate the existence of the venture capital market in countries of former Yugoslavia. The data necessary for the current research were taken from the yearbook of EVCA/PEREP Analytics for 2014 for Baltics and Ex-Y. PEREP Analytics is a centralized, non-commercial pan-European private equity database. The PEREP Analytics statistics platform monitors the development of private equity and venture capital in 25 European countries.","[Saric, Marija Simic] Univ Split, Fac Econ, Split 21000, Croatia",University of Split,"Saric, MS (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Fac Econ, Split 21000, Croatia.",msimic@efst.hr,"Saric, Marija Simic/G-9542-2017",,,,,,24,1,1,0,2,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2017,,,,,,,197,210,,10.18502/kss.v1i2.657,0.0,,,14,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BJ1DU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417433200015,0

Good practice entails: (a) Consistent definition and measurement of overrun; in contrast to mixing inconsistent baselines, price levels, etc. (b) Data collection that includes all valid and reliable data; as opposed to including idiosyncratically sampled data, data with removed outliers, non-valid data from consultancies, etc. (c) Recognition that cost overrun is systemically fat-tailed; in contrast to understanding overrun in terms of error and randomness. (d) Acknowledgment that the root cause of cost overrun is behavioral bias; in contrast to explanations in terms of scope changes, complexity, etc. (e) De-biasing cost estimates with reference class forecasting or similar methods based in behavioral science; as opposed to conventional methods of estimation, with their century-long track record of inaccuracy and systemic bias. Bad practice is characterized by violating at least one of these five points. Love and Ahiaga-Dagbui violate all five. In so doing, they produce an exceptionally useful and comprehensive catalog of the many pitfalls that exist, and must be avoided, for properly understanding and curbing cost overrun.","[Flyvbjerg, Bent; Ansar, Atif; Budzier, Alexander; Stewart, Allison] Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Oxford, England; [Buhl, Soren] Aalborg Univ, Dept Math Sci, Aalborg, Denmark; [Cantarelli, Chantal] Univ Sheffield, Management Sch, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Garbuio, Massimo; Lovallo, Dan] Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Glenting, Carsten] Viegand Maagoe AS, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Holm, Mette Skamris] Aalborg Municipal, Aalborg, Denmark; [Lunn, Daniel] Univ Oxford, Dept Stat, Oxford, England; [Molin, Eric] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Delft, Netherlands; [Ronnest, Arne] Esrum Kloster & Mollegard, Graested, Denmark; [Stewart, Allison] Infrastruct Victoria, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Oxford; Aalborg University; University of Sheffield; University of Sydney; University of Oxford; Delft University of Technology,"Flyvbjerg, B (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Oxford, England.",bent.fiyvbjerg@sbs.ox.ac.uk,"Garbuio, Massimo/HNI-6134-2023","Molin, Eric/0000-0003-4486-9608; Budzier, Alexander/0000-0002-2132-0412",,,,,92,106,111,2,52,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

The case of Strategic Choice of Measures in Swedish transport planning,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Communicative rationality; Instrumental rationality; Strategic Choice of Measures; Transport planning; Collaborative planning; Wicked problems,RATIONALITY; POLICY,"In 2013, a new preparatory study was established in the Swedish national transport planning process: Strategic Choice of Measures (SCM). It constitutes an arena for early dialogue between main actors and stakeholders at local, regional and national level to jointly assess transport related problems and develop solutions. This paper explores the collaborative elements of this planning method, analysing the extent to which the introduction of SCM implies fundamental steps towards a planning approach based on communicative rationality in Swedish national transport planning. The article departs from the governments recognition of the need for more and deeper collaboration between actors, new approaches and measures for transport problem, and increasing attention to demand management and modal shift to meet transport policy goals more efficiently, asking whether SCM makes national transport planning in Sweden more collaborative, in the sense of primarily relying on communicative rationality. The focus of the analysis lies on collaborative elements in the official SCM guidelines produced by the Swedish Transport Administration (STA) as an expression of an ideal SCM process, and a case study of an SCM process considered by the STA to be a good example of SCM in practice. The article concludes that although traces of communicative rationality are visible in both ideal and in practice, a more fundamental shift from instrumental to communicative rationality in Swedish national transport planning through the introduction of SCM has not occurred, since collaborative practices of SCM mainly are framed in a wider institutional framework of instrumental rationality.","[Tornberg, Patrik; Odhage, John] Royal Inst Technol, Dept Urban Planning & Environm, Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology,"Tornberg, P (通讯作者)，KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Urban Planning & Environm, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",patrik.tornberg@abe.kth.se,,,Swedish Transport Administration,Swedish Transport Administration,"The authors would like to thank Abdul Khakee, Karolina Isaksson, Torbjorn Suneson, and two anonymous reviewers for constructive comments on previous drafts of this paper.

Progression was not smooth or linear. It included a degree of experimentation and introspection. A dynamic capabilities framework is used to analyse the ability of a large long-established insurer to adapt to the emerging financial market environment. Internal change routines were not capable of achieving the degree of reorganisation needed.

We do this for two different measures of park availability and examine sources of preference heterogeneity. We find that the implicit price of another hectare of park within a 1000 m radius is 53.25 EUR per ha per year for the average apartment corresponding to an increase in annual rent of 0.33% per additional ha. For reducing distance to the nearest park by a meter, the price is 0.59 EUR per meter per year, corresponding to an increase in annual rent of 0.03%(0) per meter. We apply our results to a policy scenario reducing the park area available in an area of central Copenhagen and show how estimates of aggregate welfare changes are highly sensitive to the measure of park availability applied.

When the contest success function takes a logit form, and marginal cost is increasing in effort, we show that a Nash equilibrium exists and is unique both in productive and destructive endogenous prize contests. In equilibrium, the underdog expends more resources to win the prize, but still his probability of winning remains below that of the favorite. In a productive contest, the underdog behaves more aggressively and wins the prize more often in comparison to a fixed-value contest. Thus, the degree of competitive balance-defined as the level of uncertainty of the outcome-depends upon the (fixed or endogenous) prize nature of the contest.","[Damianov, Damian S.; Yildizparlak, Anil] Univ Durham, Dept Econ & Finance, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England; [Sanders, Shane] Syracuse Univ, Falk Coll, Dept Sport Management, 440 White Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",Durham University; Syracuse University,"Damianov, DS (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Dept Econ & Finance, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England.",damian.damianov@durham.ac.uk; sdsander@syr.edu; anil.yildizparlak@durham.ac.uk,,"Yildizparlak, Anil/0000-0002-7115-6075",,,,,40,6,7,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,OCT,2018,85.0,3-4,,,,,435,453,,10.1007/s11238-018-9661-0,0.0,,,19,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GY3JH,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448446600009,0

Between 1908 and 1933, county governments enacted county health departments (CHDs) that provided sanitation and child-oriented health services. Using an event study design, I exploit variation in the location and timing of CHD arrival to measure the health effects. I find that CHD entry led to a decline in infant mortality, but provided little advantage to overall population health. For infants, CHDs prevented two deaths per 1000 births, which accounts for 8-10% of the period-specific mortality decline. The effect is most substantial in rural-only counties where infant mortality declines by roughly three deaths per 1000 births.","[Hoehn-Velasco, Lauren] Bryn Mawr Coll, Dept Econ, Bryn Mawr, PA 19010 USA",Bryn Mawr College,"Hoehn-Velasco, L (通讯作者)，Bryn Mawr Coll, Dept Econ, Bryn Mawr, PA 19010 USA.",lvelasco@brynmawr.edu,,"Hoehn-Velasco, Lauren/0000-0003-4054-9789",,,,,35,11,13,0,3,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0014-4983,1090-2457,,EXPLOR ECON HIST,Explor.

While almost 60% of male cancers are diagnosed in men over the age of 65, no previous research has examined the effect that cancer has on this age group, which is surprising given the relevance of this group to public policy. With data from the Health and Retirement Study, I show that cancer has a significant negative effect on the labor supply of these workers. Using a combination of linear regression models and propensity score matching, I find that respondents who are diagnosed with cancer work 3 fewer hours per week than their non-cancer counterparts. They are also 10 percentage points more likely to stop working. This reduction seems to be driven by a deterioration in physical and mental health. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Since the 1990s, major electricity market restructuring took place in some parts of the United States. We explore the implications of changing from a regulated cost-of-service, or rate of return, system to liberalized wholesale electricity markets on technology and fuel choices. We find that wholesale market restructuring resulted in significant immediate investment in various natural gas technologies due to higher expected profits, and a reduction in coal investments. In states that adopted liberalized wholesale electricity markets, higher natural gas price expectations resulted in more investment in coal and renewable technologies, while higher coal price expectations resulted in lower coal-fired baseload power investments. Natural gas price expectations, therefore. have the potential to significantly shape the power generation landscape of the future.","[Csereklyei, Zsuzsanna] RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, B80,445 Swanston St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Stern, David, I] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, 132 Lennox Crossing, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Australian National University,"Csereklyei, Z (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, B80,445 Swanston St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",zsuzsanna.csereklyei@rmit.edu.au; david.stern@anu.edu.au,"Stern, David I/B-4700-2009","Stern, David I/0000-0001-6595-4268; Csereklyei, Zsuzsanna/0000-0001-7124-8298",Australian Research Council [DP160100756],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"We thank the Australian Research Council for funding under Discovery Project DP160100756 Energy Efficiency Innovation, Diffusion and the Rebound Effect.

The complex and time varying relationship between oil prices and stock markets has caught the attention of the financial press, investors, policymakers, researchers, and the general public in recent years. In light of such attention, this paper reviews research on the oil price and stock market relationship. The majority of papers we survey study the impacts of oil markets on stock markets, whereas, little research in the reverse direction exists. Our review finds that the causal effects between oil and stock markets depend heavily on whether research is performed using aggregate stock market indices, sectorial indices, or firm-level data and whether stock markets operate in net oil-importing or net oil-exporting countries. Additionally, conclusions vary depending on whether studies use symmetric or asymmetric changes in the price of oil, or whether they focus on unexpected changes in oil prices. Finally, we find that most studies show oil price volatility transmits to stock market volatility, and that including measures of stock market performance improves forecasts of oil prices and oil price volatility. Several important avenues for further research are identified.","[Degiannakis, Stavros; Filis, George] Pante Univ Social & Polit Sci, Dept Econ & Reg Dev, 136 Syggrou Ave, Athens 17671, Greece; [Degiannakis, Stavros; Filis, George] Bournemouth Univ, Execut Business Ctr, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, 89 Holdenhurst Rd, Bournemouth BH8 8EB, Dorset, England; [Arora, Vipin] US Energy Informat Adm, 100 Independence Ave SW, Washington, DC 20585 USA",Panteion University; Bournemouth University,"Filis, G (通讯作者)，Pante Univ Social & Polit Sci, Dept Econ & Reg Dev, 136 Syggrou Ave, Athens 17671, Greece.;Filis, G (通讯作者)，Bournemouth Univ, Execut Business Ctr, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, 89 Holdenhurst Rd, Bournemouth BH8 8EB, Dorset, England.",gfilis@bournemouth.ac.uk,"Degiannakis, Stavros/AAD-2502-2019; Filis, George/HHS-1048-2022; Degiannakis, Stavros/AAF-2415-2021","Filis, George/0000-0002-4912-0973;",,,,,187,128,135,6,146,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,SEP,2018,39.0,5,,,,,85,130,,10.5547/01956574.39.5.sdeg,0.0,,,46,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GR6AF,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000442725200004,0

We find evidence that the twin-peaked distribution of GDP per worker in 2012 is the result of the existence of three spatial clubs: the first mainly populated by regions belonging to the former Eastern Bloc countries, the second by regions of the Southern Mediterranean countries (Portugal, Italy, and Spain) and the third by regions of other EU countries (notably Germany, France, UK and Northern European countries). Spatial externalities appears to be mainly driven by geographical, technological and social proximities, and only marginally by institutional proximities. Local spatial dependence is a pervasive phenomenon, and only the low-GDP per worker regions with similar neighbours seem to be immune. The 30 year ahead forecast of GDP per worker distribution suggests a weak convergence among the three clubs and a persistent spatial agglomeration in the future.","[Fiaschi, Davide] Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Econ & Management, Via Ridolfi 10, I-56124 Pisa, Italy; [Gianmoena, Lisa] Univ Politecn Marche, Ancona, Italy; [Parenti, Angela] IMT Sch Adv Studies Lucca, Lucca, Italy",University of Pisa; Marche Polytechnic University; IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca,"Fiaschi, D (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Econ & Management, Via Ridolfi 10, I-56124 Pisa, Italy.",davide.fiaschi@unipi.it; l.gianmonena@staff.univpm.it; angela.parenti@imtlucca.it,"Gianmoena, Lisa/ABF-1176-2020","FIASCHI, DAVIDE/0000-0002-1992-7071",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2016-76681-R],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"This research has benefited from the financial support of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Project ECO2016-76681-R).

Consequently, each attribute affecting service quality and rated in terms of satisfaction or importance could show spatial pattern across the region and/or temporal variations. Although transit service quality was largely investigated, few studies took into account the spatial variability of passengers' responses, given that a large amount of previous studies considered customer satisfaction with transit services in a cross sectional manner only. In order to cover this lack, we propose a study focused on transit service quality evaluated at railway stations, aimed to suggest a methodology for treating spatial variation of service quality attributes. The research is supported by Customer Satisfaction Survey data collected by a railway operator providing regional services in the North of Italy, and particularly rail services of regional and suburban lines connecting different towns of the hinterland of the city of Milan. The emerging results show spatial patterns across the region of the transit service quality attributes which should be taken into account for a deeper investigation of passengers' perceptions about rail services.","[Eboli, Laura; Forciniti, Carmen; Mazzulla, Gabriella] Univ Calabria, Dept Civil Engn, P Bucci,Cubo 46-B, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy",University of Calabria,"Mazzulla, G (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, Dept Civil Engn, P Bucci,Cubo 46-B, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy.",laura.eboii@unical.it; carmen.forciniti@unical.it; gabriella.mazzulla@unical.it,"Mazzulla, Gabriella/M-3036-2014; Forciniti, Carmen/C-9482-2016; Eboli, Laura/M-2261-2014","Mazzulla, Gabriella/0000-0003-0993-454X; Forciniti, Carmen/0000-0003-4562-9884; Eboli, Laura/0000-0002-3304-6430",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [TRA2015-66235-R],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),Support from Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Research Project TRA2015-66235-R) is gratefully acknowledged.,,52,46,48,0,29,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Rather than estimating models at the same common low frequency, we use recently developed econometric models, which allow us to deal with data of different sampling frequencies. We find that credit and labor market variables react the most to uncertainty shocks in that they exhibit a prolonged negative response to such shocks. When looking at detailed investment subcategories, our estimates suggest that the most irreversible investment projects are the most affected by uncertainty shocks. We also find that the responses of macroeconomic variables to uncertainty shocks are relatively similar across single-frequency and mixed-frequency data models, suggesting that the temporal aggregation bias is not acute in this context.","[Ferrara, Laurent] Univ Paris Nanterre, Int Macroecon Div, Banque France, 31 Rue Croix Petits Champs, F-75049 Paris, France; [Ferrara, Laurent] Univ Paris Nanterre, EconomiX, CNRS, 31 Rue Croix Petits Champs, F-75049 Paris, France; [Guerin, Pierre] Bank Canada, Int Econ Anal Dept, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Guerin, Pierre] OECD, Econ Dept, Paris, France",European Central Bank; Bank of France; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Bank of Canada; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Ferrara, L (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Nanterre, Int Macroecon Div, Banque France, 31 Rue Croix Petits Champs, F-75049 Paris, France.;Ferrara, L (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Nanterre, EconomiX, CNRS, 31 Rue Croix Petits Champs, F-75049 Paris, France.",laurent.ferrara@banque-france.fr,,,,,,,44,22,24,1,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0883-7252,1099-1255,,J APPL ECONOMET,J.

Recent literature seems to focus on partial equilibrium analysis of the jobs destruction in the US due to import competition from low-cost countries, particularly from China. However, as noted in World Investment Report 2011 (WIR, 2012), indirect employment generated by trade can be substantial, in addition to jobs directly generated by trade, to which end a general equilibrium model is more relevant. Just as in a relay game, it makes little sense to award or punish only the last runner. In this paper, a global value chain approach is adopted to examine the effects of the US-China trade on employment. By using a recently constructed world input-output data, it is made possible to account for jobs created along the value chain process. It is found that China's exports to the US and to the world had created more job opportunities for its trade partners than any other countries in the world. Further, China's exports to the US and to the world tended to generate more employment opportunities for the US services sector, while US exports created more manufacturing jobs for the Chinese workers. Finally, in both countries' exports the typical value chain products such as electrical and optical equipment were the most effective creators of jobs for both countries. In line with recent work of global value chains, our work sheds light on the employment effects of interconnected trade and provides an alternative interpretation for the impact of the US-China trade on employment.","[Lin, Guijun; Wang, Fei; Pei, Jiansuo] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics,"Lin, GJ (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,,"Pei, Jiansuo/0000-0003-4360-8705","National Natural Science Foundation [41675139, 71642002, 71433002]; National Social Science Foundation [12ZD096]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in UIBE [CXTD7-01]",National Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in UIBE,"We are grateful to the Editor and reviewers for constructive suggestions and comments.

We find significant upward return drift in the 9 trading days leading up to the Super Bowl, a pattern consistent with investors trading in anticipation of the game itself. The anticipatory behavior among investors leads to widespread pregame returns, which is not documented in prior studies. These pre-event abnormal returns are positive and statistically and economically significant for all firms, and the size of pre-event returns varies according to each team's favored status. In addition, firms associated with the winning team exhibit significant positive return drift over the 10-day period after their win. Firms associated with the losing team exhibit moderate downward drift. Our findings are strongest among the smallest quintile of firms and are robust to various risk adjustments and using a matched sample control group. The collective findings suggest that only by standing on the sideline will investors avoid winning around the Super Bowl.","[Payne, Brian C.] US Air Force Acad, Colorado Springs, CO 80840 USA; [Payne, Brian C.] Univ Colorado, Colorado Springs, CO 80907 USA; [Tresl, Jiri] Cent Michigan Univ, Dept Finance & Law, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA; [Tresl, Jiri] CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic; [Friesen, Geoffrey C.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Finance, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA",United States Department of Defense; United States Air Force; United States Air Force Academy; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado at Colorado Springs; Central Michigan University; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Friesen, GC (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Dept Finance, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",gfriesen2@unl.edu,"Tresl, Jiri/A-7041-2015",,,,,,50,3,4,0,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) have the potential to lessen the carbon emission and gasoline consumption in order to alleviate environmental problems. Consequently, attempts are being initiated to popularise the use of PHEVs as the main mode of transportation. The diffusion of PHEV adoption is a positive initiative. A sample of 403 respondents has been collected from Malaysia in order to forecast the customer's intention to adopt PHEVs by using the extended theory of planned behaviour. The empirical outcome using the PLS investigation exposed that all four constructs, subjective norm, personal moral norm, perceived behavioural control, and attitude ominously shows an indirect effect which has inclined towards the Malaysian consumers' intention to adopt PHEVs. All these four major constructs were significantly predetermined by their respective environmental concern. Whereas, hyperbolic discounting moderated the relationship between intention and adoption. The fostering result verifies that the relevance of the extended TPB had a good explanatory power in the line of predicting the Malaysian consumers' intention to adopt PHEVs. For future study, grounded by the observed outcome, authors explain the implication aimed at promoting the PHEV adoption.","[Adnan, Nadia] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Management & Humanities, Bandar Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia; [Nordin, Shahrina Md] Univ Teknol PETRONAS Bandar Seri Iskandar, Dept Management & Humanities, Tronoh 31750, Perak, Malaysia; [Amini, M.

The innovation in our model is the distinction between loans with either severe or mild losses. The variation in the proportion of these two types drives the cyclic behavior of the loss given default and constitutes the links with the default rate and macro variables. These links vary according to loan and borrower characteristics. During downturns, the proportion of defaults with severe losses increases, but the distribution of losses conditional on their being mild or severe does not change. although loans are monitored more closely than bonds and are more senior, the cyclical variation in their losses resembles those for bonds, albeit around a lower average level. This variation leads to an increase in the capital reserves required for loan portfolios.","[Keijsers, Bart; Diris, Bart; Kole, Erik] Erasmus Univ, Econometr Inst, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Keijsers, Bart; Diris, Bart; Kole, Erik] Erasmus Univ, Tinbergen Inst, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Tinbergen Institute; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Keijsers, B (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Burg Oudlaan 50,Room H08-11,POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",keijsers@ese.eur.nl,"Kole, Erik/B-5092-2008","Kole, Erik/0000-0001-9698-4072; Keijsers, Bart/0000-0001-5973-4664",Europlace Institute of Finance,Europlace Institute of Finance,"The authors thank NIBC Bank, in particular Michel van Beest, for providing access to the Global Credit Data data and helpful comments.

This suggests a novel explanation for the evolution of the college gender gap (which shows a clear upward trend in female college enrollments relative to male enrollments). Causal evidence from a natural experiment in European soccer markets-that provides exogenous variation in the expected earnings for men associated with a superstar path-supports this explanation: an increase in male earnings has a significant positive effect on the ratio of female to male tertiary enrollment in college education. Results are robust to using different samples of countries, to allowing for regional time trends, to analyzing lagged effects, to changing the definition of the treatment, and to exploiting alternative definitions of exposure.","[Rossi, Martin A.; Ruzzier, Christian A.] Univ San Andres, Victoria, Argentina",,"Ruzzier, CA (通讯作者)，Univ San Andres, Victoria, Argentina.",mrossi@udesa.edu.ar; cruzzier@udesa.edu.ar,,,,,,,50,0,0,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

Cruising also unnecessarily contributes to local congestion, vehicle emissions, air pollution, and climate change. The theoretical literature shows that these social costs can be reduced, or even eliminated, if high-quality information on the demand for and supply of parking is used to set parking prices at optimal levels. Not surprisingly, cities plagued by parking shortages, congested streets, and limited financial resources are interested in parking policies that reduce cruising and improve the efficient use of their existing parking and roadway infrastructure. The current study sheds light on the effect of the San Francisco parking pricing program (known as SFpark) on curbside parking search time and distance in urban neighborhoods on non-commuter parking. The study differs from previous empirical evaluations of similar parking pricing programs in its use of direct field measurements of parking search time and distance, rather than simulated data or proxy variables, such as parking availability. We use generalized mixed effect difference-in-difference models with data collected before and after the implementation of SFpark in both treatment and control areas to estimates effects of the San Francisco smart parking project, most importantly the demand responsive parking pricing scheme. The models control for time effects by using data from a separate control area, as opposed to using variables such as block face parking price and employment. The results suggest a significant reduction in average parking search time and distance due to SFpark. Average parking search time and distance declines by approximately 15% and 12%, respectively, from the control to the treatment areas.","[Alemi, Farzad; Rodier, Caroline] Univ Calif Davis, Inst Transportat Studies, 1715 Tilia St,Room 1149, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Drake, Christiana] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Stat, Math Sci 4101, One Shield Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Alemi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Inst Transportat Studies, 1715 Tilia St,Room 1149, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",falemi@ucdavis.edu; cjrodier@ucdavis.edu; cmdrake@ucdavis.edu,"drake, christiana/W-7161-2019","drake, christiana/0000-0002-0096-1800; alemi, farzad/0000-0003-4333-3393",U.S. Department of Transportation [DTFH61-06-D-000-7/ORDER 07-T-08002/WP BA07-041],U.S. Department of Transportation,"This paper is based on work performed for Battelle under contract to the U.S. Department of Transportation, contract number DTFH61-06-D-000-7/ORDER 07-T-08002/WP BA07-041.

Underutilization of labor is especially prevalent among firms with a unionized workforce. Firms with formal loans and firms with more human capital are closer to their efficient capital stock.

This note focuses on one particular group that benefits from subsidiesthose spectators who attend live sporting events. A portion of the benefits from subsidies provided by government are captured as increased consumer surplus by sporting fans. Thus, the income and wealth position of these fans are of interest to those deciding whether to subsidize a facility. On the other side of the equation, the taxes which fund sporting facilities are to a large degree state and local levies, which are mostly regressive, taking a larger portion of the income of lower and middle income than of higher income taxpayers because savings are usually exempt from the relevant taxes. Using data from the Household Expenditure Survey (1988-1989, 2009-2010), we analyze various financial status characteristics of those who pay to attend sporting events in Australia. We find that those who buy tickets to sporting events have higher annual incomes and greater wealth than Australians who do not purchase tickets to sporting events. Hence, while media and policy makers may view such funding as subsidizing working man's recreation, our results suggest that funding of sporting arenas should be assessed through the lens of correcting market failures rather than equity considerations.","[Wilson, John K.] Univ South Australia, Sch Business, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Siegfried, John J.] Vanderbilt Univ, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA",University of South Australia; Vanderbilt University,"Wilson, JK (通讯作者)，Univ South Australia, GPO Box 2471, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",john.wilson@unisa.edu.au,,"Wilson, John/0000-0002-4649-9121",,,,,13,5,5,0,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

It is the only exemplar to date of a mega-regional FTA for which negotiations have been successfully concluded, and a landmark in evolving approaches to Asia-Pacific integration. As such, quantitative assessments of its potential effects are of considerable interest. One of the most widely used techniques for evaluating the economic impact of regional trading agreements is numerical simulation with computable general equilibrium, or CGE, models. There have now been a large number of papers written that use CGE methods to analyse the potential economic impact of the TPP agreement under varying theoretical and policy assumptions. In this paper we provide a synthesis of the key results that have emerged from the literature, and introduce some new simulation results of our own to anchor the discussion.","[Gilbert, John] Utah State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Furusawa, Taiji] Hitotsubashi Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Kunitachi, Tokyo, Japan; [Scollay, Robert] Univ Auckland, Dept Econ, Auckland, New Zealand",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Hitotsubashi University; University of Auckland,"Gilbert, J (通讯作者)，Utah State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",,"Gilbert, John P/A-9031-2009",,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16H03617, 17H00986, 26220503] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,63,14,16,3,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2018,41.0,3,,,,,831,865,,10.1111/twec.12573,0.0,,,35,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FY7DH,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427021300010,0

This article examines these national choices in terms of the discontinuity they impose on the centralized policy model, showing that they reduced the policy inertia associated to the historical processes in place at the EU level, along a new national path dependency re-shaping the CAP implementation. The flexibility introduced by the 2014-20 reform was particularly embraced by Member States that had been penalized by the one-size-fits-all' historical archetype.","[Henke, Roberto; Pierangeli, Fabio; D'Andrea, Maria Rosaria Pupo] CREA Res Ctr Agr Policies & Bioecon, Rome, Italy; [Benos, Theo] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands; [De Filippis, Fabrizio; Giua, Mara] Roma Tre Univ, Rome, Italy",Maastricht University; Roma Tre University,"Henke, R (通讯作者)，CREA Res Ctr Agr Policies & Bioecon, Ctr Policies & Bioecon, Via Po 14, I-00198 Rome, Italy.",roberto.henke@crea.gov.it,"Pupo D'Andrea, Maria Rosaria/ABD-3595-2020; Pierangeli, Fabio/ABD-3535-2020","Pupo D'Andrea, Maria Rosaria/0000-0003-0635-1509; Benos, Theo/0000-0002-5688-5886; Giua, Mara/0000-0001-8923-437X",European Parliament,European Parliament,This paper further elaborates and updates some of the results of a study realized with the financial support of the European Parliament (Implementation of the first pillar of the CAP 2014-20 in the EU Member States) - Directorate-General for Internal Policies; Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies (http://www.europarl.europa.eu/studies).

We find that many, though not all, of the behavioural traits discussed in the literature can be approximated sufficiently closely by a random utility framework, allowing analysts to retain the many advantages that such an approach possesses.","[Hess, Stephane; Daly, Andrew; Batley, Richard] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Hess, Stephane; Daly, Andrew; Batley, Richard] Univ Leeds, Choice Modelling Ctr, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds; University of Leeds,"Hess, S (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.;Hess, S (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Choice Modelling Ctr, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",s.hess@its.leeds.ac.uk,"Hess, Stephane/AAX-2672-2020","Hess, Stephane/0000-0002-3650-2518; Daly, Andrew/0000-0001-5319-2745",European Research Council [615596-DECISIONS],European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)),Stephane Hess acknowledges the financial support by the European Research Council through the consolidator Grant 615596-DECISIONS.,,84,46,53,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,MAR,2018,84.0,2,,,SI,,181,204,,10.1007/s11238-017-9651-7,0.0,,,24,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,FW8XW,31983783.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000425621300003,0

Racial and ethnic variables appear to be less persistent, but all the variables exhibit a significant trend toward more stability over time. Even in the presence of large shocks to the metropolitan economy, a majority of MSAs retain the same basic spatial hierarchy they had decades ago.

This article further reveals the nature of this link. We show that citizens follow party cues on international bailouts, rather than having merely ideologically congruent positions. By employing an original survey experiment that exposes respondents to elite cues, we additionally uncover underlying dynamics. First, party cues mobilize support for bailouts even in the face of salient elite dissent and, second, even a strong elite consensus does not affect citizens without PID and low levels of political sophistication. The findings of the experiment are cross-validated with data from the voter survey of European Election Study 2014. The results suggest that current debates about international bailout packages deepen a polarization between politicized and non-politicized Europeans.","[Stoeckel, Florian] Univ Exeter, Exeter, Devon, England; [Kuhn, Theresa] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Exeter; University of Amsterdam,"Stoeckel, F (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Dept Polit, Rennes Dr, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England.",florian.stoeckel@gmail.com,"Stoeckel, Florian/ABI-7673-2020","Kuhn, Theresa/0000-0001-8784-1731",Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (VENI grant) [451-13-029]; Graduate School of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (VENI grant)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); Graduate School of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,"The authors would like to thank Liesbet Hooghe, Alison Johnston, Hanspeter Kriesi, Michael MacKuen, Gary Marks, Rune Slothuus, the participants of the Research Group on Governance at the European University Institute, the editors of JCMS, and the anonymous referee for valuable comments and suggestions.

There is reason to believe the effects of obesity on wages may vary for high- and low-earning individuals and that obesity wage effects may evolve over a lifecycle or from generation to generation. Drawing on data from two longitudinal surveys, we estimate quantile and fixed effect quantile regressions, among others, to further examine the obesity wage effect. Results suggest an increasingly severe penalty across the wage distribution for females. Specifically, the highest-earning women may be penalized as much as five times that of the lowest earners. Results for males suggest that penalties may be present at select wage levels, while prior research has generally found no male obesity penalty. We also provide evidence that the obesity penalty has increased across generations and limited evidence that it may slow earnings growth over one's lifetime.

This study uses migration to quantify the importance of Ricardian technology differences for international trade. The framework provides the first panel estimates connecting country-industry productivity and exports, and the study exploits heterogeneous technology diffusion from immigrant communities in the United States for identification. The latter instruments are developed by combining panel variation on the development of new technologies across US cities with historical settlement patterns for migrants from countries. The instrumented elasticity of export growth on the intensive margin with respect to the exporter's productivity growth is between 1.6 and 2.4, depending upon weighting. This provides an important contribution to the trade literature of Ricardian advantages, and it establishes a connection of migration to home country exports beyond bilateral networks.","[Kerr, William R.] Harvard Sch Business, Business Adm, Boston, MA 02163 USA; [Kerr, William R.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kerr, WR (通讯作者)，Harvard Sch Business, Business Adm, Boston, MA 02163 USA.;Kerr, WR (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",wkerr@hbs.edu,,,National Science Foundation; MIT George Schultz Fund; HBS Research; Innovation Policy and Economy Group,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); MIT George Schultz Fund; HBS Research; Innovation Policy and Economy Group,"I am grateful to Daron Acemoglu, Pol Antras, David Autor, Dany Bahar, Nick Bloom, Ricardo Caballero, Arnaud Costinot, Julian Di Giovanni, Robert Feenstra, Fritz Foley, Richard Freeman, Gordon Hansen, Sam Kortum, Ashley Lester, Matt Mitchell, Peter Morrow, Ramana Nanda, Giovanni Peri, Hillel Rapoport, Ariell Reshef, Tim Simcoe, Antonio Spilimbergo, Scott Stern, Sarah Turner, and John Van Reneen for advice on this project and to seminar participants at the eighth AFD-World Bank Migration and Development Conference, American Economic Association meetings, Clemson University, Columbia University, European Regional Science Association meetings, Georgetown University, Harvard University, International Monetary Fund, London School of Economics, MIT Economics, MIT Sloan, NBER High Skilled Immigration Conference, NBER Productivity, Queens University, University of California Davis, University of Helsinki, University of Toronto Rotman, World Bank, and Yale University for helpful comments.

In Europe entrepreneursip education is supported through European Union funded projects to motivate schools and make teachers be aware of the importance of this education at schools.From kindergarten to high school education entrepreneurship is included in the curriculum through different school subjects. However while integrating entrepreneurship acquisitions in the curriculum it should not be forgotten to give ethics in it. With the lights of these thoughts, this study was carried out to emerge the nessesity of ethical dimension of entrepreneurship as it is one of the most important acquisitions which should be included in the school subjects' curriculum. It was realised that entrepreneurship is not that much criticized or critically approached in literature and entrepreneurship education is not commonly related with ethics, they are few in number. In this study, entrepreneurship and ethical values were related and how they can be reflected in entrepreneurship education were discussed.

The improvements are so fast and significant that they are permanently producing the growth of expectations of the population regarding more successful, better and more comprehensive activities of health system. The aim of the survey is to get subjective insights into the quality of health care in the Republic of Croatia by interviewing citizens. The survey was conducted on a sample of 980 respondents from the entire Republic of Croatia. A written questionnaire was used for collecting the data. The data analysis used the methods of descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistical indicators were determined for all survey variables, based on respondents' responses that were measured on a 5-degree scale. Differences at a scale of p < 0.05 were considered as statistically significant differences. There are more women in the sample than men. Slightly more than half of the respondents belong to the younger group, while elderly are the least presented in the sample. If we consider non-grouped data, the average age of respondents was 39.32 years with a standard deviation of 15.9 years. Most respondents said they did not suffer from acute and chronic illness. The largest number of respondents said they use primary 'health care services, and approximately a third of them stated they use them rarely. More than 95% of respondents said they have compulsory health insurance. There is also a very large percentage of respondents who have supplementary health insurance, with more respondents paying for the insurance policy themselves, Unlike compulsory and supplementary health insurance, additional insurance is reported by less than 15% of respondents. Respondents mostly neutrally assessed the claim that healthcare quality in the Republic of Croatia, as well as in their place of residence, is at a high level, but the number of those who agreed with this claim is also significant. There is evidently a problem of public perception of the quality of health care system in the Republic of Croatia by its users. It should be noted that this is not an ideal system, but on the other hand it should be noted that it is a system which, considering all the circumstances, generally achieves positive results when it comes to its fundamental goals.","[Aleksijevic, Agneza] Vukovar Hosp, Cty Gen Hosp, Vukovar, Croatia; [Aleksijevic, Agneza] Croatian Vet Hosp, Vukovar, Croatia",,"Aleksijevic, A (通讯作者)，Vukovar Hosp, Cty Gen Hosp, Vukovar, Croatia.;Aleksijevic, A (通讯作者)，Croatian Vet Hosp, Vukovar, Croatia.",aaleksijevic@gmail.com,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,2,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,927,952,,,,,,26,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300052,0

This was done through an abundant use of analogies, including physical analogies. Given Walras's own physics envy, Winiarski felt encouraged by his elder to pursue his project in this way. This paper asks whether Winiarski's Mecanique sociale was an attempt to seriously take into account Walras's physics envy. To answer this question, we reconsider Winiarski's interpretation of Walras's general equilibrium theory, by focusing on a particular footnote found in Winiarski's writings.","[Allisson, Francois] Univ Lausanne, Ctr Walras Pareto, Batiment Geopolis, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Mueller, Thomas] Univ Paris 8 Vincennes St Denis, Led, St Denis, France",University of Lausanne,"Allisson, F (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, Ctr Walras Pareto, Batiment Geopolis, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.;Mueller, T (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 8 Vincennes St Denis, Rue Liberte, F-93526 St Denis, France.",francois.allisson@unil.ch; thomas.mueller@univ-paris8.fr,"Mueller, Thomas/ACZ-4369-2022; Mueller, Thomas/A-1740-2014","Mueller, Thomas/0000-0002-8537-3302;",,,,,53,0,0,0,3,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

We find that mortgages on properties with a highly diversified tenant base have spreads that are up to 7.1 basis points higher than spreads on mortgages for single-tenant properties, but that mortgages on properties with moderate levels of tenant diversification have spreads that are up to 5.2 basis points lower than mortgages on single-tenant properties. The spread discount for mortgages on properties with moderate levels of tenant diversification disappears when the lease of the property's largest tenant expires before the loan matures. Despite the spread discount that is given to properties with moderate levels of tenant diversification, we find that the likelihood with which a mortgage goes into default increases as tenant diversification increases.","[Ambrose, Brent] Penn State Univ, Smeal Coll Business, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Shafer, Michael] Providence Coll, Sch Business, Providence, RI 02918 USA; [Yildirim, Yildiray] Baruch Coll, Zicklin Sch Business, New York, NY 10010 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Providence College; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Baruch College (CUNY),"Ambrose, B (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Smeal Coll Business, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.;Shafer, M (通讯作者)，Providence Coll, Sch Business, Providence, RI 02918 USA.",bwa10@psu.edu; mshafer@providence.edu; Yildiray.Yildirim@baruch.cuny.edu,"Ambrose, Brent/C-8531-2017; Shafer, Michael/AFQ-9917-2022","Ambrose, Brent/0000-0001-5977-3663; Shafer, Michael/0000-0002-6942-8465",,,,,29,8,9,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The aim of the study is to analyze normative methods of estimating the construction duration, used at design and construction executive documentation developing. This aim is very important in terms of project management for selecting the most optimal methods of estimating the construction projects duration. Based on DSTU B A.3.1-22, SNiP 1.04.03-85 and DSTU B A.3.1-5, several principal methods of duration estimating were analyzed. Also, an assessment of the available methodologies accuracy and consistency was made. The study shows, that the techniques proposed in the normative literature have a number of significant drawbacks for their application in time management. The method of construction time estimating by averaged indicators, which used in Draft design, Feasibility Study, does not take into account a number of significant features of construction projects and performing organizations. Nevertheless, this technique can be used for a duration analysis in the initial stages of the project and business planning. The method of determining the construction duration, which based on the calendar plan, requires methodological refinement to the implementation of the triple constraint principle of project management. This principle allows to select the most optimal time, cost and work content and ensure the required quality of the project result with minimal resources outcomes. The obtained research results can be used by project managers when selecting methods for time management of investment and construction projects at various stages of project planning. The further research is possible to provide in the development of a method for estimating construction terms based both on the normative documents requirements and on modern project management methodology.","[Azarova, Irina] Odessa State Acad Bldg & Architecture, Odessa, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Odessa State Academy of Civil Engineering and Architecture,"Azarova, I (通讯作者)，Odessa State Acad Bldg & Architecture, Odessa, Ukraine.",azarovairene@gmail.com,"Azarova, Irina B./V-4674-2017",,,,,,14,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,23,27,,,,,,5,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540723300003,0

The new theory is a two-parameter generalization of expected utility theory. The proposed theory assumes that a decision maker: (1) behaves as if maximizing expected utility; but (2) may experience disappointment (elation) when the utility of a lottery's outcome falls short of (exceeds) the expected utility of the lottery; and (3) may have a preference for gambling (attraction/aversion to positively/negatively skewed lotteries). The proposed theory can rationalize the fourfold pattern of risk attitudes; the common ratio effect and the reverse thereof (in certain types of decision problems); the Allais paradox in classical common consequence problems and the reverse Allais paradox-in common consequence problems with an even split of a probability mass; violations of the betweenness axiom; switching behavior in the Samuelson's example; violations of ordinal, upper and lower cumulative independence (which falsify rank-dependent utility and cumulative prospect theory); and preference reversals between valuations and choice. In application to insurance, the theory can rationalize full insurance with an actuarially unfair premium and aversion to probabilistic insurance. In application to optimal portfolio investment, the theory can rationalize the equity premium puzzle.","[Blavatskyy, Pavlo] Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier Res Management, 2300 Ave Moulins, F-34185 Montpellier 4, France",Montpellier Business School,"Blavatskyy, P (通讯作者)，Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier Res Management, 2300 Ave Moulins, F-34185 Montpellier 4, France.",p.blavatskyy@montpellier-bs.com,,,,,,,75,4,4,0,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,JAN,2018,84.0,1,,,,,29,60,,10.1007/s11238-017-9629-5,0.0,,,32,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,FS3UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000419708700003,0

Data were collected from consumers who try the product. The consumers amounting to 60 people were required to fill the questioner (40 students of UMY, 10 Lecturers, and 10 staffs).On the basis of the research, it is revealed that pizza consumers are most likely to choose D substitution (80 % sweet potatoes 20% wheat), brownies consumers mostly prefers C substitution (60% sweet potatoes 40% wheat), and bread consumers mostly prefer on C substitution (60% sweet potatoes 40% wheat). This result is based on consumer preferences. This preference may be referred substance for the producer to release their product. Producing D substitution of pizza (80% sweet potatoes 20% wheat) can earn a profit of 72,1 %. For C substitution of brownies (60% sweet potatoes 40%w wheat) the profit is 95,4%.

Recently, however, observers note that debt relief might also induce irresponsible behavior by creditor governments. A collective action problem might exist, where creditor governments target new loans to developing countries that just received debt relief from a different creditor. I investigate if debt relief affects decisions by creditor governments to provide new loans. Additionally, I analyze which types of creditor governments are more likely to lend to recipients of debt relief. I find that China and other emerging creditors are not more likely to lend to recipients of debt relief than western creditor governments. Instead, creditor governments of smaller economies are more likely than those of larger economies to free-ride on debt relief provided by other lenders. If states lend to gain influence, larger lenders will typically crowd out smaller creditors. However, if a debtor state just received debt relief and is therefore viewed as a greater risk, small creditors may see an opportunity to gain influence by providing a loan that no other state wants to provide.","[Bunte, Jonas B.] Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Sci, Polit Econ, Richardson, TX 75083 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas,"Bunte, JB (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Sci, Polit Econ, Richardson, TX 75083 USA.",bunte@utdallas.edu,,,,,,,56,7,7,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

In addition to cultural and historical heritage, Rijeka prides itself on its rich industrial heritage that needs to be valorised, preserved, transformed, and incorporated in the tourist off er of the city. Nowadays, this destination is at a specific developmental turning point and its inhabitants are aware of the opportunities that high-quality and planned tourism development might bring. Apart from meeting the needs of tourists, tourism development must at the same time meet ever more complex needs of the domicile population and have a positive impact on the quality of their lives. Furthermore, in the planning of tourism development in a destination, it has become common practice to determine the attitudes of the local population towards its development. Where tourism is not supported, population's resistance to such investments is to be expected. On the other hand, hospitable hosts are one of the key factors in the forming of overall satisfaction with the visit, by which they indirectly contribute to word-of-mouth advertising and encourage revisiting. In view of the above, this paper presents the research conducted by a survey on the attitudes of the local community regarding tourism development in the city of Rijeka. This analysis of the conducted research provides an opportunity to discover the strongest positive and negative impacts of the level of tourism development on the quality of life in the destination of Rijeka.","[Delmo Smajlovic, Dina] Fac Econ, Osijek, Croatia",,"Delmo Smajlovic, D (通讯作者)，Fac Econ, Osijek, Croatia.",ddelmosmajl@gmail.com,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,1,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,208,227,,,,,,20,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300012,0

As a result of the research it was found that learning and development is the process in which gamification is mostly used in Latvian enterprises. Conclusion is that here are differences between industries and those show that in trading organisation gamification is used mostly in recruitment and onboarding and reward and recognition processes. At the same time differences between sectors show that local government and non-governmental organisations and associations use gamification more in learning and development process, as it is in private sector organisations. It was also identified that gamification in HR is used more in larger organizations. Research builds a solid base for further investigation of the impact of gamification within Human Resource management processes on employee satisfaction and engagement, as well as provides insight into the current trends in the field of Human Resource Management in Latvia.

In this paper, we estimate Okun's coefficients separately for each U.S. state using an unobserved components framework and find variation of the coefficients across states. We exploit this heterogeneity of Okun's coefficients to directly examine the potential factors that shape Okun's law, and find that indicators of more flexible labor markets (higher levels of education achievement in the population, lower rate of unionization, and a higher share of non-manufacturing employment) are important determinants of the differences in Okun's coefficient across states.","[Guisinger, Amy Y.] Lafayette Coll, Dept Econ, Easton, PA 18042 USA; [Hernandez-Murillo, Ruben] Fed Reserve Bank Cleveland, Cleveland, OH 44114 USA; [Owyang, Michael T.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Res Div, St Louis, MO USA; [Sinclair, Tara M.] George Washington Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20052 USA",Lafayette College; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Cleveland; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; George Washington University,"Guisinger, AY (通讯作者)，Lafayette Coll, Dept Econ, Easton, PA 18042 USA.",guisinga@lafayette.edu,"Hernandez-Murillo, Ruben/P-4834-2018; Owyang, Michael T/I-5750-2016; Sinclair, Tara M/I-2772-2019","Owyang, Michael T/0000-0002-2109-3432; Sinclair, Tara M/0000-0002-1990-3264",Institute for International Economic Policy (IIEP),Institute for International Economic Policy (IIEP),"Diana A.

Nowadays the trend of digitalization captures all areas of life especially in business, also the management task of decision making. This leads to the question, how relevant is digitalization for decision making in organizations. Triggered by digitalization, organizations will move toward an autonomous decision making of machines or cyber systems. The important step toward autonomous decisions or decision support (cyber systems will prepare a decision, but finally executed by humans) is an ongoing trend in decision making. Algorithmic models for these decisions will use the content of classical decision models to reach maximum utility. Hence a view on classical theories of decision making will illuminate the basis for these models, from researchers like Bernoulli, Fermat or von Neumann & Morgenstern. Furthermore digitalization changes the process of decision making, especially focussing on the behavioural part of decisions, discussed from Simon, Selten or Kahneman & Tversky, because the human aspect of decision making is relevant, in organizations and research. The research methods for this paper had been secondary research to shed a light on the theoretical concepts of decision making and digitalization. In the next step, to understand the relevance of digitalization on decision making, a qualitative empiric research was done and the tool was a structured professional interview. The idea of these interviews had been, to get the view of senior managers and executives on the impact of digital decision making in organizations including the related influencing factors. As a result from this qualitative empiric research, high attendance of top management for digitalization of decision making is given. They rate the relevance of the topic quite high, but the readiness in their organization for digital decision making is still lacking. Finally a positive feedback for digital decision making was given, with a plan to improve the set up of digital decisions in the future.","[Hossfeld, Steffen] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Hossfeld, S (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,4,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-344-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,246,257,,,,,,12,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP0MG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000535358500023,0

Producer prices indices, consumer price indices, input prices indices and quantity indices were constructed using the data for the period 1990-91 to 2008-09. The domestic terms of trade of agriculture sector has been improved in terms of both approaches i.e. the ratio of producer prices indices to consumer prices indices and the real per capita income approach. However, the cross province estimates indicated that the terms of trade also improved for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh and Punjab while Balochistan's domestic terms of trade deteriorated drastically. Using the input prices, the domestic terms of trade deteriorated for Pakistan as a whole and its provinces as well. This also explores that as a whole the profitability of the farmers reduced during the study period. Further, the standard of living of the farmers improved but their profitability reduced, which indicates that the farmers utilize some other sources of income for their livelihood. The study supports to give subsidies on farm inputs so as to improve the profitability of the farmers.","[Hussain, Anwar] Pakistan Inst Dev Econ PIDE, POB 1091, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan",,"Hussain, A (通讯作者)，Pakistan Inst Dev Econ PIDE, POB 1091, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan.",anwar@pide.org.pk,"Hussain, Anwar/IST-0809-2023","Hussain, Anwar/0000-0001-7131-1613",,,,,37,8,8,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,1,14,,,,,,14,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540718700001,0

In current debates, the paradigm of transmission is the most powerful and most visible one - albeit it is not entirely exclusive among veterinarians and other involved professionals. The logic behind this view is a kind of a management of 'natural processes' that focuses more or less exclusively on the avoidance of transmission of pathogens. Within this frame, human or animal bodies and pathogens are conceived of as separate objects. To prevent transmission (for the sake of animal health, public health or economic constraints as differentially accepted justifications) one can use medication, vaccination, keeping conditions with maximized biosecurity, and - regularly, though controversial - culling. However, a shift in perspectives is possible. The concept of 'entangled health' enables us to reconsider zoonosis and epidemics as phenomena emerging from particular configurations of coexistence as introduced e.g. by the actor-network--theory in Latour. Hence, different notions of health and alternative possibilities for prevention and combatting diseases become more visible. The paper focuses particularly on two central issues: First, health and disease are understood as inevitably conditioned by various contexts. The ordinary conceptualization of health in veterinary medicine widely ignores sociocultural contingency and the dependency on the particular constellation of people, animals, and pathogens. Second, this leads to the possible recognition of a particular disease as an outcome of intensive animal use with tight profit margins particularly in industrial farming contexts. Animals are immuno-compromised by accelerated growth rates, by stress due to housing conditions, and by the lack of ordinary confrontation with pathogens to develop a 'normal' immune system. Moreover, mass culling as supposedly necessary measure to fight e.g. food-and-mouth disease (not a zoonosis, thus done for economic reasons) becomes open for criticism because this view is also an outcome of specific conditions of human-animal relations.","[Huth, M.] Messerli Res Inst, Unit Eth & Human Anim Studies, Vet Pl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria",University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna,"Huth, M (通讯作者)，Messerli Res Inst, Unit Eth & Human Anim Studies, Vet Pl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria.",martin.huth@vetmeduni.ac.at,,"Huth, Martin/0000-0001-8518-984X",,,,,16,0,0,0,4,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,272,277,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_42,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000042,0

Respondents were chosen using simple random sampling and the total number of respondents is 60 farmers consisting of 30 calcareous land farmers and 30 farmers of rain fed land, both are active members of the farmers group. The results show that the total cost of cassava farming of rain fed land is higher than that in the calcareous land. However, the income and profit in cassava farming are higher in the calcareous land than that of rain-fed land. Overall, cassava farming in the rain-fed and calcareous land is feasible to develop. Furthermore, the study finds out that the farmers rain-fed lands are constrained by higher cost, but low prices of the products, while the farmers in the calcareous lands are challenged by the heavy rainfall, damaging the cassava plantation.

This special issue addresses two important questions about the compatibility of diverse growth models within the European Union (EU): Are some growth regimes better suited to European integration than others? and does the EU favour a particular constellation of domestic institutions? Contributions within this special issue provide a qualified yes to these questions, concluding that the EU favours export-led growth models whilst it penalises and discourages domestic consumption-oriented growth paths, particularly those that are financed by debt accumulation. While recent comparative capitalism literature highlights that European monetary integration has favoured export-led growth regimes, contributions in this special issue outline that the EU's prioritisation of export-led growth over domestic demand-led growth is present in other facets of integration, including EU accession, financial integration, the free movement of people, fiscal governance and the Europe 2020 growth strategy. Findings here provide important insights for both the European integration and comparative capitalism literature, highlighting that the unique economic ties being forged within the European project may be problematic for those countries outside northwestern Europe and for workers in low-wage domestic sectors.","[Johnston, Alison] Oregon State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Bexell Hall 339, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Regan, Aidan] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Dublin, Ireland",Oregon State University; University College Dublin,"Johnston, A (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Bexell Hall 339, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",alison.johnston@oregonstate.edu,,"Regan, Aidan/0000-0001-7558-730X",,,,,87,52,54,2,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Our findings show, firstly, that the husband's and wife's stated preferences regarding school choice do not differ markedly. Secondly, the results obtained for the revealed preferences deviate from the stated preferences for some school characteristics. Finally, we find that neither the husband's nor the wife's preferences prevail in the actual joint school choice decision.","[Mariel, Petr] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Dept Appl Econ Economet & Stat 3, Avda Lehendakari Aguirre 83, E-48015 Bilbao, Spain; [Scarpa, Riccardo] Univ Durham, Business Sch, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England; [Scarpa, Riccardo] Univ Verona, Dept Business Econ, Verona, Italy; [Scarpa, Riccardo] Univ Waikato, Waikato Management Sch, Dept Econ, Waikato, New Zealand; [Vega-Bayo, Ainhoa] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Dept Fdn Econ Anal 2, Avda Lehendakari Aguirre 83, E-48015 Bilbao, Spain",University of Basque Country; Durham University; University of Verona; University of Waikato; University of Basque Country,"Mariel, P (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Dept Appl Econ Economet & Stat 3, Avda Lehendakari Aguirre 83, E-48015 Bilbao, Spain.",petr.mariel@ehu.eus; riccardo.scarpa@durham.ac.uk; ainhoa.vega@ehu.eus,"Scarpa, Riccardo/C-6691-2009; Vega-Bayo, Ainhoa/ABF-8649-2020; Mariel, Petr/K-8399-2014","Vega-Bayo, Ainhoa/0000-0002-3605-556X;","Department of the Environment of the Basque Government; Department of Education of the Basque Government [UPV/EHU Econometrics Research Group] [IT-642-13]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2014-52587-R, ECO2015-64467-R]; Basque Government",Department of the Environment of the Basque Government; Department of Education of the Basque Government [UPV/EHU Econometrics Research Group]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Basque Government(Basque Government),"This work was supported by the Department of the Environment of the Basque Government and the Department of Education of the Basque Government [Grant IT-642-13; UPV/EHU Econometrics Research Group] and the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [Grants ECO2014-52587-R and ECO2015-64467-R].

The indebtedness of hospitals is one of the major problems to be solved by public administration. Hospitals as autonomous healthcare units are public units and are not subject to market mechanisms. Legal regulations widely determine their independence but limit responsibility for its implementation, which leads to their uncontrolled indebtedness. That indebtedness adversely affects not only the development of healthcare but also quality of provided medical services. Constant indebtedness of the units creates a need for finding its determinants. The aim of the research is an attempt to define some factors which determine indebtedness of public healthcare units (hospitals) in Poland. The study will cover units with a similar and thus comparable profile. The study was conducted between years 2007 - 2015 with help of econometric modeling. It should be stressed that the level of indebtedness of healthcare units, and at the same time, the efficiency of their performance vary. Based on preliminary research on determinants of indebtedness there should be mentioned the following most crucial factors: hiring medical personnel, average remuneration, bed occupancy, average stay in hospital, average number of patients per bed, days of treatment per person, founders.","[Miszczynska, Katarzyna M.] Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, Dept Publ Finance, Narutowicza 68, PL-90136 Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Miszczynska, KM (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, Dept Publ Finance, Narutowicza 68, PL-90136 Lodz, Poland.",katarzyna.miszczynska@uni.lodz.pl,,"Miszczynska, Katarzyna/0000-0003-4924-7605",National Science Centre [DEC-2016/23/N/HS4/03410],"National Science Centre(National Science Centre, Poland)","This article is an output from the research project Multicriteria assessment of efficiency of public hospitals in Poland and identification of determinants of their indebtedness financed by the National Science Centre, decision number DEC-2016/23/N/HS4/03410",,21,3,3,0,1,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8980-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,420,426,,,,,,7,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BM4AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000462948800054,0

The lack of respect of these fundamental principles led to the creation of an European judicial practice but also to the adjustment of the European and national legislation in this matter, and here is the reason why I undertook a synthetic analysis of the main regulations and of the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice, study that led to a series of conclusions. The whole analysis makes us appreciate that this subject is an open one and it can lead towards new evolutions that might be embodied in other European or national regulations in this matter.

The review of national health models of the EU countries shows a rather wide range of possible approaches to financing, organising and providing medical care. While expectations related to health care systems are growing, and cost justification is constantly being questioned, governments need to find the answer to the cardinal question: what is the most appropriate way to finance our health care? As a rule, not one country has only one net source of income. Historically, most countries in Europe have developed primary financing systems of health care, either from the budget or through health insurance. To a greater or lesser extent, the primary health financing system is being developed in the presence of other forms. Currently, all existing health systems are reduced to three main economic models. These are: paid medicine, based on market principles using private health insurance, state medicine with a budgetary financing system and a health system based on the principles of social insurance and market regulation with a multi-channel financing system. It is interesting to note that the principles of insurance medicine in most countries of the world still dominate both completely private and fully public funding. The corpus of data on the impact of various methods of financing is growing. The present study explores ways to mobilise revenues and the consequences of choosing a funding mechanism or a combination of mechanisms. Different mechanisms are evaluated on the basis of various criteria, one of which is the impact on social justice. Do we want to put a paying heavy burden on the poor and the sick? Existing evidence suggests that the mobilisation of revenues for health market mechanisms are limited. Privatisation can lead to the violation of the principles of social justice and equal access to services: private health insurance is very regressive, and user charges are a gross political tool. The purpose of our study is to analyze the nature and characteristics of the market for private (voluntary) health insurance in the European Union in terms of market structure and financing functions.","[Plotnic, Olesea] Moldova State Univ, Kishinev, Moldova; [Ciochina, Elena] Acad Econ Studies Moldova, Kishinev, Moldova",Moldova State University; Academy of Economic Studies of Moldova,"Plotnic, O (通讯作者)，Moldova State Univ, Kishinev, Moldova.",plotnicolesea.aum@gmail.com; ciochina.elena.law@gmail.com,"Ciochina, Elena/HLQ-2304-2023","Ciochina, Elena/0000-0001-7852-8567",,,,,16,0,0,0,3,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-492-5,,,,2018,,,,,,,257,272,,,,,,16,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL8FU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000456271700019,0

In the context of world hunger, poverty and rapid population growth, forecasted to 10 billion people by 2050, molecular gastronomy' s next trend, 'Note by Note cooking', come up with the solution of using pure chemical compounds rather than animal or plant tissues for designing new foods, but still trying to create the same taste, consistency, colour or trigeminal sensation. The approach is still in its infancy, but it gives specific examples of its sustainability. However, this new way of designing foods faces the 'food neophobia' of people worried about the safety aspects, nutrition, toxicology and economics. Therefore, this paper will focus on ethical questions that should be addressed: What compounds can be used? Is it sure that they aren' t harmful? What are the implications for traditional cooking?

The aim of the current paper was to identify the mode of behaviour of Latvians in respect of their mandatory pension savings in mandatory state funded pension pillar. The paper provides the analysis of the responses given by the participants of the survey conducted in spring 2016. The research methods include analysis of scientific publications and analysis of primary and secondary statistical data using descriptive statistics, Kruskal-Wallis test, chi(2) test, and correlation analysis. The survey revealed, that 76.8% of those respondents who claim to have participated in pillar II pension funds do not control the profitability of their pension plans, and 67.8% of those who control do it less than once per year. The analysis shows no difference in answers of Latvians and non-Latvians, men and women, having and not-having minor children. There are statistically significant differences between respondents from different regions, of different educational and income levels, age, working in public and private sector. The respondents' answers correlate with their locus of control and ability to critically assess the information. The decisions concerning pillar II savings made by pension plan participants are mainly influenced by advertising, rather than rational thinking. Low interest demonstrated by the population to the performance of state funded pension plans demotivates fund managers from competition and undermines the future adequacy of pensions. Improving financial literacy in the field of pensions is needed to enable people make informed choice of financial services for their future wellbeing.","[Rajevska, Olga] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Rajevska, O (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,"Rajevska, Olga/I-1390-2016",,Post-Doc Latvia Project [1.1.1.2/VIAA/1/1 6/056],Post-Doc Latvia Project,This paper has been prepared with the support from the Post-Doc Latvia Project No. 1.1.1.2/VIAA/1/1 6/056.,,13,0,0,0,0,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-344-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,540,548,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP0MG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000535358500050,0

A refined inventory of financial system change - including new meso-level data on finance pattern and the marketisation of banking - reveals a varied pattern of change across German finance. It is argued that this financial diversification can only be understood with careful reference to the underlying ideational factors. An analytical narrative traces how technocratic ideas of financial modernisation during the 1980s began to open up space for the political program of finance capitalism to absorb liberal and leftist discontents with insider control and bank dominance. Upon reaching a tipping point of discursive dominance, the program was distinctly adopted across the political economy as the result of compartmentally different political, ideational and structural factors; creating a non-hegemonic financial paradigm that became identifiable in the face of recent crises. By developing analytical steps that link incremental and dynamic theories of institutional change in a conceptual framework of belief shifts, the paper contributes to efforts of adapting existing models of change to complex domains and accounting for the dynamic nature of the paradigm-generating process. The findings inform the larger debate about internal capitalist diversity and the coherence of national economic models.","[Roper, Nils] Univ Oxford, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Röper, N (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Oxford, England.",nils.roeper@gmail.com,,,,,,,130,16,16,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The meat paradox describes the tension of loving animals and at the same time loving meat. It concerns consumers and producers alike (Loughnan et al., 2012). Psychologically, it can be described as a cognitive dissonance often resulting in an unease about eating former living beings one usually cares about. One possibility for overcoming this is the objectification of animals, i.e. turning subjects into objects by denying them certain characteristics. This alleviates the dissonance, as the animals no longer have to be ethically considered. The paper sets out a philosophical conception of the objectification of animals used for meat production. After generally illuminating the meat paradox and the issue of objectification, Nussbaum's (1995) seven signposts of human objectification in pornography are transferred to the animal context resulting in four distinct indicators of objectifying treatment of animals: denial of being an end in itself, denial of preference autonomy, denial of individuality, and denial of sentience. Examples of pork production in Western industrialised countries show that objectification of animals is a socially established practice that is directly and indirectly requested from professionals working in the agricultural context. Finally, a definition of objectification of animals used for meat production will be provided, representing a starting point for answering ethical questions about the treatment of animals (as objects) and the associated responsibilities of consumers and producers.","[Schlemmer, M-T; Grimm, H.; Benz-Schwarzburg, J.] Messerli Res Inst, Unit Eth & Human Anim Studies, Vet Pl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria",University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna,"Schlemmer, MT (通讯作者)，Messerli Res Inst, Unit Eth & Human Anim Studies, Vet Pl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria.",resi@schlema.com,,,,,,,13,1,1,0,8,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,129,133,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_18,0.0,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000018,0

By joining the European Union, Croatia has opened up a wide range of financial possibilities in terms of funding from European funds and financing projects through cohesion policy instruments, Structural funds are financial instruments aimed at achieving economic and social cohesion in a single European market. Areas that can be financed by these instruments are defined by operational programs or programming documents. Four thematic units have been set for the period 2014-2020: Strengthening economic competitiveness, encouraging employment and strengthening the education system, preserving the environment and natural resources, and strengthening administrative capacity, and involving civil society more effectively, These priorities point to the necessary reforms to effectively address the difficulties Croatia faces. Croatia's prospects for a revival of inclusive growth are limited without further reforms in order to re-establish macroeconomic stability, boost productivity, invest in people, and modernize public services. In the new financial period 2014-2020, a total of FUR 10,7 billion of funds from the European Structural and Investment Funds are available to Croatia. Of this, 8,43 billion for cohesion policy goals, 2 billion for agriculture and rural development, and 250 million for fisheries development. This is roughly equivalent to 3.3% of GDP per annum, and according to the European Commission estimates, about 73% of the expected national public investment in the areas within which the funds are intended. It is of paramount importance to use this financial potential and to use it because it can have a strong impact on economic growth in the coming years. The use of EU funds mentioned above has broad development implications and requires, primarily, a profound change in the current philosophy of development management. It is necessary to define the short-term and long-term goals of the EU funds better, and attention should be paid to capital objectives, as the new program period would not re-establish the situation of reduced intensity of use of resources that can greatly affect the development of the Croatian economy.","[Staresinic, Zrinka] Hrvatske Sume Doo, Zagreb, Croatia; [Franic, Mia Duska] Minist Poljoprivrede, Zagreb, Croatia",,"Staresinic, Z (通讯作者)，Hrvatske Sume Doo, Zagreb, Croatia.",zrstaresinic@gmail.com; mia.franic@mps.hr,,,,,,,4,1,1,0,2,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,1489,1503,,,,,,15,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300081,0

The qualitative indicators (soft - facts) have different wage in the considered rating systems, although in all of them the wage is lower than 50% and / or the ability of soft-facts to change the overall rating score is limited. On the other hand, in all cases the importance of qualitative factors is significant enough to pay attention to them. The research is focused on the rating of business entities, more precisely the corporate, (especially limited liability companies or joint-stock companies). It does not deal with the rating of natural persons or non-profit organizations, municipalities etc. The procedure of collecting empirical data as well as data from relevant literature, their assessment according to the criteria of verifiability and relevance and the application of the induction method was used and a generalization of conclusions was subsequently made. The result of the research shows that two categories of qualitative indicators (soft facts) are present in all considered rating systems: (i) quality of company's management and / or strategy and (ii) market, where the evaluated company is present. Another regularly present qualitative indicator is (iii) accounting or related indicators like information system or audit quality. On the other hand, the use of the factor (iv) relationship with the bank (or similar) is quite different across the surveyed rating systems. The roles of members of staff in making of the rating are also mentioned.","[Svitil, Martin] Soukroma Vysoka Skola Ekon Znojmo, Loucks 656-21, Znojmo 66902, Czech Republic",,"Svítil, M (通讯作者)，Soukroma Vysoka Skola Ekon Znojmo, Loucks 656-21, Znojmo 66902, Czech Republic.",svitil.martin@syse.cz,"Svitil, Martin/HCH-1927-2022","Svitil, Martin/0000-0002-8833-7198",,,,,10,0,0,0,2,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8980-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,725,732,,,,,,8,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BM4AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000462948800092,0

According to Western unemployment theories, some inspirations for helping university graduates' employment are obtained: setting majors and courses reasonably, increasing rural investment, attaching importance to the role of the government in labor and employment and the significance of human capital investment. We hope that with the supporting materials in this paper, students can apply suitable professional courses according to reasonable time arrangements during their college life, and make different types of career planning in different grades.

On the one hand, a modern higher education institution should be stable in its individuality and educational strategies, and on the other hand, open to constant changes.

In the paradigm of solving this problem, the idea of managing education and knowledge becomes actual, namely, the idea of prudence and providence concerning the use of educational process opportunities of a higher technical educational institution on the basis of lean-education. Innovativeness as the dominant principle of the pedagogical system of a higher technical educational institution reflects the results of applying the best world achievements. The pre-condition for productivity of its implementation in current complex socio-economic conditions is the correspondence of the personal and professional level of modern teachers at higher educational institutions to the requirements of time. The use of lean-thinking using the means of a higher educational institution actualizes the educational resources of a technical higher educational institution in general and its teachers in particular, promotes the transformation of knowledge and actions into result, gradually reduces losses at all stages of creating educational values, and, as a result, raises its competitiveness. The integration of lean-thinking in Ukrainian higher technical education will help to determine the ways of forming social vectors for the synthesis of pedagogical and technical education. Thus, there is a need to rethink the goals and essence of the activities of modern teachers of higher technical educational institutions and their monitoring as a content core of activities on the basis of prudence and providence as to the use of possibilities of educational process of a higher technical educational institution. That is why the lean use of resources of a higher technical educational institution in implementation of the experimental lean-technology of occupational training of future specialists is specified and the pedagogical practicability of the advanced training of future specialists is proved in the research.

Globalization as a systemic geoeconomic and geopolitical phenomenon leads to increased risks for Ukraine considering its inadequate competitiveness, and therefore the search of a vector for own path of development, an effective management format for the domestic economy is the guarantee for successful integration into the global economy. Education, considered as an element of the innovation economy, plays a fundamental role in preparing the intellectual resources of the country not only for producers, but also for the social sphere, that is the role of education extends beyond the triad: education, science and production. The economic success of development of a higher educational institution depends directly on its competitiveness in the education market, on the chosen development strategy, the diversification of commercial efforts - all areas of activities specific to the brand of a higher educational institution. Brand in the field of education is the guarantee of quality of an educational service or a scientific product obtained, its reputation, image, associations that arise in the minds of people when they see the attributes of an educational institution. The brand in current environment is also a part of all the processes in activities of the higher educational institution, and such marketing communication tools as advertising, public relations, introduction of educational start-ups, educational fairs or conferences, training seminars, trainings, coaching intensities, direct mailing, supporting materials, etc. play an important role in the educational and informational brand of a higher educational institution. Considering these tools as brand translators is a good way to understand their role. They allow to transfer the educational drivers of a higher educational institution. The process of creation and promotion of brands of higher educational institutions corresponds to the modern market conditions of development of society, which have inherent characteristics such as globalization and chaotic nature. In such conditions, the brand has certain advantages which enable it to remain competitive and to achieve commercial success. However, modern educational modernizations do not always contribute to the rapid response of higher educational institutions to numerous changes. From an organizational point of view, branding is a set of consistent measures aimed at creating a holistic and consumer-friendly image of a higher educational institution, whose algorithmization allows to visualize this process and to simplify the construction of the brand as much as possible. Consequently, all integration processes of higher education are aimed at getting out of a tight framework taken as a start. Nowadays the integrated educational branding is offered as an ideological adjustment for educational marketing.","[Yermakova, Svitlana] Odessa State Acad Civil Engn & Architecture, Odessa, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Odessa State Academy of Civil Engineering and Architecture,"Yermakova, S (通讯作者)，Odessa State Acad Civil Engn & Architecture, Odessa, Ukraine.",ermakova.s2011@yandex.ua,"Єрмакова, Світлана/AAK-2852-2021","Єрмакова, Світлана/0000-0001-9524-518X",,,,,16,0,0,0,4,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,269,278,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540723300032,0

Producing more energy while reducing greenhouse gasses is a difficult task for many countries. It is because of challenges finding the best long-term solution to meet people's expectations and to reduce the development of global warming and the adverse effects. In order to achieve the goals of European Union regarding the share of renewable energy sources in final energy consumption, countries are forced to increase their green energy potential by integrating renewable energy sources into urban environment. The aim of the research is to study the future perspectives of the energy sector and possible consequences, focusing on the territory of Latvia. Authors use umbrella review, literature review and state-of-the-art review to explore the renewable energy potential of Latvia. It mainly relies on the development of biomass and biogas. Research considers possible integration of nuclear energy into Latvia, but results of the survey reflect negative public opinion on nuclear energy, giving priority to renewable energy sources. Authors, using the specialized program 'ARGOS', made predictions about the consequences of a nuclear accident, assuming that there is a leak of radioactive substances from one of the nuclear power plants close to Latvia, located either in Sweden, Finland or Russia. In these cases main preventive measures such as taking Iodine pills, staying indoors and following the information from media are considered.","[Zvirgzdins, Janis; Senfelde, Maija; Plotka, Kaspars] Riga Tech Univ, Riga, Latvia",Riga Technical University,"Zvirgzdins, J (通讯作者)，Riga Tech Univ, Riga, Latvia.",,,"Zvirgzdins, Janis/0000-0001-6677-0145",,,,,26,0,0,0,11,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-344-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,825,835,,,,,,11,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP0MG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000535358500076,0

This paper undertakes a correlation analysis of risk premia to investigate the nature and extent of contagion from these crises to other selected Eurozone countries. A commonly expressed view is that the effects of the second crisis were more muted since the systemic risks were seen by markets as being lower. However, using a rolling correlation model, a Dynamic Conditional Correlation GARCH (DCC-GARCH) model and a t-copula model we find that this is not the case.

Such impacts include sea level rise, coastal and riverine flooding resulting from more frequent and intense precipitation events, storms, storm surges and other extreme events. For this purpose, numerical experiments utilizing stochastic optimization based methodologies were conducted on a case study of the Washington, D.C. Greater Metropolitan area proximate to the Potomac River under varying climatic predictions. Results from the numerical experiments suggest a 54% reduction in added costs due to the implementation of chosen protective infrastructure investments. They also indicate a reduction in added costs (capital investment and added delays) on the order of 19% when the investments are chosen to hedge against probable future flooding events as compared with planning for the 50th percentile SLR prediction with associated weather events. A potential gain of nearly 27% in reduced costs through improved predictive accuracy in climatic forecasts is also noted, suggesting significant value in more accurate forecasts.","[Asadabadi, Ali; Miller-Hooks, Elise] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,"Miller-Hooks, E (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",miller@gmu.edu,"Asadabadi, Ali/Y-8115-2019",,"University of Maryland's National University Transportation Center, a U.S. Department of Transportation","University of Maryland's National University Transportation Center, a U.S. Department of Transportation","This work was funded by the University of Maryland's National University Transportation Center, a U.S. Department of Transportation funded center.

The paper focuses on the commuting trips that are long enough to be served by more than one transit services (local and regional transit services) in the GTHA (hence denoted by cross-regional commuting). This type of trips represents a unique travel market for which multimodal transportation services compete with each other. The study uses a dataset collected by a purposely designed SP pivoted on RP choices of cross-regional commuters in the GTHA. An advanced RP-SP model structure is specified to enhance parameter estimation from the SP choices by explicitly capturing the correlations between the SP choices and corresponding elicited confidence ratings. The econometric model also accounts for serial correlations between SP choices of the same respondents as well as inertia effects between RP and SP choices. The estimated choice model is used to predict the effectiveness of different strategies on commuting mode choice behaviour of cross-regional commuters. The results of the empirical investigation revealed many behavioural details such as the effect of eliminating co-fare between local and regional transit services and providing Wi-Fi on regional transit vehicles on increasing the share of regional transit modes. It is found that monetizing park and ride at transit stations will deter some individuals from using transit, however, this strategy can be considered as a way to manage the increasing parking demand at regional transit stations and to improve the access time of park and ride users.","[Rashedi, Zohreh; Mahmoud, Mohamed; Hasnine, Sami; Habib, Khandker Nurul] Univ Toronto, Dept Civil Engn, 35 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 1A4, Canada",University of Toronto,"Habib, KN (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Civil Engn, 35 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 1A4, Canada.",zohreh.rashredi@mail.utoronto.ca; mohamed.mahmoud@mail.utoronto.ca; sami.hasnine@mail.utoronto.ca; khandker.nurulhabib@utoronto.ca,,"Hasnine, Md Sami/0000-0003-4110-5047",NSERC; MEDI,NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); MEDI,"This research was funded by an NSERC Discovery Grant and an Early Researcher Award from MEDI.

Over a prolonged period of time, populations that were genetically far from Europeans and had extreme levels of genetic diversity (e.g. in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Americas) adapted to environments that were significantly different from the climatic conditions of continental Europe. This resulted in a divergence in populations' resistance to infectious diseases and positive relationships between European settler mortality at the time of colonization, genetic distance to the technological frontier, and genetic diversity. I evaluate the consequences of the aforementioned relationships first, for the role of genetic distance and diversity in development (e.g. Spolaore and Wacziarg, 2009; Ashraf and Galor, 2013), and second, for studies that use European settler mortality as an instrument for institutions (e.g. Acemoglu et al., 2001). The results highlight a potential bias in the estimates of the effect of genetic distance and diversity on contemporary development in a sample of former colonies and suggest that the effect of these measures on current economic and institutional outcomes is indirect and works through Europeans' colonial policies.

I find that for whites and Hispanics the effect of BMI is generally decreasing across the wage distribution; at the .9 quantile of the wage distribution, a two standard deviation increase in BMI reduces wages by 8% for white males, 13% for white females, 9% for Hispanic males, and 16% for Hispanic females. Conversely, at the .1 quantile, a two standard deviation increase in BMI affects wages by less than 2% for all these groups. For black males, the effect of BMI is positive, and either increasing or non-linear in wages. For black females, the estimates tend to be more uniform across the wage distribution. I discuss possible explanations for these inter-quantile differences including preference discrimination, productivity differences, and statistical discrimination. The results point to a new explanation for the observed correlation between socioeconomic status and body weight: individuals with higher income earning potential have differential incentives to maintain a lower BMI.

We show that each aspect of the Fed's structure reflected the preferences of national banks, including adjustments to district boundaries after 1914. Further, using newly collected data on interbank connections, we find that banker preferences mirrored established correspondent relationships.

We show how to implement classical identification schemes based on long-run restrictions in the case of large panels. The importance of the error correction mechanism for impulse response analysis is analyzed by means of both empirical examples and simulation experiments. Our results show that the bias in estimated impulse responses in a factor-augmented vector autoregressive (FAVAR) model is positively related to the strength of the error correction mechanism and the cross-section dimension of the panel.

Using panel data on golf demand (number of golf players) and supply (number of courses), and indicators of the economic situation for 15 European countries, encompassing years 2000 through 2014, we estimate a dynamic panel data model in order to evaluate the influence of the economic conditions and golf supply on the number of registered golfers. Economic situation is assessed through two variables: the gross domestic product (GDP) and the main stock market index of each country. We also test the hypothesis of uneven effects of the GDP before and after the beginning of the economic recession. The most crucial finding is that from the start of the financial crisis, the level of GDP imposes statistically significant effect on golf demand, making those countries with higher GDP per capita the ones whose golf demand is harmed the least by the financial crisis. The number of golf players responds to the state of the economy after the start of the economic downturns, while the high persistence of the golf demand makes it rather difficult to find significant differences in the changes in GDP before the recession. We also find that the number of golf courses is not seen to bear a close relationship with the number of players unless we control for economic factors and business cycle. Within the economic factors, the level of development of a country, as measured by GDP per capita, outweighs stock market role in determining the demand for golf.","[Barcena-Martin, E.; Rodriguez-Fernandez, M.] Univ Malaga, Malaga, Spain; [Borrego-Dominguez, S.] Publ Co Tourism & Sport Management Andalusia, Andalucia, Spain",Universidad de Malaga,"Bárcena-Martín, E (通讯作者)，Univ Malaga, Dept Appl Econ Stat & Econometr, Campus EI Ejido, E-29071 Malaga, Spain.",barcenae@uma.es,"Barcena-Martin, Elena/J-4833-2013; Rodriguez-Fernandez, Mercedes/B-5227-2008; liu, ting/AAA-1112-2022","Barcena-Martin, Elena/0000-0002-6381-7507; Rodriguez-Fernandez, Mercedes/0000-0003-4476-5331;",,,,,57,4,5,0,33,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

It is well known that sanctions impose a cost on their targets as well as on the senders, as lamented by European governments, but the costs of EU sanctions on its members have not been fully explored. This article intends to fill this gap by looking at the cost of EU sanctions on Russia. Who is bearing the cost among EU countries? This article argues that sanctions had a redistributive impact across the EU. Whereas exports fell for all countries, with Germany, Italy and Finland in the leading positions, the article shows that there are economic sectors that increased their exports to Russia after the imposition of sanctions, which occurred particularly in countries as Greece, Sweden, Luxembourg and Bulgaria.

Empirical research on neighborhood change, however, has not produced any conclusive evidence that incumbent residents are systematically displaced under circumstances of gentrification. This raises the question, do these incumbent residents benefit from the economic and social changes that accompany gentrification? In this paper, we focus on low-income neighborhoods undergoing economic transitions (i.e. gentrification) and test whether or not the potential benefits from these changes stay within the community, in the form of employment opportunities for local residents. We find that employment effects from gentrification are quite localized. Incumbent residents experience meaningful job losses within their home census tract, even while jobs overall increase. In our preferred model, local jobs decline by as much as 63 percent. These job losses are concentrated in service and goods-producing sectors and low- and moderate-wage positions. Proximate job losses, however, are compensated for by larger gains in goods-producing and low-wage jobs slightly farther away. There is some evidence that chain establishments are associated with modest job gains in gentrifying census tracts, and that, outside of NYC, businesses that stay in place around gentrifying neighborhoods are associated with marginal job gains.","[Meltzer, Rachel; Ghorbani, Pooya] New Sch, New York, NY USA",The New School,"Meltzer, R (通讯作者)，72 Fifth Ave,Room 616, New York, NY 10011 USA.",meltzerr@newschool.edu,,,,,,,46,36,50,5,43,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

Empirical analyses often neglect a number of methodological issues and relevant influences on health. This paper investigates empirically whether neglecting these items leads to systematically different estimates. Based on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, this study derives the following results. (1) Many combinations of weight and height lead to the same health status. (2) The relationship between health and body mass index is nonlinear. (3) Underweight strengthens individual health and severe obesity has a clear negative impact on health status. Underweight women are more affected than men but obese men are hit harder than women. (4) The hypothesis has to be rejected that weight has an exogenous influence on health. (5) A worse health status is linked with weight fluctuations and deviations between desired and actual working hours. (6) A healthy diet and long but not too long sleeping contribute to a good health status. Moreover, a good parental education and a high parental social status act favorably on health as does personal high income. (7) Four of the big five components of personality, namely openness, extraversion, conscientiousness and agreeableness, contribute to resilience against health problems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Based on the data from 1984: Q1 to 2009: Q2, I find that historical evidence of the policy reaction toward stock prices is weak except for the stock market bubble of the 1990s. A counterfactual exercise shows that the rapid growth in stock prices during that period would have been significantly higher if monetary policy had been independent of the stock market. However, unconditional macroeconomic volatility increases with the degree of policy responsiveness toward stock prices.

Our results reveal that while capital expenditures are mostly idiosyncratic and related to unique property characteristics, they are a significant determinant of property returns. We find persistently strong positive relationship between capital expenditures and excess NPI returns when controlling for the endogeneity of capital expenditures for industrial, office and retail properties. A further analysis reveals that this relationship is driven by the positive impact of building improvements and building expansions, while returns in all property types do not fully adjust to account for tenant improvements.","[Ghosh, Chinmoy] Univ Connecticut, Sch Business, Dept Finance, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Petrova, Milena T.] Bocconi Univ, Dept Finance, I-20136 Milan, Italy",University of Connecticut; Bocconi University,"Petrova, MT (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Dept Finance, I-20136 Milan, Italy.",milena.petrova@unibocconi.it,"ghosh, chinmoy/AAE-2935-2022; Petrova, Milena/AAX-5309-2021",,Real Estate Research Institute,Real Estate Research Institute,"We thank the Real Estate Research Institute for providing funding for this study.

Inequality in energy intensity is measured by using the Zenga inequality index. The analysis is carried out by measuring inequality from the bottom of the energy intensity distribution to the top. This approach enables to identify the most unequal portions of the energy intensity distribution. To provide information on the causes of inequality at every point of the distribution, we show that inequality can be broken down into three components explaining the roles played by energy transformation, final energy intensity and their interaction in determining inequality in energy intensity. This decomposition reveals the impact of each component of inequality from the bottom of energy intensity distribution to the top. Results show that final energy intensity plays a major role in explaining inequality in the energy intensity distribution. The interaction component explains that EU-28 countries with low energy intensity are more efficient in energy transformation and less energy-intensive in end-use sectors than EU-28 countries with high energy intensity. The energy transformation component is higher when measuring inequality between the countries at the bottom of the distribution and those in the rest of the distribution, suggesting that disparities in energy transformation efficiency play an important role in determining inequality in energy intensity between the least energy-intensive countries and the other countries. The high inequality at the top of the distribution is due to the lower efficiency in energy transformation in the most energy-intensive countries, which reinforces the effect of disparity in final energy intensity between the countries at the top of the distribution and the other countries.","[Grossi, Luigi; Mussini, Mauro] Univ Verona, Dept Econ, Via Cantarane 24, Verona, Italy",University of Verona,"Grossi, L (通讯作者)，Univ Verona, Dept Econ, Via Cantarane 24, Verona, Italy.",luigi.grossi@univr.it; mauro.mussini@univr.it,"GROSSI, Luigi/HOH-7776-2023","GROSSI, Luigi/0000-0003-3671-7348",,,,,29,18,18,8,46,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,JUL,2017,38.0,4,,,,,1,18,,10.5547/01956574.38.4.lgro,0.0,,,18,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EZ6FJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404813500001,0

To better understand this relationship, we studied shoppers in Davis, California using a comprehensive survey dataset to explore the effect of personal characteristics, attitudes, perceptions, and the built environment on the frequencies of shopping online and within three distinct shopping settings. Overall, results showed that attitudes and perceptions played an important role in the shopping decision. The ordered response models of shopping frequency also revealed that the shopping motivations for each setting differed. Most notably, many of the factors influencing the frequency of shopping outside Davis had the opposite effect on shopping within Davis. Joint copula models subsequently suggested that online shopping had a complementary relationship with in-store shopping frequency, even after controlling for demographic variables and attitudes. Rather than reducing shopping travel, it appears that online shopping is associated with higher in-store shopping rates.

Technical efficiency is estimated using well-known data envelopment analysis (DEA) approaches and a bootstrapped DEA model. To solve the problem of measuring sporting results as output in knockout competitions, we propose the use of the coefficients applied by the UEFA from UCL revenue distribution. The results obtained show first that there is a high level of inefficiency in UCL over the period studied: Only 10% of the teams seem to be efficient. Also, the teams have many problems in maintaining their efficiency during the seasons. Second, the champion is always efficient. Third, we identify two sources of inefficiency: waste of sports resources and the selection of sporting tactics. Finally, from a methodological perspective, the output measure proposed seems to be suitable to represent reliably the sports results achieved by clubs in this qualifying competition type. Furthermore, our results are robust when applying alternative estimation methods. Regarding the results, some management implications are discussed and suggestions are made to boost the efficiency in inefficient clubs.","[Zambom-Ferraresi, Fabiola; Lera-Lopez, Fernando; Iraizoz, Belen] Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Econ, Arrosadia Campus Los Madronos Bldg, Pamplona 31006, Spain; [Isabel Garcia-Cebrian, Lucia] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Business Management & Org, Zaragoza, Spain",Universidad Publica de Navarra; University of Zaragoza,"Zambom-Ferraresi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Econ, Arrosadia Campus Los Madronos Bldg, Pamplona 31006, Spain.",fabiola.zambom@unavarra.es,"Ferraresi, Fabíola Zambom/P-3109-2019; Iraizoz, Belen/GLT-9023-2022; Cebrián, Lucía Isabel García/H-5690-2019; Zambom-Ferraresi, Fabíola/H-1700-2014; Zambom-Ferraresi, Fabíola/AAI-5419-2020; Iraizoz, belen/A-8705-2011; Lera-Lopez, Fernando/J-4450-2016","Iraizoz, Belen/0000-0002-9131-7323; Cebrián, Lucía Isabel García/0000-0002-0772-0321; Zambom-Ferraresi, Fabíola/0000-0001-7068-5269; Iraizoz, belen/0000-0002-9131-7323; Lera-Lopez, Fernando/0000-0002-9230-9405",Public University of Navarre; CREVALOR research group; MICINN [ECO2012-36290-C03-01]; FEDER,Public University of Navarre; CREVALOR research group; MICINN(Spanish Government); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Fabiola Zambom Ferraresi was supported by a predoctoral fellowship from the Public University of Navarre.

Recent literature also indicates the importance of export sophistication on economic development. This raises an important question whether export sophistication contributes to the income improvement in sub-Saharan African. The paper examines the causal effect of export sophistication on income in sub-Saharan Africa with panel data. By employing instrumental variables techniques and heteroskedasticity identification strategy that correct for endogeneity bias, the findings show that within-country variations in export sophistication lead to income growth. That is, a 1 % point increase in the export sophistication index is associated with an increase in GDP per capita of approximately 0.08 % points in the long run.","[Lin, Faqin] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Weldemicael, Ermias O.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Wang, Xiaosong] Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics; University of Melbourne; Renmin University of China,"Lin, FQ (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",linfaqin@126.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71503281, 71473254]; Major Project Program of the National Social Science Fund of China [12ZD097, 14ZDB120]; program for innovation research in Central University of Finance and Economics",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Major Project Program of the National Social Science Fund of China; program for innovation research in Central University of Finance and Economics,"We are grateful to the Coordinating Editor Professor Robert M.

We measure the ability of hospitals, particularly in rural communities, to attract nonhealth-related employment and provide higher wage jobs to residents based on their education level. Results find hospital employees with an associate's degree can expect a 21.4% wage premium, when compared with alternative opportunities, and those with a bachelor's degree can earn 12.2% more working in a hospital. Hospitals are shown to be positively related to overall employment as well as exhibit positive employment spillover. For rural counties, a short-term general hospital is associated with 559 jobs in the county, 60 of which are hospital based and 499 are non-health care related. With the positive benefits on wages and non-health care job growth, hospitals have measurable positive labor market outcomes above their primary objective of providing health care access, particularly in rural counties.","[Mandich, Anne M.; Dorfman, Jeffrey H.] Univ Georgia, Agr & Appl Econ, 312 Conner Hall, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Dorfman, JH (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Agr & Appl Econ, 312 Conner Hall, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",jdorfman@uga.edu,,,,,,,27,1,4,0,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

However, the instrumental role of telecommunication is unclear in contexts where residents' information-sharing networks are strongly geographically constrained by their limited mobility. Empirical research on the interactions between telecommunication and travel in rural areas of developing countries is lacking. This study analyses physical and virtual contact patterns within 1270 instrumental information-sharing relationships reported by the inhabitants of the Pulau Panggung and Sumber Rejo rural subdistricts of Indonesia. In 2013, we implemented an exogenous mobility intervention. In 2014, we administered a network survey in 16 randomly selected farming groups to map local residents' egocentric and sociocentric physical and virtual travel networks. By comparing the observed networks with simulated random networks, analysing the relationship characteristics and their history, and performing a regression analysis with fixed effects, we examine the complementarity and substitution between telecommunication and travel in the creation and maintenance of social networks. By examining the effects of the exogenous intervention, we can explain the mechanisms underlying the uncovered associations. The results suggest path dependency between physical and virtual travel in remote rural areas. The implication for transportation policy is that physical mobility is a precondition for the creation of virtual information-sharing links. Instrumental communication relationships that do not socially require regular physical co-presence can be partially substituted by virtual travel only after virtual links have been created through physical mobility. Therefore, in contrast with general expectations, mobile telephony in remote rural regions is more practical if the transportation infrastructure is adequately developed. concludes with a discussion of the potential contribution of the sociocentric network perspective to transportation research.

The empirical model reveals that the presence of children shapes the daily activity-travel patterns of non-workers by reducing the flexibility of out-of-home activity-type choices. Availability of private cars increases flexibility in travelling and increases the spread of spatial locations of out-of-home activities of non-workers. Income plays a significant role in non-workers' activity travel behaviour and it seems that non-workers from lower to middle-income households are less active (return home early) than those living in higher income households. In general, it is found that male non-workers are less active than the female non-workers and it is also evident that non-workers living in single detached houses are less active (return home early) than those living in condos/apartments. These findings have an implication to health issues as the average age of non-workers is over 50 years and the majority of detached houses are far from the central business district.

To this end, the principal ingredient for obtaining a reliable crude oil confidence interval is its volatility. Moreover, accurate crude oil volatility estimation has fundamental implications in terms of risk management, asset pricing and portfolio handling. Generally, current studies consider volatility models based on lagged crude oil price realizations and, at most, one additional macroeconomic variable as crude oil determinant. This paper aims to fill this gap, jointly considering not only traditional crude oil driving forces, such as the aggregate demand and oil supply, but also the monetary policy rate. Thus, this work aims to contribute to the debate concerning the potential impact of (lagged) US monetary policy as well as the other crude oil future price (COFP) determinants on daily COFP volatility. By means of the recently proposed generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity mixed data sampling model, different proxies of the US monetary policy alongside US industrial production (proxy of the US aggregate demand) and oil supply are included in the COFP volatility equation. Strong evidence that an expansionary (restrictive) variation in monetary policy anticipates a positive (negative) variation in COFP volatility is found. We also find that a negative (positive) variation of industrial production increases (decreases) COFP volatility. This means that volatility behaves counter-cyclically, according to the literature. Furthermore, the out-of-sample forecasting procedure shows that including these additional macroeconomic variables generally improves the forecasting performance.","[Amendola, Alessandra; Candila, Vincenzo; Scognamillo, Antonio] Univ Salerno, Dept Econ & Stat, Via Giovanni Paolo 2,132, I-84084 Salerno, Italy",University of Salerno,"Candila, V (通讯作者)，Univ Salerno, Dept Econ & Stat, Via Giovanni Paolo 2,132, I-84084 Salerno, Italy.",alamendola@unisa.it; vcandila@unisa.it; ascognamillo@unisa.it,"Scognamillo, Antonio/ABA-7757-2021; Amendola, Alessandra/E-6037-2018","Scognamillo, Antonio/0000-0002-0276-6814; Amendola, Alessandra/0000-0002-0152-9307; CANDILA, VINCENZO/0000-0002-3215-793X",,,,,49,14,14,2,26,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Our theoretical approach considers bounded rationality of agents (consumers and producers), heterogeneity of both agents and product characteristics, and the co-evolution of consumer desires, mainly, by social emulation. The proposed dynamics can reproduce some stylized facts that are well known in literature, such as the S-shaped adoption rate curve that many industries develop over their life cycle. Our model also obtains a novel result with relevant theoretical implications: the strictness of requirements, a factor rarely studied in consumer theory, has an important effect on some aggregate variables that are usually explained by the supply side, such as the number of producers or the industrial concentration index. In particular, the minimum number of producers (and then, the maximum Herfindahl index) is obtained for an intermediate degree of consumer requirements, a fact that is empirically validated for the wine market in Spain.","[Fernandez-Marquez, Carlos M.; Vazquez, Francisco J.] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Fernandez-Marquez, Carlos M.] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Dept Anal Econ Econ Cuantitat, C Francisco Tomas & Valiente 5, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Fatas-Villafranca, Francisco] Univ Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid; Autonomous University of Madrid; University of Zaragoza,"Fernández-Márquez, CM (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, Madrid, Spain.;Fernández-Márquez, CM (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Dept Anal Econ Econ Cuantitat, C Francisco Tomas & Valiente 5, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",carlosm.fernandez@uam.es,"HERNANDEZ, FRANCISCO JOSE VAZQUEZ/AAE-3997-2019; MARQUEZ, CARLOS MANUEL FERNANDEZ/AAB-5522-2019","HERNANDEZ, FRANCISCO JOSE VAZQUEZ/0000-0002-0250-1517; MARQUEZ, CARLOS MANUEL FERNANDEZ/0000-0002-9547-713X; Fatas Villafranca, Francisco/0000-0002-1246-6751",Centro de Computacion Cientifica at UAM,Centro de Computacion Cientifica at UAM,"The authors thank Nielsen Company for providing us data from their retail measurement services, and in particular we wish to thank Elena Alonso for her kind personal treatment.

We draw upon new evidence for Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, Lithuania, and Russia, controlling for potential selectivity issues. Numeracy started at low levels, especially in Russia and, later, in Lithuania. In the mideighteenth century, levels in Russia began to converge to Polish levels; later, the other regions followed. We test potential determinants such as serfdom, female autonomy, nutrition, and geography. We find that female autonomy proxied by the share of young female singles had a particularly consistent positive effect.

We assume that the identified household in each country minimizes its expenditure on energy and other goods. We simulate alternate scenarios of renewables implementation in 2035, taking account of different RES prices, and assess the related societal implications of a gradual transition from fossil fuels to RES.

However, it is characterized by the strong relationship with one or more families which, by providing the risk capital, constitute it. Consequently, its functionality strictly depends on the evolution through which these family units go and on the decisions that they make inside of them. Italian and international scholars had devoted particular attention to small- and medium-sized businesses, often considered as transitional phases for a dimensional development of the enterprise. The empirical evidence has actually disproved these assumptions, leading to the conclusion that even small-and medium-sized businesses can achieve high levels of success without necessarily increasing their dimensions. Starting from the eighties of the last century, business studies have considerably developed in this respect. The family business has now assumed an important role in the national and international scene, thus attracting an increasing interest in the theoretical and empirical research. The wide and rich literature on family businesses has highlighted a variety of topics, such as the understanding of the success and development factors of family businesses, the peculiarities of their management models, their corporate governance, their valuation, and, generally, the specificity of small-and medium-sized businesses. Today, a definition of a family business, which is unanimously accepted by the scholars of the field, is nonexistent. Therefore, this work aims at identifying those aspects, which are typical of a family business. Moreover, the abovesaid paper highlights too some other aspects, useful to identify family businesses from nonfamily ones. Finally, the paper wishes to examine how the identified variables (such as the ownership, dimensions, succession, and involvement of family members) affect the family business performance.","[Cristiano, Elena] Univ Calabria, Dept Business Adm & Law, Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy",University of Calabria,"Cristiano, E (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, Dept Business Adm & Law, Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy.",elena.cristiano@unical.it,,,,,,,49,1,1,1,9,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-39919-5; 978-3-319-39918-8,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,4.0,,,,,,577,600,,10.1007/978-3-319-39919-5_42,0.0,,,24,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2AH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000407615400042,0

This move was vehemently opposed by the tobacco industry, which challenged it on several levels: nationally, bilaterally and multilaterally at the World Trade Organization (WTO). The political behaviour of the tobacco companies in this case is puzzling both in terms of scale, operating at multiple levels at the same time, and in terms of the countries mobilized in their defence. WTO litigation is typically the result of multinational enterprises (MNEs) lobbying their own government, but here third countries were mobilized. Lobbying in third country contexts, with the objective of accessing multilateral dispute settlement systems, has been little studied. We thus know very little about the driving factors behind such activities, how target governments are selected and what lobbying strategies are used. This article draws on emerging research on transnational lobbying and a case study of the plain packaging case to explore these issues in detail and, by doing so, aims to further our theoretical understanding of the political economy of international trade in the context of increasing regime complexity and globalization of production. In addition, the article sheds new light on advocacy in the context of disputes about cross-border challenges to domestic regulation.","[Curran, Louise] Toulouse Business Sch, Int Business, Toulouse, France; [Eckhardt, Jappe] Univ York, Dept Polit, York, N Yorkshire, England",Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; TBS Education; University of York - UK,"Curran, L (通讯作者)，Toulouse Business Sch, Int Business, Toulouse, France.",,"Curran, Louise/AHE-2801-2022","curran, louise/0000-0001-9326-052X; Eckhardt, Jappe/0000-0002-8823-0905","National Cancer Institute, US National Institutes of Health [R01-CA091021]","National Cancer Institute, US National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI))","National Cancer Institute, US National Institutes of Health [grant number R01-CA091021].",,107,31,33,1,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Nowadays, it represents an interesting employee benefit also called the home office. At the same time, it can help to reduce company costs in certain situations, such as the costs relating to the creation of a new job and overhead costs. In the context of the increasing demand for labour and the gradual growth of the interest in part-time work, the active search for this possibility of work is mainly found among families with children under 15 years of age. The accessions of small and medium sized enterprises in the EU member states are not uniform, which is reflected in the frequency of the use of homeworking by individual employees on the one hand and the possibility of homeworking on the part of the employers. The aim of the paper is to compare the approaches of selected countries. The authors focus on the comparison of the Czech Republic, Spain and average values within the EU. The comparison is carried out according to the frequency of use, gender and the age structure of employees according to the selected statistical methods. From the data obtained, the wider use of homeworking in Spain towards the Czech Republic and simultaneously, the lower introduction of homeworking in both selected stakes compared to the EU average arise. The results also failed to demonstrate statistically significant differences between men and women in the selected countries and the EU.","[Frantikova, Zuzana; Vlckova, Miroslava; Vrchota, Jaroslav] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Econ, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Sladek, Jan] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Philosophy, Prague, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; Charles University Prague,"Frantikova, Z (通讯作者)，Univ South Bohemia, Fac Econ, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",zfrantikova@ef.jcu.cz; mvlckova02@ef.jcu.cz; vrchota@ef.jcu.cz; sladek.jan@gmail.com,"Vrchota, Jaroslav/D-6145-2016; Vlčková, Miroslava/D-9025-2016","Vrchota, Jaroslav/0000-0002-8363-3131; Vlčková, Miroslava/0000-0002-6935-3037",Faculty of Economics of the University of South Bohemia [EF-IGS2017-Vrchota-IGS24B1],Faculty of Economics of the University of South Bohemia,This paper has been supported by the Faculty of Economics of the University of South Bohemia within the Internal grant competition administrated under theref. number EF-IGS2017-Vrchota-IGS24B1,,23,2,2,1,20,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,693,700,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8CX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427987300070,0

Based on Michel Foucault's philosophical developments about ethics and the ontology of the self, the article explores Keynes's economic perspectives on the material possibilities of the economy and how prosperity must be conceived not as an end, but rather as a means to enjoy the arts of life. Our conclusions are buttressed by the possible connections between Foucault's notions of self-government and Keynes's considerations about the economy, which have not been acknowledged by philosophers and historians of economics. Keynes's view of the role of economic activity and prosperity can be reinterpreted from the Foucauldian notion of government of self in the sense that economic activities represent a transformative experience of the self: one can transform himself/herself within the material possibilities of the economy and seek for the good life as an ethical end.","[Guizzo, Danielle] Univ West England, Accounting Econ & Finance Dept, Bristol, Avon, England",University of West England,"Guizzo, D (通讯作者)，Univ West England, Accounting Econ & Finance Dept, Bristol, Avon, England.",Danielle.Guizzoarchela@uwe.ac.uk,"Guizzo, Danielle/HRD-2684-2023; Guizzo, Danielle/G-6097-2015","Guizzo, Danielle/0000-0002-1629-8062","CAPES Research Foundation (Ministry of Education, Brasilia, DF, Brazil) [70.040-020]","CAPES Research Foundation (Ministry of Education, Brasilia, DF, Brazil)","I thank the CAPES Research Foundation (Ministry of Education, Brasilia, DF, 70.040-020, Brazil) for financial support, and the Archives Centre, King's College, Cambridge (UK) for access to the papers of J.

Setting up a sovereign wealth fund with a clear spending constraint may decrease these risks. On the other hand, in a capital scarce developing economy with limited access to international borrowing, such a spending constraint may lower welfare by reducing domestic capital accumulation and hindering consumption increases for the currently poor. These two contradicting considerations pose a dilemma for policy makers in deciding whether to set up a sovereign wealth fund with a spending constraint. Using Uganda's recent oil discovery as a case study, this paper presents a quantitative macroeconomic analysis and examines the potential loss of constraining spending through a sovereign wealth fund with a simple spending rule. We find that the loss is relatively low and unlikely to dominate the political risks associated with increased oil spending. Thus, such a spending constraint appears well warranted.","[Hassler, John; Krusell, Per] Stockholm Univ, Inst Int Econ Studies, Stockholm, Sweden; [Shifa, Abdulaziz B.] Syracuse Univ, Maxwell Sch, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Spiro, Daniel] Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Spiro, Daniel] Oslo Ctr Res Environm Friendly Energy, Oslo, Norway",Stockholm University; Syracuse University; University of Oslo,"Spiro, D (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.;Spiro, D (通讯作者)，Oslo Ctr Res Environm Friendly Energy, Oslo, Norway.",daniel.spiro@econ.uio.no,,"Spiro, Daniel/0000-0002-6819-832X",International Growth Center; ESRC [ES/L009633/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L009633/1] Funding Source: researchfish,International Growth Center; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We wish to thank the International Growth Center for financial and logistic support.

With a higher or lower degree of development trend, time and place, the law of motion of the population is not the same everywhere and always, for all eras and all the places. Expands and eliminates government restrictions within and across borders, changing the form of states, regions and the whole world. It is the expression of overall-general law of concentration of social production, in which lies the objective basis of the phenomenon, as manifested in the slave, feudal and bourgeois society. It is also noted that it is manifestations of the dialectic between the strategy and the geostrategic sphere of global economy and the homonymous community. A careful and penetrating review of the global situation today testifies to the objective fact that the immediately preceding major realities are those that form the cultural, economic and social context of movement of the productive forces. Migration is the effect of broader development processes, which move dialectically with globalization and moves correspondingly, as an intrinsic growing element of objective character. It is the link between the national and international elements due to the dual nature, the national-domestic and international-global, while traditional movement as pertaining the domestic element and the movement out of the borders is international by nature. The official progressive science and sociology also helped in the prevalence of the perception that the first right of potential migrant is the most fundamental principle in theory of human rights.","[Kypriotelis, Efstratios] TEI Epirus, Psathaki 48100, Preveza, Greece",,"Kypriotelis, E (通讯作者)，TEI Epirus, Psathaki 48100, Preveza, Greece.",kypriot@gmail.com,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,4,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2017,,,,,,,295,306,,10.18502/kss.v1i2.664,0.0,,,12,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BJ1DU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417433200022,0

Using data from a rural household survey in the mid-1930s, we explore how the post plague conditions in various villages affected migrant cohorts' long-term wealth accumulation. We find that the migrant households that moved to plague-hit villages soon after the plague ended prospered the most: they owned at least 112% more land than migrant households that either moved elsewhere or migrated to the same village before or long after the plague outbreak.

It is found that no matter who dominates the channel, the retailer always suffers from CSR when it is a profit-maximizer. Our finding verifies that not only manufacturers but also the retailer would be not willing to take(CSR) unless governments' subsidies or market rewards can compensate them for doing so. Interestingly when social responsibility is concerned, we show that a dominate retailer will be best off by taking(CSR).

Last but not least, we test the hypothesis that companies which are reporting on certification according to ISO 14001 disclose the higher quantity of environmental information than other companies and hypothesis that companies which are reporting on obtained environmental subsidies disclose the higher quantity of environmental information than other companies. We found that themes Energy, Biodiversity, Emissions, Products and services, Other (mentions on environmental policy, environmentally related training of employees and general proclamations) and Effluents and waste constitute 83.11 percent of the total environmental disclosure. The most often discussed environmentally relevant standard is ISO 14001, which is mentioned by 44.90 percent of companies in our sample. In relation to our hypotheses we can conclude that group of companies which are reporting on ISO 14001 on average disclose higher quantity of environmental information than the group not reporting on ISO 14001 and group of companies which are reporting on environmental subsidies on average disclose higher quantity of environmental information than the group not reporting on these subsidies.

In the case of the scale problem empirical studies should be conducted with application of simulations. Within the simulation analysis the realisations of random fields referred to irregular regions will be generated. First, the internal structure of spatial processes will be analysed. Next, we consider the theoretical foundations for random fields relative to irregular regions. The accepted properties of random fields will be based on the characteristics established for economic phenomena. The outcome of the task will be the development of a procedure for generating the vector of random fields with specified properties.

The results of our analysis are generally consistent with the findings of other empirical studies. From the investigated factors, almost all had a negative impact on the indebtedness of the firms in the sample. Overall, the debt ratio of Romanian firms is consistent with the pecking order theory, so that profit-making firms, with better growth opportunities and those with higher business risk lend themselves to a lesser extent and finance their investments using internal resources.

Despite this, key concepts of his political regime, such as sovereignty' and sovereign democracy', have frequently been used in Russian political discourse. This essay examines the way the current Russian administration has used concepts that stress strong societal unity, and the creation of a stable state and societal unity to support the development of real functioning dynamics in the society. It charts the shift from sovereign democracy' to sovereignty' around 2011-2012 as a key discursive concept in moving towards a more isolationist international stand and consolidating Putin's power by emphasising Russia's unique political tradition, which requires a strong leader as the basis of national unity and to ensure Russian sovereignty.","[Ruutu, Katja] European Univ, St Petersburg, Russia; [Ruutu, Katja] Univ Helsinki, POB 3, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",European University at Saint Petersburg; University of Helsinki,"Ruutu, K (通讯作者)，European Univ, St Petersburg, Russia.;Ruutu, K (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, POB 3, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",katja.ruutu@helsinki.fi,,,,,,,37,3,5,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2017,69.0,8,,,,,1153,1162,,10.1080/09668136.2017.1378621,0.0,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,FN3VX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000415930400002,0

Using repeated cross-sectional travel diary data collected from individuals residing in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2000 and 2012, we develop a latent class choice model of travel mode choice behavior. Estimation results reveal ten segments across the pooled sample populations that differ from one another in terms of their demographic composition, the travel modes that they consider, and the relative importance that they attach to different level-of-service attributes, namely travel times and costs. Findings indicate shifts in latent modal preferences that exceed analogous changes in observable travel mode choice patterns. For example, private (motorized) vehicle mode shares decreased from 85.0% in 2000 to 81.2% in 2012, but the proportion of the population that only considers private vehicle when deciding how to travel is found to decline from 41.7% to 23.5% during the same period. Changes in economic and social factors and changes in the level of service of different travel modes are found to have had a marginal effect. Had modal preferences not changed between 2000 and 2012, over and above changes in the socioeconomic environment and the transportation infrastructure, our framework predicts that private vehicle mode shares would have increased to 88.3% by 2012. Finally, shifts in modal preferences are not found to be limited to any one generation but to have cut across the entire population, reflecting broader cultural shifts that have transcended generational differences.

Findings presented in this paper show how students of selected university program gained benefits from using social media networks and related applications. These benefits are covering team management functions, analytical functions and also possibilities of funding of their coursework projects. Initiative arising from this paper is to bring social media education to be contained in compulsory study basis in study fields that can benefit from its potential like business or social oriented study programs. This can be understood as a setup of new course which will cover functions and possibilities of social networks for professional purposes. There has been studied the relationships of students to certain social media networks and a set of functions student need for their projects.

The latter are possible, because bank deposits that are meant as means of exchange by their holders are subject to very low minimum reserve requirements. For a long time, renowned economists have proposed to protect cash deposits fully by 100% reserve requirements, because depriving banks from creating new money would stabilise the financial system. The chapter argues that, under the prevailing fiscal and monetary conditions, Japan would greatly benefit from shifting to a 100% reserve-backed money regime. Such a move would not only take advantage of the benefits propagated by the supporters of a reserve-backed regime. The implied Bank of Japan's (BoJ) balance sheet expansion would allow the Bank to purchase further Japanese Government Bonds (JGB). As the expansion would be permanent, the regime shift would not only stabilise the government's fiscal condition, the BoJ, too, would no longer have to worry about exiting from its policy of quantitative easing. Both the government and the central bank could focus on their primary policy goals. The shift to a 100% regime would also very likely reduce Japan's very high ratio of cash to GDP.","[Waldenberger, Franz] German Inst Japanese Studies, Tokyo, Japan",,"Waldenberger, F (通讯作者)，German Inst Japanese Studies, Tokyo, Japan.",waldenberger@dijtokyo.org,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0921-8580,2197-1889,978-3-319-59846-8; 978-3-319-59845-1,FINAN MON P,,,2017,44.0,,,,,,77,98,,10.1007/978-3-319-59846-8_6,0.0,,,22,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL1NM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447914500006,0

In contrast with the state of the art in travel behaviour research, which is almost invariantly based on linear regression and structural equations analysis, this study explores the performance of non-linear models of trip satisfaction for public transportation. Focusing on public transportation, we assume that trip stage satisfaction systematically varies in a non-linear fashion with the discrepancy between expectations and actual experienced attributes of the trip stage, controlling for perceived service quality, attitudes, moods and personality traits. In contributing to the rapidly growing literature on travel satisfaction in general and in the context of public transportation in particular, the aim of this study is to develop a reference-based model of trip stage satisfaction that takes perceived service quality, attitudes, moods, personality traits and difference tolerance into account. Difference tolerance refers to the notion that within some tolerance level, differences between service delivery and expectations do not have a major effect on satisfaction ratings. The data used to estimate the model were collected in January 2015 in Xian, China among a random sample of respondents. Results support the contentions underlying the study: several relationships between attributes and satisfaction appear non-linear. There is also evidence of difference tolerance, but results differ between attributes.","[Gao, Yanan; Wang, Yuanqing] Changan Univ, Dept Transportat Engn, Middle Sect Naner Huan Rd, Xian 710064, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Rasouli, Soora; Timmermans, Harry] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Urban Planning Grp, NL-5612 AZ Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Timmermans, Harry] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Dept Air Transportat Management, Jiangjun Ave, Nanjing 211106, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Chang'an University; Eindhoven University of Technology; Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics,"Gao, YA (通讯作者)，Changan Univ, Dept Transportat Engn, Middle Sect Naner Huan Rd, Xian 710064, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",gaoyanan@chd.edu.cn; s.rasouli@tue.nl; h.j.p.timmermans@tue.nl; wyq21@vip.sina.com,"Gao, Yanan/GXG-9743-2022","Gao, Yanan/0000-0002-3641-5449; Timmermans, Harry/0000-0002-8737-4632; rasouli, soora/0000-0001-8044-8654","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China [300102218521, 300102218401]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51878062]",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research is supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China (Grant Nos. 300102218521, 300102218401) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51878062).",,59,21,24,5,84,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

This article challenges these persistent, though unsubstantiated assumptions, used to justify weakening employment rights enforcement and further deregulate the labour market. It draws upon the experiences of 158 clients of Citizens' Advice Bureaux, who were tracked over the course of their disputes, as they sought to resolve work-related grievances. Among this group, it can be argued that rather than too many, too few claims go forward, discouraged by the real and imagined costs of making a claim.

Given the difficulties in applying standard anti-trust regulations in the agri-food system, a growing interest is emerging in a decentralized approach where private entities, such as Producer Organizations (PO), are given active role in the governance of the agricultural markets. We present a simple bargaining model assessing the POs' capacity to rebalance bargaining power along the supply chain. The results show that POs can benefit farmers by strengthening their negotiation power, improving their bargaining position and worsening the buyer's one. Imposing a minimum size for POs may improve their effectiveness in affecting the buyer 's bargaining position. Such requirement should be calibrated on the structure of the downstream (upstream) relevant market.","[Sorrentino, Alessandro; Cacchiarelli, Luca] Univ Tuscia, Dipartimento Econ & Impresa, Viterbo, Italy; [Russo, Carlo] Univ Cassino & Lazio Merid, Dipartimento Econ & Giurisprudenza, Cassino, Italy",Tuscia University; University of Cassino,"Cacchiarelli, L (通讯作者)，Univ Tuscia, Dipartimento Econ & Impresa, Viterbo, Italy.",cacchiarelli@unitus.it,"Cacchiarelli, Luca/AAE-5241-2021","Cacchiarelli, Luca/0000-0002-0302-9621",,,,,27,24,25,3,21,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,DEC,2018,17.0,4,,,,,21,31,,10.30682/nm1804b,0.0,,,11,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,HJ8ZC,,gold,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000457487600003,0

We use a model of the world's national wine markets, projected to 2025, to examine potential impacts of Brexit and a series of follow-on bilateral FTAs. The scenarios assume a UK-EU-27 FTA is followed by EU-27 bilateral FTAs with Australia and New Zealand and then UK bilateral FTAs with those two plus South Africa and Chile (with whom the EU already has FTAs). The new EU-Japan FTA is also assessed. Brexit's impact comes more from assumed changes to the UK's income growth and the pound's exchange rate than to its tariffs. The bilateral trade consequences of the trade-diverting and trade-creating effects of each additional FTA are highlighted. They are then compared with the effects of a multilateral agreement to remove all wine import tariffs globally. Unrealistic though this is, it exposes the far bigger benefits to wine producers and consumers that could emerge from a single multilateral undertaking than from several bilateral or regional FTAs.","[Anderson, Kym] Univ Adelaide, Econ, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Anderson, Kym] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Wittwer, Glyn] Victoria Univ, Ctr Policy Studies, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Adelaide; Australian National University; Victoria University,"Anderson, K (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Econ, Adelaide, SA, Australia.;Anderson, K (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",,"Greene, Lilli/JRW-8947-2023; Anderson, Kym/G-7292-2012","Anderson, Kym/0000-0002-1472-3352",,,,,17,17,17,1,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2018,41.0,11,,,,,2883,2894,,10.1111/twec.12726,0.0,,,12,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,HA3DC,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450129200002,0

This study evaluates the geographic and temporal scope of the impact of unnatural death on property values in Hong Kong. By exploiting the spatial and intertemporal variation of the shock in a difference-in-differences approach, we find significant negative externalities of unnatural death incidence on neighborhood housing values. On average, units in which an unnatural death occurred experience a 25% drop in value following the death. Nearby units on the same floor also show a significant price drop of 4.5%. Prices of units on other floors of the same building decline about 2.6%. Units in other buildings of the same estate observe a price decline of about 1% on average. However, the price for nearby estates within 300 m shows a positive impact of 0.5%, suggesting a very localized sorting mechanism. Temporally, price evolution after death incidence follows a U shape. Housing prices continue to decline up to 4-5 years after deaths and recover gradually afterwards. We also document the heterogeneity of the impact by the type of death incidence (murder, suicide, or accident) and the type of homebuyers (local buyer, investment firm, and other buyers). We find that the negative externalities of death incidence are largely due to a severe stigma effect, rather than channels through the revealed crime risk or the price contagion effect.","[Chang, Zheng] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Kowloon, 6-F,Acad 1 Bldg,Tat Chee Ave, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Li, Jing] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, 90 Stamford Rd, Singapore 178903, Singapore",City University of Hong Kong; Singapore Management University,"Chang, Z (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Kowloon, 6-F,Acad 1 Bldg,Tat Chee Ave, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",zchang@cityu.edu.hk; lijing@smu.edu.sg,"Li, Jing/H-6822-2013","Li, Jing/0000-0001-5269-134X; chang, zheng/0000-0001-6624-3206",,,,,40,11,11,0,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

In contrast to this literature we propose an approach to analyze cooperative behavior among a group of firms only by making use of information on the spatial structure of a horizontally differentiated market. Using spatial econometrics techniques we focus on differences in the pricing behavior between different groups of firms, i.e. alliance and stand-alone firms. We apply this method to the market for ski lift tickets using a unique data set on ticket prices and detailed resort-specific characteristics covering all ski resorts in Austria. We show that prices of ski resorts forming alliances are higher and increase with the size and towards the spatial center of an alliance. Interaction in pricing is higher within than outside alliances. All results are in line with the findings of theoretical models on non-competitive pricing behavior in horizontally differentiated markets.","[Firgo, Matthias; Kuegler, Agnes] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Arsenal Objekt 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria",,"Firgo, M (通讯作者)，Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Arsenal Objekt 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",matthias.firgo@wifo.ac.at; agnes.kuegler@wifo.ac.at,,"Firgo, Matthias/0000-0003-3978-3009; Kugler, Agnes/0000-0003-4546-4768",City of Vienna Jubilaeumsfonds,City of Vienna Jubilaeumsfonds,"We are grateful to the editor and two anonymous referees for their valuable comments.

To this end, we apply a Granger causality analysis based on augmented vector autoregressive (VAR) model in levels and extra lags. This provides more efficient and robust results than the standard VAR model that can lead to biased results with limited samples, especially in the country-by-country analysis. In this article, we present the first application of these econometric techniques in the field by studying the relationship between tourism and economic growth. Empirical results suggest that the impact of gross domestic product in the origin countries of inbound Spanish tourism is heterogeneous and country specific, and asymmetric behaviours appear among countries. The analysis of this issue is relevant for the design and implementation of tourism promotion programmes specific to the country of origin by policymakers and practitioners.","[Iglesias, Jesus] Univ Seville, Seville, Spain; [Gegundez, Manuel E.; Golpe, Antonio A.; Carlos Vides, Jose] Univ Huelva, Huelva, Spain",University of Sevilla; Universidad de Huelva,"Golpe, AA (通讯作者)，Univ Huelva, Dept Econ, Plaza Merced 11, Huelva 21002, Spain.;Golpe, AA (通讯作者)，Univ Huelva, Ctr Estudios Avanzados Fis Matemat & Computac, Plaza Merced 11, Huelva 21002, Spain.",antonio.golpe@dehie.uhu.es,"Gegundez-Arias, Manuel E./HKV-5465-2023; Golpe, Antonio/F-6995-2016; Iglesias, Jesús/W-1989-2018; Gegundez_Arias, Manuel E/H-5674-2015; Vides, José Carlos Vides/AAB-3407-2020","Gegundez-Arias, Manuel E./0000-0001-6375-1782; Golpe, Antonio/0000-0003-0360-1541; Iglesias, Jesús/0000-0003-1533-273X; Gegundez_Arias, Manuel E/0000-0001-6375-1782; Vides, José Carlos Vides/0000-0002-9732-0347",,,,,92,2,2,0,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The external common trend has a larger impact on private investment and public expenditure than on consumption and output, a result consistent with the role of investment in absorbing income volatility. The permanent terms of trade (foreign) shocks account for most of the volatility in output, consumption, private investment, and public expenditure.

To this aim, we employ standard regression analysis and dynamic simulations to illustrate the channels through which international capital mobility impacts unemployment adjustments to productivity shocks and quantify its effect on unemployment volatility. We find that capital mobility plays a significant role in generating unemployment responses to idiosyncratic productivity shocks which are wider but less persistent. Moreover, the empirical evidence suggests that the responsiveness effect dominates the persistence effect, implying that higher international capital mobility increases unemployment volatility. The effect is not negligible. Monte Carlo simulations of the model show that moving from a closed economy to an open economy scenario causes the standard deviation of unemployment to increase by around 26%.","[Vallanti, Giovanna] Libera Univ, Int Sociali Guido Carli, Rome, Italy; [Vallanti, Giovanna] Libera Univ, LLEE, Rome, Italy",,"Vallanti, G (通讯作者)，Libera Univ, Int Sociali Guido Carli, Rome, Italy.;Vallanti, G (通讯作者)，Libera Univ, LLEE, Rome, Italy.",,,"Vallanti, Giovanna/0000-0001-6238-0094",,,,,85,0,0,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2018,41.0,11,,,,,3130,3171,,10.1111/twec.12705,0.0,,,42,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,HA3DC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450129200012,0

This is an important issue for analysts and policy makers, because industrial production is a standard element in tools for nowcasting real GDP in real time. It also raises the question about the factors explaining these differences. Differences in terms of (changes in) quarterly growth between production and gross value added include sign reversals and can last for consecutive quarters. Persistent level differences might also exist. The explanatory factors for these differences are the treatment of prices, seasonality and coverage. Data limitations prevent a detailed analysis of the price factor, but the other two factors are more closely evaluated. It turns out that the relative importance of these factors varies over time and thus is difficult to assess ex ante for a specific quarter. A remedy is that statisticians further harmonize national accounts and short-term statistics as well as national practices for seasonal adjustment.","[de Bondt, Gabe Jacob] European Cent Bank, Business Cycle Anal Div, Sonnemannstr 20, Frankfurt, Germany; [Kosekova, Stanimira Vasileva] European Cent Bank, External Stat & Sect Accounts Div, Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank; European Central Bank,"de Bondt, GJ (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Business Cycle Anal Div, Sonnemannstr 20, Frankfurt, Germany.",gabe.de_bondt@ecb.europa.eu; stanimira.kosekova@ecb.europa.eu,,,,,,,28,0,0,1,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

An open question has been the robustness of such predictions when heterogeneity in budgets amongst individuals is allowed. Here, we show analytically that the consequences of permitting heterogeneity depend crucially on the exact nature of the underlying public-good provision efficacy, but generally are rather devastating. Using computational methods, we quantify the loss resulting from heterogeneity vis-a-vis the homogeneous case as a function of (i) the public-good provision efficacy and (ii) the population inequality.","[Duca, Stefano; Helbing, Dirk] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Humanities Polit & Social Sci, Clausiusstr 50, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Nax, Heinrich H.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Humanities Polit & Social Sci, Clausiusstr 37, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Duca, S (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Humanities Polit & Social Sci, Clausiusstr 50, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",sduca@ethz.ch,,,European Commission through the ERC Advanced Investigator Grant Momentum [324247],European Commission through the ERC Advanced Investigator Grant Momentum(European Research Council (ERC)),"We thank the associate editor, the anonymous reviewers, Michael Mas, Ryan Murphy, Stefano Balietti, and the colleagues at the COSS chair at ETH Zurich for helpful discussions and comments and for helping improving the manuscript.

The results of water charges model are consistent with the theory of water cost determination as water source, debt, and economies of size plus scale influence residential consumer charges for water. Both models (water charges and minimum monthly access) displayed positive spillover effects, although the only variable in either model with a significant indirect effect is water charges on minimum monthly access charges. Based upon model results, ground water use by utilities lowers water charges and is estimated to save residential customers in West Virginia over $3.6 million annually. West Virginia households typically pay far below the OECD standard of 3 to 5% of household income for municipal water, which may explain why socioeconomic factors do not influence minimum monthly charges for access.","[Erfanian, Elham; Collins, Alan R.] West Virginia Univ, Davis Coll Agr Nat Resources & Design, Reg Res Inst, Resource Econ & Management, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",West Virginia University,"Collins, AR (通讯作者)，West Virginia Univ, Davis Coll Agr Nat Resources & Design, Reg Res Inst, Resource Econ & Management, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",alan.collins@mail.wvu.edu,,,West Virginia Agriculture and Forestry Experiment Station project [WVA00636],West Virginia Agriculture and Forestry Experiment Station project,The authors would like to thank the editor and reviewers for providing valuable suggestions in the organization of the manuscript along with insights about our models.

Through a quantitative analysis of the 14th-18th centuries series of real wages and population shocks in fourteen European cities, I find that in four north-western cities (Amsterdam, Antwerp, London, and Oxford) the urban real wages were detached from population before the Industrial Revolution, while, in the central and southern Europe wages had a moderate or negative response to population changes. In addition, I show that this different response dates back to the 16th century. I claim, that these two results support three possibly non alternative interpretations of the little divergence, either based on changes of fertility regimes, rural and urban labor organizations, or on the onset, in early modern north-western Europe, of non strictly Malthusian growth mechanisms.","[Fochesato, Mattia] Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland",University of Basel,"Fochesato, M (通讯作者)，Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland.",mattia.fochesato@unibas.ch,,"FOCHESATO, MATTIA/0000-0002-9915-4696",European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007-2013/under REA [608129],European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007-2013/under REA(European Union (EU)),The research leading to these results has received funding from the People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007-2013/under REA grant agreement n.608129.,,202,12,12,1,14,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0014-4983,1090-2457,,EXPLOR ECON HIST,Explor.

Conceptually, the analysis draws on the technology acceptance model (TAM). To test the model, structural equation modelling is employed, relying on unique survey-based data of actual users of electric vehicles (N = 575), i.e. from early adopter organisations. In general, the empirical findings support the model. In particular, variables at the organisational level (perceived organisational usefulness) and the organisation member's reactions to the introduction of EVs (subjective norms) are found to be highly important in supporting the acquisition of EVs in commercial pool car fleets. With regard to the perception of vehicle characteristics, environmental benefits and perceived ease of use are identified as relevant antecedents to EV acceptance (support for acquiring EVs). Unlike the results from the literature that concern private households and company car users, we found a very low effect of the evaluation of the vehicles' driving range.","[Globisch, Joachim; Duetschke, Elisabeth; Schleich, Joachim] Fraunhofer Inst Syst & Innovat Res ISI, Breslauer Str 48, D-76139 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Schleich, Joachim] Grenoble Ecole Management, 12 Rue Pierre Semard, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Schleich, Joachim] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Globisch, Joachim] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Hertzstr 16, D-76187 Karlsruhe, Germany",Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; Grenoble Ecole Management; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Globisch, J (通讯作者)，Fraunhofer Inst Syst & Innovat Res ISI, Breslauer Str 48, D-76139 Karlsruhe, Germany.",joachim.globisch@isi.fraunhofer.de,"Schleich, Joachim/I-4612-2019","Schleich, Joachim/0000-0001-6079-7240; Dutschke, Elisabeth/0000-0003-1882-1934","German Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure; Ministry of Economic Affairs, Labour and Housing in Baden-Wurttemberg; national High Performance Center by the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft","German Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure; Ministry of Economic Affairs, Labour and Housing in Baden-Wurttemberg; national High Performance Center by the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft","The data collection for this research was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure.

One of the themes in this field of research is related to partnership approaches, as one way of stimulating functioning collaboration between formally independent private and public organisations. The aim of this paper is to explore the role and function of partnerships as a way of supporting well-functioning public transport networks and services in fragmented institutional settings. The empirical focus is on partnerships between operators and public (transport) authorities in two different legal settings: England and Sweden. The analysis is based on interviews with operators and public transport authorities in two metropolitan regions in each country where innovative partnership working has been developed to deal with various types of barriers to delivering better public transport. The results show the key qualities of these partnerships that are required for them to function. Although the regulatory contexts are very different, the partnership qualities are very similar in both cases.","[Hrelja, Robert] VTI, Linkoping, Sweden; [Hrelja, Robert] K2, Lund, Sweden; [Rye, Tom] Edinburgh Napier Univ, Transport Res Inst, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Mullen, Caroline] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",VTI; Edinburgh Napier University; University of Leeds,"Hrelja, R (通讯作者)，Olaus Magnus Vag 35, SE-58195 Linkoping, Sweden.",robert.hrelja@vti.se,"Hrelja, Robert/HGD-9302-2022; Hrelja, Robert D/E-6744-2011","Hrelja, Robert/0000-0002-9445-784X; Mullen, Caroline/0000-0003-2915-5009",Swedish Innovation Agency (VINNOVA),Swedish Innovation Agency (VINNOVA)(Vinnova),This research was done in collaboration with K2-The Swedish Knowledge Centre for Public Transport.

The findings put in evidence main differences between standards in two different institutional forms: mandatory issued by governmental authorities and voluntary issued and disseminated through supply chains' inter-organizational relationships. The analysis only focuses on two certifications representing in turn authorities and private standards. Research implications indicate distinctions between mandatory public certification standards and private ones. Findings may support transport and logistics managers in the analysis and comparison of private and public certifications or standards for decision-making. Previous research has not analyzed differences between public and private security standards. In addition, researchers claim that security certifications can improve both security and efficiency.

We also find that democracy and political openness have an adverse impact on the growth prospect of SMEs in transition economies. On the other hand, the negative effect of political openness on firm growth is decreasing as the proportion of the firm's labor force with a university degree increases-a finding suggesting that the collective bargaining of low-skilled workers may hinder the growth of small firms in transition economies.","[Chit, Myint Moe] Univ Nottingham, Business Sch, Univ Nottingham Malaysia Campus,Jalan Broga, Semenyih 43500, Selangor, Malaysia",University of Nottingham Malaysia,"Chit, MM (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Business Sch, Univ Nottingham Malaysia Campus,Jalan Broga, Semenyih 43500, Selangor, Malaysia.",moechit.myint@nottingham.edu.my,"Chit, Myint/U-1501-2019","Chit, Myint/0000-0002-0866-0340",,,,,71,2,2,0,12,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We improve on this pricing mechanism by developing a forward-looking policy instrument. The instrument employs a two-stage panel data regression and optimization model that influences demand for parking spaces by changing parking rates via computed price elasticities of parking demand measures. Coefficient estimates that include the elasticity measures from the panel data regression are used to fit a linear prediction model that is the primary input to the optimization model. An application of the approach is presented using SFpark, a federal government-funded demonstration program in San Francisco as a case study. We evaluate the effectiveness of the modified pricing mechanism by comparing actual occupancy and parking rate tuples with the optimized result to ascertain the potential improvement in SFpark's performance. Policy scenarios are subsequently explored by carrying out sensitivity analysis primarily through SFpark pricing rules. Relative to SFpark's figures, our model yielded approximately 16% improvement in systems performance when measured by the number of blocks that deviate from the 60 to 80% occupancy target. Our findings highlight the importance of moving towards a predictive regime that allows for proactively managing the parking program compared to a reactive approach based on observed parking occupancy.","[Fabusuyi, Tayo; Hampshire, Robert C.] Univ Michigan, Transportat Res Inst, 2901 Baxter Rd, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Fabusuyi, T (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Transportat Res Inst, 2901 Baxter Rd, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",Fabusuyi@umich.edu,,"Fabusuyi, Tayo/0000-0002-5828-1912",,,,,46,14,18,3,35,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,1879-2375,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

A subset of these actions is horizontal litigation', where EU institutions litigate against other EU institutions. Based on a new dataset covering all horizontal annulment conflicts (1957-2017), this contribution analyzes conflict patterns.

Using the example of EU external affairs, I show how annulment actions have shaped the relationship between EU institutions over time, with impact as significant as treaty changes.

For this, quasi-experimental evidence, including average treatment effects on those treated (ATI), are generated by using the self-reported health survey of the labour force of Sri Lanka. According to the analysis, individuals with at least one NCD account for approximately 19.15% of the working-age population. On average, employment probability, labour supply, and labour earnings of them are significantly lower than those of non-NCD individuals by 9.5% (ATT=-0.102, P < 0.001), 44.6% (ATT=-0.590, P < 0.001), and 47.9% (ATT=-0.652, P < 0.001), respectively. The negative impacts on labour force outcomes are notably larger in the cases of paralysis and mental illness. These NCDs reduce individual labour supply by more than 80% and labour earnings by more than 90%. The employment probability of individuals with paralysis and mental illnesses is also relatively lower by more than 60%. Apart from these individual-level effects, the paper provides evidence on how labour force outcomes at the household level are influenced by NCDs. Our findings demonstrate that the association between individuals' NCD-prevalence and labour force outcomes is relatively stronger for males, informal sector employees, and elderly people. The results suggest several social inclusion policies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Following this theory, four indicators were developed to measure people's behavioural intentions for improving air quality; two of these indicators were correlated with contingent valuation survey. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was employed to estimate our Perception-based Behavioural Intention Model (PBIM) by using a cross-sectional data set of 759 residents of the Jinchuan mining area in Gansu Province, China. We found that Jinchuan residents' WTP for improving local air quality was significantly influenced by the perceived health risk of hazardous pollutants, environmental knowledge, socioeconomic status, current health condition, gender, work environment, and proximity to the pollution source. This study shows that SEM outperforms conventional CVM econometrically and in terms of the provision of relevant policy information. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

To achieve this goal, we use a difference gravity equationin order to explore the time variation in port procedures for 16 Brazilian ports. This paper uses a unique database with local exports, taking into account the port used and products aggregated at the four-digit Harmonized System (HS) level for the period between 2010 and 2012. The estimation results indicate that, in general, each additional hour of delay in port procedures represents costs to Brazilian exporters, which may lead to loss of competitiveness of domestic products abroad. According to the estimates, each additional relative hour of delay in the average port is equivalent to a reduction in relative local exports of similar to 2%. Moreover, a 10% relative reduction in vessel turnaround time can increase the proportional number of exported product categories by 1%. Therefore, our findings suggest that turnaround time has a statistically significant effect on the intensive and extensive margins of international trade.","[Sant'Anna, Vinicios P.] Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Kannebley Junior, Sergio] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Econ Adm & Contabilidade, Dept Econ, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Sant'Anna, VP (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",,"Júnior, Sérgio Kannebley/F-9423-2015; Sant'Anna, Vinicios Poloni/J-7570-2013","Sant'Anna, Vinicios Poloni/0000-0002-1070-2220; Kannebley, Sergio Junior/0000-0003-3389-3354",,,,,15,4,4,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,SEP,2018,41.0,9,,,,,2528,2551,,10.1111/twec.12654,0.0,,,24,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,GS6NI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000443813500010,0

I study parliament's passage of estate bills, a legislation that broke restrictions on land use and made up most of parliament's legislative output from 1660 to 1702 Using a new dataset on estate bills, I first document that the sudden closure (prorogation) of parliament by the monarch caused bills to fail. Probit and OLS estimates show estate bills were 19 percentage points more likely to fail in these sessions. Second, I show conflict delaying revenue bills and conflict with the monarch's interests made sudden prorogations more likely before the Glorious Revolution. Political and constitutional changes with the Glorious Revolution were thus important for England's economic development. They improved parliament's provision of legislation that made property rights more flexible to changing economic opportunities throughout the preindustrial era.","[Dimitruk, Kara] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92717 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Dimitruk, K (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92717 USA.",kdimitru@uci.edu,,,All-UC Economic History Summer Research grant,All-UC Economic History Summer Research grant,"I thank Dan Bogart, Gary Richardson, and Stergios Skaperdas for critical feedback, encouragement, and guidance.

At a congested airport, airborne decisions are related to take-off and landing operations, while ground (taxiway) decisions consist of scheduling aircraft movements between the gates and the runways. Since the runways are the initial/terminal points of both decisions, coordinated actions have a great potential to improve the overall performance. However, in the traffic control practice the different decisions are taken by different controllers, at least in large airports. Weak coordination may result in long queues at the runways, with increasing aircraft delays and energy consumption. This paper investigates models, methods and policies for improving the coordination between taxiway scheduling and airborne scheduling. The performance of a solution is measured in terms of delay and travel time, the latter being related to the energy consumption of an aircraft. A microscopic mathematical formulation is adopted to achieve reliable solutions. Exact and heuristic methods have been analysed in combination with the different policies, based on practical-size instances from Amsterdam Schiphol airport, in the Netherlands. Computational experience shows that good quality solutions can be found within limited time, compatible with real-time operations.","[Sama, Marcella; D'Ariano, Andrea; Pacciarelli, Dario] Roma Tre Univ, Dept Engn Rome, Rome, Italy; [Corman, Francesco] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Maritime & Transport Technol, Delft, Netherlands; [Corman, Francesco] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, Zurich, Switzerland",Roma Tre University; Delft University of Technology; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Pacciarelli, D (通讯作者)，Roma Tre Univ, Dept Engn Rome, Rome, Italy.",pacciarelli@ing.uniroma3.it,"Samà, Marcella/ADE-1055-2022; Samà, Marcella/AFN-5785-2022; Pacciarelli, Dario/D-1073-2009; D'Ariano, Andrea/M-5211-2015","Samà, Marcella/0000-0001-6427-0366; Pacciarelli, Dario/0000-0002-0020-1940; D'Ariano, Andrea/0000-0002-7184-0459",,,,,40,16,17,7,54,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

These data contain the most important facts about the institutions and its customers. A good and efficient data analytics system can find patterns in this huge data source that can be used in actionable knowledge creation. Actionable knowledge is the knowledge that can be put to decision making and take some positive action towards better performance of organizations. This actionable knowledge is termed Business Intelligence by data scientists. Business Intelligence and Analytics is the process of applying data mining techniques to organizational or corporate data to discover patterns. Business Intelligence and Business Analytics are emerging as important and essential fields both for data scientists and organizations. Risk analysis, fraud detection, customer retention, customer satisfaction analysis and actuarial analysis are some of the areas of application of business intelligence and analytics. Credit risk analysis is an important part of a successful financial institution particularly in the banking sector. The current study takes this risk analysis in financial institutions and reviews the state of the art in using data analytics or data mining techniques for financial risk analysis. The analysis of risk from financial data depends on several factors that are both objective and subjective. Hence it is a multi-criteria decision problem. The study also proposes a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) for analyzing financial data for risk analysis and prediction. The proposed MOGA is different from other evolutionary systems in that a memory component to hold the rules is added to the system while other systems in the literature are memory less. The algorithm is applied to bench mark data sets for predicting the decision on credit card and credit applications. The preliminary results are encouraging and show light towards better decision making in reducing risks.","[Srinivasan, Sujatha; Kamalakannan, T.] VELS Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Dept Comp Applicat & Informat Technol, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India","Vels Institute of Science, Technology & Advanced Studies","Srinivasan, S (通讯作者)，VELS Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Dept Comp Applicat & Informat Technol, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India.",ashoksuja03@yahoo.co.in; tkannan722003@gmail.com,"Srinivasan, Sujatha/F-8316-2018","Srinivasan, Sujatha/0000-0001-8797-8703",,,,,20,21,22,2,83,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

On the one hand, unemployment frees up time for more housework by both men and women. On the other hand, once unemployed, women may take on more additional housework than men do, either because they capitalize on their time to act out traditional gender roles or because unemployment compounds women's general disadvantage in household bargaining. Multi-level analyses based on the European Social Survey show that both men and women perform more housework when unemployed. However, the extra domestic work for unemployed women is greater than for unemployed men. They also spend more time on housework when their husband is unemployed.

However, existing literature does not capture the effect of slot allocation decisions on the acceptability of slot schedules. The objective of this paper is to investigate the trade-off between scheduling efficiency and the airlines' dis-utility of slot schedules expressed by various metrics of schedule displacement. We develop and solve two bi-objective scheduling models considering different combinations of total and maximum acceptable slot displacement objectives. The proposed models are applied to real-world scheduling data. Substantial improvements in schedule acceptability metrics are achieved without sacrificing a lot in terms of scheduling efficiency. Sacrifices in scheduling efficiency increase the capability of the airport coordinator to allocate slots that are eventually acceptable and hence more intensively used.","[Zografos, Konstantinos G.] Univ Lancaster, Management Sch, Dept Management Sci, Ctr Transport & Logist CENTRAL, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England; [Androutsopoulos, Konstantinos N.] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Management Sci & Technol, 47A,Evelpidon Str & 33, Athens 11362, Greece; [Madas, Michael A.] Univ Macedonia, Informat Syst & E Business Lab ISeB, Dept Appl Informat, 156 Egnatia Str, Thessaloniki 54636, Greece",Lancaster University; Athens University of Economics & Business; University of Macedonia,"Zografos, KG (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Management Sch, Dept Management Sci, Ctr Transport & Logist CENTRAL, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England.",k.zografos@lancaster.ac.uk; kandro@aueb.gr; mmadas@uom.gr,"Androutsopoulos, Konstantinos N./G-6331-2010","Madas, Michael/0000-0002-9809-8485",UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilEPSRC [EP/MO20258/1]; EPSRC [EP/M020258/1] Funding Source: UKRI,UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilEPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"The work reported in this paper has been supported by the UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilEPSRC) through the Programme Grant EP/MO20258/1 Mathematical models and algorithms for allocating scarce airport resources (OR-MASTER).

Perhaps as a result of this pervasive influence, some have claimed that the EU is itself ordoliberal, resting on a particular understanding of the relationship between ordoliberalism and an economic constitution'. For this claim to be substantiated, the characterization of ordoliberalism needs to persist across time and the EU's law and policy-making spaces.

In a prior study, we estimated an itinerary choice model based on a multinomial logit specification that corrected for price endogeneity. In this paper, we extend the analysis to include inter-itinerary competition along three dimensions: nonstop versus connecting level of service, carrier, and time of day using nested logit (NL) and ordered generalized extreme value (OGEV) models. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first NL and OGEV itinerary choice models to correct for price endogeneity. Despite the many structural changes that have occurred in the airline industry, our results are strikingly similar to models estimated more than a decade ago. These results are important because it suggests that customer preferences, on average, have been stable over time and are similar across distribution channels. The stability in inter-itinerary competition patterns provides an important practical implication for airlines, namely it reduces the need to frequently update the parameter estimates for these models.","[Lurkin, Virginie; Schyns, Michael] Univ Liege, HEC Management Sch, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Garrow, Laurie A.; Newman, Jeffrey P.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 790 Atlantic Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Higgins, Matthew J.] Georgia Inst Technol, Ernest Scheller Jr Coll Business, 800 West Peachtree NW, Atlanta, GA 30308 USA; [Higgins, Matthew J.] NBER, 1050 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Newman, Jeffrey P.] Cambridge Systemat Inc, 115 South LaSalle St,Suite 2200, Chicago, IL 60603 USA; [Lurkin, Virginie] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Route Cantonale, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Liege; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; National Bureau of Economic Research; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne,"Garrow, LA (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 790 Atlantic Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",virginie.lurkin@epfl.ch; laurie.garrow@ce.gatech.edu; matt.higgins@scheller.gatech.edu; jnewman@camsys.com; m.schyns@ulg.ac.be,,"Garrow, Laurie/0000-0003-2445-9687",Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique (FNRS - Belgium),Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique (FNRS - Belgium)(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS),"This research was supported in part by Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique (FNRS - Belgium).

The importance of bus service quality on mode share is often considered but rarely measured explicitly. This study presents a novel temporal data set of geolocated buses from New York City. The merger of locational vehicle data with public schedule data allows for the estimation of bus dependability across neighbourhoods. This study uses plausibly exogenous spatial variation in the introduction New York City's Select Bus Service program to explore the relationship between the policy intervention, bus service quality and changes in commuter mode share. A propensity score matching procedure compares bus reliability and mode share in tracts that received Select Bus Service to a control group. A sizeable treatment effect is found. The policy intervention significantly increased service frequency and improved bus arrival reliability. Additionally, bus mode share amongst commuters in treatment neighbourhoods increased substantially. Select Bus Service was responsible for an increase in local bus mode share of 1.9 percentage points, with bus mode share in the median tract rising from 9.6% to 11.5%. Female commuters are found to be more responsive to the service improvements than males.","[Tyndall, Justin] Univ British Columbia, Sander Sch Business, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Tyndall, J (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Sander Sch Business, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada.",justin.tyndall@sauder.ubc.ca,"Tyndall, Justin/AAQ-6161-2021",,,,,,41,8,9,2,32,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Given the prevalence of poverty in rural areas, farmers have always relied on non-farm income to survive. But the recent shrinking of rural areas has also raised the question of whether pluriactivity has helped the disappearance of farms. This paper explores four main determinants of pluriactivity and extends prior work by considering their relation to the neoclassical and portfolio theories.

Once we subject the finance-growth regressions to model uncertainty, our results suggest that commonly used indicators of financial development are not robustly related to long-term growth. However, the findings from our global sample indicate that one newly developed indicator-the efficiency of financial intermediaries-is robustly related to long-term growth.","[Hasan, Iftekhar] Fordham Univ, Bronx, NY 10458 USA; [Hasan, Iftekhar] Bank Finland, Res Unit, Helsinki, Finland; [Horvath, Roman; Mares, Jan] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic; [Horvath, Roman] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Prague, Czech Republic; [Mares, Jan] Czech Minist Finance, Prague, Czech Republic",Fordham University; Bank of Finland; Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Horvath, R (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic.;Horvath, R (通讯作者)，Czech Acad Sci, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Prague, Czech Republic.",ihasan@fordham.edu; roman.horvath@gmail.com; janxmares@gmail.com,"Horvath, Roman/AAX-8903-2020; Hasan, Iftekhar/IUM-3182-2023; Horvath, Roman/AAD-8248-2019; Mares, Jan/U-7979-2018","Horvath, Roman/0000-0002-9036-9746; Hasan, Iftekhar/0000-0003-2469-0539; Mares, Jan/0000-0001-5809-2268",Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [16-09190S],Grant Agency of the Czech Republic(Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicNorwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD),"We thank Martin Feldkircher and seminar participants at 19th ICMAIF conference (Rethymno, Greece), 32nd International Symposium on Money, Banking and Finance (Nice, France) and 1st World Congress for Comparative Economics (Rome, Italy) for helpful comments.

We expect strong trade unions and left-leaning governments to be associated with more, and more far-reaching labor provisions in PTAs. We also expect the strength of skilled workers relative to the strength of unskilled workers to negatively correlate with the depth of labor provisions in PTAs. In addition, the effect of trade unions should be conditional on both the presence of left government and democracy. We test these hypotheses relying on an original dataset of labor provisions included in 483 PTAs signed between 1990 and 2016. This dataset covers 140 different labor provisions that relate to six overarching dimensions. The quantitative analysis finds support for the expectations concerning the influence of trade unions and the role of a country's skill profile.","[Raess, Damian] Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, Hallerstr 6, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Raess, Damian] Univ Reading, Sch Polit Econ & Int Relat, Whiteknights Campus, Reading RG6 6AA, Berks, England; [Dur, Andreas] Univ Salzburg, Dept Polit Sci & Sociol, Rudolfskai 42, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria; [Sari, Dora] Univ Geneva, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Blvd Pont Arve 40, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Sari, Dora] Harvard Law Sch, Labor & Worklife Program, 8 Mt Auburn St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Bern; University of Reading; Salzburg University; University of Geneva; Harvard University,"Raess, D (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, Hallerstr 6, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.;Raess, D (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Sch Polit Econ & Int Relat, Whiteknights Campus, Reading RG6 6AA, Berks, England.",damian.raess@wti.org; andreas.duer@sbg.ac.at; dora.sari@etu.unige.ch,"Dür, Andreas/HTN-9240-2023","Dür, Andreas/0000-0001-6621-7243; Sari, Dora/0000-0002-0216-7088",Swiss Network for International Studies,Swiss Network for International Studies,"This paper is part of the Swiss Network for International Studies funded project A Social Clause through the Back Door: Labor Provisions in Preferential Trade Agreements (Call for projects 2014; project coordinator: Dr. Damian Raess).

We estimate a data envelopment analysis based efficiency score that allows for direct comparison between ex-post efficiency rankings and test the ex-ante relevance of such scores by including them into asset pricing models. We find that knowing the fund efficiency score can help explain time-series returns. When efficiency is included in an asset pricing model, the absolute value of the average mispricing error is decreased, which we take as evidence of the explanatory power of efficiency scores. But more importantly, we show that efficacy scores can be used as next period predictors of stock returns. In addition, we further use the efficiency scores to differentiate between the performance of constrained and unconstrained investment assets, as in the case of socially responsible investments. Our findings give robustness to the literature on constrained investments showing significant underperformance of socially and responsible investments.","[Rubio, J.

Building on and expanding Noora Lori's work around this concept, the article examines intra-EU migrants' increasingly unsettled legal statuses as potentially precarious citizenship. Focusing on the experiences of young university-educated intra-EU migrants in Brussels, the article claims that, in the absence of straightforward EU legislation and explicit government policies, administrative actors use their discretion to draw indeterminate boundaries enforcing conditionality and temporariness of status for EU citizens in precarious work arrangements, therefore often increasing the pressure on them to take further precarious jobs. The article argues that, under the conditions of precarious employment, not even migrants with privileged access to citizenship rights are protected from processes of boundary enforcement that institutionalise the ambiguity of statuses and produce precarious citizenship.","[Simola, Anna] Univ Helsinki, Ctr Excellence Res Ageing & Care RG Migrat Care &, Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Simola, A (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Dept Social Res, PL 54, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",anna.simola@helsinki.fi,"Simola, anna/AAE-7350-2020","Simola, Anna/0000-0003-0948-4315","Palkansaajasaatio, Centre of Excellence for Research on Ageing and Care [312310]; Academy of Finland project 'Citizenisation in the Local Welfare State' [1273392]","Palkansaajasaatio, Centre of Excellence for Research on Ageing and Care; Academy of Finland project 'Citizenisation in the Local Welfare State'","This research receives funding from Palkansaajasaatio, Centre of Excellence for Research on Ageing and Care (RG 3 Migration, Care and Ageing, #312310) and from Academy of Finland project 'Citizenisation in the Local Welfare State' (no. 1273392).",,51,19,19,0,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

This paper evaluates the distributional consequences of trade liberalization within industries differentiating two distinct aspects in which trade liberalization could result in higher trade flows: the intensive vs. the extensive margin of trade. In particular, we analyze whether trade liberalization leads to increased trade flows because either firms trade more volume in products they have already traded before (intensive margin) or because they start to trade products they have not traded previously (extensive margin), or both. We test these arguments for the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) and exporting firms based in Costa Rica for the time-period 2008-2014. The results of our study suggest that the effects of CAFTA-DR depend not only on whether we analyze the extensive versus the intensive margin of trade but also whether the product in question is homogenous or differentiated and whether the exporting firm under analysis is small or large. In particular, we find support for the theoretical expectation that firms exporting heterogeneous products, such as textiles, gain from trade agreements, such as CAFTA-DR, in that they can export more varieties of their products. Yet at the same time, they tend to lose at the intensive margin by a reduction in their trade volume while the opposite pattern occurs for firms exporting homogenous products.","[Spilker, Gabriele] Univ Salzburg, Rudolfskai 42, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria; [Bernauer, Thomas] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Kim, In Song] MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Milner, Helen] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Osgood, Iain] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Tingley, Dustin] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Salzburg University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Princeton University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Harvard University,"Spilker, G (通讯作者)，Univ Salzburg, Rudolfskai 42, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria.",gabriele.spilker@sbg.ac.at,"Song, In/B-2895-2017; Tingley, Dustin/C-8495-2011; Spilker, Gabriele/GWU-7329-2022","Song, In/0000-0002-5774-1585; Bernauer, Thomas/0000-0002-3775-6245",Paris Lodron University of Salzburg,Paris Lodron University of Salzburg,"Open access funding provided by Paris Lodron University of Salzburg.

Overall, our results do not support the claim that EA membership constituted a weakness during the recent financial crisis. On the contrary, we find that EA membership decreases the probability of a sudden stop, all else equal. We find no evidence that being part of the EA has a direct effect on the probability of bonanza. When allowing for interaction effects, our results suggest that EA membership might have mitigated the risk perception arising from higher government debt in the case of bonanzas.","[De Freitas, Miguel Lebre; Nunes, Luis Catela; Rodrigues, Madalena Sampaio] Univ Nova Lisboa, Nova Sch Business & Econ, Campus Campolide, P-1099032 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Nunes, LC (通讯作者)，Univ Nova Lisboa, Nova Sch Business & Econ, Campus Campolide, P-1099032 Lisbon, Portugal.",lcnunes@novasbe.pt,"de freitas, miguel lebre/AAA-4358-2020; Catela Nunes, Luis/G-1989-2011","de freitas, miguel lebre/0000-0002-9409-2115; Catela Nunes, Luis/0000-0001-8115-6223",FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia [UID/ECO/00124/2013]; POR Lisboa [LISBOA-01-0145-FEDER-007722]; Nova Forum,FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); POR Lisboa; Nova Forum,"The authors wish to thank JCMS co-editor Amy Verdun and three anonymous referees for valuable comments.

In particular, it aims to identify common factors. The empirical results suggest that MLB fan preferences were simple in the early years (1904-1957) with respect to common factors and then became multifaceted in later years (1958-2012), because the number of significant common factors increased from four to seven. Time trends and per capita gross domestic product were significant over the whole sample period, but outcome uncertainties and offensive performance, such as slugging performance, became newly significant common factors influencing attendance in later years. This indicates that fans consider not only their home team's characteristics but also the characteristics of the away teams; then, in the modern era, it became critical for the league to implement elaborate business measures to promote competitive balance and slugging performance.","[Lee, Young H.] Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, 1 Sinsoo Dong, Seoul 136792, South Korea",Sogang University,"Lee, YH (通讯作者)，Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, 1 Sinsoo Dong, Seoul 136792, South Korea.",yhnlee@sogang.ac.kr,"Lee, Young/AFO-2829-2022","Lee, Young/0000-0002-1104-9446",,,,,12,11,11,0,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

In these models, travel time to work (firms) is the single most important factor for residential land-use allocation. New theories of complex urban systems (CUS), however, have begun to cast some doubt on the efficacy of the distance to COD model. There is some evidence for example, that large urban systems might evolve with scale-free transportation networks. In this paper, we examine urban land-use data from the Chicago Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) to argue for a theoretical shift from a distance to CBD based prototype to one that considers the complexity inherent in urban systems structure. We use a Stochastic Greedy Algorithm to quantify connectivity and attractions to every land cell (30 x 30 m) to existing population and employment centers, Points of Interests (POIs), and highway and major roads. We measure the frequency of commercial and resident land-uses relative to these found attraction levels and develop algorithms that help explain the relations. Using these methods, we find that both CBD-driven and network-driven approaches are empirically valid for explaining current urban structures. We also find, however, that these relations change when temporal variables are considered. For example, we found that the land-use change in Chicago from 2001 to 2011 is an obvious deviation from the distance to CBD based urban growth assumption. Our results suggest that we should re-examine the core urban structure assumptions of spatial equilibrium models.","[Pan, Haozhi; Hewings, Geoffrey] Univ Illinois, Reg Econ Applicat Lab, Room 67,1301 West Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Deal, Brian] Univ Illinois, Dept Landscape Architecture, Room 228 Temple Buell Hall 611 Taft Dr, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Chen, Yan] Univ N Carolina, Dept City & Reg Planning, New East Bldg,CB 3140, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Pan, HZ (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Reg Econ Applicat Lab, Room 67,1301 West Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",hpan8@illinois.edu; deal@illinoise.edu; yanc@live.unc.edu; hewings@illinois.edu,"Hewings, Geoffrey John Dennis/B-2058-2014; Pan, Haozhi/A-6408-2017","Hewings, Geoffrey John Dennis/0000-0003-2560-3273; Pan, Haozhi/0000-0002-0709-632X",NSF [1429699],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The work used the ROGER supercomputer, which is supported by NSF under grant number: 1429699.

Using microlevel trade and tariff data at the HS 8-digit level for the European Union, we investigate whether the use of anti-dumping measures has acted as a catalyst in subsequent multilateral tariff negotiations. Our findings suggest that anti-dumping policies may have reduced the resistance of domestic protectionist forces towards major tariff reforms, as they show significantly larger tariff cuts for products previously involved in an anti-dumping investigation.","[Ketterer, Tobias D.] European Commiss, Brussels, Belgium",,"Ketterer, TD (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Brussels, Belgium.",,,,,,,,20,1,1,2,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,APR,2018,41.0,4,,,SI,,1111,1130,,10.1111/twec.12634,0.0,,,20,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,GC9JM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430113300009,0

In the last two decades, the accumulation of housing wealth by Chinese households has not been effectively transmitted to their final consumption. We discovered that the sustained increase in household wealth and housing-ownership rate in China has been accompanied by a decrease in consumption rate. We also identified a negative correlation between housing price and household consumption for both the homeowners who own one housing unit and those who own two units of housing. We investigated this phenomenon in China both theoretically and empirically by capturing the dual nature of housing as a consumption good and an investment vehicle. We found that the demand for second housing units is motivated by increasing housing consumption demand rather than pure investment needs. To explain the mechanisms that drive household-consumption behavior, we also explored the effects on household consumption of China's educational system, marriage market and ageing society, as well as future housing-market uncertainty. The implications of government intervention in the housing market are discussed.","[Yang, Zan; Fan, Ying; Zhao, Liqing] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Contruct Management, Tsinghua Hang Lung Ctr Real Estate, Beijing, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University,"Yang, Z (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Dept Contruct Management, Tsinghua Hang Lung Ctr Real Estate, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zanyang@tsinghua.edu.cn; fanying13@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; liqingzhao1989@gmail.com,"Yang, Zan/G-7619-2015","FAN, Ying/0000-0003-0189-9524","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673154, 71461137002]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71673154 and 71461137002).

Further, our conflict experiment allows us to study whether lack of coordination or fear of retaliation may refrain individuals from rioting despite their willingness to riot. Our conflict game consists of two-stages. In a first stage, subjects play a proportional rent-seeking game to share a prize. In a second stage, players can coordinate with the other members of their group to reduce (burn) the other group members' payoffs. Our treatments differ in the extent of inequality. Precisely, in the first series of treatments (called symmetric treatments), inequality only arises from different investment behaviors of players in the first stage. In a second series of treatments (called asymmetric treatments), inequality is strongly reinforced by attributing to some subjects (the advantaged group) a larger share of the price than other subjects (the disadvantaged group) for the same amount of effort. While the former refer to inequality of effort the latter is related to exogenous inequality of circumstances (bad luck). We ran these treatments under both partner and stranger matching protocol. Consistent with the assumption of inequality aversion, we observe that disadvantaged groups burn significantly more money than advantaged groups in the asymmetric treatment. However, we also observe that the relationship between inequality and conflicts is non-linear since the frequency of conflicts is significantly higher in the symmetric treatment where inequality is moderate compared to the asymmetric treatment where inequality is extreme. Resignation seems to be the main driving force behind this phenomenon. Our findings also shed light on the important role played by coordination.","[Abbink, Klaus] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Masclet, David] Univ Rennes 1, CREM, CNRS, 7 Pl Hoche, F-35065 Rennes, France; [Mirza, Daniel] Univ Orleans, LEO, CNRS, 50 Ave Jean Portalis, F-37000 Tours, France; [Mirza, Daniel] Univ Francois Rabelais Tours, 50 Ave Jean Portalis, F-37000 Tours, France",Monash University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Rennes; Universite de Orleans; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Mirza, D (通讯作者)，Univ Orleans, LEO, CNRS, 50 Ave Jean Portalis, F-37000 Tours, France.;Mirza, D (通讯作者)，Univ Francois Rabelais Tours, 50 Ave Jean Portalis, F-37000 Tours, France.",klaus.abbink@monash.edu; david.masclet@univ-rennes1.fr; daniel.mirza@univ-tours.fr,"Mirza, Daniel/Q-1795-2018","Mirza, Daniel/0000-0002-0685-2939; Abbink, Klaus/0000-0003-4436-604X",Agence Nationale de Recherche (ANR) [ANR-08-JCJC-0105-01]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-08-JCJC-0105] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR),Agence Nationale de Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"We wish to thank Elven for programming the experiment.

To achieve this, we start with a spatial autoregressive model with an acceptable form for the generating process for the elements of the endogenous spatial weights matrix as in Qu and Lee (2015). Our test statistic is simple to calculate because it requires computationally simple estimations. By construction, the test statistic is robust in the sense that its asymptotic null distribution is a centered chi-square distribution regardless of the (local) presence of a spatial autoregressive parameter in the alternative model. We summarize the asymptotic properties of our test statistic under the null and the alternative hypotheses. To investigate its finite sample size and power properties, we conduct a Monte Carlo study. The results are in line with our theoretical findings and indicate that the robust test has good size and power properties.","[Bera, Anil K.; Dogan, Osman] Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60680 USA; [Taspinar, Suleyman] CUNY Queens Coll, Econ program, New York, NY USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Dogan, O (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60680 USA.",abera@illlnois.edu; odogan@illinois.edu; staspinar@qc.cuny.edu,"Dogan, Osman/HJG-9407-2022; Dogan, Osman/AAW-3381-2021","Dogan, Osman/0000-0001-7324-9454","National Science Foundation [CNS-0958379, CNS-0855217, ACI-1126113]; City University of New York High Performance Computing Center at the College of Staten Island",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); City University of New York High Performance Computing Center at the College of Staten Island(General Electric),"This research was supported, in part, under National Science Foundation Grants CNS-0958379, CNS-0855217, ACI-1126113 and the City University of New York High Performance Computing Center at the College of Staten Island.",,44,6,6,0,12,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

Previous research on squatting has shed light on how the provision of formal land titles affects a number of socioeconomic outcomes and a subset of this research has provided estimates on how the provision of formal titles affects property values. However, the phenomenon of squatting encompasses a variety of informal property rights distinct from the possession of a legal title. Using an exceptionally rich household data set including geo-location at the community level we study the effects of both formal and informal property rights on property values. Having a title increases property values by almost 7 percent and squatting on the land by invasion reduces values by about 6 percent. Using these estimates, we determine the potential losses of property tax revenue and are able to study the issue of squatting in the context of public finance.","[Hawley, Zackary; Sawyer, W.

We showcase the advantages of our proposed methodology in terms of an empirical study on the banking sectors of five former communist countries during the period 2000-2008.

The strategy of a store in the chain does not only involve coordination with the other stores in the same chain, but also competition against opponent stores in other chains. To estimate the system, we extend the generalized method of moments framework based on linear and quadratic moment conditions proposed by Lee (2007) and Lin and Lee (2010). We show that under some regularity assumptions the proposed GMM estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal. We derive the best GMM estimator under normality and propose a robust GMM estimator against unknown heteroskedasticity. Monte Carlo experiments are conducted to study the finite sample performance of the GMM estimation.

With increased out-migration, poorer households invested more in housing and durable goods than rich households, while richer households invested significantly more in non-agricultural production assets. As migration became easier, increased participation in migrant employment was greater among poorer households on both the extensive and intensive margins, and poorer households reduced labor days in agriculture.","[de Brauw, Alan] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Giles, John] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Giles, John] IZA, Washington, DC USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); The World Bank,"Giles, J (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.;Giles, J (通讯作者)，IZA, Washington, DC USA.",a.debrauw@cgiar.org; jgiles@worldbank.org,,"Giles, John/0000-0003-1935-6632","Knowledge for Change Program at the World Bank; CGIAR research program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets","Knowledge for Change Program at the World Bank; CGIAR research program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets","The research for this article was supported by the Knowledge for Change Program at the World Bank and the CGIAR research program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets.

We firstly empirically test for breaks in the time series of gross margins. Our results indicate that there is only one break-point, in mid-2008, just when the demand for automotive fuels drops due to the economic crisis and the difference between the Spanish and the European retail margins increase notably. In addition, a regression analysis shows that the gross retail margins were higher during the recessive period of the Spanish economy (2008-2013) than before. Furthermore, we examine the causes of the break-point and of the subsequent evolution of margins. We find no evidence to support either the prohibition of using retail price maintenance (RPM) and recommended prices in the supply contracts or a supply cost change of automotive fuels as the cause of the evolution of retail margins. In addition, empirical evidence indicates that retail prices respond symmetrically to changes in wholesale prices. Instead, we show that the data are consistent with some firms exercising market power during the recessive period of the Spanish economy.","[Bello, Alejandro; Contin-Pilart, Ignacio] Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Gest Empresas, Campus Arrosadia, Navarra 31006, Spain; [Bello, Alejandro; Contin-Pilart, Ignacio] Univ Publ Navarra, INARBE Inst Adv Res Business & Econ, Campus Arrosadia, Navarra 31006, Spain; [Blanca Palacios, Ma] Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Estadist & Invest Operat, Campus Arrosadia, Navarra 31006, Spain",Universidad Publica de Navarra; Universidad Publica de Navarra; Universidad Publica de Navarra,"Contin-Pilart, I (通讯作者)，Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Gest Empresas, Campus Arrosadia, Navarra 31006, Spain.;Contin-Pilart, I (通讯作者)，Univ Publ Navarra, INARBE Inst Adv Res Business & Econ, Campus Arrosadia, Navarra 31006, Spain.",alejandro.bello@unavarra.es; contin@unavarra.es; blanca.palacios@unavarra.es,"Contín-Pilart, Ignacio/K-6383-2017; Palacios, MB/K-3763-2014",,,,,,54,3,3,0,10,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2018,39.0,,,,1,,57,78,,10.5547/01956574.39.SI1.abel,0.0,,,22,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HJ4BL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000457118600006,0

Corporate bankruptcies are an inherent element of the market economy. In the Czech Republic in 2006 was published a law no. 182/2006 Coll., On Bankruptcy and Its Resolution (Insolvency Act), which came into effect from January 1st, 2008. This law came into effect just at a time when the new financial crisis started getting stronger. This crisis has affected the development of corporate bankruptcies not only in the Czech Republic but also in other countries. Corporate Bankruptcies (Mgczynska, 2009) are the necessary selection mechanism in the world of business and have an important rationalizing function - they rid the market of entities that are unable to meet the appropriate efficiency requirements. The aim of this paper is to analyze the development of corporate bankruptcies - the comparison between the development of corporate insolvency proposals and corporate bankruptcies (using total and monthly data) in the Czech Republic over the last decade - in the period 2008 to 2017 with a forecast for 2018. The software STATGRAPHICS Centurion will be used for this analysis.

If one explores the city as an element of a society, then it appears as a socio-spatial form of its existence. A high level of the centralization and a strong powerful vertical with weak horizontal links, including between regions and cities, leads to a distorted vision of the position of one or another region or a big city in the economy of the state, in the social, cultural sphere and in the politics. Large cities with large areas and number of population at a certain stage of their development face the invocation of spatial problems caused by various objective factors and conditions that are inherent in one or another territory. The bigger the area of the city, the more irregularly the potential of the population, of material and cultural resources is located on its territory, the more acute the problems of spatial disproportions are, which may under certain conditions pose a threat to the further development and the prosperity. Taking into account a many-year disregard of the importance of the state regional policy concerning the development of large cities, a reduction of its size, a suspention of the construction in it, a crisis in management, an ignoring of the effect and consequences caused by various instruments and measures of sectoral policies on the city's space, an accessibility of its territories, a building activity, an attractiveness for life and running business, their competitiveness and investment attractiveness, their stability and security, their tourism potential and social prosperity, it is proposed to study the development of space, the efficiency of its use and the degree of importance of increasing the prosperity of large cities as the commanders of states of our country. Afterwards, today, in the context of growing the global civilizational inquiries, the changes in the role and the position of individual cities in a world system of economic and political coordinate systems, the question of production a new effective state regional policy, especially the regulation of the development of large cities and the effective use of their spatial potentials in Ukraine, is becoming extremely relevant.","[Bileha, Olena] Odessa State Acad Civil Engn & Architecture, Odessa, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Odessa State Academy of Civil Engineering and Architecture,"Bileha, O (通讯作者)，Odessa State Acad Civil Engn & Architecture, Odessa, Ukraine.",olena_bileha@ukr.net,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,118,124,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540723300014,0

One of the key strategies to slow down and limit its development and spread is to promote good antimicrobial stewardship by medical professionals, i.e. doctors and veterinarians. Multiple studies have endeavoured to understand the nature and construction of good stewardship in human medicine - and to some extent in farm animal practice - and it is increasingly realised that different constructions of ethical responsibility are affecting prescribing practice. Equivalent work has seldom been carried out with companion animal veterinarians. This paper will describe some of the ethical issues raised by antimicrobial prescribing in order to explore the interplay between constructions of responsibility. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews with veterinary practitioners, then coded and analysed thematically. This paper will focus on a sub-set of the empirical results illustrating the challenges companion animal veterinarians face while handling antimicrobials, and how they construct the notion of ethical responsibility in antimicrobial prescribing. This initial work presents the perspectives of veterinarians on antimicrobial prescription, and promotes a wider appreciation of professional constructions of responsibility. Results are intended to inform the development of new clinical guidelines and strategies to promote antimicrobial stewardship.","[Cartelet, C.; Hobson-West, P.; Millar, K.] Univ Nottingham, Ctr Appl Bioeth, Sch Vet Med & Sci, Sutton Bonington Campus, Loughborough LE12 5RD, England; [Cartelet, C.; Hobson-West, P.; Millar, K.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Biosci, Sutton Bonington Campus, Loughborough LE12 5RD, England; [Raman, S.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Sociol & Social Policy, Inst Sci & Soc ISS, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham; University of Nottingham; University of Nottingham,"Cartelet, C (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Ctr Appl Bioeth, Sch Vet Med & Sci, Sutton Bonington Campus, Loughborough LE12 5RD, England.;Cartelet, C (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Biosci, Sutton Bonington Campus, Loughborough LE12 5RD, England.",clio.cartelet@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Raman, Sujatha/0000-0002-9037-5716",Leverhulme Trust [RP2011-SP-013],Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),We would like to thank all the participants for their time and involvement in the study and the Leverhulme Trust for funding this PhD as part of the `Making Science Public: Challenges and Opportunities' research programme [RP2011-SP-013].,,21,1,1,0,1,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,296,301,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_46,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000046,0

For this particular study, the focus group is selected as the most appropriate data collection method for high-quality research. To find out individuals' opinions and attitudes two focus group discussions were carried out. Members from various industries were included in discussion groups. In aggregate, opinions of the employees from 38 different companies were summarized regarding the aspects of decision making in organizations. Results of researches show that that any organization can improve the speed and quality of the decision making by paying more attention to the process approach. Results of discussions showed that advanced analytics, intelligent algorithms and data storage provide organizations with powerful new approaches to decision making and improves decision-making dynamics. To identify the need for changes based on management decisions, a manager should follow events in the environment and analyse the extent, to which they affect the performance of the organization. There are many decisions influenced by intelligent algorithms and devices.

Thus, we argue that state capitalism in the Russian natural gas industry can be understood through the idealistic claims of state power and of serving the national interest, which underpin the dominant perception of natural gas resources as a foreign policy tool. Moreover, we contend that although this perception is often considered as a product of the last decade, in fact it is rooted in history, as a legacy of the Soviet era.","[Charokopos, Michael] Univ Piraeus, Masters Program Energy, Dept Int & European Studies, 126 Gr Lambraki Str, Piraeus 18532, Greece; [Dagoumas, Athanasios] Univ Piraeus, Dept Int & European Studies, 126 Gr Lambraki Str, Piraeus 18532, Greece",University of Piraeus; University of Piraeus,"Charokopos, M (通讯作者)，Univ Piraeus, Masters Program Energy, Dept Int & European Studies, 126 Gr Lambraki Str, Piraeus 18532, Greece.",mchar78@gmail.com; dagoumas@unipi.gr,"Dagoumas, Athanasios/B-1116-2010","Dagoumas, Athanasios/0000-0001-7524-5262; CHAROKOPOS, MICHAEL/0000-0002-6146-8016",,,,,61,9,9,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2018,70.0,3,,,,,441,461,,10.1080/09668136.2018.1448367,0.0,,,21,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,GE1WB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431006400006,0

Such tasks in EU countries are performed by rural development programmes (RDP), created under the second pillar of the Common Agricultural Policy. The aim of the paper is to define the role of RDPs in driving the transformation of the agricultural sector in selected countries of East-Central Europe - the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Romania - for the years 2007-2013. The authors attempt to find certain interrelationships between the premises of rural development programmes and the funds directed their way, and changes in the agricultural sector for each of the economies. The work uses critical analysis of subject literature, meta-analysis, deductive and inductive reasoning, as well as a comparative analysis using elements of time series analysis (analysis of dynamics and structure changes). The main conclusion is that: 1. the second pillar of CAP was undoubtedly an important element of support for rural areas in the countries of East-Central Europe; 2. the accumulated effects of the support led to a considerable improvement in the income situation of agricultural producers; 3. investment expenditures led to structural changes at farm level. In relation to the above, the key issue is to keep a relatively high level of funding for the second pillar of CAP for EU-12 countries after 2020.","[Czyzewski, Bazyli; Stepien, Sebastian] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Poznan, Poland; [Maican, Silvia] 1 Decembrie 1918 Univ Alba Iulia, Alba Iulia, Romania",Poznan University of Economics & Business; 1 Decembrie 1918 University Alba Iulia,"Czyzewski, B (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Poznan, Poland.",bazylicz@interia.pl; sebastian.stepien@ue.poznan.pl; smihalache@uab.ro,"Czyżewski, Bazyli/Y-4679-2019; Maican, Silvia-Ştefania/AAZ-2609-2020",,National Science Centre in Poland [2016/21/B/HS4/00653],"National Science Centre in Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)",The paper was written as a part of research project titled Determinants of food security and sustainable development of small farms in Poland against the background of the European Union regions.

Different factors have been blamed, or praised, for having caused the price slump: the expansion of renewable energy; the near-collapse of the European emissions trading scheme; over-optimistic power plant investments; a decline in final electricity consumption; and cheap coal and natural gas. This ex-post study of European electricity markets from 2008 to 2015 uses a fundamental power market model to quantify their individual contributions on day-ahead prices. The two countries we study in detail, Germany and Sweden, differ significantly: fuel and CO 2 prices were important price drivers in Germany, but in Sweden it was electricity demand. This difference is explained by the nature of the hydro-dominate Nordic electricity system. In both countries, however, the single largest factor depressing prices was the expansion of renewable energy. At the same time, Germany's nuclear phase-out had an upward effect on prices. If one defines the Energiewende as the combination of these two policies, its net effect on power prices was negligible.","[Hirth, Lion] Neon Neue Energieokon GmbH, Karl Marx Pl 12, D-12043 Berlin, Germany; [Hirth, Lion] Hertie Sch Governance, Berlin, Germany; [Hirth, Lion] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Berlin, Germany",Hertie School,"Hirth, L (通讯作者)，Neon Neue Energieokon GmbH, Karl Marx Pl 12, D-12043 Berlin, Germany.;Hirth, L (通讯作者)，Hertie Sch Governance, Berlin, Germany.;Hirth, L (通讯作者)，Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Berlin, Germany.",hirth@neon-energie.de,,,Svensk Energi,Svensk Energi,"Funding by Svensk Energi is gratefully acknowledged.

There are strong grounds for believing that these stories are largely nonsense, yet they inform policy and are widely believed among mass publics, and have proved almost impossible to refute in everyday political discourse. The answer to this puzzle, we suggest, is that such claims are better thought of as bullshit (as conceptualised by Harry Frankfurt 2005) rather than outright falsehoods: in other words, as speech acts that are indifferent to the truth and proceed without effective concern for the veracity of the claim in question. In this paper, we examine the characteristics of political bullshit applied to economic policy debates since the financial crisis, and seek to explain its hold on the popular imagination. We assess what makes some particular brands of bullshit more successful than others, and argue that in a world of competing realities as well as competing theories, the power of rhetoric is more likely to settle an argument than evidence and logic.","[Hopkin, Jonathan] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Govt, London, England; [Rosamond, Ben] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Polit Sci, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Copenhagen,"Hopkin, J (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Govt, London, England.",j.r.hopkin@lse.ac.uk,"Hopkin, Jonathan/C-4396-2017",,,,,,86,47,47,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

However, little has been done to explore the role that countries with regional leadership aspirations have played in fostering regional integration. Why do regional powers pursue different forms of leadership to exert economic influence over their neighbors and achieve regional hegemony? Through a comparison of Russia and Turkey, I argue that elite national identity conceptions construct national economic interests and shape foreign economic policies of these regional powers. In both countries, ruling elites have embraced national identity conceptions that were in stark contrast to the national identity conceptions of their predecessors. Russia under Putin has pursued a coercive hegemonic form of leadership in Eurasia contrary to the Yeltsin era. Conversely, Turkey under Erdogan has pursued liberal regional economic leadership in the Middle East as opposed to the coercive and isolationist policies of Westernist elites. In both cases, the consolidation of political power and international developments have strengthened the prevalent national identity conceptions at home, and reinforced regional economic leadership strategies. As it highlights the domestic ideational sources of the pursuit of regional hegemony, this study has implications for the study of regional powers, regionalism and economic nationalism.","[Kostem, Seckin] Bilkent Univ, Dept Int Relat, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey",Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University,"Köstem, S (通讯作者)，Bilkent Univ, Dept Int Relat, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.",kostem@bilkent.edu.tr,"Köstem, Seçkin/AAE-5353-2019","Kostem, Seckin/0000-0001-8356-444X",,,,,95,13,17,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

They testify to the degree of attractiveness of such country as a potential place of capital location. The conditions for foreign capital generate investment risk, which is one of the factors determining the inclination to invest abroad. One type of conditions for the inflow and functioning of foreign capital to a given country are political conditions, which are to be understood as the overall political relations in a given country, resulting from political views of important persons and groups. One of the aspects of political views in general are economic views of a given authority, which form the basis of the pursued economic policy, including policy with respect to the foreign capital. Transformation of the Polish economic system from centrally controlled economy to market economy called for huge capital outlays, which could not have been provided by limited potential of domestic financial accumulation Therefore, efforts were undertaken to supplement the domestic possibilities of financing changes with foreign financial assets as supplementary in relation to the first group. The degree of such complementarity, rational from the point of view of economy's interests, was discussed. The objectives and assumptions of policy of subsequent Polish governments with respect to the foreign capital, in particular foreign direct investments (FDI), were described in relevant governmental documents. It is possible to distinguish two basic stages of governmental policy with respect to the foreign capital in Poland, namely before the accession to the European Union (EU), and in particular in the 1990s, and after the accession to the EU.","[Kozlowska, Magdalena] Univ Econ Katowice, Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Kozlowska, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Katowice, Poland.",magdalena.kozlowska@ue.katowice.pl,"Mężyńska, Magdalena/T-2182-2018",,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,62,68,,10.33938/186-62,0.0,,,7,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540718700006,0

Trump, President of the United States of America returned a salute of Col. Gen.

The return of the salute was heavily criticised not only by politicians in the U.S., but rather subject to harsh critique and condemnation in most of the U.S. media. In this paper, the historical basis for a salute and saluting itself was reviewed and brought into a diplomatic context. For a better comprehension of Trump's behaviour, and what might be behind his way of solving the DPRK-issue, Trump's earlier behaviour, before his presidency as a businessman, was subject to interpretation and contextualization. Furthermore, the U.S. media reaction regarding the salute and the U.S.-DPRK summit was subject to content analysis. Additionally, reactions from domestic political parties- and persons of the U.S., and international reactions allowed the authors of this paper to discuss findings, enabled them to draw conclusions, and develop implications for further research: It was found out that there is a vivid discord between media reception and the original context of the appearance by Trump. Diminishing the historic meaning of a salute and overlooking the effrontery to honour an adversary officer has been accepted by Trump deliberately, eventually cutting down all presence to a personal level. Nevertheless, this strategic move won over the DPRK media and leadership and might play a significant role in the development of future U.S.-DPRK relations and the reunification process of North- and South Korea.","[Krieter, Konstantin] Univ Rostock, Philosoph Fak, August Bebel Str 28, D-18055 Rostock, Germany; [Hoffer, Thomas] Univ Appl Sci Burgenland, Int Econ Relat & Management, A-7000 Eisenstadt, Austria",University of Rostock,"Krieter, K (通讯作者)，Univ Rostock, Philosoph Fak, August Bebel Str 28, D-18055 Rostock, Germany.",konstantin.krieter@uni-rostock.de; 1719001135@fh-burgenland.at,,,,,,,66,0,0,0,0,EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"UNIV ECONOMICS, EKONOMICKA UNIVERZITA & BRATISLAVE, DOLNOZEMSKA CESTA 1, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-4602-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,366,386,,,,,,21,Economics; International Relations; Political Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,BN0AA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000471959900041,0

While attention has been given to wild animal predation, most notably by Jeff McMahan, the suffering caused in sustaining captive carnivorous animals is absent from the discourse. McMahan argues that humans have an obligation to reduce suffering by aiding prey animals in the wild. I present his arguments in favour of interfering with predation as well as arguments against such obligations. McMahan lays the moral groundwork for a wide range of interference; however, interfering to the extent he suggests is currently infeasible. His arguments become stronger when applied to captive animals. Captive predation presents a situation in which humans have already interfered, and where further interference to alleviate suffering caused in sustaining captive carnivorous animals is practical and morally necessary. The carnivorous animals I consider are those kept as pets, in zoos and aquariums, and in rehabilitation centres. Cultured meat is the ideal candidate to replace the meat being fed to these animals. Current research is predominantly directed toward supplementing meat consumption by humans. I argue that it makes sense to direct research and development of cultured meat toward supplementing the diets of captive carnivorous animals. Feeding these animals cultured meat would result in an immense reduction in suffering and death for animals who would otherwise be killed to sustain them.","[Kristensen, B.] Oregon State Univ, Sch Hist Philosophy & Relig, 2520 SW Campus Way, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Oregon State University,"Kristensen, B (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Sch Hist Philosophy & Relig, 2520 SW Campus Way, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",kristenb@oregonstate.edu,,"Kristensen, Bjorn Ralf/0000-0002-5694-7880",,,,,18,1,1,0,8,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,152,156,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_22,0.0,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000022,0

Whilst the Coalition government effectively re-established the UK's finance-led' growth model, it simultaneously broke with the legitimation strategy which New Labour had advanced in the pre-crisis conjuncture. The Coalition advanced a distinctive two nations' strategy which sought to secure a limited but durable base of support in a context of fiscal consolidation. This strategy was conditional upon the deep and unprecedented period of real wage decline which took hold in the post-crisis conjuncture. However, the Coalition successfully transformed this potential liability into a political asset, constructing a series of moralised antagonisms' between wage earners and welfare recipients, on the one hand, and private and public sector workers, on the other. Whilst this strategy secured a limited base of popular support, it also re-embedded a series of structural weaknesses within post-crisis UK capitalism. These imbalances are likely to undermine the stability of the UK's finance-led growth model in the future and will condition British politics as the country embarks upon the process of leaving of the EU.","[Lavery, Scott] Univ Sheffield, SPERI, 219 Portobello, Sheffield S1 4DP, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Lavery, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, SPERI, 219 Portobello, Sheffield S1 4DP, S Yorkshire, England.",scott.lavery@sheffield.ac.uk,,,,,,,124,16,18,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The nature of these effects remains ambiguous according to theoretical and empirical literature review, especially for developing countries. Indeed, these effects are analyzed in the context of a behavior's imbalance that can be caused by decentralization between local expenditures and their coverage by local own revenues. We are interested in Morocco for the period 2002-2014, taking into consideration all the Moroccan territorial communities grouped by the 16 regions. The effects are analyzed for total own revenue and then for each type of own-revenues and taking into account the endogeneity effect of transfers as a key issue. It is concluded that an increase in transferred central revenues does not necessarily encourage local own revenues in Morocco.

This paper examines whether neofunctionalism may be able to explain a major case of European refugee crisis' policy-making, the negotiations on the European Border and Coast Guard regulation. We argue, somewhat counterintuitively, that the theory considerably furthers our respective understanding. The crisis acted as a catalyst exposing the weaknesses of a system that pitted a supranational Schengen against a largely intergovernmental external border regime, notwithstanding a developing Frontex. These dysfunctionalities have been widely fostered by both national and supranational decision-makers shrinking from the significant economic, political and sunk costs of Schengen disintegration, thus ruling out the possibility for spillback. Additionally, further integration was substantially nurtured by supranational agency, socialized' national civil servants, transnational NGOs and European business associations.","[Niemann, Arne; Speyer, Johanna] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Mainz, Germany",Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,"Niemann, A (通讯作者)，Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Polit Sci, Jakob Welder Weg 12, D-55128 Mainz, Germany.",arne.niemann@uni-mainz.de,"Speyer, Johanna/AAM-8986-2021","Speyer, Johanna/0000-0002-9317-6069",,,,,75,47,48,2,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Thus, there should be another alternative livelihood in peat land corresponding to community's local potency.

The analysis demonstrates that electoral manipulation presents conflicting incentives for the Kremlin and its regional officials.

These companies pursue an audience rating maximization, which depends heavily on the schedule of the league matches. At the same time, clubs try to maximize their home attendance and find themselves affected by the schedule as well. Our article aims to capture the Belgian soccer fans' preferences with respect to scheduling options, both for watching matches on TV and in the stadium. We carried out a discrete choice experiment using an online survey questionnaire distributed on a national scale. The choice sets are based on three match characteristics: month, kickoff time, and quality of the opponent. The first part of this survey concerns TV broadcasting aspects. The second part includes questions about stadium attendance. The choice data are first analyzed with a conditional logit model which assumes homogenous preferences. Then a mixed logit model is fit to model the heterogeneity among the fans. The estimates are used to calculate the expected utility of watching a Belgian Pro League match for every possible setting, either on TV or in the stadium. These predictions are validated in terms of the real audience rating and home attendance data. Our results can be used to improve the scheduling process of the Belgian Pro League in order to persuade more fans to watch the matches on TV or in a stadium.","[Wang, Chang; Vandebroek, Martina] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Econ & Business, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Goossens, Dries] Univ Ghent, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Ghent, Belgium; [Vandebroek, Martina] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven Stat Res Ctr, Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven; Ghent University; KU Leuven,"Wang, C (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Econ & Business, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",chang.wang@kuleuven.be,"Goossens, Dries/AAP-7415-2020; Vandebroek, Martina L./J-9103-2015; Wang, Chang/GZK-9414-2022","Goossens, Dries/0000-0003-0224-3412; Vandebroek, Martina L./0000-0002-0317-1986;",,,,,27,25,29,2,42,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

The contradiction between the neo-generation workers' own rights and company's interests. The reason comes from migrants own, company, and government.

Our study aimed to shed further light on the role of microeconomic factors versus macroeconomic factors in influencing the extent of the exchange rate pass-through (ERPT). As a first step, we conduct a sectoral analysis using disaggregated import prices data. We find a much higher degree of pass-through for more homogeneous goods and commodities, such as oil and raw materials, than for highly differentiated manufactured products, such as machinery and transport equipment. Our results confirm that cross-country differences in pass-through rates may be due to divergences in the product composition of imports. The higher share of imports from sectors with lower degrees of pass-through, the lower ERPT for an economy will be. In a next step, we investigate for the impact of some macroeconomics factors or common events experienced by EA members on the extent of pass-through. Using the system generalised method of moments within a dynamic panel-data model, our estimates indicate that decline of import-price sensitivity to the exchange rate is not significant since the introduction of the single currency. Our findings suggest instead that the weakness of the euro during the first 3years of the monetary union significantly raised the extent of the ERPT. This outcome could explain why the sensitivity of import prices has not fallen since 1999. We also point out a significant role played by the inflation in the Eurozone, as the responsiveness of import prices to exchange rate fluctuations tends to decline in a low and more stable inflation environment. Overall, our findings support the view that the extent of pass-through is comprised of both macro- and microeconomic aspects that policymakers should take into account.","[Ben Cheikh, Nidhaleddine] ESSCA Sch Management, Angers, France; [Rault, Christophe] Univ Orleans, CNRS, LEO, UMR 7322, F-45067 Orleans, France",ESSCA School of Management; Universite de Orleans; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Ben Cheikh, N (通讯作者)，ESSCA Sch Management, Angers, France.",,"Ben Cheikh, Nidhaleddine/E-8449-2019","Ben Cheikh, Nidhaleddine/0000-0003-2550-6721; RAULT, Christophe/0000-0002-1658-3912",,,,,35,18,20,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2017,40.0,12,,,,,2611,2638,,10.1111/twec.12499,0.0,,,28,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FO8JB,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417130900005,0

The purpose of this paper is to study the consistency of choice independent of the particular decision model at hand. Consistency is viewed as an inherently logical concept that is fundamentally void of connotation and is thus disentangled from traditional rationality or consistency conditions imposed on decision models. The proposed formalization of consistency takes two forms: internal consistency, which refers to the property that a choice model does not generate contradictory statements; and semantic consistency, which refers to the idea that a theory's predictions are valid with respect to some observed data. In addressing semantic consistency, the relationship between theory and data is analyzed in terms of so-called duality mappings, which allow a passage between the two universes in a way that consistency is preserved. The formalization of consistency concepts relies on adapting the revealed preference theory to the context-dependent setting. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of the proposed framework and how it relates to classical revealed preference theory and other formalizations of the relationship between the theory and reality of choice.","[Mahmoud, Ola] Univ St Gallen, Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Fac Math & Stat, Bodanstr 6, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland; [Mahmoud, Ola] Univ Calif Berkeley, Ctr Risk Management Res, Evans Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of St Gallen; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Mahmoud, O (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Fac Math & Stat, Bodanstr 6, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.;Mahmoud, O (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Ctr Risk Management Res, Evans Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",ola.mahmoud@unisg.ch,,,,,,,34,2,3,1,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,DEC,2017,83.0,4,,,,,547,572,,10.1007/s11238-017-9635-7,0.0,,,26,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,FN1BM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000415718300006,0

We analyse how firm heterogeneity and shocks of different types and signs affect the impact of competition on skill premia. We find that opposite shocks have opposite effects: an increase (resp. decrease) in international competition increases (resp. decreases) skill premia.

This study uses data from 19 Indonesian toll roads over 2008-2015 to calculate the effects of Indonesia's historic recent fuel subsidy reforms on motor vehicle travel. The timing of the reforms was determined by budgetary and political factors, providing a suitable setting for estimating a causal effect. We control for a broad set of other factors potentially influencing traffic flows. Estimates using monthly data suggest an immediate fuel price elasticity of motor vehicle flows on the roads in our study of -0.1, increasing to -0.2 when responses over a year are considered. We estimate that Indonesia's fuel subsidy reforms of 2013 and 2014 had reduced traffic pressure on these roads in the second half of 2015 by around 10% relative to the counterfactual without reform. A move to an adequate fuel excise system could contribute to more free-flowing traffic, while generating revenue for infrastructure and other investment.","[Burke, Paul J.; Batsuuri, Tsendsuren] Australian Natl Univ, Coombs Bldg 9, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Yudhistira, Muhammad Halley] Univ Indonesia, Fac Econ & Business, Inst Econ & Social Res, Depok, Indonesia",Australian National University; University of Indonesia,"Burke, PJ (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Coombs Bldg 9, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",paul.j.burke@anu.edu.au,"Burke, Paul J./G-3757-2010; Yudhistira, Muhammad Halley/ABF-4570-2021",,Australian Research Council [DE160100750]; Australian Research Council [DE160100750] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"We thank Jasa Marga for data, and Donny Pasaribu and Andhika Putra Pratama for research assistance.

As integration advances, so does the scholarly debate on identity. This article endeavours to contribute to the debate by investigating the relationship between European integration and European identity longitudinally in 14 countries over 21 years from 1992 to 2012. Using Eurobarometer and EU Index data, this relationship is found to be exponential with current integration levels predicting the imminent emergence of a European identity. In order to better understand whose identities are impacted or formed most by integration, the paper then turns to three intervening concepts: (1) cognitive mobilization, (2) optimism, and (3) support of the EU. All of these amplify the effect of integration on identity with the noteworthy exception of optimism. Finally, the article evaluates the implications of these findings for neofunctionalism and the literature on European identity more broadly.","[Lahmann, Sybille] Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Lahmann, S (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Berlin Grad Sch Social Sci, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",luhmann@hu-berlin.de,,,,,,,48,10,10,2,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Probably as a result of this belief, many real bus systems try to connect as many origins and destinations as possible without transfers, so they are usually composed of long, circuitous routes with redundant overlapping sections - and the resulting bus map is hard to understand. If coverage is extensive, many routes are needed. Economics then prevents an agency from populating all routes with sufficient buses to provide attractively frequent service. This low frequency and the complicated circuitous map discourage transfers, perpetuating the belief that people are averse to transferring. Not surprisingly, the percentage of bus trips that includes a transfer has been reported to be: 1.5% for Boston, 3% for New York, 13% for London, and 16% for Melbourne. The Nova Xarxa in Barcelona was designed with a different paradigm. It was designed and deployed to cover the whole city on the belief that if a bus map is easy to understand, and has direct lines with frequent service and ubiquitous transfer points then the bus system would become more appealing, people would transfer more freely and become users of the network rather than its single lines. With this design paradigm, a city can be covered with fewer lines, which can be depicted on a simple map. The lines can in turn be economically populated with sufficient buses to deliver the high frequency required to encourage transfers. Could this work? To answer this question and see whether there is truth in the beliefs underlying the new paradigm, this paper examines data from the first three deployment phases of the Nova Xarxa (from 2012 to 2015). It is found that the Nova Xarxa is already attracting more demand than the network it replaced. This attests to its appeal. Furthermore, this demand has increased disproportionately with the number of lines opened for service in each phase, revealing that some people are using the Nova Xarxa as a network. The paper further shows that this growth is underpinned by transfers - at the end of 2015, the percentage of trips that involved a transfer was approximately 26%, and it reached a maximum of 57% for line V7. These numbers should increase considerably (to 44% and 66%, respectively) once the Nova Xarxa is completed in 2018 and passengers have even more opportunities for transferring. The numbers disprove the conventional wisdom. They strongly suggest that transit providers can attract more demand by providing transfer-friendly networks that can be used as such and not as an inefficient aggregation of individual lines.

Further, not only is it the level of inflation persistence that is important in economic analyses, but also the question of whether the persistence varies over time, for instance, across business cycle phases, is equally pertinent, since assuming constant persistence across states of the economy is sure to lead to misguided policy decisions. Against this backdrop, we extend the literature on long-memory models of inflation persistence for the US economy over the monthly period of 1920:1-2014:5, by developing an autoregressive fractionally integrated moving-average-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic model with a time-varying memory coefficient which varies across expansions and recessions. In sum, we find that inflation persistence does vary across recessions and expansions, with it being significantly higher in the former than in the latter. As an aside, we also show that persistence of inflation volatility is higher during expansions than in recessions. Understandably, our results have important policy implications.","[Caporin, Massimiliano] Univ Padua, Dept Stat Sci, Via Battisti 241, I-35123 Padua, Italy; [Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Padua; University of Pretoria,"Caporin, M (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dept Stat Sci, Via Battisti 241, I-35123 Padua, Italy.",massimiliano.caporin@unipd.it; rangan.gupta@up.ac.za,"Caporin, Massimiliano/AAM-5958-2020","Caporin, Massimiliano/0000-0001-5014-5951",,,,,31,15,16,0,6,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

This hybrid model approach has been explored by recent empirical studies to relax the strictness of pure factor-augmented model approximations, but no formal model selection procedures have been developed. The main difference to previous factor-augmented model selection procedures is that we must account for estimation error in the idiosyncratic component as well as the factors. Our main contribution is to show the conditions required for selection consistency of a class of information criteria that reflect this additional source of estimation error. We show that existing factor-augmented model selection criteria are inconsistent in circumstances where N is of larger order than root T, where N and T are the cross-section and time series dimensions of the dataset respectively, and that the standard Bayesian information criterion is inconsistent regardless of the relationship between N and T. We therefore propose a new set of information criteria that guarantee selection consistency in the presence of estimated idiosyncratic components. The properties of these new criteria are explored through a Monte Carlo simulation study. The paper concludes with an empirical application to long-horizon exchange rate forecasting using a recently proposed model with country-specific idiosyncratic components from a panel of global exchange rates.","[Fosten, Jack] Univ East Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"Fosten, J (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",j.fosten@uea.ac.uk,,,,,,,34,1,1,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0883-7252,1099-1255,,J APPL ECONOMET,J.

This article demonstrates different degrees of progress towards a supranational framework in two important areas of reform: Limited harmonization of the rules on bank structures, but robust progress toward the supranationalization of bank resolution, where the euro area dimension is also considered. What accounts for this variation? We draw on a synthesis of neofunctionalism and liberal intergovernmentalism to explain the diverging outcomes. We explain the low supranationalization in bank structural reforms with the absence of strong spillovers and availability of domestic options to unilaterally contain financial instability. In bank resolution, we examine the causal mechanisms through which significant spillovers modified the government preferences of key Member States.","[Quaglia, Lucia] Univ York, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Spendzharova, Aneta] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands",University of York - UK; Maastricht University,"Spendzharova, A (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Dept Polit Sci, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",a.spendzharova@maastrichtuniversity.nl,,"Spendzharova, Aneta/0000-0002-6764-1430",,,,,67,17,18,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

In this respect, we distinguish between adaptation of winter sports vacations due to lacking snow reliability and other journeys apart from winter sports vacations due to higher temperatures. By examining the tourism sector, our study investigates an industry, which has not been extensively considered in economic analyses of climate change so far in spite of its worldwide huge economic relevance and strong sensitivity to climate change. Our empirical analysis on the basis of unique data from German tourists first reveals a large extent of stated tourism-related adaptation to climate change in the amount of nearly three quarters for winter sports tourists and more than 50% for other tourists. Our microeconometric analysis indicates that female tourists and tourists with a high awareness of climate change effects and increasing age are more willing to adapt. Our empirical results underline several challenges for the tourism industry and policy makers in order to transform the tourism infrastructure and to diversify holiday offers. They additionally reveal important focus groups of tourists such as (the increasing group of) elderly persons who are crucial for the development of successful future product strategies in the tourism sector.","[Schwirplies, Claudia] Univ Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany; [Ziegler, Andreas] Univ Kassel, Kassel, Germany",University of Hamburg; Universitat Kassel,"Schwirplies, C (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Dept Econ, Von Melle Pk 5, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",claudia.schwirplies@uni-hamburg.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under the funding priority Economics of climate change'',German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under the funding priority Economics of climate change''(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Financial Support by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under the funding priority Economics of climate change'' is gratefully acknowledged.",,50,9,9,4,43,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Why did 47 states impose barriers anyway? This article argues that states use barriers as political cover to prevent a loss of domestic political support. This logic suggests that governments anticipating high domestic political benefits for imposing barriers during an outbreak will be likely to do so. Logistic regression and duration analysis of an original dataset coding state behavior during H1N1 provide support for this argument: democracies with weak health infrastructure- those that stand to gain the most from imposing barriers during an outbreak because they are particularly vulnerable to a negative public reaction-are more likely than others to impose barriers and to do so quickly.","[Worsnop, Catherine Z.] Worcester State Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, Worcester, MA 01602 USA",Massachusetts System of Public Higher Education; Worcester State University,"Worsnop, CZ (通讯作者)，Worcester State Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, Worcester, MA 01602 USA.",cworsnop@worcester.edu,,"Worsnop, Catherine/0000-0002-3908-1085",,,,,120,28,33,0,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

BMA is a computationally feasible method that allows us to explore the model space even in the presence of a large set of candidate predictors. We test the performance of BMA in now-casting by means of a recursive experiment for the euro area and the three largest countries. This method allows flexibility in selecting the information set month by month. We find that BMA-based forecasts produce smaller forecast errors than standard bridge model when forecasting GDP in Germany, France and Italy. At the same time, it also performs as well as medium-scale factor models when forecasting Eurozone GDP.","[Bencivelli, Lorenzo] Bank Italy, Rome, Italy; [Marcellino, Massimiliano] Bocconi Univ, IGIER, Milan, Italy; [Marcellino, Massimiliano] Bocconi Univ, CEPR, Milan, Italy; [Moretti, Gianluca] Bank Amer Merril Lynch, London, England",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy; Bocconi University; Bocconi University,"Marcellino, M (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, IGIER, Milan, Italy.;Marcellino, M (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, CEPR, Milan, Italy.",lorenzo.bencivelli@bancaditalia.it; massimiliano.marcellino@unibocconi.it; gianluca.moretti@baml.com,,"Marcellino, Massimiliano/0000-0002-8737-2768",,,,,34,8,8,1,8,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

U-OHD have potential to increase economic competitiveness, reduce congestion, improve environmental conditions, enhance livability, and increase quality of life in urban areas. This study considers the role that public policy initiatives could play in fostering receivers' acceptance of U-OHD by analyzing survey data collected from potential U-OHD adopters. The paper describes the survey conducted, performs descriptive analyses of the data, analyzes the respondents' stated willingness to participate in unassisted off-hour deliveries, estimates discrete choice models to gain insight into receivers' decision-making processes, and analyzes the effectiveness of alternative policy scenarios. It is found that a number of policy levers can foster U-OHD: (1) public sector provision of a one-time incentive, a public recognition program, and business support services; (2) carriers providing shipping discounts to receivers of U-OHD; and (3) the creation of a Trusted Vendor Certification Program.

Using a birth-cohort approach with 10 year birth cohorts from the 1780s to the 1820s, we find that French-Canadian prisoners grew shorter over the period. Through the whole sample period, they were short compared to Americans. However, French-Canadians were taller either than their cousins in France or the inhabitants of Latin America (except Argentinians). In addition to extending anthropometric data in Canada to the 1780s, we are able to extend comparisons between the Old and New Worlds as well as comparisons between North America and Latin America.

By incorporating the ratings shopping by issuers, we investigate the equilibrium decisions of CRAs and the impact of government regulation on the rating market. More importantly, an evolutionary reform plan named the Rating Network Structure, which is an alliance or a network of CRAs' rating approaches, is proposed to improve market efficiency. Simulations demonstrate that this structure plays a significant role in increasing rating accuracy and market profits.

Short-term Experimental Evidence on Parent Empowerment and School Quality,WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,EDUCATION,"Giving power over school management and spending decisions to communities has been a favored strategy to increase school quality, but its effectiveness may depend on local capacity. Grants are one form of such a transfer of power. Short-term responses of a grant to school committees in Niger show that parents increased participation and responsibility, but these efforts did not improve quality on average. Enrollment at the lowest grades increased and school resources improved, but teacher absenteeism increased, and there was no measured impact on test scores. An analysis of heterogeneous impacts and spending decisions provides additional insight into these dynamics. Overall, the findings suggest that programs based on parent participation should take levels of community capacity into account: even when communities are willing to work to improve their schools, they may not be able to do so. The short-term nature of the experiment reduces the extent to which the results can be generalized.","[Beasley, Elizabeth] CEPREMAP Well Being Observ, Paris, France; [Huillery, Elise] Sci Po Dept Econ, Paris, France",,"Huillery, E (通讯作者)，Sci Po Dept Econ, Paris, France.",elise.huillery@sciencespo.fr,,,World Bank; Education for All Fast Track Initiative through the Education Program Development Fund,World Bank(The World Bank India); Education for All Fast Track Initiative through the Education Program Development Fund,"Cornelia Jesse led the implementation of this project and contributed substantially to its design, and we are deeply indebted to her for her leadership.

Staricco recommends the Amsterdam School of transnational historical materialism as a more immediately productive and insightful approach to developing a regulationist critique of political economy. Both lines of criticism of CPE are addressed. First, Staricco misinterprets the implications of treating semiosis and structuration as ontologically equal bases of social life. Second, Staricco mistakes our criticisms of the Italian School' in international political economy for criticisms of the Amsterdam School - an approach we have always warmly endorsed. He therefore misses our more nuanced claim that while the Amsterdam School emphasises the importance of semiosis, it has fewer concepts to explain how semiosis matters and why only some imagined class identities and concepts of control are selected, retained, and institutionalised. CPE addresses this lacuna by integrating critical semiotic analysis into political economy. Third, we provide the first detailed comparison of the Amsterdam School and CPE to provide a better understanding of the merits of each approach and to indicate where they might complement each other without claiming one to be superior to the other.","[Jessop, Bob] Univ Lancaster, Dept Sociol, Lancaster, England; [Sum, Ngai-Ling] Univ Lancaster, Dept Polit Philosophy & Religious Studies, Lancaster, England",Lancaster University; Lancaster University,"Jessop, B (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Sociol, Lancaster LA1 14T, England.",r.jessop@lancaster.ac.uk,"Jessop, Robert/M-9112-2014","Jessop, Robert/0000-0001-8134-3926","Cardiff University in the WISERD-Civil Society programme - Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L009099/1]; ESRC [ES/H004653/1, ES/L009099/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L009099/1, ES/H004653/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Cardiff University in the WISERD-Civil Society programme - Economic and Social Research Council; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),The article was written while Bob Jessop was in receipt of a research fellowship at Cardiff University in the WISERD-Civil Society programme funded by the Economic and Social Research Council [Award: ES/L009099/1].,,46,15,16,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Certain factors, such as the technical characteristics of the generated knowledge and the absorptive capacity of firms, influence the power of attraction that such institutions may exert for new firms to join the tourist district. For that reason, a U-shaped relationship between agglomeration and institutional knowledge is proposed.

Using recent spatial panel methods, this paper estimates a number of econometric models to examine the impact of RPS policies when spatial autocorrelation is taken into account. Consistent with previous literature, we find that RPS laws do not have a significant impact on renewable generation within a state. However, we find evidence that state RPS laws have a significant positive impact on the share of renewable generation in the NERC region as a whole. These findings provide evidence that electricity markets are efficiently finding the lowest-cost locations to serve renewable load in states with more stringent RPS laws. In addition, our results suggest that RPS laws may be more effective tools for environmental policy than for economic development.","[Bowen, Eric] West Virginia Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Bur Business & Econ Res, 1601 Univ Ave,POB 6527, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Lacombe, Donald J.] West Virginia Univ, Reg Res Inst, Morgantown, WV USA",West Virginia University; West Virginia University,"Bowen, E (通讯作者)，West Virginia Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Bur Business & Econ Res, 1601 Univ Ave,POB 6527, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",eric.bowen@mail.wvu.edu,,,,,,,31,14,15,4,25,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,MAY,2017,38.0,3,,,,,177,193,,10.5547/01956574.38.3.ebow,0.0,,,17,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ES6YN,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000399696700008,0

We examine this issue using a dynamic intertemporal model of the displacement of fossil fuel energy technologies by non-fossil alternatives. Our model highlights the fact that since capital used to produce energy services from fossil fuels is a sunk cost, it will continue to be used so long as the price of energy covers merely short-run operating costs. Until fossil fuels are abandoned, the price of energy is insufficient to cover even the operating costs of renewable energy production, let alone provide a competitive return on the capital employed. The full long-run costs of renewable energy production are not covered until some time after fossil fuels are abandoned.","[Hartley, Peter R.; Medlock, Kenneth B., III] Rice Univ, Dept Econ, MS22,6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Hartley, Peter R.; Medlock, Kenneth B., III] Rice Univ, James A Baker Inst Publ Policy 3, Houston, TX USA; [Hartley, Peter R.] Univ Western Australia, Dept Econ, Nedlands, WA, Australia",Rice University; Rice University; University of Western Australia,"Hartley, PR (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, Dept Econ, MS22,6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",hartley@rice.edu,,"Hartley, Peter/0000-0003-4967-720X",,,,,30,15,15,0,37,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,MAY,2017,38.0,3,,,,,33,61,,10.5547/01956574.38.3.phar,0.0,,,29,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ES6YN,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000399696700002,0

A preliminary analysis based on estimation of the exponent of cross-sectional dependence provides a clear result in favor of strong cross-sectional dependence. This result has relevant implications in terms of econometric modeling and suggests that a factor structure is preferable to a spatial error model. The common correlated effects approach is then used because it remains valid in a variety of situations that are likely to occur, such as the presence of both forms of dependence or the existence of nonstationary factors. According to the estimation results, richer countries benefit more from domestic R&D and geographic spillovers than poorer countries, while smaller countries benefit more from spillovers originating from trade. The results also suggest that when the problem of (possibly many) correlated unobserved factors is addressed the quantity of education no longer has a significant effect. Finally, a comparison of the results with those obtained from a spatial model provides interesting insights into the bias that may arise when we allow only for weak dependence, despite the presence of strong dependence in the data.

This paper employs the tradable credits scheme on traffic mobility management and private provision of public transportation infrastructure through a novel kind of private financing of public road: build-equity-credit (BEC) scheme, hoping to achieve a triple win. Namely, the government can achieve its objectives (e.g. construction of the new road, desired traffic condition, certain vehicle emissions threshold) without its own capital, the private firm can receive its expected profit with less public's resistance and the travelers can enjoy less congested traffic with a negligible cost. Moreover, many issues that occurred upon the termination of the traditional private financing (e.g. build-operate transfer) scheme, such as severe congestion, explosion of travel demand and lack of management and maintenance, can be avoided in BEC. A general bi-level programming problem is formulated to model the determination of capacity of the new road and the tradable credits scheme in BEC scheme. The properties of several different BEC scenarios are investigated. Generally, the link service level in BEC is not constant but depends on multiple factors. Under some conditions, the total market value of the credits charged on the new link can offset its construction cost and the profit of the private firm can always be nonnegative.

We argue that the Commission acted as a 'purposeful opportunist' in both tiers; but whereas in economic governance issues there was breakthrough change in the Commission's achievements and competences, in the Single Market realm policy change was fairly modest. Using process tracing analysis our goal is to explain why the Commission did not succeed in furthering a genuine Single Market reform. Our findings suggest that the Commission's entrepreneurship was constrained by the limited salience of Single Market issues in the crisis context and by the lack of actual political commitment from the other relevant stakeholders. Thus, our research highlights the limits of the Commission's opportunistic behaviour in less advantageous circumstances.","[Camisao, Isabel] CICP, Coimbra, Portugal; [Camisao, Isabel] Univ Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal; [Guimaraes, Maria Helena] Univ Minho, Braga, Portugal",Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade do Minho,"Camisao, I (通讯作者)，Univ Coimbra, Fac Letters, Dept Hist European Studies Archaeol & Arts, P-3004530 Coimbra, Portugal.",isabelc@fl.uc.pt,"; Guimaraes, Maria Helena/N-5984-2014","Camisao, Isabel/0000-0003-4138-3231; Guimaraes, Maria Helena/0000-0003-1432-4113",Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia) [SFRH / BPD / 77342 / 2011]; European Social Fund,Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)),"This work was supported by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia), under Grant SFRH / BPD / 77342 / 2011 through the POPH (Programa Operacional Potencial Humano) and the European Social Fund.",,68,11,11,2,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

We use two unique datasets of specific trade obstacles to empirically examine which barriers continue to undermine EU cross-border trade, and whether non-judicial remedies have provided some degree of effective informal market governance in tackling trade impediments. Based on four hypotheses on country, industry and policy variables we test the probability of removing trade barriers in the pre-litigation phase of infringement proceedings rather than by Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decisions. We then assess the usage and effectiveness of the informal mechanism Solvit to resolve trade obstacles in the single market.

We exploited the longitudinal nature of our data to separate the effect of observed and unobserved individual characteristics on earnings. In keeping with the limited existing UK literature, we found a clear and wide dividing line between whites and non-whites in simple comparable models. However, in our more complete models, when we accounted for unobservable individual characteristics an important contribution of this paper we found a much narrower and subtler dividing line. This suggests that the labour market primarily rewards individual characteristics other than immigration status. This, in turn, facilitates the assimilation of immigrants into the UK labour market. We also found that the lowest paid immigrants, whom are disproportionately non-white, suffer an earnings penalty in the labour market, whereas higher paid immigrants, whom are disproportionately white, do not. Finally, we found less favourable earning gaps for cohorts that witnessed proportionately larger non-white and lower paid white immigration.","[Lemos, Sara] Univ Leicester, Dept Econ, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",University of Leicester,"Lemos, S (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Dept Econ, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",sl129@leicester.ac.uk,,,,,,,37,2,3,0,12,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

In particular, we examine the effect of demographic and socio-economic characteristics of tourists and of the attributes of their trip, on both the likelihood and the frequency of their cultural participation. The data was gathered based on a national telephone survey in Austria, known as 'The Travel Habits of Austrian Residents' which has been conducted over the years 2008 and 2009. Using observations of 8587 respondents and their 14,646 trips, a series of logistic and negative binomial regressions were employed. The findings of this study have practical implications for cultural managers both in Austria and in global markets. Although tourism is often promoted as a way to escape from everyday routines, the actual choice of cultural consumption in the tourism arena appears to be dictated by individual characteristics of tourists. Nevertheless, factors related to the character of a trip are also significant in determining cultural participation of tourists.","[Zieba, Marta] Univ Limerick, Limerick, Ireland",University of Limerick,"Zieba, M (通讯作者)，Univ Limerick, Kemmy Business Sch, Dept Econ, Limerick, Ireland.",marta.zieba@ul.ie,"Zieba, Marta/JAZ-0878-2023; Zieba, Marta/A-8283-2018","Zieba, Marta/0000-0002-9116-2413",,,,,37,6,6,2,27,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The new test using the RALS procedure is more powerful than the usual LM test which does not incorporate information on non-normal errors. Our test is free of nuisance parameters that indicate the locations of structural break. It is also free of the spurious rejection problem. Thus, the rejection of the null hypothesis can be considered as more accurate evidence of stationarity. We apply the new test on the recently extended Grilli and Yang index of 24 commodity series from 1900 to 2007. Our empirical findings provide significant evidence that primary commodity prices are stationary with one or two trend breaks. However, compared with past studies, our findings provide even weaker evidence to support the Prebisch-Singer hypothesis.","[Meng, Ming; Lee, Junsoo] Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Box 870224, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Payne, James E.] Georgia Coll & State Univ, J Whitney Bunting Coll Business, Econ, Milledgeville, GA 31061 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; University System of Georgia; Georgia College & State University,"Lee, J (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Box 870224, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",jlee@cba.ua.edu,"Payne, James/Q-9569-2019; Payne, James/IZQ-1848-2023",,,,,,22,39,40,0,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

Although many important theoretical models require the real interest rates to be stationary, the empirical evidence accumulated so far has not been able to provide conclusive evidence on the mean reverting dynamics of this variable. To resolve this puzzle we re-investigate the stochastic nature of the real interest rates by developing unit root tests for nonlinear heterogeneous panels where the alternative hypothesis allows for a smooth transition between deterministic linear trends around which stationary asymmetric adjustment may occur. When the newly developed panel unit root tests are applied to the real interest rates of the 17 OECD countries, we were able to uncover overwhelming empirical support in favor of mean reversion in the short-run and long-run real interest rates. Therefore, these results show that the conclusions drawn from a miss-specified test that ignores the presence of either nonlinearity, structural breaks or cross sectional dependence can give quite misleading results about the stochastic behavior of the real interest rates.","[Omay, Tolga] Turk Hava Kurumu Univ, Dept Management, Bahcekapi Mahallesi Okul Sokak 11, TR-06790 Ankara, Turkey; [Corakci, Aysegul] Cankaya Univ, Dept Econ, Eskisehir Yolu 29 Km, TR-06810 Ankara, Turkey; [Emirmahmutoglu, Furkan] Gazi Univ, Dept Econometr, TR-06500 Ankara, Turkey",Turk Hava Kurumu University; Cankaya University; Gazi University,"Omay, T (通讯作者)，Turk Hava Kurumu Univ, Dept Management, Bahcekapi Mahallesi Okul Sokak 11, TR-06790 Ankara, Turkey.",tomay@thk.edu.tr; aeruygur@cankaya.edu.tr; furkan@gazi.edu.tr,"Emirmahmutoglu, Furkan/B-2267-2019; Corakci, Aysegul/ABE-3469-2021","Emirmahmutoglu, Furkan/0000-0001-7358-3567; Corakci, Aysegul/0000-0002-0684-4103",,,,,52,24,24,0,15,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Analysis of the 2012 British Skills and Employment Survey demonstrates monitoring difficulty and asset specificity predict National Statistics Socio-Economic Classification (NS-SEC) membership and employment relations in ways expected by the Goldthorpe model, but the role of asset specificity is partially confounded by analytical tasks. It concludes that while the Goldthorpe model continues to provide a useful descriptive tool of inequality-producing processes and employment relations in the labour market, examining underlying job characteristics directly is a promising avenue for future research in understanding over time dynamics in the evolution of occupational inequalities.","[Williams, Mark] Univ Surrey, Dept People & Organisat, HRM & Employment Relat, Guildford, Surrey, England",University of Surrey,"Williams, M (通讯作者)，Univ Surrey, Surrey Business Sch, Dept People & Organisat, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England.",m.t.williams@surrey.ac.uk,"Williams, Mark/H-7941-2019","Williams, Mark/0000-0002-4108-0583",,,,,27,18,19,1,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The number of clusters has been selected based on the number of clustered objects and due to the clarity of the results obtained. Using the methods of cluster analysis, the clusters with similar wage level were created. Methods of the furthest neighbour and Euclidean distance metric were used. For the Czech regions, the model wage distribution was constructed to enable the comparison of wage development during recent seven years. Three-parametric lognormal curves present the basis of the theoretical wage distribution. The special attention was paid to the situation of wage level within European countries and its comparison with the wage level in the Czech Republic.

The new digital products and services have also emerged but together with this new evolution the new privacy and personal data protection challenges have been encountered. Data processing, especially processing of personal data, developed the need for increasing privacy protection with regards to new digital products and services, such as internet of things. This could be done in the framework of the on-going revision of EU data protection framework but also the protection of consumer rights will need to follow the revision in the same context. Action should also be taken in order to protect consumers from unfair contract terms and offer them effective dispute resolution in a global and internet-based context (with special regard for cloud computing services). In addition, the reduced frontier between digital services and products may create legal uncertainty and protections of citizens's privacy with respect to the definition of digital econmy new surroundings. In this paper, the author will present the new emerging digital consumer trends with regulation overview of consumer protection rights in the Republic of Croatia and in the EU as well with emphasis on the possible challenges associated to them.

We show that the optimal blockholding coalition type, consisting of two members coalitions without dominant owners, was able to attain short-term efficiency of dispersed owners. Other blockhold ingcoalition types stayed behind.

However, the new direction of studies is towards ranking on the micro-level; on the level of cities. One of such composite indexes which stands out for its coverage, precise definition, sound methodology, and regular publication is the Sustainable Cities Index devised by Arcadis, a management consulting company. In this paper, we employed the Factor analysis and the one-way ANOVA to explore whether there is difference in the sustainability of European, North American, Asian, and Australian cities. We aimed to explore the differences between them and the patterns of differences for indicators of the People, Planet, and Profit pillars.

Would such fabrication substantially affect the validity of empirical analyses? We document how we identified such fabrication in South Africa's longitudinal National Income Dynamics Study, which affected about 7% of the sample. The fabrication was detected while fieldwork was still ongoing, and the relevant interviews were reconducted. We thus have an observed counterfactual that allows us to measure how problematic such fabrication would have been, had it remained undetected. We compare estimates from the dataset that includes the fabricated interviews with corresponding estimates that includes the corrected data instead. We find that the fabrication would not have affected our univariate and cross-sectional estimates meaningfully, but would have led us to reach substantially different conclusions when implementing panel estimators. We estimate that the data quality investigation in this survey had a benefit-cost ratio of at least 24, and was thus easily justifiable.","[Finn, Arden] Univ Cape Town, Southern Africa Labour & Dev Unit, Rondebosch, South Africa; [Ranchhod, Vimal] Univ Cape Town, SALDRU, Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town,"Ranchhod, V (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, SALDRU, Rondebosch, South Africa.",fnnard001@myuct.ac.za; vimal.ranchhod@uc-t.ac.za,,,Research Chairs Initiative of the Department of Science and Technology; National Research Foundation,Research Chairs Initiative of the Department of Science and Technology; National Research Foundation,"He acknowledges support from the Research Chairs Initiative of the Department of Science and Technology and National Research Foundation.

Due to ideological and economic reasons, by the late 1980s, the country had been largely de-monetised in the sense that money existed but was unable to fulfil its basic functions. A massive economic shock resulting from the collapse of the global socialist system after 1990 contributed to a re-monetisation including a reform of the domestic currency from the mid-1990s. Individuals have reacted in a predictable way, thus weakening the power of the state. Currently, North Korea is, in some aspects, more monetised than, for example, East Germany was in 1989, thanks to the de facto existence of parallel currencies. This chapter analyses the process of re-monetisation, its impact on society, and the state's efforts to curb these effects, which we are only beginning to comprehend fully.","[Frank, Ruediger] Univ Vienna, East Asian Econ & Soc, Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Frank, R (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, East Asian Econ & Soc, Vienna, Austria.",ruediger.frank@univie.ac.at,"Frank, Ruediger/C-3876-2014","Frank, Ruediger/0000-0001-7834-3802",,,,,41,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0921-8580,2197-1889,978-3-319-59846-8; 978-3-319-59845-1,FINAN MON P,,,2017,44.0,,,,,,43,61,,10.1007/978-3-319-59846-8_4,0.0,,,19,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL1NM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447914500004,0

There is a study of [3] which examines the success of the introduction of e-Learning system with the help of ELSS model (e-Learning System Success). We made two questionnaires to evaluate the application of e-Learning at University of Debrecen, Faculty of Economics and Business. One of them was for the students and the other one asked the lecturers. The aim was to develop such questionnaires which are suitable for both the evaluation of the e-Learning's quality and its economic benefits. The basis of the e-Learning's quality questions was Wang's article (2007), in which he measured the success of the e-Learning systems, therefore the questions of the students' and the lecturers' questionnaires were the same. The aim of this survey was to compare the opinions of the students and the teachers regarding the application of e-Learning. The role of the questionnaire for quality development is to give guidance for the University of Debrecen in the e-Learning application. We have used the Mann-Whitney test to evaluate the questionnaires of the students who use the e-Learning system. This method is used to compare the means of two groups in case of ordinal scales or not normally distributed variables. We have also used factor analysis and binominal logistic regression. We have examined whether the background variables manipulating the variables are possible to be developed on the basis of the answers. We used factor analysis to demonstrate this since it contracts the coherent factors into one common factor. Factor analysis is used to compress data and explore data structure.

Application of information technologies for food processing and logistics industry in the fields of smart packaging and materials, automation and control technology, standards and their application scenarios, and production management principles were wildly studied. A collaborative research project for the supply and logistics of fresh agricultural products in Tianjin was performed. System analysis for the logistics management information system is studied. The model-driven business transformation, an approach uses formal models to explicitly define the structure and behavior of a business, is applied for the review and analysis process.

The research is a part of a project Strengthening the business capacity of women entrepreneurs in Republic of Macedonia, as a developing country. This chapter argues that usage of integrated communication leads to increased profitability. The method of quantitative and qualitative research is used through questionnaires and personal interviews with managers in the food industry. The data are processed with IBM SPSS19. Conclusions are based on descriptive and deductive statistics. The results show that the companies, regardless of the size, give priority to economic propaganda and sales promotion; they mostly use nonpersonal, mass media, mainly television; combination of several elements of the promotional mix, i.e., integrated communications affect profitability; and combination of media for promotion has impact on profitability. The conclusion suggests that implementation of integrated communication results in positive effect on the financial performance and increases the chances of investment in further development.","[Marjanova, Tamara Jovanov; Sofijanova, Elenica; Davcev, Ljupco; Temjanovski, Riste] Univ Goce Delcev, Fac Econ, Stip, Macedonia",Goce Delcev University of Stip,"Marjanova, TJ (通讯作者)，Univ Goce Delcev, Fac Econ, Stip, Macedonia.",tamara.jovanov@ugd.edu.mk,"Jovanov, Tamara/ABH-4569-2020","Jovanov, Tamara/0000-0002-4938-0732",,,,,23,1,1,0,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-39919-5; 978-3-319-39918-8,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,4.0,,,,,,29,41,,10.1007/978-3-319-39919-5_3,0.0,,,13,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2AH,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000407615400003,0

On the surface, after the September 2015 combined regional and local elections, Russia appeared to be tranquil, politically disengaged, and supportive of President Vladimir Putin. The underlying reality was quite different. The election exposed a country divided by rivalry and a conflict of interests within the Russian political establishment set off by Putin's own policies over the preceding two years. Since the election, Putin and the Kremlin have been confronting the challenge of balancing and containing the competing interests of institutions, levels of government, and establishment stakeholders who are less easily reconciled or controlled.","[Moses, Joel] Iowa State Univ, Polit Sci, 4575 South Atlantic Ave 6711, Ponce Inlet, FL 32127 USA",Iowa State University,"Moses, J (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Polit Sci, 4575 South Atlantic Ave 6711, Ponce Inlet, FL 32127 USA.",jcmoses23@gmail.com,,,,,,,106,5,5,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2017,69.0,6,,,,,961,988,,10.1080/09668136.2017.1364700,0.0,,,28,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,FF4TT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000408950600006,0

The study is mainly based on the data retrieved from the World Bank Open Data. During analysed 15 years, Asia's LDCs, except Yemen, experienced high economic growth. Average annual GDP per capita growth rate in five countries was more than 4%. GDP has been largely generated through the service and industry sectors. The biggest decline in the contribution of agriculture sector to GDP was observed in the fastest growing economies. Afghanistan, Timor-Leste, and Bhutan sustained strong growth mainly because of foreign assistance. In Nepal, Yemen, and Bangladesh remittances were a significant source of development finance. In the years 2001-2015, Myanmar, Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Bhutan increased their GDP per capita more than twice. Asia's LDCs substantially improved their development indicators. Cambodia, Afghanistan, and Timor-Leste recorded the highest rise in the value of HDI. Moreover, Cambodia, Timor-Leste, and Yemen significantly reduced infant mortality and under-five mortality. Afghanistan, Timor-Leste, and Lao PDR made big progress in reduction of maternal mortality. Life expectancy at birth increased the most in Cambodia, Bhutan, and Timor-Leste. A lot of people in Asia's LDCs have gained access to electricity and improved water and sanitation. However, Asian least developed countries are slowly implementing economic reforms. What's more, Asia's LDCs, except Bhutan, have big problems with corruption and poor governance.","[Nowak, Wioletta] Univ Wroclaw, Wroclaw, Poland",University of Wroclaw,"Nowak, W (通讯作者)，Univ Wroclaw, Wroclaw, Poland.",wioletta.nowak@uwr.edu.pl,"Nowak, Wioletta/L-1548-2019","Nowak, Wioletta/0000-0002-9200-2972",,,,,20,3,3,0,9,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,128,137,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8CX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427987300014,0

This paper offers an answer to this question based on a survey of empirical research on individual trade policy preferences, the impact of domestic political institutions on trade policy outcomes, and the relationship between international institutions and trade policy outcomes. I reach a rather disappointing conclusion: although every contribution to the OEP research program is rigorous and robust, the individual findings have not produced consensus on any of the major questions at the center of research. Consequently, we know no more about the politics of trade policy today than we knew three decades ago. This lack of progress in OEP's variable-based approach creates opportunities for research that relies on a pattern-based approach informed by the logic of causal complexity.","[Oatley, Thomas] Univ N Carolina, Polit Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Oatley, T (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Polit Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",toatley@email.unc.edu,"Oatley, Thomas/I-6712-2019","Oatley, Thomas/0000-0002-1604-6092",,,,,58,14,15,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

In this study, an attempt is made to overcome at least two deficiencies associated with previous literature concerning the influence of environmental stringency on trade flows among transition economies, the measurement of environmental stringency that rarely accounts for the direct impact of taxing pollutant emissions, and the common use of cross-section analysis encompassing transition economies. Although, economists and policy makers generally agree that prices should incorporate the full costs of environmental degradation and that market-based instruments present an effective environmental policy measures, the introduction and the use of these measures has remained limited. Previous literature has not studied the impact of environment-related taxes on relative export performance of transition economies' heavy pollutant industries in a dynamic and an integrated framework that allows for more validated assessment of costs/benefits of environmental regulation. This research attempts to fill-in this gap in the literature. The results of panel analysis in this chapter seem to render support to the hypothesis of the least regulated transition economies, i.e., CEE EU member states tend to specialize in pollution-intensive industries and tend to benefit from differences in compliance with environmental regulation among EU countries.","[Silajdzic, Sabina; Mehic, Eldin] Univ Sarajevo, Dept Econ Theory & Policy, Sch Econ & Business, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Sarajevo,"Silajdzic, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sarajevo, Dept Econ Theory & Policy, Sch Econ & Business, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg.",sabina.silajdzic@efsa.unsa.ba,"Mehic, Eldin/GLV-3455-2022","Mehic, Eldin/0000-0001-5825-6701",,,,,20,4,4,0,10,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-39919-5; 978-3-319-39918-8,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,4.0,,,,,,155,169,,10.1007/978-3-319-39919-5_13,0.0,,,15,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2AH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000407615400013,0

Yet, these discussions have neglected to theorise the intersection between the production of stigmatised space and the governance of its inhabitants within the context of one of Germany's most stigmatised boroughs. By situating Berlin-Neukolln within historical processes of capital accumulation, I show how the discursive, institutional and material practices of neoliberal social policies have played a central, albeit contradictory, role in (re-)producing stigmatise spaces and subjects along racialised, gendered and class lines. This is particularly evident with regard to neoliberal governance strategies that employ and apply the power of public money to repress and integrate impoverished workers into contemporary capitalist society, or what I refer to as the monetisation of socio-spatial reproduction'.","[Soederberg, Susanne] Queens Univ, Dept Global Dev Studies, Kingston, ON, Canada",Queens University - Canada,"Soederberg, S (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Dept Global Dev Studies, Kingston, ON, Canada.",soederberg@queensu.ca,,,"Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation; Collegium for Advanced Studies at the University of Helsinki, Finland","Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation; Collegium for Advanced Studies at the University of Helsinki, Finland","This work was supported by Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation and the Collegium for Advanced Studies at the University of Helsinki, Finland.",,87,11,11,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The Internet, and social networks in particular, have become the integral part of integrated political marketing communication and consequently are in the function of branding a political party or a political candidate. The implementation of social networks in political campaigns has enabled direct feedback from a potential voter. Based on this fact, communication during a political campaign can be developed in line with desires and preferences of the electorate. Key messages of a political campaign find a direct way to the electorate through social networks as the offer a possibility of selecting target groups towards which all promotional activities are directed. Additionally, social networks make an ideal channel for content marketing whose primary goal is to attract new voters. Precisely the new voters are the decisive factor in making the decision who to vote for in the elections. The fundamental goal of this research is to establish how the candidates in the US Presidential Elections used social networks in their campaigns and to determine the differentiation in marketing communication strategy on social networks of presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hilary Clinton. Based on the obtained results it can be concluded how Donald Trump used social networks Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to motivate his target group as well as new voters to vote in the election and consequently secure his victory. Despite the boycott of all major mainstream media, Donald Trump managed to convey the key messages of his presidential campaign to the citizens of the US using unconventional marketing strategy, and thus securing majority electoral vote and winning the US presidential election 2016.","[Tadic, Diana Plantic; Ratkic, Hrvoje; Suput, Branka] Univ Appl Sci VERN, Trg Bana J Jelacica 3, Zagreb, Croatia",,"Tadic, DP (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci VERN, Trg Bana J Jelacica 3, Zagreb, Croatia.",diana.plantic-tadic@vern.hr; hrvoje.ratkic@gmail.com; branka.suput@vern.hr,,,,,,,13,2,2,1,9,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,372,380,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8SX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428763000038,0

Through the results of the factors' threshold effect, then we give some reasonable suggestions.","[Wang, Yi; Xu, Minghao; Lu, Jingjing] North China Elect Power Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China",North China Electric Power University,"Wang, Y (通讯作者)，North China Elect Power Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",wy6060@126.com; haogegeshishui@163.com; Lujingjing9126@163.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,1,7,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-379-1,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,23.0,,,,,,46,49,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Law; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Government & Law; Public Administration,BJ6HI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426687800013,0

The CMMPI which reflects operational performance more comprehensively and determine ways of enhancing future competiveness, not only estimates efficiency change but also decomposes gap ratio thus enabling the decision making unit to differentiate group frontier from metafrontier within the broad definition of catch-up. Empirical results show that the CMMPI of international tourism hotels in Taiwan declined by 0.9% from 2002 to 2010 mainly because of the deterioration of meta-technical efficiency change, meta-allocative efficiency change, meta-cost scale efficiency change, and the meta-input price effect change. Empirical results suggest that the completeness of cost approach is useful for exploring the characteristics of the Taiwanese international tourism hotel industry. Moreover, the international chain hotel is significantly superior to independent hotels in meta-cost efficiency, meta-technical efficiency, and meta-allocative efficiency, and several managerial insights and implications are discussed.","[Cho, Tsui-Yueh; Wang, Tsai-Yi] Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Insurance & Finance, 129,Sec 3,Sanmin Rd, Taichung 404, Taiwan",National Taichung University of Science & Technology,"Wang, TY (通讯作者)，Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Insurance & Finance, 129,Sec 3,Sanmin Rd, Taichung 404, Taiwan.",yueh@nutc.edu.tw; peterw@nutc.edu.tw,,,,,,,37,11,12,0,21,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Recent studies have therefore analyzed factors explaining variations in public support and examined strategies to increase support of restrictive policy measures. However, few have analyzed whether there is an actual relationship between transportation policies and political legitimacy. This article thus makes two main contributions to the literature. First, it explores whether there is a relationship between support of restrictive instruments and political legitimacy to study the political implications of introducing such instruments. The results show that citizens opposing restrictive measures, such as local road tolls, are more dissatisfied with the performance of local democracy.

Second, the article analyzes the importance of transportation policies in particular for local political legitimacy. The results show that citizens dissatisfied with the quality of services within the transport sector are also more dissatisfied with the performance of local democracy.","[Christiansen, Petter] Norwegian Ctr Transport Res, Inst Transport Econ, Gaustadallen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway; [Christiansen, Petter] Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway",Institute of Transport Economics; University of Oslo,"Christiansen, P (通讯作者)，Norwegian Ctr Transport Res, Inst Transport Econ, Gaustadallen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway.;Christiansen, P (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway.",pch@toi.no,,"Christiansen, Petter/0000-0002-5225-6572",Research Council of Norway [249733/O80],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),This work was supported by the Research Council of Norway for a project entitled Changing commuting in large urban areas identifying acceptable and effective measures (COMMUTE)' (249733/O80).,,75,17,18,1,24,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,1879-2375,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

In particular, we construct a hypothesis from theoretical derivation that if airlines do internalize airport congestion the airfare prices would be positively correlated with the interactive term of the airline's passenger number at the origin airport and the congestion delay level of this airport. We test this hypothesis with the Airline Origin and Destination Survey (DB1B) database and the Airline On-Time Performance database published by the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS). We find that the hypothesis is supported by the data, suggesting that airlines' behaviour is in line with the internalization theory. We further implement subsample analysis and find that airline type also plays a role in this matter. In particular, while full service carriers internalize airport congestion, low cost carriers do not.","[Guo, Huanxiu] Nanjing Audit Univ, Inst Econ & Finance, Nanjing 211815, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Changmin] Univ Manitoba, Asper Sch Business, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada; [Wan, Yulai] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Logist & Maritime Studies, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Nanjing Audit University; University of Manitoba; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Jiang, CM (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Asper Sch Business, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.",changmin.jiang@umanitoba.ca,"Jiang, Changmin/AAD-7650-2020","Wan, Yulai/0000-0002-5743-0509",Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada [SSHRC 435-2017-0728]; National Science Foundation of China [71803131],Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Financial supports from the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC 435-2017-0728) and the National Science Foundation of China (No. 71803131) are gratefully acknowledged.,,39,3,3,2,19,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Furthermore, we apply two new testing approaches: panel-data and principal components versions of explosive root tests. We find evidence for explosive price increases in many cities.

While existing research highlights member states' power, preference intensity, and the IO's institutional design, this paper introduces an additional source of bargaining power in IOs: Through issue linkage members of an IO leverage privileged positions in other IOs to obtain more favorable bargaining outcomes. Specifically, European Union members are more successful in bargaining over the EU budget while they hold a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). Inside the UNSC EU members can promote security interests of other European countries, and they can use their influence to secure side-payments from the EU budget. The study tests this argument by investigating new EU budget data, and it shows that EU members obtain 1.7 billion Euro in additional net receipts during a two-year UNSC term, on average. Thus, bargaining processes in the EU and the UN are intricately linked.","[Mikulaschek, Christoph] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Mikulaschek, C (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",cmikulas@princeton.edu,,,,,,,75,18,19,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

We review the debates prompted by LI's three core claims about national preference formation, intergovernmental bargaining and institutional choice, as well as by the theory's three policy-relevant corollaries relating to the EU's democratic deficit, its constitutional settlement and its role in the world. Liberal intergovernmentalism, we argue, remains highly relevant in today's EU, offering important insights and serving to structure much of the academic debate about the prospects of the Union in a time of crisis. Nevertheless, a revitalized LI faces the dual challenges of theorizing both the causes and consequences of mass politicization of EU politics, as well as the prospect of endogenous change in the direction of greater integration or disintegration.","[Kleine, Mareike] London Sch Econ, European Inst, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Pollack, Mark] Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Kleine, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, European Inst, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",m.o.kleine@lse.ac.uk,"Kleine, Mareike/AAP-6202-2020; Pollack, Mark/ADW-3218-2022","Kleine, Mareike/0000-0002-7442-7328;",EUI's Robert Schuman Centre; Temple University; Princeton University's EU Program,EUI's Robert Schuman Centre; Temple University; Princeton University's EU Program,"We would like to thank Frank Schimmelfennig and Alasdair Young for their comments on early drafts of this introduction.

We show that the integration steps in the copula mass function for large dimensions can be accurately approximated via numerical integration. The resulting computational gains lead to a methodology that can treat high-dimensional applications. Its accuracy is shown by an extensive simulation study. In our empirical application of 10 US bank stocks, we reveal strong evidence of time-varying intraday dependence patterns: Dependence starts at a low level but generally rises during the day. Based on one-step-ahead out-of-sample density forecasting, we find that our new model outperforms benchmarks for intraday dependence such as the cubic spline model, the fixed correlation model, or the rolling average realized correlation.","[Koopman, Siem Jan; Lit, Rutger; Lucas, Andre; Opschoor, Anne] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Koopman, Siem Jan; Lit, Rutger; Lucas, Andre; Opschoor, Anne] Tinbergen Inst, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Koopman, Siem Jan] Aarhus Univ, CREATES, Aarhus, Denmark",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; Aarhus University; CREATES,"Koopman, SJ (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Koopman, SJ (通讯作者)，Tinbergen Inst, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",s.j.koopman@vu.nl,"Koopman, S.J./M-7814-2019; Lucas, Andre/E-4054-2018","Koopman, S.J./0000-0002-4440-9524; Lucas, Andre/0000-0003-2807-1102; Opschoor, A./0000-0002-2908-2260","Dutch National Science Foundation (NWO) [VICI453-09-005]; CREATES, the Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series at Aarhus University, Denmark - Danish National Research Foundation [DNRF78]","Dutch National Science Foundation (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); CREATES, the Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series at Aarhus University, Denmark - Danish National Research Foundation","Lit and Lucas acknowledge the financial support of the Dutch National Science Foundation (NWO, grant VICI453-09-005).

The deepening of European governance has meant, however, that the EU today is better understood as a polity in formation, generalizable through the lens of comparative politics instead of international relations. Alongside the burgeoning literature on the EU's politicization, I advocate for comparisons to historical episodes of state-building and nationalism, with particular attention to the role of culture and identity in shoring up, or contesting, political authority. Doing so allows us to better delineate the challenges presented by European citizens' lack of impassioned attachment to the EU, while also informing a broader understanding of the populist backlashes occurring in the context of more global trends of transnational authority construction.","[McNamara, Kathleen R.] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC USA",Georgetown University,"McNamara, KR (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Mortara Ctr Int Studies, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",kathleen.mcnamara@georgetown.edu,,,,,,,105,15,15,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

However, they can also generate negative effects on traffic flow due to stop-start operations at bus stops. This paper aims to assess the net impact of bus operations on traffic congestion in Melbourne. The methodology used to achieve this aim comprised of three main stages. First, a primary survey was conducted to determine the mode shift from bus to car when buses are unavailable. This figure was used to estimate the positive impact of buses on relieving congestion. Second, the negative impact of buses was investigated by considering the effect of bus stop operations on vehicle traffic flow using microsimulation. Finally, the net effect was estimated by contrasting congestion measures determined from a traditional four step model between two scenarios: 'with bus' and 'without bus'. The results indicated that Melbourne's bus network contributes to reduce the number of severely congested road links by approximately 10% and total delay on the road network by around 3%. The highest congestion relief impact was found in inner Melbourne with a 7% decrease in vehicle time travelled and total delay, and 16% decrease in the number of heavily congested road links. In inner areas, the level of congestion is relatively high so the mode shift from car to bus, even if not as high as middle and outer areas, have a significant effect on relieving traffic congestion. Areas for future research are suggested such as investigating the long-term effect of buses on traffic congestion.","[Nguyen-Phuoc, Duy Q.; Currie, Graham; De Gruyter, Chris] Monash Univ, Monash Inst Transport Studies, Publ Transport Res Grp, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Nguyen-Phuoc, Duy Q.] Univ Danang Univ Sci & Technol, 54 Nguyen Luong Bang, Danang, Vietnam; [Kim, Inhi; Young, William] Monash Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Monash University; University of Danang; Monash University,"Nguyen-Phuoc, DQ (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Monash Inst Transport Studies, Publ Transport Res Grp, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",nguyen.duy@monash.edu; graham.currie@monash.edu; chris.degruyter@monash.edu; inhi.kim@monash.edu; bill.young@monash.edu,"Currie, Graham/ABC-6611-2020; Shaaban, Khaled/A-9405-2016; Currie, Graham/P-5431-2019; Kim, Inhi/U-9124-2019; Duy, Nguyen-Phuoc Q./AAD-9598-2020","Shaaban, Khaled/0000-0001-9667-252X; Currie, Graham/0000-0001-7190-7548; Kim, Inhi/0000-0001-9711-7587; Duy, Nguyen-Phuoc Q./0000-0002-2299-2368; De Gruyter, Chris/0000-0001-5069-3018",,,,,36,27,30,0,38,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

The original approaches were at odds on whether EU level intergovernmental actors or supranational actors were better able to exercise coercive or institutional power to pursue their interests, with Andrew Moravcsik's liberal intergovernmentalism serving as a baseline for one side of those debates. Newer approaches are similarly divided, but see power in terms of ideational innovation and consensus-focused deliberation. The one thing old and new approaches have in common is that they ignore the parliamentarists, new and old. What all sides to the debates have failed to recognize is the reality of a 'new' EU governance of more politically charged dynamics among all three main EU actors exercising different kinds of power. This has roots not only in the national level's increasing 'politics against policy' and its bottom up effects on the EU level. It also stems from EU institutional interactions at the top, and its 'policy with politics'.","[Schmidt, Vivien A.] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University,"Schmidt, VA (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",vschmidt@bu.edu,,,EU Commission [649456-ENLIGHTEN],EU Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"I wish to thank the guest editors of this Special Issue, Mark Pollack and Mareike Kleine, for their impressive stewardship of the entire project along with their extremely perceptive and careful editorial suggestions for my own article.

This paper investigates the response of such movements utilizing changes in cross-border differentials in the minimum wage and Earned Income Tax Credit state supplements. Specifically, effects of the minimum wage on commuting patterns are estimated for restaurant workers, high school dropouts, and teenagers. The effects of the EITC on commuting patterns are estimated for single female heads of household with children. The main results show that a $1 increase in the minimum wage differential is associated with a 0.5 to 1 percentage point increase in the probability of commuting. This is approximately a 15-25 percent increase over the mean commuting rate for the minimum wage samples of interest. Results for the EITC are less precise and show that a 0.1 increase in the phase-in rate differential is associated with an increase in commuting probability of 0.9 percentage points, a result that is not statistically different from zero. The minimum wage results are strongest along non-MSA borders.","[Shirley, Peter] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Shirley, P (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",pshirley@uci.edu,,"Shirley, Peter/0000-0003-1254-8770","University of California, Irvine Economics Department","University of California, Irvine Economics Department","I would like to thank Marianne Bitler, Jan Brueckner, Damon Clark, Yingying Dong, David Neumark, two anonymous referees, and seminar participants at the University of California, Irvine for their advice and constructive comments on this paper.

Structural estimation documents that crude oil supply and demand shocks induce sizeable remittances flows. The sign and magnitude of remitter outflows differ across countries and structural shocks. A multilateral global general equilibrium model is used to show how oil-exporting remitters generate international remittance and migration spillovers from crude oil price movements. Remittees' economic outcomes from remittances and migration channels are found to be dominated by terms of trade channels for shocks to the global market for crude oil. Due to this, studies of remittance flows need to account for the source of the commodity price movement if using the correlation between remittee real GDP and remittance inflows.","[Snudden, Stephen] Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON, Canada",Queens University - Canada,"Snudden, S (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON, Canada.",,,"Snudden, Stephen/0000-0002-4033-3235",,,,,22,3,3,2,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2018,41.0,11,,,,,2934,2953,,10.1111/twec.12666,0.0,,,20,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,HA3DC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450129200005,0

Evidence from Jordan,WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Education; inequality of opportunity; intergenerational mobility; Middle East; supply of schooling,ATTAINMENT; POLICY; WORLD,"The impact of the growth of the local supply of public schools in the post-Colonial period on intergenerational mobility in education is a first-order question in the Arab World. This question is examined in Jordan using a unique dataset that links individual data on own schooling and parents' schooling for adults, from a household survey, with the supply of schools in the subdistrict of birth at the time the individual was of age to enroll, from a school census. The identification strategy exploits the variation in the supply of basic and secondary public schools across cohorts and subdistricts of birth in Jordan, controlling for year and subdistrict-of-birth fixed effects and interactions of governorate and year-of-birth fixed effects. The findings show that the local availability of basic public schools does, in fact, increase intergenerational mobility in education. For instance, a one standard deviation increase in the supply of basic public schools per 1,000 people reduces the father-son and mother-son associations of schooling by 18-20 percent and the father-daughter and mother-daughter associations by 33-44 percent. However, an increase in the local supply of secondary public schools does not seem to have an effect on the intergenerational mobility in education.","[Assaad, Ragui] Univ Minnesota, Humphrey Sch Publ Affairs, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Saleh, Mohamed] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Saleh, Mohamed] Inst Adv Study, Toulouse, France",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Assaad, R (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Humphrey Sch Publ Affairs, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",assaad@umn.edu; mohamed.saleh@tse-fr.eu,"Saleh, Mohamed/JXL-8647-2024","Saleh, Mohamed/0000-0002-2403-9300",Economic Research Forumas part of the research project on Inequality of Opportunity and Inequality of Outcomes in the Arab Region; ANR-Labex IAST,Economic Research Forumas part of the research project on Inequality of Opportunity and Inequality of Outcomes in the Arab Region; ANR-Labex IAST(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"Ragui Assaad (corresponding author) is a professor at Humphrey School of Public Affairs, University of Minnesota; his e-mail address is assaad@umn.edu.Mohamed Saleh is an assistant professor at Toulouse School of Economics and Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse; his e-mail address ismohamed.saleh@tse-fr.eu.This article was supported by a grant from the Economic Research Forum as part of the research project on Inequality of Opportunity and Inequality of Outcomes in the Arab Region.

We consider a standard extension of the Nash equilibrium concept denoted as a partial cooperative equilibrium as well as an equilibrium concept in which the coalition of cooperators has a leadership position. Existence results are stated and we identify conditions under which the various equilibrium concepts are equivalent. We apply this framework to existing models of multi-market oligopolies and international pollution abatement. In a multi-market oligopoly, typically, a merger paradox emerges in the partial cooperative equilibrium. The paradox vanishes if the cartel attains a leadership position. For international pollution abatement treaties, cooperation by a sufficiently large group of countries results in a Pareto improvement over the standard tragedy of the commons outcome described by the Nash equilibrium.","[Chakrabarti, Subhadip; Gilles, Robert P.] Queens Univ Belfast, Queens Univ, Management Sch, Riddel Hall,185 Stranmillis Rd, Belfast BT9 5EE, Antrim, North Ireland; [Lazarova, Emiliya] Univ East Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",Queens University Belfast; University of East Anglia,"Lazarova, E (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",E.Lazarova@uea.ac.uk,"LAZAROVA, EMILIYA/AAI-6647-2020","Lazarova, Emiliya/0000-0002-7178-0644",,,,,31,2,2,0,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,OCT,2018,85.0,3-4,,,,,455,478,,10.1007/s11238-018-9666-8,0.0,,,24,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GY3JH,,"Green Published, hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448446600010,0

Although numerous authors have discussed the usefulness of the approach, only a few models exist. The paper proposes an update to a multi-agent climate-economic model, namely the battle of perspectives (Janssen, 1996; Janssen and de Vries 1998). The approach of the paper is twofold. First, the reimplementation of the model follows the model to model concept. Supporters of the approach argue that replication is a useful way to check a model's accuracy and robustness. Second, updating a model with current data and new scientific evidence is a robustness check in itself. The long-term validity and usefulness of a model depends on the variability of the data on which it is based, as well as on the model's sensitivity to data changes. By offering this update, the paper contributes to the development of agent-based models in climate-economics. Acknowledging evolutionary processes in climate-policy represents a useful complement to intertemporal cost-benefit analyses, the latter of which derive optimal protection paths but are not able to explain why people do not follow them. Since the replication and update succeeded, the paper recommends using the model as a basis for further analysis.","[Geisendorf, Sylvie] ESCP Europe Berlin, Chair Environm & Econ, Heubnerweg 8-10, D-14059 Berlin, Germany; [Geisendorf, Sylvie] ESCP Europe Berlin, Res Ctr SustBusy Business & Soc Sustainable World, Heubnerweg 8-10, D-14059 Berlin, Germany",heSam Universite; ESCP Business School; heSam Universite; ESCP Business School,"Geisendorf, S (通讯作者)，ESCP Europe Berlin, Chair Environm & Econ, Heubnerweg 8-10, D-14059 Berlin, Germany.;Geisendorf, S (通讯作者)，ESCP Europe Berlin, Res Ctr SustBusy Business & Soc Sustainable World, Heubnerweg 8-10, D-14059 Berlin, Germany.",sgeisendorf@escpeurope.eu,,,,,,,78,5,5,3,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

By quantifying the relationship between transit ridership, the cost of travel, the character of the built environment, and the socio-economic characteristics of riders, such models enable transit planners and managers to make more informed decisions regarding transit routes, levels of service, transit fares, transit oriented development (TOD) and other transit supply parameters. Direct ridership models (DRMs) are now able to address transit ridership at each station directly with higher sensitivity to built environmental characteristics in well-defined station areas. More recently Origin-Destination DRMs have begun to use data on ridership between each origin and destination pair to facilitate more precise estimation of transit demand by origin-destination pair. In this study, we developed a time-of-day Origin-Destination Direct Transit Demand Model (OD-DTDM) that uses fare-card data from the Washington DC Metrorail system, applying a multilevel (or hierarchical) model to address the statistical problem due to the presence of groups or clusters of observations. We examine the research questions: (1) what are the determinants of transit demand between the origin and destination stations in the DC Metrorail system by time of day? and (2) what are the magnitudes of impacts that land use factors, as well as factors of fares and travel time of other modes, have on transit demand vary by time of day? To address statistical complexities introduced by the fact that each station represents both an origin and a destination, we applied multilevel (or hierarchical) modeling techniques. Using these techniques, we found that the number of households and the number of jobs within a walkshed serve as trip generating and attracting factors, respectively, in the AM peak period, but with higher positive coefficients for jobs; these two factors reverse their roles in the PM peak period. Other variables with substantial effects on ridership include transit fares per mile, travel time between OD-stations by car and by bus, parking capacity, the level of feeder bus service, and train service levels. While these findings are not surprising, the time-of-day OD-DTDM provides more detailed information regarding the determinants of transit demand with temporal variation, and enables transit planners and managers to adopt policies and plans, such as transit oriented development, fare structure, and service levels, more fine-tuned for each origin and destination pair and by time of day.","[Iseki, Hiroyuki] Univ Maryland, Urban Studies & Planning Program, Natl Ctr Smart Growth Res & Educ, 1112K Preinkert Field House, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Liu, Chao] Univ Maryland, Natl Ctr Smart Growth Res & Educ, 1219A Preinkert Field House, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Knaap, Gerrit] Univ Maryland, Natl Ctr Smart Growth Res & Educ, 1112M Preinkert Field House, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Iseki, H (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Urban Studies & Planning Program, Natl Ctr Smart Growth Res & Educ, 1112K Preinkert Field House, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",hiseki@umd.edu; cliu8@umd.edu; gknaap@umd.edu,"liu, chao/C-9480-2015; Iseki, Hiroyuki/Q-3447-2017","Iseki, Hiroyuki/0000-0002-3443-9738",Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA),Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA),"This study is supported by funding from Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA).

Using field-collected freight parking observation data from New York City, this study estimated a parametric survival model to predict parking durations based on several characteristics of a parked freight vehicle. Results indicated that vehicles delivering different types of items parked for differing durations, while vehicles that parked illegally were likely to park for a shorter period of time. The model was then employed to make predictions regarding how parking durations would differ based on vehicle and delivery characteristics. An elasticity analysis was performed on each significant variable, and planning recommendations were made in order to maximize the amount of vehicles parking legally. Recommendations for future research included expanding the dataset to obtain more accurate estimates and applying the duration model to optimize operations at a business or logistics firm.","[Schmid, Joshua] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 5304 JEC Bldg,110 8th St, Troy, NY 12180 USA; [Wang, Xiaokun (Cara)] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 4032 JEC Bldg,110 8th St, Troy, NY 12180 USA; [Conway, Alison] CUNY City Coll, Dept Civil Engn, Steinman Hall T-195,160 Convent Ave, New York, NY 10031 USA",Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; City University of New York (CUNY) System; City College of New York (CUNY),"Wang, XK (通讯作者)，Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 4032 JEC Bldg,110 8th St, Troy, NY 12180 USA.",schmij5@rpi.edu; wangx18@rpi.edu; aconway@ccny.cuny.edu,"WANG, XIAOKUN/GQR-1904-2022","Wang, Xiaokun/0000-0001-5819-0212; Conway, Alison/0000-0002-2538-4501",University Transportation Research Center Region II as part of the Project Freight Costs at the Curbside,University Transportation Research Center Region II as part of the Project Freight Costs at the Curbside,The research reported in this paper was supported by the University Transportation Research Center Region II as part of the Project Freight Costs at the Curbside.,,21,26,29,2,16,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

In summarized form, we present an overview of each of the financial theories that discuss the movements of stock prices and their connection with industry trends. Within this theoretical framework, we first propose that prices be distinguished by following stock prices and a random-walk approach, and second, that the analysis of historical prices be broken down by industries. Similarities among price series are extracted through a clustering methodology based on an approach to non-computable Kolmogorov complexity. We model price series by following geometric Brownian motion and compare them to historical series of stock prices. Our first contribution confirms the existence of hidden common patterns in time series of historical prices that are clearly distinguishable from simulated series. The second contribution claims strong connections among firms carrying out similar industrial activities. The results confirm that stock prices belonging to the same industry behave similarly, whereas they behave differently from those of firms in other industries. Our research sheds new light on the stylized feature of the non-randomness of stock prices by pointing at fundamental aspects related to the industry as partial explanatory factors behind price movements.","[Contreras, Ivan] Univ Girona, Inst Informat & Aplicac, Girona, Spain; [Ignacio Hidalgo, J.] Univ Complutense Madrid, Adapt & Bioinspired Syst Res Grp, Madrid, Spain; [Nunez, Laura] IE Business Sch, Madrid, Spain",Universitat de Girona; Complutense University of Madrid; IE University,"Contreras, I (通讯作者)，Univ Girona, Inst Informat & Aplicac, Girona, Spain.",ivancontrerasfd@gmail.com,"Núñez, Laura/IVU-9691-2023; Hidalgo, J.

To mitigate potential governance failures, states turn to information sharing - the exchange of sensitive data between governments. Such exchanges, however, come with considerable risks. Building on work in International Relations and organizational sociology stressing the importance of institutional similarity, we argue that states commit to information sharing based on their beliefs as to the reliability and predictability of potential partners - an assessment that involves a relative evaluation of domestic institutions. We test our argument on institutional similarity with a new dataset of mutual legal assistance treaties (MLATs) - a critical example of information-sharing agreements. The empirical analysis finds substantial support for our argument: states with similar legal institutions are much more likely to sign MLATs.

Not only is assignment to process often not random, but when the process of creating new institutions starts, outcomes and other performance-influencing covariates are not measurable because the yet-to-be created institutions are not functioning at baseline. This paper compares the performance of 74 'treated' water user associations (WUAs) in Tajikistan that were created using a longer training process with 67 'control' WUAs that were created using shorter training, to assess the impact of training on WUA performance of mandated duties. First, propensity scores were constructed to estimate the probabilities of being 'treated' by treatment status. These results guided the application of the difference-in-difference technique with right-hand side covariates in a context where field measures of outcomes and other performance-influencing covariates were made after the new institutions were created and functioning. The first measures were taken within 12-18 months of the new institutions being functional and the second measures were taken 24 months after the first. This choice of methods introduces a bias due to measurement error causing an underestimate of the treatment effects, while controlling for biases due to time-invariant and time-varying unobservables. An alternative method that only compared the differences in outcomes at a single point in time after the new institutions were created would have provided an inaccurate estimate of the effects of the intervention. This is a context in which methods such as synthetic controls are impossible to employ due to the nature of the intervention, other macroeconomic structural changes, and severe data restrictions. The methodology employed here generates evidence that, while biased toward generating an underestimate of effect, can still be useful and informative for policy and management purposes, and for evaluating the impact of process on the functioning of new institutions in transition settings.","[Balasubramanya, Soumya; Price, Joseph P.

Based on the empirical evidence, we decompose changes in aggregate energy intensity into structural changes in the economy (structural effect) and within-sector energy efficiency improvements (efficiency effect). The relative importance of these effects is determined by energy price growth and sectoral productivities that drive the direction of technical change. When research is directed to the labour-intensive sector, the structural effect is the main driver of energy intensity dynamics. In contrast, the efficiency effect dominates energy intensity developments, when research is directed to energy-intensive industries. Increasing energy price generally leads to lower energy intensities and temporal energy price shocks might induce a permanent redirection of innovation activities.

The improvement of transit access conditions is deemed to improve the overall quality of the transit service, the user experience, and ultimately, the transit ridership. In transport modeling, however, transit accessibility is still modeled in a very crude manner based on centroid connectors. This approach does not render actual walking conditions as encountered by transit users. The current paper proposes a new definition of transit access for transport modeling purposes. In contrast to current practice which is based on centroid connectors, this new definition uses high resolution spatial data to model actual access and egress conditions to and from transit facilities. The new approach relies on the spatial distribution of potential transit users and their probability of using transit facilities. Two automatic methods have been developed: selection of accessible transit facilities on the basis of their proximity and computation of the length of connectors using distance decay functions. Results from the urban area of Lyon, France, show the significant contribution of the new definition. In comparison to the standard method, the new definition is found to improve main transit modeling outcomes and to better reproduce observed data. This new method can assist transport planners and public authorities to evaluate transit policies more accurately and instruct more appropriately policy makers.","[Manout, Ouassim; Bonnel, Patrick; Bouzouina, Louafi] Univ Lyon, ENTPE, LAET, 3 Rue Maurice Audin, F-69518 Vaulx En Velin, France; [Manout, Ouassim] ForCity, 184 Cours Lafayette, F-69003 Lyon, France",,"Manout, O (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon, ENTPE, LAET, 3 Rue Maurice Audin, F-69518 Vaulx En Velin, France.",ouassim.manout@entpe.fr; Patrick.bonnel@entpe.fr; louafi.bouzouina@entpe.fr,"Manout, Ouassim/AAY-1717-2021","Manout, Ouassim/0000-0002-7688-7934; Bouzouina, Louafi/0000-0001-8975-5124",ForCity (an urban modeling startup); Keolis (the transit operator for the region of Lyon); RATP (the transit operator for the Paris region),ForCity (an urban modeling startup); Keolis (the transit operator for the region of Lyon); RATP (the transit operator for the Paris region),"This research has been carried out thanks to the support of ForCity (an urban modeling startup), Keolis (the transit operator for the region of Lyon), and RATP (the transit operator for the Paris region).

From the point of view of economic history, what should we make of such doomster prophecies? As economic historians all know, for 97% or so of recorded history, the stationary state well-describes the long-run dynamics of the world economy. Growth was slow, intermittent, and reversible. The Industrial Revolution rang in a period of sustained economic growth. Is that growth sustainable? One way to come to grips with that question is to analyze the brakes on economic growth before the Industrial Revolution and examine how they were released. Once these mechanisms are identified, we can look at the economic history of the past few decades and make an assessment of how likely growth is to continue. The answer I give is simple: there is no technological reason for growth in economic welfare to slow down, although institutions may become in some area a serious concern on the sustainability of growth.","[Mokyr, Joel] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, 2211 Campus Dr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Mokyr, Joel] Northwestern Univ, Dept Hist, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Mokyr, Joel] Tel Aviv Univ, Berglas Sch Econ, Tel Aviv, Israel",Northwestern University; Northwestern University; Tel Aviv University,"Mokyr, J (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, 2211 Campus Dr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",J-Mokyr@northwestern.edu,,,Balzan Foundation; Northwestern's Center for Economic History,Balzan Foundation; Northwestern's Center for Economic History,"I am indebted to Ashish Aggarwal for research assistance, and the Balzan Foundation and Northwestern's Center for Economic History for financial support.

Focusing on the low-cost carrier (LCC) framework, we compare easyJet's 2012 average fares on all routes with their 2011 counterpart in the same equivalent week. Empirical analyses show that changes in frequency are negatively correlated with fare variations, both in monopolistic and competitive contexts. Our conjecture is that if the load factor has to be maintained within a sustainable range and the demand level can be assumed roughly constant, at least in the short period, variations in average fares should be negatively correlated with changes in frequency at the route level. Moreover, by analyzing easyJet's price discrimination dynamics, we find that an increase in weekly flights leads the airline to strategically price discriminate demand among offered flights (between-flights discrimination), especially in competitive situations, while reducing its ability to intertemporally price discriminate on the same flight (within-flight discrimination).","[Cattaneo, Mattia; Malighetti, Paolo; Redondi, Renato; Salanti, Andrea] Univ Bergamo, Dept Management Informat & Prod Engn, Bergamo, Italy",University of Bergamo,"Cattaneo, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bergamo, Dept Management Informat & Prod Engn, Bergamo, Italy.",mattia.cattaneo@unibg.it; paolo.malighetti@unibg.it; renato.redondi@unibg.it; andrea.salanti@unibg.it,,,,,,,32,7,8,0,10,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Favorable cost-benefit ratios then depend on low costs. This paper calculates the costs of microcredit and other elements of the microcredit business model using proprietary data on 1,335 microfinance institutions between 2005 and 2009, jointly serving 80.1 million borrowers. The costs of making small loans to poorer clients are high, and when revenues fall short of costs, subsidies are necessary to deliver services to those clients on a sustainable basis. Using a method that accounts for the opportunity costs of all forms of subsidy, the analysis finds that the median institution receives five cents of subsidy per dollar lent and $51 of subsidy per borrower (in PPP-adjusted terms). Relatively low levels of median subsidy suggest that even modest benefits of microcredit could yield impressive cost-benefit ratios. The distribution of subsidies is highly skewed, however: the average subsidy per dollar lent is 13 cents, and the average subsidy per borrower is $248. The data show that subsidies per borrower are substantially higher for commercial microfinance banks and some non-bank financial institutions that make relatively large loans. MFIs organized as non-governmental organizations (NGOs), in contrast, generally rely less on subsidy.","[Cull, Robert] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Demirguc-Kunt, Asli] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Res, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Morduch, Jonathan] NYU, Publ Policy & Econ, Wagner Grad Sch Publ Serv, New York, NY 10003 USA",The World Bank; The World Bank; New York University,"Cull, R (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",rcull@worldbank.org; ademirguckunt@worldbank.org; jmorduch@nyu.edu,,,,,,,34,44,45,1,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

Analysis of firm-level data from China's electronics industry reveals that both spatial and R&D agglomerations are positively related to R&D, highlighting the importance of network effects of agglomeration. Multinational enterprises invest less in R&D compared with domestic firms, because they tend to allocate R&D activity to the parent firm, leaving their Chinese affiliates to focus on manufacturing. No significant difference in R&D investment is observed between state-owned enterprises and private firms in China.

However, these studies have examined a limited set of possible explanatory factors and in some cases used only descriptive statistical analyses. To explore the causes of the licensing trend in more depth, this study uses retrospective questions asked of respondents to the 2014-15 UC Davis Campus Travel Survey, an annual online survey of students and employees at the University of California, Davis. We test the influence of an array of explanatory factors on driver's license possession, using a binomial logistic model, and on license timing, using multilevel survival analysis and censored regression models. The results show that delay in licensing is associated with travel attributes and attitudes, parental influences, and graduated driver's licensing policies. After controlling for these factors, the variables accounting for unexplained cohort influences had a small and uncertain effect on delay. Since we observe generational differences in eagerness to get a driver's license and find that driver's licensing attitudes substantially increase delay, this result suggests that cultural changes may be driving the decreased licensing trend. This generational shift in attitudes may have synergistic effects with policies designed to encourage smart growth and with the proliferation of innovative travel options that provide alternatives to car ownership and use.","[Thigpen, Calvin; Handy, Susan] Univ Calif Davis, Inst Transportat Studies, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Thigpen, C (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Inst Transportat Studies, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",cgthigpen@ucdavis.edu; slhandy@ucdavis.edu,,"Thigpen, Calvin/0000-0003-4284-2882",UC Davis Transportation and Parking Service Department; UC Davis Jarena Wright Fellowship; National Center for Sustainable Transportation Dissertation Grant; US Federal Highway Administration's Dwight David Eisenhower Transportation Fellowship,UC Davis Transportation and Parking Service Department; UC Davis Jarena Wright Fellowship; National Center for Sustainable Transportation Dissertation Grant; US Federal Highway Administration's Dwight David Eisenhower Transportation Fellowship,"We would like to thank Dr. Joan Walker for her helpful suggestion to consider left-censoring in our censored regression model.

Results show that, a few years after graduation, men are more likely than women to acquire complex jobs and that this difference contributes to early career gender gaps in wages and employee bargaining power.

However, twin births are not exogenous either as dizygotic twinning is correlated with maternal characteristics. Following the medical literature, we assume that monozygotic twins are exogenous, and construct a new instrument, which corrects for the selection although monozygotic twinning is usually unobserved in survey and administrative datasets. Using administrative data from Sweden, we show that the usual twin instrument is related to observed and unobserved determinants of economic outcomes, while our new instrument is not. In our applications we find that the classical twin instrument underestimates the negative effect of fertility on labor income. This finding is in line with the observation that high earners are more likely to delay childbearing and hence have a higher risk to get dizygotic twins.","[Farbmacher, Helmut; Guber, Raphael] Max Planck Gesell, Munich Ctr Econ Aging, Munich, Germany; [Farbmacher, Helmut] Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, Mannheim, Germany; [Vikstrom, Johan] IFAU, Uppsala, Sweden; [Vikstrom, Johan] Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, Uppsala Ctr Labor Studies, Uppsala, Sweden",Max Planck Society; University of Mannheim; Uppsala University,"Farbmacher, H (通讯作者)，Max Planck Gesell, Munich Ctr Econ Aging MEA, Amalienstr 33, D-80799 Munich, Germany.",farbmacher@mpisoc.mpg.de,,"Farbmacher, Helmut/0000-0002-3789-7742",International Doctoral Program Evidence-Based Economics of the Elite Network of Bavaria; Ragnar Soderberg Foundation,International Doctoral Program Evidence-Based Economics of the Elite Network of Bavaria; Ragnar Soderberg Foundation,"We are grateful for helpful suggestions from the Editor Edward Vytlacil, four anonymous referees, Marcus Eliason, Martin Nybom, Martin Weidner, and participants at the International Association for Applied Econometrics conference, the Econometric Society World congress, the Royal Economic Society annual conference, the Verein fur Socialpolitik annual conference and IFAU.

Based on the accounts of 25 women in such disciplines in an Irish university, four types are identified: careerist femininity; individualised femininity; vocational femininity; and family-oriented femininity. All of these are constituted in relation to the meanings attached to the masculinist STEM career which performatively render women outsiders. The typology moves beyond the career/paid work and work/life dichotomies to encompass both the re-envisioning of career as vocation (Type 3) and the development of a highly individualised lifestyle orientation based on a high commitment to both (Type 2). It points to the variation, complexity and contradictions in how women do femininities in the academic STEM environment.","[O'Connor, Pat] Univ Limerick, Sociol & Social Policy, Limerick, Ireland; [O'Hagan, Clare] Univ Limerick, Gender Equal Project, Limerick, Ireland; [Gray, Breda] Univ Limerick, Dept Sociol, Limerick, Ireland; [O'Connor, Pat] Univ Coll Dublin, Geary Inst, Dublin, Ireland",University of Limerick; University of Limerick; University of Limerick; University College Dublin,"O'Connor, P (通讯作者)，Univ Limerick, Fac Arts Humanities & Social Sci, Dept Sociol, Fdn Bldg, Limerick V94 PX58, Ireland.",pat.oconnor@ul.ie,,,European Commission [287526],European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),This work was supported by funding from the European Commission under Grant Number 287526.,,57,16,17,0,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

It draws on the organizational spaces literature to analyse the relationship between design of the physical work setting and senior doctors' experiences of deprofessionalization. Analysis of qualitative data from a study of senior hospital doctors identifies two main themes that link the experience of spaces with perceptions of the erosion of professional status and reduced knowledge sharing. These two themes are: emplacement, which is the application of coercive power both in and through spatial arrangements; and isolation, which refers to physical alienation in the workplace leading to disconnection and a perceived loss of power. Observing the changes in the physical environment over time and mapping them against these processes of deprofessionalization offers interesting new insights into the sociology of professions.","[Siebert, Sabina] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Management, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Bushfield, Stacey; Martin, Graeme; Howieson, Brian] Univ Dundee, Sch Business, Management, Dundee, Scotland; [Martin, Graeme] Univ Dundee, Sch Business, Res, Dundee, Scotland",University of Glasgow; University of Dundee; University of Dundee,"Siebert, S (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",sabina.siebert@glasgow.ac.uk,"Martin, Graeme/O-2038-2013","Martin, Graeme/0000-0002-2395-0629",British Medical Association Scottish Consultants Committee,British Medical Association Scottish Consultants Committee,The study was funded by the British Medical Association Scottish Consultants Committee.,,53,17,18,2,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

To assess the impact of the Tobin tax in this framework, we extend the model of De Grauwe and Grimaldi (Eur Econ Rev 50(1):1-33, 2006) by including transaction costs and perform numerical simulations. Motivated by the importance of the market microstructure, we choose to model the market as being cleared by a Walrasian auctioneer. This setting could more closely resemble the two-layered structure of foreign exchanges at daily frequency than a price impact function, which is often adopted in similar studies. We find that the Tobin tax can deliver a moderate reduction of return volatility and kurtosis. In addition, simulations indicate that the Tobin tax reduces the degree of mispricing in the time series, which is primarily achieved by eliminating long-lasting deviations from fundamental value.","[Stanek, Filip] CERGE EI, Politickych Veznu 7, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic; [Kukacka, Jiri] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Smetanovo Nabrezi 6, Prague 11101 1, Czech Republic; [Kukacka, Jiri] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Vodarenskou Vezi 4, Prague 18200 8, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague; Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Kukacka, J (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Smetanovo Nabrezi 6, Prague 11101 1, Czech Republic.;Kukacka, J (通讯作者)，Czech Acad Sci, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Vodarenskou Vezi 4, Prague 18200 8, Czech Republic.",filip.stanek@cerge-ei.cz; jiri.kukacka@fsv.cuni.cz,"Kukacka, Jiri/J-1974-2014","Kukacka, Jiri/0000-0001-8680-2896","Czech Science Foundation (GACR) [P402/12/G097]; Grant Agency of the Charles University (GAUK) [588912, SVV 260 233]",Czech Science Foundation (GACR)(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Grant Agency of the Charles University (GAUK),Support from the Czech Science Foundation (GACR) under the P402/12/G097 DYME Dynamic models in economics project and from the Grant Agency of the Charles University (GAUK) under project 588912 and project SVV 260 233 are gratefully acknowledged.,,52,6,7,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

J,"Bacha, OI; Mirakhor, A",,,,"Bacha, Obiyathulla Ismath; Mirakhor, Abbas",,,Funding development infrastructure without leverage: A risk-sharing alternative using innovative sukuk structures,WORLD ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Muslim countries of the developing world suffer indebtedness resulting mostly from funding development infrastructure. Faced with a dire need for development infrastructure but with inadequate resources to fund them domestically, these governments often resort to foreign borrowing. As neither foreign banks nor international debt markets would allow for the debt to be in home currency, the funding is invariably denominated in foreign currency. For the borrowing country, in addition to currency exposure such borrowing increases the country's leverage and economic vulnerability. As these countries typically have a narrow economic base with heavy reliance on commodity exports, they are susceptible to the vagaries of commodity price fluctuation. Leverage increases the amplitude of the economy's fluctuation, resulting if not in outright crisis, then, at least in financial distress and depreciating home currency. As a result, when the foreign currency funded project comes on stream, it is burdened with huge accumulated debt which in many cases makes the project unmanageable without further government help through subsidy of operating costs. This further stresses already stretched government budgets and perpetuates indebtedness. This cycle of borrowing, leverage and vulnerability can be broken by innovative use of sukuk. The problem with debt financing is that the servicing requirements are independent of the underlying project's risk or cash flows. This paper presents two sukuk structures based on the risk sharing principles of Islamic finance. Sukuk that have returns linked to the nation's gross domestic product growth if the funded project is non-revenue generating and linked to earnings of the project if it is revenue generating can avoid the problems above. The pay-off profile, estimated cost of funds and returns to investors of these sukuk are discussed. When designed in small denomination, such sukuk can enhance financial inclusion, help build domestic capital markets and enable the financing of development without stressing government budgets.","[Bacha, Obiyathulla Ismath; Mirakhor, Abbas] Global Univ Islamic Finance, INCEIF, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",INCEIF,"Bacha, OI (通讯作者)，Global Univ Islamic Finance, INCEIF, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",,"Bacha, Obiyathulla/AAF-9083-2021",,,,,,8,14,18,2,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2018,41.0,3,,,,,752,762,,10.1111/twec.12512,0.0,,,11,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FY7DH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427021300006,0

The evidence across econometric techniques and sample periods systematically indicates that: (i) a real depreciation of the yuan-dollar exchange rate reduces Mexican manufacturing exports by lowering the price of Chinese goods in the US market; (ii) a depreciation of the peso-dollar real exchange rate generates a strong supply-side effect due to the high import content of Mexican manufacturing exports, which ultimately leads to lower (rather than higher) sales in the US; and (iii) external demand and labour productivity are positively related to manufacturing exports, whereas real wages are negatively related. Therefore, a falling external demand for Mexican manufacturing products or a real depreciation of the Chinese currency could, to some extent, be offset by increasing labour productivity faster than wages. These findings reflect two fundamental problems of the Mexican economy: (i) low investment in high-quality formal instruction and proper training programs, which gives rise to severe bottleneck points for faster labour productivity growth and (ii) excessive reliance of the export-oriented manufacturing industry on foreign suppliers of intermediate inputs.","[Cuevas, Victor] Univ Autonoma Metropolitana, Dept Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana - Mexico,"Cuevas, V (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Metropolitana, Dept Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",,,,,,,,62,1,1,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2018,41.0,3,,,,,866,883,,10.1111/twec.12542,0.0,,,18,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FY7DH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427021300011,0

In particular, we examine whether different religious groups (Christianity, Islam, Judaism and Buddhism) have an impact on income inequality in a global perspective. Furthermore, this paper also sheds light on the effects of major religious sub-groups (Christianity and Islam) on income inequality. Using data for 130 countries from 1970 to 2013, we estimate a panel data model, controlling for religious beliefs, savings rate, arable land rate and age-dependency ratio. Our results indicate that religion plays an important role in explaining income inequality. In particular, we found that Islam and Judaism reduce income inequality while in general, Christianity and Buddhism increases inequality. However, the effects from sub-groups of Christianity on inequality are mixed; in particular, Anglican and Orthodox significantly reduce inequality while the effect from Catholic and Protestant is opposite. These findings are robust to different measures of inequality and alternative estimation techniques that take care of endogeneity.","[Naveed, Amjad] Aarhus Univ, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Birk Centerpk 15, DK-7400 Aarhus, Denmark; [Wang, Cong] Bond Univ Univ Dr, Bond Business Sch, 14 Univ Dr, Robina, Qld 4226, Australia",Aarhus University; Bond University,"Naveed, A (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Birk Centerpk 15, DK-7400 Aarhus, Denmark.",amjadnaveed9@yahoo.com; cowang@bond.edu.au,"Naveed, Amjad/AAU-2164-2020; Naveed, Amjad/JUV-0303-2023","Naveed, Amjad/0000-0002-1351-4145; Wang, Cong/0000-0002-6852-5490",,,,,78,11,11,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,MAR,2018,50.0,3,,,,,481,518,,10.1007/s00355-017-1093-1,0.0,,,38,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,FV6CD,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424668000004,0

Carbon dioxide reduction may be characterized by Prisoners' Dilemma, threshold, or harmony games, depending on capture and sequestration procedures. In contrast, albedo modification may abide by chicken, coordination, or threshold games. Once deployed, albedo modification presents an addiction problem that makes current efforts difficult to alter, even by countries originally opposed to such modification. With its many procedures, geoengineering is tied to a host of collective action problems that may ensue prior, during, or after geoengineering deployment. For carbon dioxide reduction, governance concerns encouraging action, while for albedo modification, governance concerns inhibiting unilateral action.

For this purpose, we decompose the inflation gap, the difference between actual inflation and the inflation target, into predictable and unpredictable components. We argue that the central banks are successful if the predictable component diminishes over time. The predictable component of the inflation gap is measured by the conditional mean of a parsimonious time-varying autoregressive model. Our results find considerable heterogeneity in the success of these IT countries in achieving their targets at the start of this policy regime. Our findings suggest that the central banks of the IT adopting countries started targeting inflation implicitly before becoming an explicit inflation targeter. The panel data analysis suggests that the relative success of these countries in reducing the gap is influenced by their institutional characteristics, particularly fiscal discipline and macroeconomic performance.","[Ardakani, Omid M.] Georgia Southern Univ, Econ, Savannah, GA USA; [Kishor, N.

A multi-equation model building on the factorially determined multi-output model of classical production theory satisfies the materials balance that tells us that the mass contained in inputs cannot disappear, but must turn up in the desirable outputs or end up as residuals. In this model, potentially complex technical relationships are simplified to express each of the intended outputs and the residuals as functions of the same set of inputs. Serious problems with the single-equation models most often found in the literature are demonstrated. Abatement activity in the form of end of pipe is added, and an optimal planning solution is derived using the concept of an environmental damage function for the impact of discharge of residuals into the natural environment. It is shown that the traditional environmental policy instruments, like direct regulation restricting the amount of undesirable residuals discharged to the environment, a Pigou tax on pollutants, and cap and trade, all function well. Extending the multi-equation model to allow for inefficiency, three efficiency measures are introduced: desirable output efficiency, residuals efficiency, and abatement efficiency. It is conjectured that these measures can be estimated independently using the DEA model.","[Forsund, Finn R.] Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Forsund, FR (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, Oslo, Norway.",finn.forsund@econ.uio.no,,,,,,,62,52,53,3,11,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We analyse this question for exports of the Swiss agriculture and food sector, using both time series and dynamic panel data models based on data from 1999 to 2012. We find that in the long run a one per cent appreciation of the Swiss franc leads on average to a decrease in exports of agricultural and food products between 0.8 and 0.9 per cent. Our results suggest that on average, producers in the Swiss agriculture and food sector are able to successfully avoid price competition by differentiating their products, producing high-quality products for niche markets.","[Kohler, Andreas; Ferjani, Ali] Agroscope, Fed Dept Econ Affairs Educ & Res, Ettenhausen, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope,"Kohler, A (通讯作者)，Agroscope, Fed Dept Econ Affairs Educ & Res, Ettenhausen, Switzerland.",,,"Kohler, Andreas/0000-0003-2756-8512",,,,,50,8,8,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,FEB,2018,41.0,2,,,,,494,518,,10.1111/twec.12611,0.0,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FV9WU,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424941800006,0

Though it is generally agreed that this has been driven by economic factors, climatic factors might also have had a part to play. The challenge is to evaluate the impact of climatic factors on migration in the simultaneous presence of changing socio-economic influences. We resolve this challenge by carrying out a statistical multivariate regression analysis on bilateral migration rates between Chinese provinces. The analysis simultaneously includes climate change in the form of climate anomalies (temperature, precipitation, sunshine) and various socio-economic factors including energy consumption. To this end we have constructed a unique three-dimensional panel dataset (time, sending province, receiving province) with bilateral migration rates between 30 provinces for the period 1987-2015. Due to the distributional properties of the data and underlying theory we use a Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood (PPML) estimator but include OLS estimates for comparison. The results suggest that increases in temperature and precipitation are significant migration push factors while increased sunshine discourages push migration. Provincial differentials in per capita energy consumption and Gross Regional Product (GRP) are also significant drivers of migration.","[Barassi, M. R.; Ercolani, M. G.; Herrerias, M.

There has been renewed interest in this question since the large and persistent fall in the real price of oil in 2014-16. In the context of this debate, Ramey (2017) makes the striking claim that the existing literature on the transmission of oil price shocks is fundamentally confused about the question of how to quantify the effect of oil price shocks. In particular, she asserts that the discretionary income effect on private consumption, which plays a central role in contemporary accounts of the transmission of oil price shocks to the U.S. economy, makes no economic sense and has no economic foundation. Ramey suggests that the literature has too often confused the terms-of-trade effect with this discretionary income effect, and she makes the case that the effects of the oil price decline of 2014-16 on private consumption are smaller for a multitude of reasons than suggested by empirical models of the discretionary income effect. We review the main arguments in Ramey (2017) and show that none of her claims hold up to scrutiny. Our analysis highlights the theoretical basis of the discretionary income effect. We also discuss improved regression-based estimates of this effect that allow for changes in the dependence on oil and gasoline imports, and we highlight the fact that alternative estimates used by policymakers involve strong simplifying assumptions.","[Baumeister, Christiane] Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Baumeister, Christiane; Kilian, Lutz] CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA; [Kilian, Lutz] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, 611 Tappan St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Zhou, Xiaoqing] Bank Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Notre Dame; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Bank of Canada,"Kilian, L (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA.;Kilian, L (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, 611 Tappan St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",lkilian@umich.edu,,,,,,,39,23,25,0,2,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2018,39.0,,,,2,,117,137,,10.5547/01956574.39.SI2.cbau,0.0,,,21,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,VJ6RI,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000616698300007,0

It is just now, that the debate about GE and its possible use in food and feed production transcends the scientific circle towards a political discussion. Although a general public debate in Germany is yet to come, it very likely will be influenced by the existing controversy about food products modified by classical genetic engineering, i.e. genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The Institute Technology-Theology-Natural Science (TTN) investigates potential ethical aspects of the public debate with a focus on the question of freedom of choice and labelling of GE products. An expert online survey we conducted revealed that GE technologies have the potential to change the stand-off situation in the debate about genetical engineering in agriculture as they were positively assessed by the majority of the experts. But therefore, questions of risk and questions of values need to be discussed in a comprehensive debate. We find that a voluntary label for GE-free as well as approved GE products will be highly effective to ascertain freedom of choice and to improve the knowledge basis for a value-based deliberation of GE technologies.","[Bechtold, S.

Confronting to new data and to rising inflation, Gordon adopted the NRH after 1973. Nevertheless, the adoption anticipated any clear empirical proof. We explain that this conversion was due to Friedman's influence on Gordon, but also to the fact it did not prevent Gordon to support active stabilization policies.","[Goutsmedt, Aurelien] Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, Paris, France; [Rubin, Goulven] Univ Lille, Lille Econ Management, Lille, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Universite de Lille,"Rubin, G (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, 112-116 Blvd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France.",Goulven.Rubin@univ-paris1.fr,"Goutsmedt, Aurélien/JWO-4582-2024","Goutsmedt, Aurélien/0000-0002-3788-7237",,,,,61,6,6,0,4,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

They are an important analytical instrument allowing to assess whether the bank's activity is conducted economically. The aim of the article is to assess the impact of a bank tax on the operational efficiency of commercial banks in Poland and the effects of its introduction on banking services for costumer. The author draws attention to insufficient research on the consequences of tax and the stability of the banking system, in particular in the context of low interest rates and increased burdens borne by banks. The author accepted the hypothesis that the introduction of a new tax burden resulted in lowering basic ratios of banks' profitability and an increase in costs incurred by clients in connection with the use of banking products. The analysis of aggregated financial data was used to verify hypotheses.","[Gubernat, Ewa] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Finance, Ul Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Gubernat, E (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Finance, Ul Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",ewa.gubernat@ue.wroc.pl,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,2,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8980-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,123,127,,,,,,5,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BM4AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000462948800015,0

The therapeutic and preventive use of antibiotics in intensive livestock production is closely linked to the animal housing and rearing conditions. The transmission dynamic of antibiotic resistance is complex and not fully understood, but still antibiotics should be used with cautiousness. The WHO has launched an action plan aiming for 'reduction in nontherapeutic use of antimicrobial medicines in animal health. Thus, the risk factors associated with intense production needs to be tackled in order enable animal production with minimal antibiotics usage. In contrast to most other concurrent commercial animal husbandry in Europe and in the world, organic livestock production today essentially complies with this position. It has been postulated that lower need and use of antibiotics in organic livestock production will diminish the risk of development of antibiotic resistance, and this has also been demonstrated in organic pigs and poultry. However, the differences between species and countries are large. Organic production is always certified according to rigorous standards, which means that transparency for consumers and authorities throughout the food chain should be guaranteed. This transparency may be fruitful in order to acquire knowledge and methods for combating the elevating problems of transmissions of antimicrobial resistance within the food production. In summary, organic animal husbandry essentially fulfils today the demands on restrictive use of antibiotics made by the WHO and by the European Parliament, for counteracting the development and spreading of antibiotic resistance. Knowledge dissemination between conventional and organic production may be important steps in the right direction. However, transition into organic production for the whole livestock sector would, on its own, only be part of a solution of the antibiotic resistance issue, because factors outside animal production, such as the use in humans, will be unaffected.","[Gunnarsson, S.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Anim Environm & Hlth, POB 234, S-53223 Skara, Sweden; [Mie, A.] Karolinska Inst, Dept Clin Sci & Educ, Sodersjukhuset, Sjukhusbacken 10, S-11883 Stockholm, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Sodersjukhuset Hospital; Karolinska Institutet,"Gunnarsson, S (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Anim Environm & Hlth, POB 234, S-53223 Skara, Sweden.",stefan.gunnarsson@slu.se,"Gunnarsson, Stefan/H-1537-2014","Gunnarsson, Stefan/0000-0002-9126-1905",,,,,29,1,1,0,9,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,93,98,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_12,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000012,0

In terms of evolution, the rules are fairly stable over time, but with numerous adaptations that bring them closer to international standards and with a de jure evolution that leads to the disconnection of accounting from taxation. The share of tangible assets in the listed companies' balance sheets is significant (around 50% on the regulated market and 60% on AeRo). This leads to a significant impact of the depreciation and impairment charges on the financial indicators of listed companies (over 50% and 80% of EBITDA, respectively). The mostused method of depreciation is the straight-line method, with a severe decrease of the use of the accelerated method when applying IFRS.

Coupled with the restoration of government orders and the 2020 rearmament programme, these newly acquired market skills have contributed to the impressive revival of the Russian defence industry in the Putin era.","[Kosals, Leonid] Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Lab Studies Econ Sociol, 9-11 Myasnitskaya Ulitsa, Moscow 101000, Russia; [Kosals, Leonid] Univ Toronto, Ctr Criminol & Sociolegal Studies, 14 Queens Pk Crescent West, Toronto, ON M5S 3K9, Canada; [Izyumov, Alexei] Univ Louisville, Dept Econ, 110 West Brandeis Ave, Louisville, KY 40292 USA; [Kemelgor, Bruce] Univ Louisville, Dept Management, Management, 110 West Brandeis Ave, Louisville, KY 40292 USA",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); University of Toronto; University of Louisville; University of Louisville,"Kosals, L (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Lab Studies Econ Sociol, 9-11 Myasnitskaya Ulitsa, Moscow 101000, Russia.;Kosals, L (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Ctr Criminol & Sociolegal Studies, 14 Queens Pk Crescent West, Toronto, ON M5S 3K9, Canada.",leon.kosals@gmail.com; alexei.izyumov@louisville.edu; bhkeme01@louisville.edu,"IZYUMOV, ALEXEI/AAL-6340-2021","IZYUMOV, ALEXEI/0000-0002-1750-2790",,,,,115,1,1,2,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2018,70.0,9,,,,,1450,1471,,10.1080/09668136.2018.1500524,0.0,,,22,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,HD3SD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452438400005,0

They show that fintech has developed rapidly in terms of new market entrants and the volume of the market. The authors also show that fintech specialists are required to have a diverse set of skills combining information technology (e.g. cybersecurity or blockchain applications) and finance. Although the lack of qualified labour force is not perceived as a problem by domestic fintech experts, this may change in the future. The authors suggest that the government consider supporting education institutions' initiatives in adapting their programs for fintech demands, while education institutions should keep in close contact with employers to ensure that they can tailor their services to the demands, which are likely to change in the future.","[Kuzmina-Merlino, Irina] Transport & Telecommun Inst, Riga, Latvia; [Saksonova, Svetlana] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",Transport & Telecommunication Institute - Latvia; University of Latvia,"Kuzmina-Merlino, I (通讯作者)，Transport & Telecommun Inst, Riga, Latvia.",,"Saksonova, Svetlana/ABE-3576-2020","Saksonova, Svetlana/0000-0003-3635-9122",,,,,18,0,0,0,7,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-344-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,387,395,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP0MG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000535358500036,0

We measure local segregation by a simple inter-group isolation index, where Muslims' (non-Muslims') isolation is measured by the share of Muslim (non-Muslim) households in the local environment of each location. We find that relative to locations that did not witness changes in the instance of industrialization, the opening of Cairo railway station in 1856 differentially increased Muslims' isolation from non-Muslims (conversely, decreased non-Muslims' isolation) in its proximity and that the closures of textiles firms in 1848-1868 differentially decreased it. The results are arguably driven by an indirect labor market mechanism, whereby state industrialized firms crowded in private-sector unskilled jobs that attracted greater net inflows of rural immigrants and unskilled workers who were predominantly Muslims.

Consumer food ethnocentrism is kind of aversion that consumers feel towards all food products from export. There is strong correlation between economic development and consumer ethnocentrism with consequence of GDP increase, unemployment decrease and balancing of foreign trade deficit. Several factors have been identified that determine or are closely related to consumer ethnocentrism and can be divided into four categories: socio-psychological (cultural openness, patriotism, animosity, dogmatism), economic (consumers' income, economy development, price and income elasticity), political (political propaganda, political history etc.) and demographic (age, gender, education). The research results confirm that the level of consumer ethnocentrism differs from country to country, but also between country's regions and that level changes over time, as the factors that determine ethnocentrism changes. Consumer ethnocentrism can be one of the drivers of agriculture and food processing industry development in Croatia, but it is not enough, especially in conditions of low purchasing power and unemployment. In such circumstances, consumers pay more attention to the price than to the country of origin. Therefore, the price competitiveness of Croatian food products should be increased in relation to prices of foreign food products.","[Loncaric, Ruzica; Sudaric, Tihana; Deze, Jadranka] Univ JJ Strossmayer Osijek, Fac Agr, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Loncaric, R (通讯作者)，Univ JJ Strossmayer Osijek, Fac Agr, Osijek, Croatia.",rloncaric@pfos.hr; tsudaric@pfos.hr; jdeze@pfos.hr,,,,,,,47,0,0,0,15,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,618,635,,,,,,18,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300035,0

They also engaged in a series of major trade disputes, notably in the solar photovoltaic and wind sectors. The European Union (EU)-China solar dispute is one of the largest such cases. In 2013, the European Commission (EC) announced duties on imports of solar products from Chinese manufacturers. This decision was at odds with the fact that the majority of the European solar industry opposed tariffs. We propose that the decision was affected by a shift in negotiating power between business and the EC. We suggest that the rise of global supply chains undermined the structural power of industry by dividing manufacturers over trade policy and by fragmenting the information conveyed to policy-makers. This provided an opportunity to the Commission to engage in interest shopping' by selecting an industry position that matched its own interest. Evidence from a comparative case study on EU and German responses to solar imports supports our argument. The findings suggest that the globalisation of production can strengthen the negotiating power of policy-makers, and implies that policy-makers face new trade-offs at the intersection of manufacturing and climate policy.","[Meckling, Jonas] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hughes, Llewelyn] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Australian National University,"Hughes, L (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",llewelyn.hughes@anu.edu.au,"Hughes, Llewelyn/E-5634-2015","Hughes, Llewelyn/0000-0002-8352-2693",Winkler Family Foundation; Social Science Research Council; Japan Foundation Center for Global Partnership,Winkler Family Foundation; Social Science Research Council; Japan Foundation Center for Global Partnership,"The authors would like to thank Winkler Family Foundation, Social Science Research Council, and Japan Foundation Center for Global Partnership for financial support.",,84,22,23,4,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

In many liberalized electricity markets, FTR are sold at auction by the local electricity system operator. This paper addresses several questions about the performance of FTR auctions in Ontario's restructured electricity market, including whether auction market clearing prices approximate realized payouts and whether there is any evidence that the competitiveness of auctions, as measured by the number of bidders, affects the forward market unbiasedness or informational efficiency of the auctions. The paper finds that the auction process is inefficient in the sense that market clearing prices are substantially and systematically lower than realized payouts, resulting in substantial transfers away from consumers.

Using Monte Carlo simulation and probability theory, we estimated the combined impacts of biophysical and economic factors on the economic productivity of irrigation water use by individual activities. The estimated residual values vary across regions and in response to water availability as we would expect and warrant consideration of these factors in making any future water policy and investment decisions in different regions. As anticipated perennial (fruits and nuts, grapes) and high capital annual activities (cotton) represent the highest value water uses. Water trading from low to high value activities results in economic losses that are much lower than the proportional decline in water availability during periods of drought.","[Qureshi, M.

It is necessary to activate internal opportunities of energy conversation. Low energy efficiency was a characteristic feature of the economy of the USSR, and from the moment of independence of Ukraine became the cause of the crisis. The technologically obsolete structure of the national economy and the high energy intensity of products limit its competitiveness in foreign and domestic markets. The crisis in the energy sector led to an increase in energy tariffs, social tensions in society increased. Now the population and all spheres of business depend on the state policy. Ukraine can activate the energy conversation potential and will become an attractive sales market of innovative energy-saving technologies and equipment. There are a number of factors that affect the development of energy efficiency: market, investment, information, technical and institutional. Each of them may have a positive or negative impact on the overall situation.

These technological solutions rely not only on the use of biotechnology but also on the use of biomass produced by farmers world-wide. The origins of this biomass might become increasingly specialised, for instance through the use of energy crops, or existing edible crops might find to have multiple uses for varied industries. Farmers, then, become an important provider of a resource that might be needed by many, and that is not food or feed. What arable land is used for and how it is used is a question of moral significance (Kline et al, 2017). The role of farmers in the bio-economy is of moral significance. What are the roles and responsibilities of farmers in the context of this transition? What is a farmer's ethics in the bioeconomy? Most studies on farmers seem to focus on behavior and policy incentives impact on behavior. Recently, Meijboom and Stafleu (2016) suggested that entrusting farmers with professional moral autonomy increases the chance of them formulating innovative answers to ethical issues. This ties in with three recent arguments in the ethics of technology. First, Asveld (2016) argues that experimenting and thereby learning (as in moral learning, learning about impacts and institutional learning) is necessary for the bioeconomy. Second, Robaey (2016a) argues that in order to be morally responsible for new technologies they use, farmers must have access to knowledge and develop their epistemic virtues (2016b). Last but not least, the suggestion that the bio-economy and its technologies might improve the life of farmers invites looking into Oosterlaken's (2015) arguments on the capabilities approach and its relation to new technologies. In this paper, we want to articulate the relation between farmer's values, virtues, and capabilities in order to first flesh out the implications of the professional moral autonomy argument and thereby to provide a framework for conceptualizing their changing roles and responsibilities in the context of the bio-economy.","[Robaey, Z.; Asveld, L.; Osseweijer, P.] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Biotechnol, Biotechnol & Soc, Van Maasweg 9, NL-2629 HZ Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology,"Robaey, Z (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, Dept Biotechnol, Biotechnol & Soc, Van Maasweg 9, NL-2629 HZ Delft, Netherlands.",z.h.robaey@tudelft.nl,"Robaey, Zoë/AAT-3455-2020",,MVI-NWO,MVI-NWO,This paper was written under the MVI-NWO funded project 'Inclusive bio-based innovation securing sustainability and supply through farmers'.,,12,1,1,2,7,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,49,54,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_5,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000005,0

The analysis of the 2,161 data sets from transactions between 2001 and 2017 is conducted by the ordinary least squares method. The findings show that the transaction volumes have a significant positive impact on the number of mandated banks, whereas the complexity of the transaction, represented by the number and type of facilities as well as the total allocation of arranger titles, has a significantly negative impact on the mandate allocation.

It also reveals that due to a series of internal power struggles and external shocks, the current regulatory system is undergoing significant restructuring. A new policy paradigm is emerging that is largely different from the previous decades of policy orientation that centred on capacity expansion and instrumental interests for renewable energy development. The new paradigm would face tremendous challenges from existing institutions and vested interests, and it requires new set of ideologies that can help renewable energy sector to truly competing with the energy incumbents in order to bring about meaningful low-carbon energy transition in China.","[Shen, Wei] Inst Dev Studies, Lib Rd, Brighton BN1 9RE, E Sussex, England; [Xie, Lei] Univ Exeter, Dept Polit, Penryn, Cornwall, England; [Xie, Lei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, 11A,Datun Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","University of Exeter; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Shen, W (通讯作者)，Inst Dev Studies, Lib Rd, Brighton BN1 9RE, E Sussex, England.",w.shen@ids.ac.uk,"Xie, Lei/K-1404-2019","Xie, Lei/0000-0002-4535-7893","ESRC STEPS Centre (Social, Technological and Environmental Pathways to Sustainability) [ES/I021620/1]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I021620/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/I021620/1] Funding Source: UKRI","ESRC STEPS Centre (Social, Technological and Environmental Pathways to Sustainability)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","The authors would like to thank The ESRC STEPS Centre (Social, Technological and Environmental Pathways to Sustainability) [grant number ES/I021620/1] for their support to complete this study.",,61,37,39,3,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The analysis performed in the paper has allowed the author to outline the basic study programme accreditation standards applied in the context of quality assurance in higher education. The conducted analysis has also enabled the author to conclude that the implementation of European Standards and Guidelines (ESG) used as a basis for accreditation procedures in the EU countries contributes to enhancing quality provision in cross-border higher education within the European Higher Education Area. The author hopes that whatever lessons this analysis provides would be helpful to the emerging experts in the field of international accreditation, as well as policy decision-makers in the area of higher education.","[Stukalina, Yulia] Transport & Telecommun Inst, Riga, Latvia",Transport & Telecommunication Institute - Latvia,"Stukalina, Y (通讯作者)，Transport & Telecommun Inst, Riga, Latvia.",,"Stukalina, Yulia/AAU-2859-2020","Stukalina, Yulia/0000-0002-2660-4975",,,,,29,0,0,0,6,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-344-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,703,713,,,,,,11,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP0MG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000535358500065,0

However, policy choices, such as Germany's decision to open its borders for Syrian refugees in 2015, can also have a significant impact on the number of arrivals and constitute a puzzle that traditional approaches struggle to explain. This paper demonstrates that viewing refugee burden-sharing through the lens of public goods theory can provide significant insights about refugee protection dynamics in the EU, in particular in the context of a sudden mass influx of migrants that threatens internal security. By highlighting how free-riding and burden-shifting dynamics can undermine the provision of collective goods during a refugee crisis, a public goods approach can advance our understanding of why countries sometimes accept disproportionate responsibilities for forced migrants and how the effectiveness of EU refugee burden-sharing instruments can, and should, be strengthened.","[Thielemann, Eiko] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Thielemann, E (通讯作者)，LSE, London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, European Polit & Policy, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",e.thielemann@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,47,63,74,0,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

By analyzing the output of Russia's two main television channels during Putin's third presidential term, we identify a range of distinctly new features that amount to a new media strategy. This involves a significant increase in the coverage of political issues through the replacement of infotainment with what we term agitainmentan ideologically inflected content that, through adapting global media formats to local needs, attempts to appeal to less engaged and even sceptical viewers. Despite the tightening of political control over the media following the annexation of Crimea, the new strategy paradoxically has strengthened the constitutive role played by the state-controlled broadcasters in the articulation of official discourse.","[Tolz, Vera] Univ Manchester, Russian & East European Studies, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Teper, Yuri] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Polit Sci, Jerusalem, Israel",University of Manchester; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Tolz, V (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Russian & East European Studies, Manchester, Lancs, England.",VeraTolz@manchester.ac.uk,,,"UK's Arts and Humanities Research Council [AH/HO18964/1, AH/P00508X/1]; AHRC [AH/H018964/1, AH/P00508X/1] Funding Source: UKRI",UK's Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),"This article emanates from two research projects: Mediating Post - Soviet Difference: An Analysis of Russian Television Representations of Inter - Ethnic Cohesion Issues, which was funded by the UK's Arts and Humanities Research Council [project code AH/HO18964/1]; and Reframing Russia: From Cold War to Information War?, which is funded by the UK's Arts and Humanities Research Council [project code AH/P00508X/1].",,90,47,48,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

To attract vessels to use their national flags, the traditional maritime countries (TMCs) have adopted various incentive-based and rule-based marine policies. Among them, the establishment of second ship registers is one of the most effective, as shown by the success of EU countries. To understand the influence of the second ship register upon vessel registration and the mechanism of flag choice decisions, this study transforms binary and nested logit models with individual-level data into aggregate-level models. The empirical estimate suggests that the policy of establishing second ship registers significantly affects the number of vessels register back to their national countries, though this effect varies for different countries. The results of the nested logit model in analyzing the flag choice mechanism suggest that the second ship register is clustered to the nest of foreign ship registers. This suggests that the second register is more similar to open ship registers in function than to national registers, which indicates the convergence of maritime policies between the TMCs and open registers. This result has significant implications for China as it develops as an international maritime center. This study strongly recommends that China reorient its maritime policy by incorporating Hong Kong as its second ship register to provide a competitive operational environment for shipping companies and thereby foster a maritime cluster.","[Yin, Jingbo] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Naval Architecture Ocean & Civil Engn, State Key Lab Ocean Engn, 800 Dongchuan RD, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Fan, Lixian] Shanghai Univ, Sch Management, 599 Shangda Rd, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China; [Li, Kevin X.] Chung Ang Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Dept Int Logist, Seoul, South Korea",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai University; Chung Ang University,"Fan, LX (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ, Sch Management, 599 Shangda Rd, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China.",lixianfan@shu.edu.cn,"Fan, Lixian/T-3660-2019","Fan, Lixian/0000-0002-7417-9635",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673181]; National Social Science Fund of China [17BGL259]; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2014-220-2014027957],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Fund of China; National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),This research is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no.: 71673181); National Social Science Fund of China (Grant no.: 17BGL259) and National Research Foundation of Korea (Project No.: NRF-2014-220-2014027957).,,31,13,15,2,44,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Contemporary integration processes refer to the third wave of regionalism, and could be seen in the context of a trend towards increasing number of cross-regional agreements. A significant aspect of this trend is the complexity of RTA negotiations as modern agreements include more and more sophisticated commitments and provisions. They address issues related to rnultilateralization of regionalism in moving away from a spaghetti bowl of criss-crossing arrangements. This trend is especially growing in the Asia-Pacific region. The aim of this paper is to identify the trends in contemporary regionalism and to verify whether the changes in that process are reflected in creating TPP as a new model of a RTA. TPP anticipated liberalisation of trade and investment between 12 Asia-Pacific countries. In light of the US withdrawal, negotiations were continued between the remaining 11 members. On 23 January 2018, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) was concluded. It is assumed to become one of the most comprehensive regional agreements. The study should offer new insights into issues of contemporary regionalism enhancing our theoretical knowledge in this area. Many of the specific provisions of the CPTPP are likely to set the benchmarks for future trade agreements. From a practical perspective the CPTPP may change trading structures across the region, its implications can be important even for non-members.

Two types of smooth transition models-Exponential Smooth Transition Autoregressive and Asymmetric Exponential Smooth Transition Autoregressive-are employed to account for the nonlinear mean-reverting behaviour in unemployment due to heterogeneity in hiring and firing costs across firms. Four main results emerge: first, the hysteresis hypothesis is rejected for 60 % of the countries in our sample. Second, nonlinear models capture the asymmetries in unemployment dynamics over the business cycle for some countries. Third, many of the series display multiple structural breaks which might point out shifts in mean level of unemployment. Fourth, forecasting powers of our nonlinear models display poor performance against the linear AR specification. The results have policy implications for the debate on the benefits of demand or supply-side policies for tackling the current unemployment problem in Europe.","[Akdogan, Kurmas] Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Struct Econ Res Dept, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey",Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey,"Akdogan, K (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Struct Econ Res Dept, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey.",kurmas.akdogan@tcmb.gov.tr,,"Akdogan, Kurmas/0000-0002-1297-3737",,,,,75,19,19,3,19,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The framework links simulation models and valuation approaches from different economic research fields including economy-wide modelling, time series modelling, stated preference approaches, and net present value analysis. Applied to the analysis of an investment for enhancing cultural heritage tourism in the Colonial City of Santo Domingo, the integrated model generates valuable insights on the transmission pathways through which investment in cultural heritage tourism can accelerate economic growth, generate employment, and raise incomes.

We aim to improve our understanding of travel behaviour change based on a theoretical framework extending the Theory of Planned Behaviour (ToPB), namely the Requirements, Opportunities, Abilities (ROA) approach, and the concept of habits and key events. The paper focuses on (i) how former university students adjust their travel behaviour when their working life starts and (ii) what are the most important factors explaining these changes. With a three-wave online panel, we show that indeed many graduate workers start commuting by car and fewer travel by public transport. To explain mode change, we identified classical factors from the ToPB (subjective norm, perceived behavioural control, attitudes) as well as several requirements (more flexibility, dress code), opportunities (changed car availability, parking situation, connection to public transport) and abilities (financial, commuting distance) and, moreover, habits. As a result, we could show influences resulting from changed attitudes, changes in personal requirements as well as changes in mode options. Habit consequently decreases the probability of mode change. We draw some policy implications from the results highlighting the importance of the provision of rail-bound public transport and giving recommendations on travel demand management.","[Busch-Geertsema, Annika; Lanzendorf, Martin] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Human Geog, Theodor W Adorno Pl 6, D-60329 Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Busch-Geertsema, A (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Human Geog, Theodor W Adorno Pl 6, D-60329 Frankfurt, Germany.",busch-geertsema@geo.uni-frankfurt.de; lanzendorf@geo.uni-frankfurt.de,"Lanzendorf, Martin/N-4335-2015","Lanzendorf, Martin/0000-0003-3465-7695; Busch-Geertsema, Annika/0000-0003-4671-2057",Scholarship Programme of the German Federal Environmental Foundation (Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt),Scholarship Programme of the German Federal Environmental Foundation (Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt),This research was funded by the Scholarship Programme of the German Federal Environmental Foundation (Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt).

We show that reasonable interpretations of the egalitarian and the liberal ideal characterize what we refer to as the generalized proportionality principle. This principle states that an individual should have the share of total income that he or she would have had if everyone had the same opportunities and these opportunities were given by the average of the pre-tax income functions of all individuals in society. We argue that a redistribution mechanism based on this principle would eliminate unfair inequalities and preserve fair inequalities, and discuss when the generalized proportionality principle is equivalent to the simple proportionality principle.","[Cappelen, Alexander W.; Tungodden, Bertil] Norwegian Sch Econ, Bergen, Norway",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Tungodden, B (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Econ, Bergen, Norway.",alexander.cappelen@nhh.no; bertil.tungodden@nhh.no,"CAPPELEN, ALEXANDER/AAY-1676-2021",,Research Council of Norway [236995],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"We have received extremely useful comments and suggestions from Marc Fleurbaey, Juan D.

After micro-founding a new peripheral diversity index, it puts forth a simple theory in which the cost of public goods increases with peripheral ethnolinguistic diversity and tax compliance decreases with overall ethnolinguistic diversity. It then empirically explores the relation between public goods provision, transfers, peripheral diversity and overall diversity. Consistent with the theory, we find that higher levels of peripheral diversity are associated with less provision of public goods, but more transfers, whereas higher levels of overall diversity have a negative association with transfers. Public goods and transfers are therefore substitutes in their reaction to a change in peripheral diversity.","[Desmet, Klaus] Southern Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, Dallas, TX 75205 USA; [Desmet, Klaus] CEPR, London, England; [Ortuno-Ortin, Ignacio] Univ Carlos III, Dept Econ, Madrid, Spain; [Weber, Shlomo] SMU, Dept Econ, Dallas, TX USA; [Weber, Shlomo] New Econ Sch, Moscow, Russia",Southern Methodist University; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Southern Methodist University; New Economic School,"Desmet, K (通讯作者)，Southern Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, Dallas, TX 75205 USA.;Desmet, K (通讯作者)，CEPR, London, England.",kdesmet@smu.edu; iortuno@eco.uc3m.es; sweber@smu.edu,"Weber, Shlomo/AAQ-5651-2020; ORTUNO, IGNACIO ISIDRO/Y-5541-2018","ORTUNO, IGNACIO ISIDRO/0000-0001-6721-5901; Weber, Shlomo/0000-0002-7832-2769; DESMET, KLAUS/0000-0002-8206-845X",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO-2013-42710-P]; Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation [14.U04.31.0002],"Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation(Ministry of Education and Science, Russian Federation)","We thank two anonymous referees for thoughtful comments.

Determining the set of measures that are the most cost effective and efficient for a particular city has always been very challenging. In this study, the development of a performance measurement system (PMS) is used as a base for choosing the best programs for the city of Mashhad, Iran. Six programs are selected for analysis; four programs from major public transportation programs and two from major private transportation programs. The following steps are performed to conclude the proposed most efficient programs: (1) defining a wide range of performance measures (PM), (2) selecting a set of PMs based on the city's goals, (3) calculating the improvements of each program and (4) comparing the results with do nothing scenario. The analysis shows that modification of the current Taxi Khattee (equivalent to jitney) and introducing the bus rapid transit (BRT) system are the most efficient programs for Mashhad. The very expensive interchange or light rail transit (LRT) system are not as efficient as a modification of the current bus system.","[Gholami, Ali; Ziaee, Maysam] Mashhad Traff & Transportat Org, Mashhad, Iran",,"Gholami, A (通讯作者)，Mashhad Traff & Transportat Org, Mashhad, Iran.",a_gholami@gu.ac.ir; ziaee@rnashadtraffic.ir,"Gholami, Ali/I-7462-2019","Gholami, Ali/0000-0001-5888-6420",Mashhad Traffic and Transportation Organization (MTTO),Mashhad Traffic and Transportation Organization (MTTO),"Mashhad Traffic and Transportation Organization (MTTO) funded this project.

In a hypothetical economy, a firm produces consumption goods and issues a risk-free corporate bond and a risky stock in the financial market. Heterogeneous agents provide either capital or labor to the production, and they trade in the financial market by using fundamental or technical strategies. The fundamental value of the firm's stock is endogenously determined by the firm's production output. Agents' investment in the risk-free bond is reinvested into future production. Steady-state analysis shows possible economic equilibrium under a proper parameter setting. In numerical simulations, stock cycles recur, and each stock cycle consists of the following four phases: accumulation, boom, crash, and recovery. A close investigation of stock cycles shows that a prosperous stock market may accelerate the formation of bubbles by drawing resources from future production. Although chartists are less wealthy than fundamentalists, they are capable of having a significant effect on the stock market.","[Huang, Weihong] Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Econ, 14 Nanyang Dr, Singapore 637332, Singapore; [Zhang, Yu] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, 55 Guanghuacun St, Chengdu 610074, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Nanyang Technological University; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Zhang, Y (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, 55 Guanghuacun St, Chengdu 610074, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",AWHHuang@ntu.edu.sg; zhangyu@swufe.edu.cn,"Huang, Weihong/A-9676-2013","Zhang, Yu/0000-0002-0028-0175; Huang, Weihong/0000-0002-8626-2807",,,,,19,1,1,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Farmers' reactions to policy measures are assessed by means of mathematical programming models that maximize utility subject to agronomic, institutional and resource constraints. The main impacts emanating from the CAP reform are reduction for cotton and durum wheat as well as increase for set-aside and alfalfa cultivation areas. Similar crop mix is obtained by applying the scenario of CAP coupled with the fiscal-social insurance reform. Farm income is moderately sensitive in reform concerning reduction of subsidies but the combination with the Third Memorandum measures dramatically decreases their viability prospects.","[Mantziaris, Stamatis; Karanikolas, Pavlos] Agr Univ Athens, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Athens, Greece; [Rozakis, Stelios] IUNG PIB, Dept Bioecon & Syst Anal, Pulawy, Poland",Agricultural University of Athens; Institute of Soil Science & Plant Cultivation,"Mantziaris, S (通讯作者)，Agr Univ Athens, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Athens, Greece.",sta.athens@hotmail.com,"Karanikolas, Pavlos/AAO-5450-2021; Karanikolas, Pavlos/AAO-5139-2021; rozakis, stelios/JZC-8313-2024","Karanikolas, Pavlos/0000-0001-8272-3584; Mantziaris, Stamatis/0000-0001-7047-1447",,,,,32,0,0,1,6,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,DEC,2017,16.0,4,,,,,12,23,,,,,,12,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,FX4EX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426026600002,0

Empirical analysis based on a national-level household survey suggests that because of the low financial cost of informal borrowing, households tend to borrow as much as possible from informal channels until they reach the constraint determined by their social capital, which significantly crowds out formal borrowing such as mortgage loans from commercial banks. Additionally, the existence of informal borrowing significantly increases households' housing demand. Understanding these effects is especially important in regions with less mature financial systems.","[Fan, Ying; Wu, Jing; Yang, Zan] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Real Estate, Hang Lung Ctr Real Estate, Beijing, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University,"Wu, J (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Inst Real Estate, Hang Lung Ctr Real Estate, Beijing, Peoples R China.",ireswujing@tsinghua.edu.cn,"Wu, Jing/KBQ-4198-2024","Wu, Jing/0000-0003-0272-0784; FAN, Ying/0000-0003-0189-9524","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673154, 71073090, 71461137002, 71373006, 91546113]; Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program [20151080431]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program,"We are grateful for the comments of the editor and two anonymous referees.

We focus on natural gas fuel as a low-carbon alternative to oil-based diesel fuel in the heavy-duty sector primarily because of the recent cost benefits relative to diesel fuel and the high vehicle turnover rate in heavy-duty trucks.

Challenges and pressures facing businesses are examined through merchant surveys and interviews. Observations reinforce the notion that cultural competency and strong grassroots leadership is vital for economic development planning so that capitalizing on an ethnic heritage does not become a tool for commodification or commercial gentrification.

We develop forecast combination schemes that assign weights to individual predictive densities based on the censored likelihood scoring rule and the continuous ranked probability scoring rule (CRPS) and compare these to weighting schemes based on the log score and the equally weighted scheme. We apply this approach in the context of measuring downside risk in equity markets using recently developed volatility models, including HEAVY, realized GARCH and GAS models, applied to daily returns on the S&P 500, DJIA, FTSE and Nikkei indexes from 2000 until 2013. The results show that combined density forecasts based on optimizing the censored likelihood scoring rule significantly outperform pooling based on equal weights, optimizing the CRPS or log scoring rule. In addition, 99% Value-at-Risk estimates improve when weights are based on the censored likelihood scoring rule.","[Opschoor, Anne] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Opschoor, Anne; van Dijk, Dick; van der Wel, Michel] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van Dijk, Dick; van der Wel, Michel] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [van Dijk, Dick; van der Wel, Michel] ERIM, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [van der Wel, Michel] Aarhus Univ, CREATES, Aarhus, Denmark",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Aarhus University; CREATES,"Opschoor, A (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",a.opschoor@vu.nl,"van der Wel, Michel/C-8676-2012; van Dijk, Dick/C-3542-2012","van der Wel, Michel/0000-0001-5133-7680; van Dijk, Dick/0000-0002-1880-204X; Opschoor, A./0000-0002-2908-2260",Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO); CREATES; Danish National Research Foundation,Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); CREATES; Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond),"An earlier version of this paper was titled Improving density forecasts and Value-at-Risk estimates by combining densities.

Our data set provides information on exports and imports of services (excluding transportation and travel) in 2008-09 for almost 3,000 Italian industrial and services firms, divided by partner country and type of service. We report a set of stylised facts on services trade and analyse the choice between export and foreign direct investment in services at the firm level. We find that the export and import of services are highly concentrated in just a few firms. Firm-level variation in trade is positively correlated with firm size and productivity. Country-level variation is to a large extent explained by the standard gravity variables: distance strongly reduces trade in services in spite of their intangibility. Smaller and less productive firms choose to export rather than sell through foreign affiliates, although there is some heterogeneity among service types.","[Federico, Stefano; Tosti, Enrico] Bank Italy, Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Federico, S (通讯作者)，Bank Italy, Rome, Italy.",,,,,,,,41,12,12,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,OCT,2017,40.0,10,,,,,2078,2096,,10.1111/twec.12462,0.0,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FK2XT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413347400003,0

NCREIF provides appraisal-based and transaction-based return series allowing comparison of market participants with specific valuation expertise to general market participants. Results using the appraisal-based indices indicate that the mispricing term is not statistically significantly related to expected inflation, which suggests that commercial valuers do not suffer from inflation illusion. Interestingly, results based on the investor oriented transaction-based indices show that the mispricing term is inversely related to expected inflation and that mispricing plays an important role in determining the long-term discount rate. These results are robust across different empirical specifications, inflation data and subsamples by property type. The comprehensive findings suggest that the inflation illusion effect in direct investment in real estate differs from securitized markets. This study further adds to the general literature regarding the impact of inflation illusion on asset markets by showing that experienced participants may not suffer from inflation illusion which suggests that 1) novice participants may be driving its appearance and 2) experience and training mitigate this bias.","[Hardin, William G., III; Wu, Zhonghua] Florida Int Univ, Coll Business, 1101 Brickell Ave,S 1000, Miami, FL 33131 USA; [Jiang, Xiaoquan] Florida Int Univ, Coll Business, 11200 SW 8th St,RB 208b, Miami, FL 33199 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida International University; State University System of Florida; Florida International University,"Wu, ZH (通讯作者)，Florida Int Univ, Coll Business, 1101 Brickell Ave,S 1000, Miami, FL 33131 USA.",hardinw@fiu.edu; jiangx@fiu.edu; wuz@fiu.edu,,"Jiang, Xiaoquan/0000-0002-1393-1627",,,,,35,5,6,3,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Segregation thus plays a substantially more important role in accounting for the gender wage gap in the public sector than in the private sector. While the importance of segregation for wage formation decreased substantially in the public sector over time, it only decreased slightly in the private sector. Although the remaining gender wage gap, after controlling for segregation, is close to zero in the public sector, a substantial within-job cell differential remains after controlling for segregation in the private sector.","[Albaek, Karsten; Larsen, Mona; Thomsen, Lars Stage] SFI, Herluf Trolles Gade 11, DK-1053 Copenhagen K, Denmark",,"Albæk, K (通讯作者)，SFI, Herluf Trolles Gade 11, DK-1053 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",kal@sfi.dk,,,"Danish Council for Independent Research, Social Sciences","Danish Council for Independent Research, Social Sciences(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF))","For comments on previous versions of the paper, we thank the editor, two referees, Colin Green, the participants in the workshop in honour of Professor Peder Pedersen, Arhus University, April 2012, the meeting of the European Society for Population Economics in Bern, June 2012, the Nordic Econometric Meeting in Bergen, June 2013, the 3rd Linked Employer-Employee Data Workshop in Lisbon, June 2013, and the European Meeting of the Econometric Society in Gothenburg, August 2013.

This informs both the literature on trade costs and the microeconomic literature on firms' export behaviour. We identify the nationality of each worker in a large sample of German establishments and relate this to the exporting behaviour of these establishments. We allow for the possible endogeneity of an establishment's workforce by instrumenting the share of foreign workers with the regional distribution of foreign workers in the wider labour market. We find a significant effect of worker nationality on exporting which is not driven by the industrial, occupational or locational concentration of migrants. The effect is much stronger for senior occupations, who are more likely to have a role in exporting decisions by the establishment. The relationship is also stronger when we consider exports to particular regions and workers from these regions, consistent with a gravity model in which trade flows from country i to j are a function of migrants from j in i.","[Andrews, Martyn] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Schank, Thorsten] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Mainz, Germany; [Upward, Richard] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham, England; [Upward, Richard] GEP, Nottingham, England",University of Manchester; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; University of Nottingham; University of Nottingham,"Andrews, M (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England.",,,"Schank, Thorsten/0000-0002-1926-1070; Upward, Richard/0000-0003-1504-7728",ESRC [ES/L015684/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L015684/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,25,8,10,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,SEP,2017,40.0,9,,,,,1750,1774,,10.1111/twec.12486,0.0,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FG5AD,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000410299900003,0

We suggest this requires a closer reading of the institutional changes necessary to bring about centralization/formalization, and ask particularly whether change might be partially attributable to the very institutional-agents operating inside Europe's networked modes of governance. Supplementing functional-political explanations, we propose an endogenous model of institutional change that incorporates the independent role transnational networks play in shaping their own institutionalization, which may make this mode of governance more resilient and even self-reinforcing.

The framework draws on both individual level (i.e., pertaining to the individual elements of groups) and aggregate level (i.e., pertaining to the group as a whole) data under a single specification. To take into account the selection process for employment, our multilevel model uses the Heckman two-step procedure. Occupational Groups (OG) are found to capture around 40 % of the wage heterogeneity, whereas Employment Area (EA) nests capture less than 10 %. Higher wages are offered to young workers in (1) OG dominated by seniors and (2) OG dominated by men. These group characteristics also influence gender inequalities: there is a higher wage penalty for women in (1) OG dominated by men and (2) OG dominated by senior workers. In contrast to gender inequality, immigrant inequalities manifest closer links to EA.","[Bunel, Mathieu] Bourgogne Univ, LEDi UMR CNRS 6307, Pole Econ & Gest, F-21066 Dijon, France; [Guironnet, Jean-Pascal] Normandy Univ Caen, CREM UMR CNRS 6211, Batiment A,Campus 1, F-14000 Caen, France",Universite de Bourgogne,"Guironnet, JP (通讯作者)，Normandy Univ Caen, CREM UMR CNRS 6211, Batiment A,Campus 1, F-14000 Caen, France.",jean-pascal.guironnet@unicaen.fr,"Bunel, mathieu/CAJ-5446-2022","bunel, mathieu/0000-0002-0038-4759",,,,,57,4,5,1,8,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Using data on inventories and prices of oil futures, I show that convenience yields decrease at a diminishing rate as inventories increase, consistent with the theory of storage. In addition to exhibiting seasonal and procyclical behaviors, I show that the historical convenience yield averages about 18 percent of the oil price from March 1989 to November 2014. Although some have argued that a breakdown of the relationship between crude oil inventories and prices following increased financial investors' participation after 2004 was evidence of a speculative effect, I find that the proposed price-inventory relationship is stable over time. The empirical evidence indicates that crude oil prices remained tied to oil-market fundamentals such as inventories, suggesting that the contribution of financial investors' activities was weak.","[Byun, Sung Je] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Financial Ind Studies Dept, 2200 N Pearl St, Dallas, TX 75201 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Dallas,"Byun, SJ (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Financial Ind Studies Dept, 2200 N Pearl St, Dallas, TX 75201 USA.",SungJe.Byun@dal.frb.org,"Byun, SungJe/Q-6515-2019",,,,,,55,8,8,1,18,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,SEP,2017,38.0,5,,,,,93,114,,10.5547/01956574.38.5.sbyu,0.0,,,22,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FE2PY,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000408059400005,0

The results show that land prices were more volatile than house prices everywhere, but especially so in the areas where land was inexpensive in 2000. We demonstrate that the change in the land share of house value during the boom was a significant predictor of the decline in house prices during the bust, highlighting the value of focusing on land in assessing house-price risk.","[Davis, Morris A.] Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ USA; [Oliner, Stephen D.; Pinto, Edward J.] Amer Enterprise Inst Publ Policy Res, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Oliner, Stephen D.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Bokka, Sankar] FNC Inc, Oxford, MS USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Oliner, SD (通讯作者)，Amer Enterprise Inst Publ Policy Res, Washington, DC 20036 USA.;Oliner, SD (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",stephen.oliner@aei.org,,,"UCLA Rosalinde and Arthur Gilbert Program in Real Estate, Finance and Urban Economics","UCLA Rosalinde and Arthur Gilbert Program in Real Estate, Finance and Urban Economics","The views expressed are ours alone and do not represent those of the institutions with which we are affiliated.

The directive is part of a defence package' - along with a directive on defence procurement (2009/81/EC) - that is geared to liberalizing and regulating the European Defence Equipment Market (EDEM). A major theoretical question is why the EU Member States would agree to the ICT directive when it did not ultimately make much difference to the functioning of the EDEM. A number of competing theories exist that help explain why the 2009 defence package' was adopted. In the hope of engaging with this theoretical debate, and expanding our empirical understanding of the ICT directive, this article contends that insights from judicial politics, economic patriotism and liberal intergovernmentalism are best placed to explain why the EU Member States eventually adopted the directive.","[Fiott, Daniel] Vrije Univ Brussel, Brussels, Belgium",Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Fiott, D (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Brussel, Inst European Studies, 5 Pleinlaan, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",daniel.fiott@vub.be,"Fiott, Daniel/ABB-2733-2020","Fiott, Daniel/0000-0002-2378-3568",,,,,40,8,8,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Assigning an appropriate weight to each defined port performance indicator (PPI) is essential for rational decision and precise performance measurement. However, PPIs are often presented in a hierarchy, having the interdependency among them ignored. It causes concerns on the accuracy of PPIs' weight allocation and arguments on the performance measurement results, revealing a significant research gap to be addressed. As far as MCDM modelling is concerned, the importance of criteria has been studied utilising either absolute or, relative comparisons, while the calculation of their importance also takes into account both independency and interdependency factors. However, there is lack of empirical studies in the literature to provide supporting evidence to distinguish the different impacts of the two factors. This study aims to compare the analysis of PPIs importance when taking into account their independent relationship using an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and their interdependent relationship using a decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) incorporating an analytic network process (ANP), respectively. The same domain experts are invited to evaluate the importance of the defined PPIs based on both approaches. The results demonstrate that a similar variance of relative importance across the PPIs but a clear difference on their importance scores and ranking. As a result, the results make contributions to fulfil the research gap on consideration of interdependency among PPIs in PPM and on the provision of convincing empirical evidence to highlight the impact of interdependency of criteria on MCDM modelling. Another practical significance draw from this study is that use of DEMATEL can aid port stakeholders to make more rational decision as to whether the interdependency among PPIs should be taken into account in PPM and/or port choice.

Extant research on barriers to joint venture formation clearly indicates an important role for collaboration risk, but a systematic examination of the factors shaping local officials' perceptions of this risk is lacking. The authors propose that their perceptions of the region's norms regarding interlocal collaboration, the structure of the communication networks they have created with other local officials, and differences in the racial composition of their own cities are important factors shaping their perceptions of collaboration risk. The findings provide researchers with a basis for understanding the dimensions of collaboration risk in joint ventures and highlight the importance of the regional climate of cooperation among municipal leaders in shaping these perceptions. The two measures capturing the environment for collaboration in the region had the strongest link to the respondents' perception of collaboration risk on joint ventures for economic development.","[Carr, Jered B.] Univ Illinois, Dept Publ Adm, 412 South Peoria St,132 CUPPA Hall, Chicago, IL 60601 USA; [Hawkins, Christopher V.] Univ Cent Florida, Sch Publ Adm, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Westberg, Drew E.] Coe Coll, Econ, Cedar Rapids, IA 52402 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida,"Carr, JB (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Publ Adm, 412 South Peoria St,132 CUPPA Hall, Chicago, IL 60601 USA.",jbcarr@uic.edu,,,,,,,58,30,34,1,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Semi-structured interviews with 36 solo-living managers and professionals were carried out in the UK, spanning a range of occupations. In addition to previously identified work-life issues, four themes emerged that were pressing for and specific to solo-living managers and professionals.

Child weight status is measured by a full distribution of child weight, from severely thin to obese, using data from a z score for body mass index and cognition is measured by the Spanish version of the Picture Peabody Vocabulary Test (PPVT). This relationship is studied at age five and age eight (school age), and disaggregated across socioeconomic factors of gender, urban rural setting and indigenous/nonindigenous status. The initial results suggests that obese children have higher cognitive scores and that this result is driven by those who are female, non-indigenous and live in an urban region. However, after correcting for possible bias due to unobservable heterogeneity, there is little evidence of this relationship. The one exception is for a weakly significant relationship between obese female children and higher cognition, a relationship which tends to weaken between the ages of five and eight. On the other end of the weight distribution, indigenous children who are severely thin or thin have significantly lower cognitive scores, a relationship that holds after correcting for possible bias and appears to strengthen between ages of five and eight. This paper contributes to a very small set of literature on child cognition and obesity, points to the importance of controlling for unobserved heterogeneity in estimation, and is the first of its kind to study this relationship in a developing country.

We test the dynamics in the South East Asian and North Western European markets. The paper is motivated due to the importance of the propylene and PP market in various downstream industries and importantly to aid producers in having a better understanding of how input costs and demand drive the prices. We employ a vector error correction framework, which facilitates testing different dynamics among the upstream and downstream prices. We find PP prices in both regions to be endogenous, albeit with some evolution over time, i.e., input costs and downstream demand factors tend to drive PP prices. In both regional markets shocks to naphtha and oil prices tend to be driven mostly by each other's price with little effect originating from PP and propylene prices.","[De Mello, Lurion M.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Appl Finance & Actuarial Studies, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Ripple, Ronald D.] Univ Tulsa, Collins Coll Business Energy Econ Policy & Commer, Energy Business & Finance, Tulsa, OK 74104 USA",Macquarie University; University of Tulsa,"De Mello, LM (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Dept Appl Finance & Actuarial Studies, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",lurion.demello@mq.edu.au; ron-ripple@utulsa.edu,"De Mello, Lurion M/F-7715-2011; De Mello, Lurion/ABD-5756-2021","De Mello, Lurion/0000-0002-2625-7969",,,,,29,2,2,0,14,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,JUL,2017,38.0,4,,,,,129,144,,10.5547/01956574.38.4.ldem,0.0,,,16,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EZ6FJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404813500006,0

Our analysis found that FTAs had a positive overall impact on transport services for multiple countries (i.e., 26 home and 56 partner countries). The resulting positive overall impact assures that, even with the challenges associated with different layers of services and the obstacles formed by generally low trade openness in the sector, the provisions in FTAs (e.g., national treatment and market access for goods and services) promote transport service trades. Our findings suggest that the provisions in FTAs encourage economic agents to increase engagement in transport services because of expanded openness of the physical movement of goods across international borders.","[Lee, Jaimin] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Daegu, South Korea; [Cho, Seong-Hoon] Univ Tennessee, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Knoxville, TN USA",Kyungpook National University; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; UT Institute of Agriculture,"Lee, J (通讯作者)，Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Daegu, South Korea.",,,,National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A3A2044238],National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government,"We are grateful to an anonymous referee and an editor, David Greenaway for helpful comments.

After reconstruction, and at a time of immense growth in the city, developers shifted land out of residential uses and into nonresidential uses in burned areas relative to unburned areas. They facilitated this transition by rebuilding far fewer single-family dwellings compared to other types of housing, which suggests that houses inhibited the conversion of land to nonresidential uses before the fire. Aside from these broad effects, the fire also released new economic potential in areas that had shown little indication of shifting into nonresidential land uses before 1906, thereby creating new clusters of business activity. These impacts of the fire are still evident today-in roughly the same magnitudes and places-which suggests that the economic benefits realized upon reconstruction continue to drive the city's land-use patterns.","[Siodla, James] Colby Coll, Dept Econ, 5245 Mayflower Hill, Waterville, ME 04901 USA",Colby College,"Siodla, J (通讯作者)，Colby Coll, Dept Econ, 5245 Mayflower Hill, Waterville, ME 04901 USA.",jrsiodla@colby.edu,,"Siodla, James/0000-0002-5270-4697",All-UC Group in Economic History; Department of Economics at UC Irvine; Institute for Humane Studies,All-UC Group in Economic History; Department of Economics at UC Irvine; Institute for Humane Studies,"I am grateful to Dan Bogart and Jan Brueckner for their guidance.

However, due to a different incentive framework, viticulture can be considered an exception in the light of this general evidence. Applying a spatial Durbin Bayesian probit model to census data for the area of production of Chianti Classico DOCG (Italy), no spatial relation in the farmer's decision to convert to or maintain organic viticulture emerged and spatial spillovers have a marginal role in terms of affecting viticulturists' behaviour. An explanation for this evidence is the existence of quasi-monopsonic power in output markets with strict production standards, which limits spatial agglomeration effects. Structural factors such as small-size farm, farmer education and younger age are the main direct determinants for predicting the likelihood of being involved in organic viticulture.","[Boncinelli, Fabio; Riccioli, Francesco; Casini, Leonardo] Univ Florence, Dept Agr Food & Forestry Syst, Florence, Italy",University of Florence,"Boncinelli, F (通讯作者)，Univ Florence, Dept Agr Food & Forestry Syst, Florence, Italy.",fabio.boncinelli@unifi.it,"Boncinelli, Fabio/A-1588-2017; Riccioli, Francesco/A-3764-2016","Boncinelli, Fabio/0000-0003-2049-6720; Riccioli, Francesco/0000-0002-0745-7893",,,,,47,7,7,0,10,Bologna Univ Press,Bologna,"Via Saragozza 10, Bologna, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,JUN,2017,16.0,2,,,,,55,63,,,,,,9,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,FA2GI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405258400007,0

The lack of transparency in Chinese development projects, coupled with an uninterested stance towards governance, lead many to wonder if Chinese engagement will contribute to or undermine existing development efforts. This paper adds to the debate by inquiring as to the relationship of Chinese development efforts with perceptions of, and experiences with, corruption when projects are closely-located to those from a traditional donor, the World Bank. Taking advantage of spatial data, the paper evidences an association between the location of a larger number of Chinese projects and higher experiences with and, to some extent, perceptions of corruption when accounting for co-located World Bank projects. Likewise, while World Bank projects are associated with lower levels of corruption in the absence of Chinese projects, this relationship disappears when Chinese projects are nearby. However, these relationships only hold for Chinese projects which are not aid-like, suggesting that the differentiation of Chinese overseas flows is an important consideration when studying China as a development partner.","[Brazys, Samuel; Elkink, Johan A.] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Dublin, Ireland; [Kelly, Gina] Univ Coll Dublin, Dev Practice Programme, Dublin, Ireland; [Kelly, Gina] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",University College Dublin; University College Dublin; Trinity College Dublin,"Brazys, S (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Dublin, Ireland.",samuel.brazys@ucd.ie; jos.elkink@ucd.ie; gikelly@tcd.ie,"Elkink, Johan/AAC-7354-2019; Elkink, Johan/AAQ-1171-2021","Elkink, Johan/0000-0002-8275-533X; Brazys, Samuel/0000-0002-4482-4234",,,,,83,77,84,2,42,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

This paper examines the trends in a bike-sharing scheme that has been in operation in Cork since 2014. While many studies exist on how bike-sharing schemes are changing mobility in cities across the globe, few studies have looked at the dynamics of these schemes in smaller cities. One of the motivations in looking at a small city like Cork is to determine if smaller cites derive benefits from bike sharing schemes and can bike-sharing schemes provide a prominent role in these cities. This research found that in a small, compact city like Cork, average trip times recorded are short with regular uses displaying habitual trip patterns. This includes using the same bike stations and following similar routes on a daily or weekly basis. The findings also suggest weather has an impact upon usage, with longer trips more likely during better weather conditions. The findings of the paper provide insights to the dynamics of usage of a smaller bike-sharing scheme and results on how bike-sharing is offering citizens a new transport alternative.

This study uses a discrete-choice experiment to investigate the general public's interpretation of need in the context of health care resource allocation, focusing on three commonly cited definitions of need: need as a person's baseline health status; need as a person's ability-to-benefit; and need as the amount of resources required to exhaust a person's ability-to-benefit. Analysis of participants' need judgments using a latent-class, rank-ordered conditional logit model reveals that most individuals draw on all three definitions when assessing need, and that here is heterogeneity in interpretations of need among the public. Baseline health status is the most influential and consistent determinant of need, while ability-to-benefit and resources-required-to-exhaust-benefit are considered jointly. However, while some assign greater need to those who are worse off in the sense that they have little ability-to-benefit and require large amounts of resources to achieve that benefit, others assign greater need to those who have greater ability-to-benefit and whose benefit can be achieved with small amounts of resources. The public's reasoning about need contrasts sharply in a number of ways with the types of arguments offered in the literature on needs-based resource allocation.","[Hurley, Jeremiah; Grignon, Michel] McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, KTH 132, 1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada; [Hurley, Jeremiah; Giacomini, Mita; DeJean, Deirdre; Grignon, Michel] McMaster Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ & Policy Anal, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Mentzakis, Emmanouil] Univ Southampton, Dept Econ, Southampton, Hants, England; [Giacomini, Mita; DeJean, Deirdre] McMaster Univ, Dept Hlth Res Methods Evidence & Impact, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Grignon, Michel] McMaster Univ, Dept Hlth Aging & Soc, Hamilton, ON, Canada",McMaster University; McMaster University; University of Southampton; McMaster University; McMaster University,"Hurley, J (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, KTH 132, 1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada.;Hurley, J (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ & Policy Anal, Hamilton, ON, Canada.",hurley@mcmaster.ca,,"Mentzakis, Emmanouil/0000-0003-1761-209X",Canadian Institutes of Health Research [76670]; Government of Ontario through the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care Health System Research Fund [2045],Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Government of Ontario through the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care Health System Research Fund,"This research was funded by grant #76670 from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and by grant #2045 from the Government of Ontario through the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care Health System Research Fund.

This literature is advanced by testing whether wanting to move into homeownership before the actual entry into homeownership affects individuals' labour supply in couples. The empirical analysis is based on longitudinal data from the British Household Panel Survey (1991-2008). Fixed-effects panel regression models are used to predict the labour supply of women and men separately. Labour supply changes associated with homeownership are found to mainly occur when individuals want to move into homeownership and prior to the actual entry into homeownership. When wanting to move into homeownership, women and men increase their labour supply, where women are more likely to take up work and men to increase work hours. For women, the association between wanting to move into homeownership and labour supply is moderated by regional house price changes.","[Lersch, Philipp M.] Univ Cologne, Inst Sociol & Social Psychol, Greinstr 2, D-50939 Cologne, Germany; [Uunk, Wilfred] Tilburg Univ, Dept Sociol, Tilburg, Netherlands",University of Cologne; Tilburg University,"Lersch, PM (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Inst Sociol & Social Psychol, Greinstr 2, D-50939 Cologne, Germany.",p.m.lersch@uni-koeln.de,"Uunk, Wilfred/AAP-5232-2021","Uunk, Wilfred/0000-0002-8049-7322",European Research Council [283615]; European Research Council (ERC) [283615] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),This research is partly funded by the European Research Council (Grant Agreement No. 283615).,,32,3,3,0,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The development of an innovative in-vehicle human machine interface (HMI) has the potential to contribute to reducing traffic pollution and road trauma. Aim: A qualitative study, using a driver-centred design approach, was carried out to test how best to provide ecological and safe (eco-safe) driving advice and feedback to drivers on their driving style via an in-vehicle HMI. Method: A total of 34 drivers (52.9% males), aged 19-61 years, participated in focus groups which explored concepts from the Technology Acceptance Model (Davis, 1989). Findings: Main themes emerging from the focus groups were: (i) perceived importance of eco-safe driving behaviour; (ii) perceived usefulness of eco-safe in-vehicle HMIs; (iii) intentions to use an eco-safe in-vehicle HMI; (iv) perceptions toward eco-safe in-vehicle HMI design characteristics; and (v) potential problems associated with using eco-safe in vehicle HMIs. Implications: This study provides the foundation to inform the design and development of an evidence-based in-vehicle eco-safe HMI with high levels of driver acceptance.

Longitudinal evidence on dietary diversity and food consumption disparities among children and adolescents,ECONOMICS & HUMAN BIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Gender; Dietary diversity; India; Intra-household dynamics; Adolescents,INTRAHOUSEHOLD ALLOCATION; NUTRITIONAL-STATUS; HEALTH SURVEYS; GENDER BIAS; COUNTRIES; UNDERNUTRITION; INDICATORS; EDUCATION; ADEQUACY; DECLINE,"This paper examines the dynamics of gender-based disparities in the intra-household allocation of food during childhood and adolescence in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana by using three rounds of longitudinal data from two cohorts. While boys are advantaged at all ages (except for the Younger Cohort at 12 years old), the pro-boy gap widens markedly at 15 years old. Specifically, mid-adolescent girls tend to consume fewer protein- and vitamin-rich foods such as eggs, legumes, root vegetables and fruit. This result is robust to gender differences between adolescents in terms of puberty onset, school enrolment, time use and dietary behaviours. Finally, gender disparities in dietary diversity during early and mid adolescence do not vary by maternal education, poverty or place of residence, whilst they are moderated by levels of caregiver's educational aspirations at 15 years old.

Some of the programs highlight the importance of small firms, others emphasize the importance of young firms, and others highlight the importance of older, more established firms. The fact that each of these programs can find something in the literature that supports its particular focus suggests problems in the connection between the literature and policy formation. The authors find that the empirical support for such programs is weak. The statistical significance of firm characteristics depends critically on the model specification and/or data set used. Moreover, these characteristics explain only a small fraction of the variation in job growth, leaving policy makers with relatively weak policy tools.","[Hodges, Hart; Henson, Steven E.] Western Washington Univ, Econ, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA; [Hodges, Hart] Western Washington Univ, Ctr Econ & Business Res, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA",Western Washington University; Western Washington University,"Hodges, H (通讯作者)，Western Washington Univ, Dept Econ, 516 High St, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA.",hart.hodges@wwu.edu,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Our analysis of changes in institutional portfolio holdings indicates strong evidence of this behavior. We analyze the autocorrelation in aggregate institutional demand, and find that most of it is driven by institutional investors following the trades of others. This herding occurs at the property-type level, and not at the individual firm level. Although momentum trading explains a small amount of this herding, institutional property-type demand is more strongly associated with lagged demand than lagged returns. The results suggest that correlated information signals drive herding in REITs. In addition, we examine the extent to which herding in REIT property types affects price performance in the private real estate market. We find that information transmission resulting from institutional herding in REITs occurs faster in public real estate markets than in private markets.","[Lantushenko, Viktoriya] St Josephs Univ, Haub Sch Business, Dept Finance, Philadelphia, PA 19131 USA; [Nelling, Edward] Drexel Univ, Dept Finance, LeBow Coll Business, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Saint Joseph's University; Drexel University,"Lantushenko, V (通讯作者)，St Josephs Univ, Haub Sch Business, Dept Finance, Philadelphia, PA 19131 USA.",vol23@drexel.edu; nelling@drexel.edu,,,,,,,26,3,3,1,38,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

In the past, tools have been available only to those working in firms and industry or those willing to pay for their procurement. The maker movement increases access to tools and training, potentially altering the capability of the general public to participate in product development. This study explores makerspaces and how they contribute to economic development through business generation and sustainment. Based on interviews with members and the management of makerspaces, along with local government officials in Georgia, the author finds four principal contributions to economic development: (a) creating a cultural change by encouraging entrepreneurship in the community, (b) supporting small business growth through the provision of services, (c) providing workforce training, and (d) increasing workforce retention. However, in part because of their recent development and small memberships, makerspaces are unlikely to launch many entrepreneurs into their communities anytime soon. As such, governments should avoid making excessive commitments to makerspaces before they provide greater evidence of tangible contributions, but allowing them an expanded role in formal education can enhance their ability to incubate a maker mind-set.","[van Holm, Eric Joseph] Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [van Holm, Eric Joseph] Georgia State Univ, Publ Policy, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"van Holm, EJ (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, 14 Marietta St, Atlanta, GA 30312 USA.",ericvanholm@gatech.edu,"van Holm, Eric/X-2761-2019","van Holm, Eric/0000-0002-5741-6969","Georgia Innovation Economic Development Program - Georgia Institute of Technology program in science, technology, and innovation policy","Georgia Innovation Economic Development Program - Georgia Institute of Technology program in science, technology, and innovation policy","The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Funding from the Georgia Innovation Economic Development Program sponsored by the Georgia Institute of Technology program in science, technology, and innovation policy contribbuted to this research.",,27,47,62,1,110,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Despite their potential, EV market share remains low, necessitating research to identify factors that could encourage more widespread adoption. For instance, concern about climate change is associated with intent to adopt an EV, but little is known about mechanisms through which this concern may translate into action. This study builds on previous work investigating the roles of symbolic and instrumental attributes in low emission vehicle adoption, focusing exclusively on EVs to better understand perceptions associated with their unique technical capabilities. Prior work has examined symbolism rather generally (e.g., in terms of status). We examine specific aspects of self-identity that EVs may reflect, representing the extent to which consumers perceive EVs as symbols that they are environmentalists and/or social innovators. In addition, extending prior work, we quantify the relative influence of these separate aspects of symbolism on EV adoption intentions alongside instrumental, psychological, and demographic factors. We find differing impacts of these two symbols on EV adoption intentions. Environmentalist symbolism is consistently the strongest predictor of adoption, across three dependent variables. Innovator symbolism predicts willingness to lease/buy an EV, trailing only environmentalist symbolism in effect size, and outperforming instrumental attributes as well as psychological and demographic factors. Additionally, we examine a potential mechanism through which concern about climate change may translate into EV adoption intentions: we find that seeing EVs as environmentalist and social innovator symbols partially mediates the relationship between concern about climate change and EV adoption intentions. These results have implications for EV marketing and policy, and suggest that emphasizing the potential for EVs to reinforce specific self-identities may be a more promising strategy to increase adoption rates than emphasizing instrumental attributes such as fuel efficiency.

A common view is that most temporary migrants planned, upon entry, to eventually return home, yet there is little direct evidence to support this claim. I collect the first dataset on migrants' intentions to stay or return home from Ellis Island arrival records between 1917 and 1924. I find that fewer migrants planned to return home than actually did; many migrants, especially from Eastern and Southern Europe, left the United States unexpectedly. The high rate of unplanned returns implies that the first few years after arrival were more difficult than expected. However, this high rate of unexpected returns lowered after the 1920s migration quotas, suggesting improved outcomes for those lucky enough to enter.","[Ward, Zachary] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Coll Business & Econ, HW Arndt Bldg 25A, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia",Australian National University,"Ward, Z (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Coll Business & Econ, HW Arndt Bldg 25A, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia.",Zach.A.Ward@gmail.com,,"Ward, Zachary/0000-0001-7475-0910",,,,,68,25,31,1,17,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0014-4983,1090-2457,,EXPLOR ECON HIST,Explor.

Providing fast and convenient motorization, they attract both public transportation users and (former) car-owners. However, given their highly flexible nature and different pricing structures, previous findings on user groups and environmental impact of station-based car-sharing may not be easily transferable. Therefore, this research uses survey data to compare user groups and usage patterns of a free-floating and station-based car-sharing service both operating in the city of Basel, Switzerland. The findings suggest, that the schemes indeed attract different user groups and are also used differently. Moreover, we see, that car-sharing membership is governed by other factors than car-sharing activity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper proposes a data-driven approach to improving the electrification rate of the vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by taxi fleet in Beijing. Specifically, based on the gathered real-time vehicle trajectory data of 46,765 taxis in Beijing, we conduct time-series simulations to derive insights for the public charging station deployment plan, including the locations of public charging stations, the number of chargers at each station and their types. The proposed simulation model defines the electric vehicle charging opportunity from the aspects of time window, charging demand and charger availability, and further incorporates the heterogeneous travel patterns of individual vehicles. Although this study only examines one type of fleet in a specific city, the methodological framework is readily applicable to other cities and types of fleet with similar dataset available, and the analysis results contribute to our understanding on electric vehicle's charging behavior. Simulation results indicate that: (i) locating public charging stations to the clustered charging time windows is a superior strategy to increase the electrification rate of VMT; (ii) deploying 500 public stations (each includes 30 slow chargers) can electrify 170 million VMT in Beijing in two months, if EV's battery range is 80km and home charging is available; (iii) appropriately combining slow and fast chargers in public charging stations contributes to the electrification rate; (iv) breaking the charging stations into smaller ones and spatially distributing them will increase the electrification rate of VMT; (v) feeding the information of availability of chargers in charging stations to drivers can increase the electrification rate of VMT; (vi) the impact of stochasticity embedded in the trajectory data can be significantly mitigated by adopting the dataset covering a longer period.

Using weekly price data for these two fuels at the state level over a period of almost ten years, we find that more than half of the fuel price differentials are stationary, which reveals the importance of allowing for spatial considerations when testing for market integration. We also find that the speed at which prices converge to the long-run equilibrium depends upon the distance between states, the differential in sugarcane mills density between states, and the similarity between tax regimes. Other demand and supply factors such as population density, gas stations density, sugarcane mills density and GDP per capita are not statistically significant.","[Nunez, Hector M.] Ctr Invest & Docencia Econ, Dept Econ, Circuito Tecnopolo Norte 117, Aguascalientes 20313, Ags, Mexico; [Otero, Jesus] Univ Rosario, Fac Econ, Calle 12 C 4-69, Bogota, Colombia",Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

Despite the prominent role of ILO conventions in establishing international labor standards, surprisingly little is known about whether these conventions have any significant effect on the rights they seek to improve. This article provides a comprehensive assessment of the possible impact that seven fundamental ILO conventions have on labor rights in ratifying countries. Results from the data analysis for the period 1981-2011 suggest that the ratification of core ILO conventions is negatively associated with the level of respect for worker rights. One major implication of our findings is that while the adoption of core ILO conventions is crucial in recognizing primary rights of workers, they might paradoxically serve to undercut those rights.","[Peksen, Dursun] Univ Memphis, Dept Polit Sci, Memphis, TN 38152 USA; [Blanton, Robert G.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Govt, Birmingham, AL USA",University of Memphis; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham,"Peksen, D (通讯作者)，Univ Memphis, Dept Polit Sci, Memphis, TN 38152 USA.",dpeksen@memphis.edu; rblanton@uab.edu,,"Blanton, Robert/0000-0001-7667-2725",,,,,57,30,30,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

The sudden increase in the country's wealth created an inflow of capital never seen before, which led to an appreciation of its currency and, therefore, a loss of competiveness in the non-energy exporting sector. The purpose of this article is to provide empirical evidence of Dutch disease in Colombia. This country is different from other economies analyzed for Dutch disease since it has been dependent on two different commodities, coffee first and oil lately. Hence, we focus on the long-run analysis and test by means of a vector error correction model whether commodity prices are related to the real exchange rate and the relative manufacturing output. The long-run relations as well as the impulse response analysis clearly show that commodity prices are positively related to the real exchange rate. Thus, increases in commodity prices have a negative effect on the competitiveness of the country. Our result also shows that public spending is a major source of pressure on the Colombian real exchange rate.","[Poncela, Pilar] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Anal Econ Economia Cuantitat, C Francisco,Tomas & Valiente 5, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Senra, Eva] Univ Alcala, Dept Econ, Plaza Victoria 2, Madrid 28802, Spain; [Paola Sierra, Lya] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Dept Econ, Calle 18 118-250 Av Canasgordas, Cali, Colombia; [Poncela, Pilar] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Ispra, Italy",Autonomous University of Madrid; Universidad de Alcala; Pontificia Universidad Javeriana; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Sierra, L (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Dept Econ, Calle 18 118-250 Av Canasgordas, Cali, Colombia.",lyap@javerianacali.edu.co,"Sierra, Lya/J-5607-2016; Poncela, Pilar/AAB-1726-2019; Senra, Eva/L-3535-2014","Sierra, Lya/0000-0002-8909-8977; Poncela, Pilar/0000-0002-0848-3997; Senra, Eva/0000-0003-4422-7648","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2012-32854, ECO2014-56676C2-2-P]; Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali,"We thank the participants of the XVI Applied Economics Meeting, EEA, for their useful comments.

Accordingly, in this paper we examine the impact of liberalization, energy efficiency, renewable energy, and security of supply legislation on European energy utilities' returns between 1996 and 2013. We implement an event study portfolio analysis using a comprehensive list of major regulatory changes, the largest utility sample to date, and a novel asset pricing model that controls for sector-level stock-market, term premium, and commodity risk factors. The results show EU policies that focus on liberalization and energy efficiency have a significant negative impact on the energy sector's financial returns. This reflects changes in the fundamental risk-reward trade-off of European energy utilities and investors' recognition of the economic impact of EU legislations on the sector. Contrary to assertions by the financial press, renewable energy objectives have no significant impact on returns at sector-level; the impact is mostly concentrated on the natural gas utilities. Our results highlight a tension between liberalization and environmental objectives, negatively impacting the sector's ability to raise the estimated $2.2 trillion investment capital needed to ensure reliable and increasingly environmentally-friendly energy supply.","[Tulloch, Daniel J.] Univ Oxford, Smith Sch Enterprise & Environm, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Diaz-Rainey, Ivan; Premachandra, I.

Using a dynamic panel estimator and a sample of 78 developing and emerging economies for the years 1982-2011, the paper investigates the impact of democracy on the relationship between financial development and economic growth. The paper finds that democracy does not enhance the effect of financial development on economic growth. This finding is consistent with a view that democracy can be captured by political elites or other special interests in developing and emerging economies, where institutions are relatively weak.","[Williams, Kevin] Univ West Indies, Dept Econ, St Augustine, Trinidad, Trinidad Tobago",University West Indies Mona Jamaica; University West Indies Saint Augustine,"Williams, K (通讯作者)，Univ West Indies, Dept Econ, St Augustine, Trinidad, Trinidad Tobago.",Kevin.Williams@sta.uwi.edu,,,,,,,50,8,8,2,18,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Australia and Sweden took earlier New Public Management reforms to an ideological extreme, and pursued a profit-like goal for the public sector, in promising and delivering annual budget surpluses. From a historical institutionalist perspective, we challenge existing public choice theories and the guardian-spender framework to show how fears of crisis, party dynamics and ideological reassessments on the centre-left, and the elevation of finance and economics ministers and ministries resulted in an unlikely political and electoral consensus. Furthermore, this occurred without constitutionalised or officially strict rules, as has been the trend in other countries, but was achieved through less formal yet influential rules of the game' with stricter interpretations. What is even more perplexing is that Australia and Sweden do not have superior economic records to show for this experiment and experienced the same challenges as other countries during the 2008 financial crisis. Yet, they are still reluctant to definitely abandon the policy.","[Brenton, Scott] Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Pierre, Jon] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Polit Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Melbourne; University of Gothenburg,"Brenton, S (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Parkville, Vic, Australia.",sbrenton@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,53,5,5,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Business activities go through a large number of business changes, which offers numerous options for money or assets to enter the company via seemingly legal business transactions, enabling money or assets to remain in regular business flows once money laundering is completed. On the other hand, the opposite scenario, in which there is interest in money to be transferred from regular flows to alternative flows, including terrorism financing, is also common. This paper will discuss legal business operations as a framework for money laundering and terrorist financing. Cash flow cycles are presented in form of an algorithm as connections between irregularly and regularly acquired assets in the process of money laundering through business operations, as well as re-entry from regular flows into alternative cash flows. The Butterfly Diagram, presenting groups of business changes enabling entry of larger amounts of money and assets owned by a company in order to be laundered or their exit with the effect or tax evasion or terrorism financing, evolved from the algorithm. Also, the Butterfly Diagram includes certain forms of legal and tax misuse which enable legalising the specified activities. The business reality is exceptionally dynamic and needs of money launderers keep growing, which is why there is an increase in types and numbers of business transactions that can be used for money laundering or terrorism financing, resulting in the need to keep modifying the presented Butterfly Diagram.","[Cindori, Sonja] Univ Zagreb, Fac Law, Zagreb, Croatia; [Slovic, Jelena] Audit Co Finodit, Belgrade, Serbia",University of Zagreb,"Cindori, S (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Law, Zagreb, Croatia.",scindori@pravo.hr; jelena.slovic@finodit.co.rs,,,Croatian Science Foundation [UIP-2014-09-5933],Croatian Science Foundation,This work has been supported by the Croatian Science Foundation under the project number UIP-2014-09-5933.,,26,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,138,146,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8SX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428763000015,0

Officially modelled after the Cowles Foundation for Economics Research, it reflected Jacques Dreze's broad experiences in the USA during the 1950s when modelling techniques were not yet anchored in disciplines. CORE gained an international reputation, however, through the rather exclusive community of Neo-Walrasian economists represented by Werner Hildenbrand, Jean Gabszewicz, and Gerard Debreu. After this community modified the disciplinary divisions at CORE, the influence of CORE on continental economics occurred mainly through disequilibrium economics, which still represents a French accent in modern macroeconomics. At the same time, operations research and econometrics prospered at CORE while receiving scant attention from economists. This essay tells the story of how CORE changed continental economics through the unique career path of its founder, Jacques Dreze.","[Duppe, Till] Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Econ, Pavillon Sci Gest,315 Rue St Catherine Est, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Düppe, T (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Econ, Pavillon Sci Gest,315 Rue St Catherine Est, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",duppe.till@uqam.ca,,,,,,,61,6,6,1,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

Therefore, it's necessary to strengthen independent innovation with support of the state. The product image of listed companies involving in environmental protection is not quite beautiful, so it's imperative to focus on the brand image promotion. The brand must be supported by core competitiveness. In addition, this enterprise calls for a huge and long investment, which needs the support of the financial industry.

In the first part, this article will situate the crisis in the historical context of the twin enlargements of the EU and NATO. Secondly, it will assess the consequences of the European neighbourhood policy in fostering the crisis.

The accounting rules have been adapted and we find, firstly, an accounting model taken from French accounting and according to which all leasing contracts are recognized in a single category, without any classification of these contracts. With the introduction of some accounting principles of Anglo-Saxon origin (initially as a result of the suggestions made by the international financial institutions), the premises were created for the classification of the leasing contracts into two categories - financial and operational - with different accounting rules. This happened in 1999 and the accounting rules after that date have always kept in mind the separation of the two types of contracts. Considering the history of Romanian accounting, strongly influenced by a continental European patrimony conception, the first solutions proposed by the accounting standard setter are characterized by some inconsistencies, compared to the international accounting rules for the recognition of assets and liabilities. As the Romanian accounting regulations improved, leasing solutions became close to those of international standards, but there remain specific elements that significantly simplify the accounting treatments applied.","[Istrate, Costel] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Istrate, C (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania.",istrate@uaic.ro,"Istrate, Costel/AAC-3234-2022",,,,,,8,0,0,0,2,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-383-6,,,,2017,,,,,,,466,480,,,,,,15,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7OU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455266300038,0

To this end, we use a detailed dataset with fifty inter-provincial, industry-specific flows by four transport modes (road, train, ship and aircraft). We then feed this dataset into various specifications of a gravity model that incorporates cross-sectional dependence attributable to unobservable factors directly associated with the presence of transport-mode competition schemes.

Our statistics, which we call state prices of conditional quantiles (SPOCQ), estimate the market's willingness to pay for insurance against outcomes in various quantiles of the return distribution. By estimating state prices at conditional quantiles, we separate variation in the shape of the pricing kernel from variation in the probability of a particular event. Thus, without imposing strong assumptions about the distribution of returns, we obtain a novel view of pricing-kernel dynamics. We document six features of SPOCQ for the S& P 500. Most notably, and in contrast to recent studies, we find that the price of downside risk decreases when volatility increases. Under a standard asset pricing model, this result implies that most changes in volatility stem from fluctuations in idiosyncratic risk. Consistent with this interpretation, no known systematic risk factors such as consumer sentiment, liquidity or macroeconomic risk can account for the negative relationship between the price of downside risk and volatility.

The offered methodology of evaluation of innovativeness of HR potential allows assessing the general level of HR innovational potential and of the main parameters which characterize it. Also, this methodology is convenient for comparing territorial values of the level of HR innovational potential. Based on the results of the analysis of the level of HR innovational potential of the federal districts and of the Russian Federation on the whole, the leading regions (Central and Northwestern Federal District) and outsiders (North Caucasian and Far Eastern Federal Districts) were determined. The level of HR innovational potential of Stavropol Krai, as a subject-leader of the North Caucasian Federal District, was determined with the help of a special scale. The results of this calculation show average level of innovativeness of personnel in the krai, though its use is organized on a rather high level.

The expanding economic globalization process was induced by a complex interaction of growing international trade and foreign direct investment flows, the diffusion of new technologies, evolving corporate strategies toward a more global focus, and labor force movements. The features of the labor market are being modified by the impact of globalization. Economic globalization has both a positive and negative impact on the labor market of a small open economy. The people of small open economies participate in the economic globalization process in two ways: many local employees work for the affiliates of MNEs and acquire new qualifications and experience, while others move to more developed countries looking for a better salary and better conditions of life. The expansion of activities of MNEs not only has a great impact on the qualifications and structure of local human resources but also alters the labor market demand in a small open country, especially in one with a high concentration of activity and low level of competitiveness.","[Pekarskiene, Irena; Laskiene, Daiva; Saboniene, Asta; Susniene, Rozita] Kaunas Univ Technol, Dept Econ, Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Susniene, R (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Dept Econ, Kaunas, Lithuania.",rozita.susniene@ktu.lt,,,,,,,44,2,2,1,12,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-39919-5; 978-3-319-39918-8,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,4.0,,,,,,199,216,,10.1007/978-3-319-39919-5_16,0.0,,,18,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2AH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000407615400016,0

Using the data of 305 college students and employees in China, and via SPSS and Amos, the current research finds that the relationship between customer perceived value and purchase intention tends to be significantly stronger with the increasing of structural hole.

A well-managed labour migration strategy presents itself as a mechanism for ameliorating the impending labour shortages in some East Asia-Pacific countries, while providing an opportunity for other countries with excess labour to provide migrant workers who will contribute to the development of the home country through greater remittance flows. This paper examines such migration policy options using a global dynamic economic simulation approach and finds that allowing migrants to respond to the major demographic changes occurring in Asia over the next 50years would be beneficial to most economies in the region in terms of real incomes and real GDP over the 2007-50 period.

The purpose of this study is to find out some similarities between traditional culture and ideological and political education in Colleges and universities, and formulate innovative strategies for ideological and political education in accordance with these common points. By referring to a large number of documents, this project not only generalizes the common points of traditional culture and ideological and political education, but also concludes the common points between traditional culture and Marx doctrine. Finally, this project demonstrates that it is feasible to innovate the ideological and political education in Colleges and universities with traditional culture. Our research shows that colleges and universities can innovate the ideological and political education by taking some corresponding strategies. These strategies are: to integrate the essence of traditional culture, to create new methods of Ideological and political education, and to strengthen the construction of traditional culture education in Colleges and universities. This study provides a new idea for ideological and political education in Colleges and universities throughout the country.","[Xu, Yingfeng] Quanzhou Normal Univ, Sch Marxism, Quanzhou, Peoples R China; [Xu, Jingxian] Quanzhou Normal Univ, TSL Sch Business & Informat Technol, Quanzhou, Peoples R China",Quanzhou Normal University; Quanzhou Normal University,"Xu, JX (通讯作者)，Quanzhou Normal Univ, TSL Sch Business & Informat Technol, Quanzhou, Peoples R China.",xuyingfeng118@126.com; yjsxjx@126.com,"Xu, Jingxian/T-8417-2018; xu, yingfeng/IAN-8807-2023","xu, yingfeng/0000-0002-6855-0848","Teaching Reform Foundation Research Funds of School of Marxism, Quanzhou Normal University; Fujian Province young and middle-aged teacher education research project [JAS170399]","Teaching Reform Foundation Research Funds of School of Marxism, Quanzhou Normal University; Fujian Province young and middle-aged teacher education research project","This work was financially supported by:; The Teaching Reform Foundation Research Funds of School of Marxism, Quanzhou Normal University (2017).; Fujian Province young and middle-aged teacher education research project (Number JAS170399): Xi Jinping's thought of ecological poverty alleviation and its practical significance for the development of Fujian.",,5,2,2,1,7,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-402-6,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2017,106.0,,,,,,230,234,,,,,,5,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BI9GR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416081200051,0

Contrary to claims in the literature based on firm balance sheets, firms from developing countries borrow through bonds and syndicated loans at maturities similar to those obtained by developed country firms. There are relevant differences across the debt markets composing this aggregate pattern. Firms from developing countries borrow shorter term in domestic bond markets. But the differences in international issuances (accounting for most of the proceeds) are significantly smaller. Moreover, developing country firms borrow longer term in syndicated loan markets. However, only large firms from developing countries (similar in size to those from developed ones) issue bonds and syndicated loans. The short-termism in developing countries is partly explained by a lower proportion of firms using these markets, with more firms relying on other shorter-term instruments.","[Cortina, Juan J.; Didier, Tatiana; Schmukler, Sergio L.] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Cortina, JJ (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",,,,World Bank; Assonime/CEPR Research Programme on Restarting European Long-Term Investment Finance (RELTIF),World Bank(The World Bank India); Assonime/CEPR Research Programme on Restarting European Long-Term Investment Finance (RELTIF),"We received very helpful comments from Andreas Antoniades, Roberto Fattal Jaef, Stephany Griffith-Jones, Ruth Llovet, Andrea Presbitero, Maria Soledad Martinez Peria, Luis Serven, two anonymous referees and participants at related presentations held at the ASSA Annual Meetings (Chicago), Bocconi University, Borsa Istanbul, Central Bank of Argentina, Central Bank of Chile, CSEF-University of Naples Federico II, Georgetown University, the International Monetary Fund, University of Buenos Aires, University of Cape Town and the World Bank (Washington, DC and Malaysia Knowledge and Research Hub).

For a long time this problem was focused on the technical, agronomic, medicinal and pest management's aspects, while the problem is a behavioral problem and the socio-economic aspect plays an important role. In order to study the Farmers' risk perceptions of pesticides used in agriculture greenhouses in central-eastern Tunisia (Monastir Governorate), an ordered probit model was tested for 110 farms for greenhouse agriculture. The results showed the significance and positivity of the relationship between independent variables such as extension, use of protective equipment, experience, membership of the public irrigation perimeter, agricultural income, and the variable depending on Farmers 'risk perceptions of pesticides used. On the other hand, absence of the relationship between the level of education and the perception that it seems contradictory, but it can be justed by the age of the farmers who is high. The overall significance of the ordered probit model with a perceived acceptable level of perception can be improved by taking into account the heterogeneity of the farmers in this region in terms of age, education level, membership in a public or private irrigation perimeter and the possibility of access to extension. Developing awareness-raising methods are based on demonstrative and simple techniques accompanied by optimal monitoring and control can reduce the rate of excessive use of pesticides and guarantee greenhouse agriculture sustainable in the central eastern region of Tunisia.","[Jeder, Houcine; Laarif, Asma; Chaieb, Ikbal] Ctr Reg Rech Hort & Agr Biol Chott Meriem, Sousse, Tunisia; [Jeder, Houcine] Inst Reg Arides, Lab Econ Soc Rurales, Medenine, Tunisia; [Ksouri, Faten] Ctr Tech Agr Biol Chott Meriem, Sousse, Tunisia",Institut des Regions Arides,"Jeder, H (通讯作者)，Ctr Reg Rech Hort & Agr Biol Chott Meriem, Sousse, Tunisia.;Jeder, H (通讯作者)，Inst Reg Arides, Lab Econ Soc Rurales, Medenine, Tunisia.",djederhoucine@yahoo.fr,"JEDER, HOUCINE/ABG-6113-2020; Chaieb, Ikbal/AGO-6133-2022","Chaieb, Ikbal/0000-0002-7556-7197; JEDER, HOUCINE/0000-0003-1953-8209",Tunisian Research and Higher Agricultural Education Institution (IRE-SA),Tunisian Research and Higher Agricultural Education Institution (IRE-SA),This paper is produced as part of a research project on Integrated and Sustainable Management of Protected Vegetable Crops Systems (CleProd) funded by the Tunisian Research and Higher Agricultural Education Institution (IRE-SA).

Using a time-varying parameter model with stochastic volatility for real GDP growth and inflation allows their dynamics to change over time, approximating nonlinearities in the data that otherwise would not be adequately accounted for with linear models [Granger, Clive W.J., Timo Terasvirta, and Heather M.

With that empirical model, I document a period of declining macro volatility since the 1980s, followed by increasing (and diverging) inflation volatility since the mid-1990s. I also find significant shifts in inflation persistence and cyclicality, as well as in macro synchronization and even forecastability. The 2008 global recession appears to have had an impact on some of this. I ground my empirical strategy on the reduced-form solution of the workhorse New Keynesian model and, motivated by theory, explore the relationship between greater trade openness (globalization) and the reported shifts in international business cycle. I show that globalization has sizeable (yet nonlinear) effects in the data consistent with the implications of the model - yet globalization's contribution is not a foregone conclusion, depending crucially on more than the degree of openness of the international economy.","[Martinez-Garcia, Enrique] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, 2200 N Pearl St, Dallas, TX 75201 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Dallas,"Martínez-García, E (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, 2200 N Pearl St, Dallas, TX 75201 USA.",emg.economics@gmail.com,"Martinez-Garcia, Enrique/AAH-7320-2019","Martinez-Garcia, Enrique/0000-0001-5736-361X",,,,,87,6,6,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

By expanding the R&D-based growth model and using empirical analysis, this paper discusses the optimal combination for the government to coordinate its R&D expenditure as productive public investment in various sectors, under the condition of promoting long-term economic growth, is discussed by considering the aspects of capability for independent innovation, the development capability for basic knowledge, and the absorption capability for the technique. Results are as follows. (1) The level of production efficiency of enterprises, such as the capability for independent innovation, the development capability for basic knowledge, and absorption capability, influences the inclination of the government to invest in enterprises and institutions. When an enterprise has a high production efficiency level, technological level A, and knowledge storage B, increased investment from institutions to the enterprise can significantly promote regional economy growth. Otherwise, the government should increase R&D investment in institutions. (2) The government R&D investment in institutions can indirectly promote economic growth through the promotion of human capital and the understanding and absorption capacity of external knowledge, independent innovation capability, and basic knowledge development capability of enterprises. This paper may help the government to create appropriate policies with higher efficiency in R&D investment, and promote technical progress and economic growth in China.","[Zhao, Yuhan; Song, Xuguang] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Stat, 19 Xinjiekouwai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University,"Song, XG (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Stat, 19 Xinjiekouwai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",songxuguang@bnu.edu.cn,,,,,,,24,11,11,8,73,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

This paper examines the long-run relationship between per capita emissions and energy intensity in the GCC, while controlling for economic activity, the size of the manufacturing sector, and institutional qualities. We use heterogeneous panel techniques that account for heterogeneity and cross-country dependence for the period 1971-2011. We find that energy intensity and emissions are cointegrated in all GCC countries and that conservation and energy efficiency policies have greater potential in reducing emissions in Kuwait, Oman, and the UAE. A regional goal of mitigating emissions by 10% would require a reduction in energy intensity by 12%, on average.

The aim is to improve our understanding of the determinants of immobility and to estimate a function that links daily mobility level to socioeconomic characteristics given that a significant proportion of the survey population (9%) reported making no trip.","[Bayart, Caroline; Havet, Nathalie] Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Univ Lyon, ISFA, LSAF, F-69366 Lyon, France; [Bonnel, Patrick] Univ Lyon, CNRS, ENTPE, Urban Planning Econ & Transport Lab LAET, Rue Maurice Audin, F-69518 Vaulx En Velin, France",Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Bonnel, P (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon, CNRS, ENTPE, Urban Planning Econ & Transport Lab LAET, Rue Maurice Audin, F-69518 Vaulx En Velin, France.",caroline.bayart@univ-lyon1.fr; patrick.bonnel@entpe.fr; nathalie.havet@univ-lyon1.fr,"Havet, Nathalie/AHC-2729-2022","HAVET, Nathalie/0000-0001-7454-8771; Bayart, Caroline/0000-0003-2251-3563",,,,,37,4,4,0,7,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

This study explores disaggregate relationships among socio-economic/demographic (SED) traits, the built environment (BE), and VO. Many previous studies have assumed that the importance of SED and BE variables to VO is homogeneous across the population, and have focused on the direct and mediated effects of those variables on VO. Here, we aim to account for heterogeneity in the effects of BE and SED, allowing those effects on VO to be moderated as a function of attitudes. Specifically, we use Latent Class Modeling (LCM), which probabilistically segments the sample so as to be homogeneous within and heterogeneous across segments, with respect to the choice process. Applied to a sample of 2385 commuters in Northern California, LCM outperforms an ordinary multinomial logit model and a deterministic segmentation model. The LCM identifies two classes: an auto-oriented segment, for which household size and income have stronger influences on vehicle ownership (compared to the other segment); and an urbanite segment, for which the BE generally has a stronger influence. This study contributes to better understanding the heterogeneity of an important travel-related choice process, and offers an alternative explanation to residential self-selection for an attitude-related endogeneity bias.","[Kim, Sung Hoo; Mokhtarian, Patricia L.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Mokhtarian, PL (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",skim3020@gatech.edu; patmokh@gatech.edu,"Mokhtarian, Patricia/B-3374-2011","Mokhtarian, Patricia/0000-0001-7104-499X","Sustainable Transportation Center of the University of California, Davis (U.S. Department of Transportation); Sustainable Transportation Center of the University of California, Davis (California Department of Transportation through the University Transportation Centers program)","Sustainable Transportation Center of the University of California, Davis (U.S. Department of Transportation); Sustainable Transportation Center of the University of California, Davis (California Department of Transportation through the University Transportation Centers program)(University of California System)","This is a substantial expansion of a paper submitted for presentation only, to the 97th Annual Meeting of the Transportation Research Board.

Therefore, a multitude of incentives have been offered to the consumers but the effectiveness of those incentives varied due to diverse consumer perceptions on various incentives. To evaluate consumer behavior toward the incentives for EVs, this study performed stated preference experiments of actual EV owners. The experiments showed that, compared with the potential consumers, actual EV owners exhibited a greater inconvenience to charging time. For the incentives, EV owners showed different preferences to the different incentive measures. Especially, they have far greater preference for subsidies during their ownership period, such as discounts to the electricity charging rate and operation subsidies, than for those at the time of purchase, such as purchase subsidies and charger installation. These findings suggest that it would be more effective to formulate an incentive policy that reflects diverse consumer behavior toward EV incentive measures.","[Kwon, Yeongmin; Jang, Kitae] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Cho Chun Shik Grad Sch Green Transportat, Daejeon, South Korea; [Son, Sanghoon] Jeju Dev Inst, Reg Planning & Environm Div, Jeju, South Korea",Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST),"Jang, K (通讯作者)，Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Cho Chun Shik Grad Sch Green Transportat, Daejeon, South Korea.",kitae.jang@kaist.ac.kr,"Jang, Kitae/B-3386-2012; Kwon, Yeongmin/M-9034-2019","Kwon, Yeongmin/0000-0002-1094-2451",National Research Foundation of Korea - Korea government (MSIP) [NRF-2014R1A2A1A11052725],National Research Foundation of Korea - Korea government (MSIP)(National Research Foundation of Korea),This research was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea grant funded by the Korea government (MSIP) (NRF-2014R1A2A1A11052725).,,50,34,35,3,40,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,1879-2375,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

The cost-benefit analysis is the most common form of appraisal, where benefits are primarily measured from the change in consumer surplus in the transport market. However, these benefits will only reflect maximum social welfare if markets operate perfectly competitively and without any market failures. There may be significant uncaptured impacts, known as wider economic impacts, which agencies are beginning to incorporate in appraisals using ad-hoc methods. Computable general equilibrium (CGE) models are an increasingly popular method for assessing the economic impact of transport, including both direct and wider economic impacts, as they can determine the distribution of impacts among every market and agent in the economy by simulating the behaviour of households, firms and others from microeconomic first principles. Aside from their traditional role estimating changes in macroeconomic variables, CGE models can provide a measure of welfare that guarantees no double counting and accounts for nth order effects. This paper reviews the full range of CGE models that have been applied to transport issues and discusses their role in transport appraisal. CGE models for transport have been developed in urban, regional and environmental economics as well as other fields, and each field has applied its own theory, assumptions and practices to represent the relationships between transport and the economy relevant to the field. This paper also discusses the general role of CGE modelling in transport appraisal, as well as theoretical and practical concerns regarding CGE modelling practice.","[Robson, Edward N.; Wijayaratna, Kasun P.; Dixit, Vinayak V.] UNSW Sydney, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Res Ctr Integrated Transport Innovat, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Robson, EN (通讯作者)，UNSW Sydney, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Res Ctr Integrated Transport Innovat, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",e.robson@unsw.edu.au; k.wijayaratna@unsw.edu.au; v.dixit@unsw.edu.au,"Wijayaratna, Kasun/AAC-8070-2022","Wijayaratna, Kasun/0000-0002-4604-7256; Robson, Edward/0000-0003-2520-4504; Dixit, Vinayak/0000-0001-7643-409X",Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship,"Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science)",This work was supported by an Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship.,,188,33,37,3,58,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,1879-2375,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

We employ satellite-based night light intensity data as a proxy for urbanization to investigate the relationship between urbanization and women's body weight. We use two rounds of the Demographic and Health Survey data from Nigeria. We employ both nonparametric and parametric estimation approaches that exploit both the cross-sectional and longitudinal variations in night light intensities. Our empirical analysis reveals nonlinear relationships between night light intensity and women's body weight measures. Doubling the sample's average level of night light intensity is associated with up to a ten percentage point increase in the probability of overweight. However, despite the generally positive relationship between night light intensity and women's body weight, the strength of the relationship varies across the assorted stages of night light intensity. Early stages of night light intensity are not significantly associated with women's body weight, while higher stages of nightlight intensities are associated with higher rates of overweight and obesity. Given that night lights are strong predictors of urbanization and related economic activities, our results hint at nonlinear relationships between various stages of urbanization and women's body weight.

In addition, issues of endogeneity between bad health and subjective well-being are ignored when it comes to survival. We assess both for the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS; 1991-2008) and specifically analyze whether subjective well-being predicts better chances of surviving diseases such as cancer or heart conditions. We find that several of the studied diseases consistently decrease survival chances in our sample (e.g. hazard ratio 3.47 for cancer), also when controlling for the severity of health problems. But our results do not suggest that well-being mitigates the effect these diseases have on mortality. Life satisfaction also does not predict longer survival in the data set if we control for the endogeneity of subjective well-being. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The smart mobility options include shared taxi, one-way car rental, and a novel combination of park-and-ride and school bus facilities. While previous surveys on smart mobility options had investigated limited number of alternatives in isolation, the SP survey used in this research presents the smart mobility options alongside the existing options and their traditional variants like congestion pricing and improved public transport systems. Further, the choice of mode, departure time and occupancy are investigated in a multidimensional framework. This resulted a large choice set (with 9 modes, 5 departure times, and 2 occupancy levels leading to 135 alternatives in total) and required a novel survey design. The main survey administered over the internet and computer aided personal interviews included 2372 valid SP observations from 1248 respondents. Multi-dimensional mixed logit models were used to capture the complex correlations introduced due to the non-traditional survey design. Results indicate a significant preference of one-way car rental and shared taxi for non-commute trips. For commute trips, improved versions of traditional public transport modes are favoured over smart mobility options. These findings, as well as the novel data collection and modelling approach, are expected to provide important information to transportation planners and policy makers working to implement smart mobility options in Lisbon as well as in other cities.

When adjusted to reflect the general population of seniors, the size and bias of the average error fall to 16.1% and 4.2%. Both the bias and the size of the error tend to be lower for households with higher income and credit scores but it is greater for black households.

When seniors who applied for a reverse mortgage learn that they overvalued their home, their probability of closing the loan falls.","[Haurin, Donald] Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Moulton, Stephanie] Ohio State Univ, John Glenn Sch Publ Affairs, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Shi, Wei] Jinan Univ, Inst Econ & Social Res, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Jinan University,"Haurin, D (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",Haurin.2@osu.edu; moulton.23@osu.edu; shiweiemail@gmail.com,", Don/AAI-8422-2020; Moulton, Stephanie Marie/F-7206-2012; Shi, Wei/JPY-0293-2023","Moulton, Stephanie/0000-0003-4102-0932",,,,,56,11,11,2,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,FAL,2018,46.0,3,,,,,655,697,,10.1111/1540-6229.12197,0.0,,,43,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,GQ6UG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000441860800005,0

Conditioning on post-WWII subsamples and 5% nominal significance, conventional t-tests signal fiscal sustainability for these countries. In contrast, size-corrected inference hints at a lack of fiscal sustainability and, thus is recommended for the 'real-time' monitoring of public debt.

In order to refine the verification of the fetal origins hypothesis, we tried not only to focus on children from elite schools but also to construct the continuous influenza mortality measure using monthly variations in the number of births and influenza deaths. By utilizing a nationwide multidimensional physical examination dataset, we found that fetal exposure to influenza in the pandemic years reduced the heights of boys and girls by approximately 0.3 cm and 0.1 cm, respectively. While the strongest negative magnitude was observed in the pandemic period, the lingering relapses in the post-pandemic period still had considerable adverse effects on height. In relation to the lowest decile group which experienced normal influenza mortality in non-pandemic years, the heights of the boys and girls who experienced pandemic influenza in the womb are approximately 0.6 and 0.3 cm lower. The lingering influenza relapse in the post-pandemic period has an adverse effect on the boys' height, accounting for roughly 80% of the maximum pandemic effect. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, price optimization (PO) methods that seek to maximize hotel revenue are based on inventory scarcity, customer segmentation and pricing. In the hotel sector, as in the airline industry, different pricing policies have a greater impact than competition measurement effects. This is mainly as differentiation strategies and specific policies at hotels can reduce the pressure of a competitive environment.

Accordingly, this paper examines the house price effects of school quality and quality uncertainty. Residential bid rent theory under this type of uncertainty shows that greater school quality increases housing prices and steepens the gradient whereas quality risk decreases housing prices and flattens the gradient. The empirical models incorporate two sources of quality risk, the uncertainty over the quality of a given school and the uncertainty over which school a household will be assigned. Estimates reveal capitalization consistent with the theory. Including risk measures in the empirical model reduces quality level effects. All capitalization effects tend to be stronger in higher income neighborhoods. Further, attendance zone uncertainty exhibits more stable capitalization across subsamples than does uncertainty over the performance of a given school.","[Turnbull, Geoffrey K.; Zheng, Minrong] Univ Cent Florida, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Zahirovic-Herbert, Velma] Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Zahirovic-Herbert, V (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",Geoffrey.Turnbull@ucf.edu; vherbert@uga.edu; Mzheng2010@knights.ucf.edu,"Zheng, Minrong/AAA-3262-2022",", Minrong/0000-0003-3346-3709; zahirovic-herbert, velma/0000-0003-3552-3912",,,,,33,24,27,3,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Based on data sets of bilateral trust and trade at provincial level in China, this study investigates the trust-trade relationship empirically. As a channel of affecting bilateral trade, bilateral trust is incorporated into gravity models. By controlling for institutional quality, labour migration and other economic indicators, the baseline results show that the bilateral trust is positively correlated with the bilateral trade significantly. The sensitivity tests using an alternative estimation of interprovincial trade in China also confirm this positive trust-trade relationship. In addition, we use an instrumental-variable estimation to control for the endogeneity of bilateral trust, and find that the trust-trade relationship is robust. This relationship seems to reveal that improving bilateral trust can be a new channel of boosting bilateral trade.","[Xing, Weibo] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Li-An] Peking Univ, Guanghua Sch Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics; Peking University,"Xing, WB (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,,"Xing, Weibo/0000-0002-1703-0674; Xing, Weibo/0000-0002-3738-2052",National Science Funding of China [71673044]; MOE (Ministry of Education of China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences [15YJA790070],National Science Funding of China; MOE (Ministry of Education of China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences,"This study is supported by the National Science Funding of China (71673044) and the MOE (Ministry of Education of China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences (15YJA790070).

Despite increasing evidence of the importance of transportation equity, there are broad questions about how equity principles factor into planning processes. This work provides an empirical analysis of the role of transit equity in planning for BRT investments in three Canadian metropolitan areas. Our findings show that transit equity rarely figured into the design and planning of BRT systems and there is a lack of clarity in both defining equity and determining how it should be integrated in planning processes. Most definitions of transit equity focused on the equal distribution of resources for all groups, rather than consideration of transitdependent riders. Equity outcomes were also in conflict with other goals, as BRT systems were viewed largely as a tool for encouraging development and focused on attracting car drivers to transit. This paper argues that there needs to be a better understanding of the values and priorities of those involved in professional and political decision-making processes if transit equity goals are to be realized.","[Linovski, Orly] Univ Manitoba, Dept City Planning, 211 Russell Bldg, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada; [Baker, Dwayne Marshall] Univ South Carolina, Dept Geog, Columbia, SC USA; [Manaugh, Kevin] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Manaugh, Kevin] McGill Univ, McGill Sch Environm, Montreal, PQ, Canada",University of Manitoba; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; McGill University; McGill University,"Linovski, O (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Dept City Planning, 211 Russell Bldg, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.",orly.linovski@umanitoba.ca,"Manaugh, Kevin/ABG-5995-2020","Manaugh, Kevin/0000-0003-2975-030X; Linovski, Orly/0000-0002-1088-8053",Canada Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council [430-2015-00302],Canada Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"This work was supported by the Canada Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council [Grant No. 430-2015-00302, 2015].",,74,34,38,6,34,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

The paper presents a model for deriving the size of the equilibrium chonsei deposit by incorporating the default risk of chonsei for the first time. Using the mortgage-market equilibrium model with default costs, this paper explores the link between default cost, house price expectations of the landlord, and the chonsei deposit. The model shows that the higher is the landlord's default cost (the less risky he/she is), the smaller is the chonsei deposit, while the more favorable are the expectations for future house prices, the greater is the chonsei deposit. The predictions of the theoretical model are tested and confirmed using bank data and survey data.

The challenge consists in striking a balance between an increase in waiting time for passengers at skipped stations and a decrease in travel time for through-going passengers, with possible consequent changes in the passenger demand and route choices. This study presents the formulation of the skip-stop problem as a bi-level optimisation problem where the lower level is a schedule-based transit assignment model that delivers passengers' route choices to the skip-stop optimisation model at the upper level, and where the upper level in return provides an improved timetable to the lower level. A heuristic method for large-scale urban networks is presented to solve this extremely complex bi-level problem, where the skip-stop optimisation is a mixed-integer problem, whereas the route choice model is a non-linear non-continuous mapping of the timetable. The method was tested on the suburban railway network in the Greater Copenhagen Region (Denmark): the reduction in railway passengers' in-vehicle travel time was 5.5%, the reduction in passengers' generalised travel cost was 3.2% and, at the system level, the yearly consumer surplus amounted at 76.7 million DKK (about 10.3 million EUR or 12.7 million USD) when compared to the existing stopping patterns.","[Parbo, Jens; Nielsen, Otto A.] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Management Engn, Bygningstorvet 116B, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Prato, Carlo G.] Univ Queensland, Sch Civil Engn, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",Technical University of Denmark; University of Queensland,"Prato, CG (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Civil Engn, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",c.prato@uq.edu.au,"Nielsen, Otto Anker/AAF-2954-2021; Prato, Carlo Giacomo/C-6104-2016","Nielsen, Otto Anker/0000-0001-7901-7021; Prato, Carlo Giacomo/0000-0002-1218-4922",Danish Council for Strategic Research,Danish Council for Strategic Research(Danske Strategiske Forskningsrad (DSF)),We gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the Danish Council for Strategic Research for the project RobustRailS that this study is part of.

Finally, co-authorships in economic history are more likely to be formed of individuals of different seniority compared to economics generally.","[Seltzer, Andrew J.] Royal Holloway Univ London, London Sch Econ, London, England; [Seltzer, Andrew J.] IZA, Ilford, England; [Hamermesh, Daniel S.] IZA, Barnard Coll, Ilford, England; [Hamermesh, Daniel S.] NBER, Wakefield, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Royal Holloway University London,"Seltzer, AJ (通讯作者)，Royal Holloway Univ London, London Sch Econ, London, England.;Seltzer, AJ (通讯作者)，IZA, Ilford, England.",a.seltzer@rhul.ac.uk,,,,,,,17,6,6,0,8,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0014-4983,1090-2457,,EXPLOR ECON HIST,Explor.

Two major rebel groups benefited from cash and in-kind transfers, the CNDD-FDD from 2004, and the FNL from 2010. We combine panel data of households collected in 2006 and 2010 with official records from the National Commission for Demobilization, Reinsertion and Reintegration. We find that the cash payments received by FNL demobilized households had a positive impact on consumption, nonfood spending and investments. The program also generated positive spillovers in the villages where FNL combatants returned. Ex-combatants indeed spent a large part of their allowance on consumption goods and clothing, thereby generating a short-run economic boom in villages. However, the long-run evolution of consumption indicators is negative for CNDD-FDD households, as well as for villages where CNDD-FDD combatants returned, suggesting that the direct impact and the spillovers of the program vanished in the long run.","[D'Aoust, Olivia] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [D'Aoust, Olivia] ULB, ECARES, Brussels, Belgium; [Sterck, Olivier] Univ Oxford, CSAE, Oxford, England; [Verwimp, Philip] ULB, ECARES, Dev Econ, Brussels, Belgium",The World Bank; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; University of Oxford; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Sterck, O (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, CSAE, Oxford, England.",odaoust@worldbank.org; olivier.sterck@economics.ox.ac.uk; wimp@ulb.ac.be,,,Alain and Marie Philippson Chair; Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique (FNRS); ARC [09/14-018]; MICROCON project (EU 6th Framework),Alain and Marie Philippson Chair; Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique (FNRS)(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS); ARC(Australian Research Council); MICROCON project (EU 6th Framework)(European Union (EU)),"Olivia D'Aoust and Philip Verwimp acknowledge financial support from the Alain and Marie Philippson Chair and the Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique (FNRS).

We match Fortune Global 500 firms to WTO disputes in which they have a stake and to their political activities using public disclosure data. The quantitative evidence reveals traces of a principal-agent relationship between major MNCs and the US Trade Representative (USTR). Firms lobby and make political contributions to induce the USTR to lodge a WTO dispute, and once a dispute begins, firms increase their political activity in order to keep USTR on track. Lobbying is overwhelmingly patriotic-the side opposing the US position is barely represented-and we see little evidence of MNCs lobbying against domestic protectionism. When the United States is targeted in a dispute, lobbying by defendant-side firms substantially delays settlement, as the affected firms pressure the government to reject concessions. Lobbying on the complainant side does not delay dispute resolution, as complainant-side firms have mixed incentives, to resolve disputes quickly as well as to hold out for better terms.","[Ryu, Jeheung; Stone, Randall W.] Univ Rochester, Dept Polit Sci, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",University of Rochester,"Stone, RW (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Dept Polit Sci, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",j.ryu@rochester.edu; randall.stone@rochester.edu,,,,,,,82,15,19,1,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

Our approach indicates that even seemingly simple competitive interactions may include a rich, complex set of effects. We demonstrate that psychological pressure leads to FMA in shoot-outs; however, we show that this relationship can vary depending on a variety of different factors, such as the nature of the pressure, the magnitude of the pressure, and the specific rules governing the shoot-out.

Overall, we find the average annual real growth rate to be 5.5%. Since 1993, land prices have risen quite dramatically, and much faster than population or employment growth, at an average annual rate of 15.8%, suggesting that barriers to entry in real estate development are causing prices to rise faster than other measures of local well-being. Further, we estimate the entire amount of developable land on Manhattan in 2014 was worth approximately $1.74 trillion.

Studying the dimorphism in the mean height helps to depict variation in the basic biological sex difference due to gender-related factors that potentially determine net nutrition. To expand knowledge of diachronic development in Swiss well-being conditions we investigate changes in the height of adult females born 1770-1930, and compare the series with data on contemporary males from the same sources: We employ a sample of N = 21'028 women and N = 21'329 men from passport-, convict-, maternity hospital-, and voluntary World War II army auxiliary records. The secular height trend is found both in males, from the 1870s/1880s, and in females starting with the 1840s/1850s birth cohorts. During the decades under study, mean height increased from 157 cm to 164 cm in female and 167 cm to 172 cm in male passport applicants, 154 cm to 159 cm in female and 167 cm to 169 cm in male convicts, 159 cm to 163 cm in female auxiliaries, and 155 cm to 159 cm in females giving birth in the maternity hospital of Basel. Because females seem to have started the secular trend in height earlier than their male contemporaries, the height dimorphism decreased during the second half of the 19th century. Differences between socio-economic status (SES) and data sources are found in both females and males: Women with low SES were significantly shorter than those of the other SES groups in all sources (on average 1.40 cm, p-values between 0.00 and 0.03). In men we found individuals of upper SES to be significantly taller (on average 1.96 cm, p-value = 0.00-0.10). Concerning differences between the sources, overall, passport applicants were the tallest for men as well as women; in females the individuals measured at the maternity hospital and in prison were the shortest. The variances across the datasets highlight the importance of considering different sources to depict average living conditions. Noteworthy is the finding that the diverse sources under study all show the same trajectory of increasing mean height over the course of the 19th century. In the long run, the improving net nutritional status of Swiss females may have been one of the contributors behind the general rise in well-being of the country's population from the later 19th century onwards.

Instead, there is growing evidence that EU asylum harmonization has safeguarded existing standards and even enhanced the rights of asylum-seekers and refugees in Europe. We seek to explain this by building on the insights of principal-agent theory. We argue that delegation to supranational institutions can strengthen non-majoritarian policy dynamics and shield EU policy-makers from populist pressures for further immigration restrictions that national governments are often confronted with. We support this argument empirically through a systematic longitudinal analysis of the evolution of EU asylum policies. In particular, we seek to assess the motivation for and impact of greater delegation to EU institutions on rights developments for asylum-seekers and refugees.

It offers an explanation for why China's exports continued to rise under RMB real appreciations during the Asian financial crisis. Based on a traditional export demand model, we test our hypothesis that the counteracting effects of China's export tax rebate policy have diminished the effectiveness of real exchange rates in facilitating the resolution of trade imbalances under the current pegged exchange rate regime. We find evidence that RMB real appreciations during the crisis negatively affected China's exports, but the negative effects were mitigated by the positive effects of export tax rebates. We also find evidence of a long-run relationship between China's exports and the other explanatory variables. The empirical evidence suggests that under the pegged exchange rate regime with limited adjustments, real exchange rate movements alone cannot resolve China's external imbalances. The policy implication of this study is that China needs to redirect its decades-long export-oriented development strategy to one that emphasises domestic demand-oriented development and to replace the current pegged exchange rate regime with a market-oriented more flexible exchange rate regime.","[Xu, Zhenhui] Georgia Coll & State Univ, Milledgeville, GA 31061 USA; [Xu, Zhenhui] Hunan Univ, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China",University System of Georgia; Georgia College & State University; Hunan University,"Xu, ZH (通讯作者)，Georgia Coll & State Univ, Milledgeville, GA 31061 USA.;Xu, ZH (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,43,5,5,4,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2018,41.0,5,,,,,1288,1308,,10.1111/twec.12570,0.0,,,21,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,GF5VX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432037100007,0

Statistical tests confirm the presence of overreactions and also suggest that there is an inertia anomaly, i.e. after an overreaction day prices tend to move in the same direction for some time. A trading robot approach is then used to test two trading strategies aimed at exploiting the detected anomalies to make abnormal profits. The results suggest that a strategy based on counter-movements after overreactions does not generate profits in the FOREX and the commodity markets, but in some cases it can be profitable in the US stock market. By contrast, a strategy exploiting the inertia anomaly produces profits in the case of the FOREX and the commodity markets, but not in the case of the US stock market.","[Caporale, Guglielmo Maria] Brunel Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, London UB8 3PH, England; [Caporale, Guglielmo Maria] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Caporale, Guglielmo Maria] DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Gil-Alana, Luis] Univ Navarra, Pamplona, Spain; [Plastun, Alex] Sumy State Univ, Sumy, Ukraine",Brunel University; Ifo Institut; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; University of Navarra; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Sumy State University,"Caporale, GM (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, London UB8 3PH, England.;Caporale, GM (通讯作者)，CESifo, Munich, Germany.;Caporale, GM (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany.",Guglielmo-Maria.Caporale@brunel.ac.uk,"Plastun, Alex/L-7631-2014","Plastun, Alex/0000-0001-8208-7135",,,,,32,17,18,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Yet the democratic promise of political decentralization should be evaluated in light of its potential undermining effects upon the essential mechanism to make accountability work: citizens' capacity to assign responsibility for policy outcomes. People may get it wrong when assigning responsibility because they are not sure who is responsible for policy outcomes when powers are vertically fragmented between different levels of government and/or simply because their responsibility judgements are biased by political beliefs, which act as lenses through which attribution is filtered. How can we then make electoral accountability work in decentralized systems? This paper will explore this question by delving into the most important theoretical and empirical challenges in the study of attribution of responsibility and electoral accountability in decentralized contexts. At the theoretical level, there is still need of a better understanding of the relationship between federal institutional conditions and individuals' use of cognitive bias to cope with institutional complexity when assigning responsibility. The empirical challenge is to overcome the lack of comparable individual-level data on responsibility attribution for a broad range of country cases.

Evidence from Costa Rica,ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CULTURAL CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,EXPOSURE; IMPACT; CHILDHOOD; EDUCATION; DISEASE; GENDER; HEALTH; LABOR,"The estimated benefits of malaria eradication have been very different in terms of human capital accumulation. This paper quantifies the impact of malaria eradication in Costa Rica and explores whether precampaign regional characteristics can improve or damage the benefits of a health campaign. There are several results. First, using difference in differences I find that years of education of men and women increased in response to the eradication campaign but that only wages of males increased. Results are robust. Second, worse conditions in the school system and more child employment displaced schooling. Hence, health benefits may not translate into educational gains when the school system characteristics are bad or when the child labor market provides a better investment opportunity than schooling. Third, combining empirical evidence with a simple model, the increase in schooling cannot solely explain the increase in the income of men; however, health improvements explain most of the increase. Finally, the point estimates show that human capital gains were almost completely eliminated when a shortage of funding for eradication led to a resurgence of malaria; this emphasizes the fragility of the estimated benefits.","[Mora-Garcia, Claudio A.] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Bogota, Colombia",Pontificia Universidad Javeriana,"Mora-García, CA (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Bogota, Colombia.",claudio_mora@javeriana.edu.co,,,,,,,56,3,3,0,5,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0013-0079,1539-2988,,ECON DEV CULT CHANGE,Econ.

On the first issue, the focus is on understanding why so few low-income countries, especially in Africa, have achieved a sustained level of export diversification. The paper argues that the standard Washington Consensus advice on trade policy placed too much emphasis on liberalisation alone and neglected the important role of government policy, in particular the potential to use targeted input subsidies to support the development of export sectors. Mauritius is then discussed as an example of relatively successful subsidy policies that enabled diversification of exports: indeed the only African country to achieve this in a sustained manner. Subsidies are not advocated as a panacea, and it is recognised that they are not always feasible or effective, but they can be part of an export diversification strategy that supports economic growth.","[Mosley, Paul] Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Mosley, P (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",,,,,,,,33,5,5,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,APR,2018,41.0,4,,,SI,,1025,1044,,10.1111/twec.12620,0.0,,,20,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,GC9JM,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430113300005,0

Regional authorities have organized themselves to affect policy developments at the supranational level. They do so through the internal restructuring of their administrations, by carrying lobbying activities directly in Brussels, but also by institutionalizing and sometimes constitutionalizing their authority over their Member State's EU position. In other words, both their informal and formal influence over EU affairs has grown. The relevance of these trends is illustrated by recent events such as the Wallonia parliament holding up the EU-Canada trade deal. This case highlights how the nature of both subnational and supranational politics has changed over time. International trade deals used to be considered as high politics', remote from the immediate concerns of regional bodies and well beyond their formal reach. The Wallonia case illustrates this is no longer so. This article is part of the April 2018 Symposium titled Shaping and Breaking Political Systems?

We argue that this discrepancy results from an inherently static view of technology adoption by utilities when estimating future energy savings. We illustrate this through a simple model of technology adoption, in which households operate different vintages of appliances and have heterogenous forecasts about the rate of future technological progress. An energy efficiency gap arises when households under-estimate the true rate of technological progress. We parameterize the model using data on refrigerators and show that a DSM program that subsidizes adoption of energy-efficient refrigerators yields small energy saving that, in most cases, do not justify the cost of the subsidy.","[Cai, Wenbiao; Grant, Hugh; Pandey, Manish] Univ Winnipeg, Dept Econ, 515 Portage Ave, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2E9, Canada",University of Winnipeg,"Cai, WB (通讯作者)，Univ Winnipeg, Dept Econ, 515 Portage Ave, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2E9, Canada.",we.cai@uwinnipeg.ca; h.grant@uwinnipeg.ca; m.pandey@uwinnipeg.ca,,"Pandey, Manish/0000-0001-7874-6644",,,,,21,3,4,0,3,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,MAR,2018,39.0,2,,,,,219,231,,10.5547/01956574.39.2.wcai,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FZ4RB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427578400010,0

We analyze the dependence structure of these two risk factors employing a conditional copula model. As conditioning factors we use the supply and demand of seaborne transportation. We find that crisis risk strongly increased already about 1 year before the actual crisis outburst and that the shipping crisis was predominantly driven by an oversupply of transport capacity. Therefore, market participants could have prevented or alleviated the consequences of the crisis by reducing the ordering and financing of new vessels.","[Opitz, Sebastian; Seidel, Henry; Szimayer, Alexander] Univ Hamburg, Fac Business Econ & Social Sci, Von Melle Pk 5, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Szimayer, A (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Fac Business Econ & Social Sci, Von Melle Pk 5, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",alexander.szimayer@wiso.uni-hamburg.de,"Szimayer, Alexander/AAB-5350-2022",,Australian Research Council [DP160104737]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SZ 321/2-1],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: DP160104737; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: SZ 321/2-1",,30,3,3,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0883-7252,1099-1255,,J APPL ECONOMET,J.

Using a number of models, we compare out-of-sample forecasts of the unemployment rate with the LMCI to those without the LMCI. We also estimate models of the disaggregated unemployment rates by gender, race, and race by gender, with and without the LMCI, to identify disparities in the predictive power of the LMCI for different subgroups. Last, to determine how the LMCI performs in the presence of labor market shocks, we compare the forecasting performance of the LMCI during recessionary periods and expansionary periods. Our results confirm the potential usefulness of the LMCI as a parsimonious forecasting tool; we find that the LMCI generally improves unemployment forecasts. But, disparities exist in the predictive power of the index across subpopulations and the index forecasts slightly better during recessionary periods than expansionary periods.","[Connolly, Laura; Sheehan, Alice] Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, 200 Alston Hall,Box 870224, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Sheehan, A (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, 200 Alston Hall,Box 870224, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",aesheehan@crimson.ua.edu,,"Sheehan, Alice/0000-0003-2121-0173",,,,,15,2,2,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

This paper is focused on the description, verification and application of the multi-attribute decomposition methods AHP and ANP based on the Saaty pair comparison approach. The AHP and ANP methods are described, including the computation procedure. The applicability of the methods is presented at the preferences determination. The linear AHP and nonlinear ANP methods are applied. These methods are applied for insurance market assessment, particularly, for determination of preference indicators for the assessment of the insurance market. We consider importance of setting the ratio for evaluation indicators of the development of the insurance market by applying Saaty methods in the framework of decomposition methods AHP and ANP (insurance penetration ratio, claims frequency ratio, concentration ratio, premium indicator, benefit indicator, number of insurance company indicator and more). Subsequently, a custom regression model is created.","[Borovcova, Martina; Spackova, Adela] VSB TU Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70200, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Borovcová, M (通讯作者)，VSB TU Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70200, Czech Republic.",martina.borocova@vsb.cz; adela.spackova@vsb.cz,"Borovcová, Martina/AAG-7044-2021","Borovcová, Martina/0000-0001-8872-7308",SGS Project VSB - TU Ostrava [SP2018/154],SGS Project VSB - TU Ostrava,This paper was supported by the SGS Project VSB - TU Ostrava SP2018/154 Financni rozhodovani podniku a financnich instituci za rizika.,,7,0,0,0,0,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8980-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,44,52,,,,,,9,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BM4AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000462948800005,0

The interest of doing this is three-fold: (i) we characterize the social value of damage related to the targeted nitrate concentration; which (ii) leads us to design the optimal path consistent with the target; and (iii) we can in turn assess welfare losses arising when the tax path deviates from the optimal one.,"[Bourgeois, Cyril] Univ Paris Saclay, INRA, AgroParisTech, Econ Publ, Paris, France; [Bourgeois, Cyril; Viennot, Pascal] MinesParisTech, GEOSCI, Paris, France; [Bourgeois, Cyril] CIRED, UMR 8568, Nogent Sur Marne, France; [Jayet, Pierre-Alain] Univ Paris Saclay, INRA, AgroParisTech, UMR Econ Publ, Paris, France; [Habets, Florence] UPMC, CNRS, UMR 7619, METIS, Paris, France",INRAE; Universite Paris Saclay; AgroParisTech; Universite PSL; MINES ParisTech; AgroParisTech; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite Paris Saclay; INRAE; Universite Paris Saclay; AgroParisTech; Sorbonne Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE),"Cyril, B (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Saclay, INRA, AgroParisTech, Econ Publ, Paris, France.;Cyril, B (通讯作者)，MinesParisTech, GEOSCI, Paris, France.;Cyril, B (通讯作者)，CIRED, UMR 8568, Nogent Sur Marne, France.",bourgeois_cyrill@yahoo.fr,"Habets, Florence/K-2267-2015; Bourgeois, Cyril/AAC-5110-2022","Bourgeois, Cyril/0000-0003-1909-2040",PIREN Seine research program,PIREN Seine research program,This research is partly supported by the PIREN Seine research program.

The increase in the possibility of information flow has caused completely new conditions in the context of the human process of communication and cooperation. At the heart of civilization development, there is a progress in information technology. The result of the information revolution is informatization and inter-connectivity of modern society, thanks to which the world today is highly technicized but also complex and strongly diversified.

The state needs forms of expression its authority. Namely, the administration is bounded to choose one of the existing types of action in order to avoid arbitrary. These are: the administrative act, the transnational administrative act, the administrative convention, the material acts and the informal act. The administrative act became a way of the state's public authority to express. Particularly, the administrative act is an exhibition of the action of the executive function. As correctly has been marked the administrative act is a creation of the meaning of the rule of law Before the dominance of the rule of law, the administrative bodies actions didn't subject to the law, and the bodies acted according to their volition, id est, arbitrarily. The European edifice, however, would remain interrupted if the legal effects of an administrative act that is published in a specific member- state, couldn't develop commitment towards the rest member-states of the European Union. For this reason was consented the meaning of the transnational administrative act by German theorists.. It is about the administrative authorities act of a member- state (issuing state) during the exercise of public authority, in order to regulate the relationships that are within the scope of the Community law and which develops its results outside the legal order of its publishing, id est. within the rest member- states of the European Union.This kind of acts aim to remove the obstacles to the realization of the Community Freedoms, resulting from the differences of the legal orders of the member states, without being necessary the harmonization of the legal orders in detail(1). These are acts of overriding will and are distinguished from other acts of public administration in that they are drawn up by the concurrence of the wills of two or more legal persons exercising public authority or a legal person exercising public authority and individuals. In the field of private law, the Convention is the main source of contractual relations as the modern exchange economy finds the contract the most appropriate legal instrument, but in the sphere of administrative law the administrative convention as a dynamic administrative phenomenon additionally fulfills the principle of administrative efficiency for the benefit primarily of the citizens who are no longer the subject of administration. Material acts constitute a required tool of the administration, so among the rule of law, as among the social state and especially for the evolution of the providing administration, as Jellinek pinpoints as well. From the 19th century already, the administration didn't exclusively act with coercion, but in certain cases asked for an informal understanding with businesses as well. This practice, however, is underestimated among the administrative science, which program was mainly the administrative domestication and the legal provisions of the administrative actions. Under these conditions, the Informal act is appeared. Typical case, is the law of the environment's protection, and the law of the water protection, where the administration seems to be based on informal transactions of exchanging with the stakeholders and the businesses in order to achieve the law enforcement. The objective of this paper is to present the various forms by which the state expresses its power and willingness.","[Chatzigagios, Thomas; Mavridis, Stylianos] Univ Macedonia, Dept Accounting & Finance, 156 Egnatia St, Thessaloniki 54006, Greece",University of Macedonia,"Chatzigagios, T (通讯作者)，Univ Macedonia, Dept Accounting & Finance, 156 Egnatia St, Thessaloniki 54006, Greece.",lyrkat@gmail.com; st.mavridis@yahoo.gr,,,,,,,22,2,2,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,314,320,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540720300032,0

A high density of WTD, especially in suburban areas, has led to human-deer conflicts, conflicts traditionally solved by hunting, Recently, however, there has been a push towards non-lethal control, especially fertility control. While the scientific and technical aspects are beginning to be well understood, the ethical issues raised require further exploration. The paper begins by discussing the challenges of high- density WTD populations, and the possibility of using fertility control as a response to these. Then the paper identifies major ethical issues raised, as viewed from the perspectives of animal rights, utilitarianism and concern for wildness. Our conclusion is that changes in human behaviour, rather than pharmaceutical fertility control to reduce deer populations, seem to ethically preferable from all three perspectives. However, it is less clear how pharmaceutical population control compares with hunting in ethical terms.","[Gamborg, C.; Sandoe, P.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Sandoe, P.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Vet & Anim Sci, Gronnegardsvej 8, DK-1870 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Palmer, C.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Philosophy, 4237 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",University of Copenhagen; University of Copenhagen; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Gamborg, C (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",chg@ifro.ku.dk,"Gamborg, Christian/L-7392-2014","Gamborg, Christian/0000-0003-3150-8280",,,,,11,0,0,0,2,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,386,391,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_61,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000061,0

To address this, we develop a three sector closed economy NK-DSGE model calibrated to India. Our framework can be generalized to other emerging markets and developing economies. The model is characterized by a manufacturing sector and an agricultural sector. The agricultural sector is disaggregated into a grain and vegetable sector. The government procures grain from the grain market and stores it. We show that the procurement of grain leads to higher inflation, a change in the sectoral terms of trade, and a positive output gap because of a change in the sectoral allocation of labor. We compare the transmission of a single period positive procurement shock with a single period negative productivity shock and discuss the implications of such shocks for monetary policy setting.

Modern tourism includes providing comfortable accommodation and healthy diet, but not neglecting the content of active leisure, recreation, sport, cultural relaxation with music and entertainment. The returning towards nature and reconnecting with tradition and their roots are pleasures that are increasingly required by the modern tourists. The modern passive lifestyle presupposes the development of new alternative forms of tourism related to the combination of actives sport and relaxation, on the basis of which good health are maintained and physical and mental balance forces are restored. The second decade of the 21st century witnesses the active introduction on the international tourist market of specific tourist services aimed at those who are looking for strong sensations, and who are active users of extreme forms of tourism. Closely related to sports tourism is the adrenalin tourism, which can be defined as a type of tourism, involving exploration or travel with perceived (and possibly actual) risk, and potentially requiring specialized skills and physical exertion. Adrenalin tourism is characterized by its ability to provide the tourist with relatively high levels of sensory stimulation, usually achieved by including physically challenging experiential components. Adrenalin tourism is a gateway to break the routine, delving into strong physically and psychologically challenging tasks that can trigger profound ecstatic experiences. Also, adrenalin tourism helps in self-assessment of physical and emotional abilities. The aim of the study is to reveal the preconditions and conditions for the development of adrenalin tourism in the destination and to analyze and present main characteristics of rafting tourism destinations in republic of croatia. Inductive, deductive, and descriptive methods are used for the purpose of this work.","[Gracan, Daniela; Sotosek, Marina Barkidija] Univ Rijeka, Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management, Rijeka, Croatia; [Gregoric, Marina] Polytech Medimurje Cakovec, Cakovec, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Gracan, D (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management, Rijeka, Croatia.",danielag@fthm.hr; marina.gregoric@mev.hr; marinab@fthm.hr,"Gregoric, Marina/AAI-5438-2021; Sotosek, Marina Barkidija/Y-4477-2018; Gracan, Daniela/Y-4478-2018; Gregoric, Marina/T-7151-2017","Gregoric, Marina/0000-0003-0741-2908; Sotosek, Marina Barkidija/0000-0003-2642-3960; Gregoric, Marina/0000-0003-0741-2908",,,,,11,2,2,0,5,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,197,205,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540718700020,0

Currently, college and university administrations have not paid enough attention to the teaching of physical education. In order to improve the health of Chinese citizens, we should attach great importance to the impact of college physical education.

In veterinary ethics, the focus is often directed tripartite structure of veterinarian - owner - animal. But this triad turns out to be embedded in wider structures that build the implicit basis for a differential treatment of different animals. Hence, they pre-determine the triadic clinical encounters. Sophisticated technologies like blood donation, renal transplants, prostheses, etc. are provided to companion animals regularly. The individuals are considered patients with a normative demand for beneficence even similar to humans. Livestock is treated differently. A cow with acute renal failure would not get a donation but would be euthanized. In epidemics, economic constraints might widely overrule the individual's status as patients; e.g. in the food-and-mouth disease culling is performed because it is easier and cheaper than vaccination. The concern for the patient is limited to preferably painless killing. Hence, we can understand some animals (e.g. livestock) as liminal patients'. Consequently, these frames determine a 'differential allocation' of the recognition of animals as patient in different ways and degrees with crucial, however, often tacit impacts on concrete decision-making. Public expectations as well as the hidden curriculum of the veterinary profession determine how 'one should treat' a cow, a dog or a rat. However, these frames are not entirely determinant but are changeable.","[Huth, M.] Messerli Res Inst, Unit Eth & Human Anim Studies, Vet Pl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria",University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna,"Huth, M (通讯作者)，Messerli Res Inst, Unit Eth & Human Anim Studies, Vet Pl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria.",martin.huth@vetmeduni.ac.at,,,,,,,18,1,1,0,0,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,243,248,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_37,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000037,0

Such cooperation, however, is not guaranteed. Despite the power asymmetry between China and partner countries, as well as the latter's significant infrastructure investment needs, host countries still need to be convinced of the specific benefits of China's projects, thus creating a bargaining opportunity. Significant room for negotiations emerges due to the domain characteristics of infrastructure development and China's strategic motives and industrial policy needs which often misalign with the host country's development priorities. I construct an analytical framework drawn from bargaining theory to explain when power asymmetry may fail to prevail in China's infrastructure diplomacy, which is illustrated by its high-speed rail negotiations in Southeast Asia. The relative bargaining power of a host country is influenced by its threat points, which interact with the project terms offered by China to produce final bargaining outcomes. This article offers a new perspective on the agency of weaker states in the context of China's rise.","[Oh, Yoon Ah] Korea Inst Int Econ Policy, Sejong, South Korea",Korea Institute for International Economic Policy (KIEP),"Oh, YA (通讯作者)，Korea Inst Int Econ Policy, Sejong, South Korea.",,"Oh, Yoon Ah/ACO-5811-2022","Oh, Yoon Ah/0000-0002-7126-819X",,,,,69,32,32,7,64,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Using selected transnationalised elements from historical materialism, this is explained as a transnational state initiative to secure general material conditions for capitalist growth in a manner that is profoundly shaped by power relations. The infrastructure problem was allowed to grow during neoliberalism because of the hegemony of finance; the push is a result of and reflects a weakening of finance and strengthening of industrial interests in the transnational power bloc, as well as a strengthening of the emerging economies. This potential hegemonic project has gained the support of the global labour movement, while also has been subject to serious criticism from civil society organisations, speaking for the most vulnerable subaltern social forces. The empirical analysis also shows that the transnational state in this policy area works as a flexible, networked cooperation of G20 states and leading international organisations in ongoing dialogue with non-state actors, especially transnational business. In this cooperation, the international organisations have a relatively autonomous role in line with a historical materialist understanding of state apparatuses.","[Ougaard, Morten] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, Int Polit, Frederiksberg, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Ougaard, M (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, Int Polit, Frederiksberg, Denmark.",mo.dbp@cbs.dk,,"Ougaard, Morten/0000-0001-7234-2868",,,,,114,25,25,3,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

We further elucidated changes of immunoreactivity in terms of IgE-binding in processed insect extracts. For migratory locust Locusta migratoria different extraction methods, enzymatic hydrolysis or thermal processing were used. IgE from patients with crustacean allergy shows cross-recognition ofA. domesticus, S. gregaria and stable flies, and house dust mite allergies' IgE binds to A. domesticus and S. gregaria. The known cross-reactivity to L. migratoria can be completely deleted by hydrolyzation with different enzymes and heat treatment (cooking, autoclaving). Our results show that crustacean-, HDM- and stable flies-allergic patients cross-recognize desert locust and house cricket proteins, and crustacean-allergic patients also flies proteins. Furthermore, we confirm that the appropriate food processing method of insect proteins can reduce the risk of cross-reactivity for crustaceans- and house dust mite-allergic patients.

To question a dominant story one needs an elaborated counter story which I cannot provide here and now. What I hope to do is more programmatic in nature. The plan here is to point at a questionable, basic element of the dominant story, that is: its critique on the charity approach, and then sketch a different story that also can be heard at the food bank. This will lead me to a reflection on the difference between the dominant 'rights based approach' and a 'dignity approach' that I reconstruct and derive from empirical research, and to an attempt to normatively justify the form of emergency food aid that the food bank provides. The distribution of food, donated by companies and private individuals and to be prepared at home, at some 530 food banks that are united in the 'Association of Dutch Food Banks' (ADFB), forms the empirical frame of reference in which I argue.","[Pijnenburg, L.] Wageningen Univ & Res, CPT Philosophy, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Pijnenburg, L (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ & Res, CPT Philosophy, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",leon.pijnenburg@wur.nl,,,,,,,18,1,1,0,2,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,229,233,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_35,0.0,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000035,0

This article builds on work in comparative political economy and economic sociology to show that the degree of competitive behaviour of postsocialist firms is determined not by the existence of general market institutions alone but by the kinds of organisational allies firms possess and the kinds of markets they compete in. Using firm survey data across 28 postsocialist economies, the article examines the determinants of competitive restructuring by firms, including product innovation, standards upgrade, financial transparency, and investments in research and development. The article confirms insights from comparative political economy which suggest that dynamic enterprise sectors emerge when governance is effective. However, at the firm level, the article finds that transnational ties and supportive policy environments are most significant in the making of dynamic postsocialist enterprises. The article also highlights important regional variation in firm behaviour and discusses the relationship between institutional frameworks, organisational embeddedness, and firm restructuring in postsocialist economies.","[Pula, Besnik] Virginia Tech, Dept Polit Sci, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Pula, B (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech, Dept Polit Sci, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",bpula@vt.edu,,,American Sociological Association/National Science Foundation postdoctoral fellowship,American Sociological Association/National Science Foundation postdoctoral fellowship,The author received an American Sociological Association/National Science Foundation postdoctoral fellowship.,,75,5,5,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Despite this, there is little scientific knowledge about how much laying hens go outside (i.e. 'range') and its implications for animal welfare. This presentation covers a combination of studies on the topic of free-range egg farming from an animal welfare point of view. The aim is to illustrate through the case study of Australian free-range eggs the challenge of aligning farming practices, consumers' expectation and other market forces. Contrary to previous studies that reported low range use (5 to 30%) based on the proportion of the flock outside at one time, recent studies that followed individual hens with radio frequency identification systems revealed that most hens (85 to 95%) accessed the range. Hence, better methods are required to assess range use, and more hens range that commonly believed. Online forum discussions were run as a virtual version of focus group between stakeholders. The results highlighted that the general public and animal advocacy groups emphasised the psychological and natural aspects ofpoultry welfare, whereas industry-related members emphasised its health aspects. Video observations on commercial farms revealed that the main behaviours displayed by hens while on the range did not differ in terms of nature, but rather in terms of frequency from the behaviours shown inside the shed. This only partly addresses the consumer belief that free-range allows for more 'natural' behaviours. From the hens' point of view, the welfare implications of ranging appeared minimal, from the measures collected to date (fear, stress, fitness). Nevertheless, hens varied substantially in their range use, leaving the question of 'why do hens range?. The scientific evidence suggests that free-range offers the choice to the hens, and the market suggests that it also offers a choice to the consumers. However, consumers' expectation that laying hens should spent most of their time outside may not necessarily match the laying hens' wants. Whether animal welfare science, through its current tools and approaches, is able to inform all societal questions on animal use and on a timely manner is a topic for discussion.","[Rault, J.

It underlines the subordinated and uneven nature of Portuguese semi-peripheral financialisation, the role of European integration in its unfolding, and concludes that the promotion of the interests of finance located in major advanced capitalist countries, and of the national and international institutions under their influence, has resulted in growing social and spatial inequalities.","[Santos, Ana C.; Teles, Nuno] Univ Coimbra, Ctr Social Studies CES, Coimbra, Portugal; [Rodrigues, Joao] Univ Coimbra, Ctr Social Studies CES, Fac Econ FEUC, Coimbra, Portugal",Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra,"Santos, AC (通讯作者)，Univ Coimbra, Ctr Social Studies CES, Coimbra, Portugal.",anacsantos@ces.uc.pt,"Rodrigues, João/ISB-6671-2023; Teles, Nuno R/R-3546-2018; RODRIGUES, JOÃO/AAC-6993-2019; Rodrigues, João/GVU-7735-2022","Santos, Ana Cordeiro/0000-0002-3654-2544","European Union Seventh Framework Programme [FP7], through the FESSUD project [266800]; Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation (FCT/MEC); ERDF through the Competitiveness and Innovation Operational Programme COMPETE, through the FINHABIT project [PTDC/ATP-GEO / 2362/2014 - POCI-01-0145-FEDER-016869]","European Union Seventh Framework Programme [FP7], through the FESSUD project; Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation (FCT/MEC); ERDF through the Competitiveness and Innovation Operational Programme COMPETE, through the FINHABIT project","The research leading to these results received funding from the European Union Seventh Framework Programme [FP7/2007-2013], through the FESSUD project [grant agreement number 266800], and from the Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation (FCT/MEC), co-financed by the ERDF through the Competitiveness and Innovation Operational Programme COMPETE 2020, through the FINHABIT project [PTDC/ATP-GEO / 2362/2014 - POCI-01-0145-FEDER-016869].",,56,15,15,2,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

This article has two philosophical conclusions. As any economic system is closed, - and in the Middle Ages practically all economic systems were closed, - all economic development after XVI-XVII centuries appeared as a competition between developing and expanding systems, because expansion was possible only within a closed system.(1) Competition begins, and more successful systems swallowed up less successful systems. In late XIX century the Old World clearly defined 3 main technological systems that competed with each other. The first zone was British, it originated in the middle of XVIII century; the second technological zone was German, it appeared in the middle of XIX century; the third zone was the USA(2) Since the Earth has limits, sooner or later scientific and technological progress will have to stop.

The hypothesis was verified by means of inductive and deductive reasoning. The effects of analyses and considerations indicate the significant role of state schools of higher vocational education in the sustainable development process. Increasing educational opportunities for young people from smaller towns, the growth of gross enrolment ratio in regions where state higher vocational schools were formed, indirect economic stimulation in these regions and supplying them with financial means from the national budget in the form of grants for higher schools and financial assistance for students, boosting revitalisation processes in urban areas and the positive effects of cooperation of these schools with numerous entities in the socio-economic environment seem to demonstrate that their functioning supports the development of subregional centres, and in this way, contributes to sustainable development at the regional scale.","[Zimny, Artur] State Univ Appl Sci, Konin, Poland",,"Zimny, A (通讯作者)，State Univ Appl Sci, Konin, Poland.",artur.zimny@konin.edu.pl,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,3,STANISLAW STASZIC UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES PILA,PILA,"UL PODCHORAZYCH 10, PILA, 64-920, POLAND",,,978-83-62617-89-0,,,,2018,,,,,,,94,105,,10.14595/CP/01/007,0.0,,,12,Development Studies; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BM3DE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000461899000007,0

The large metropolises of East Asia have had decades of experience with private sector participation in the provision of heavy metro services. The design of these public private partnerships (PPP) are varied. The diverse experiences of Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore and Beijing contain valuable lessons for other cities. Using a case study approach, this paper discusses three features of urban rail transit developments in the context of East Asian cities, viz., farebox recovery, land value capture mechanisms, and vertical structure of the industry. Super vertical integration between rail transit and real estate development as land value capture strategy to finance urban rail transit has proven to be successful in Japanese cities and Hong Kong. Singapore's experience illustrates that vertically unbundled PPPs could cut off avenues for cross-subsidisation, reduce information flows as well as economies of scale and scope, introduce principal agent problems, and result in underinvestment in capital stock and maintenance. We conclude that (i) a combination of high farebox recovery ratios and successful land value capture contributed significantly to the development of urban rail transit in East Asia cities; (ii) given the complexities and high costs of heavy metros, the optimal structure is a vertically integrated public-owned and driven system, with the public sector entering into selective partnerships with the private sector where risk sharing is clearly defined and allocated.","[Chang, Zheng] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Tat Chee Ave, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Phang, Sock-Yong] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, 90 Stamford Rd, Singapore 178903, Singapore",City University of Hong Kong; Singapore Management University,"Phang, SY (通讯作者)，Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, 90 Stamford Rd, Singapore 178903, Singapore.",zchang@cityu.edu.hk; syphang@smu.edu.sg,"PHANG, Sock Yong/D-1443-2009","chang, zheng/0000-0001-6624-3206; Phang, Sock-Yong/0000-0001-6280-3202",,,,,73,45,46,5,156,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,1879-2375,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

A number of studies have explored the association between childhood overweight and obesity and healthcare utilisation and costs. This paper adds to the literature by estimating the causal effect of child overweight and obesity status on use of general practitioner (GP) and hospital inpatient stays at two time points using instrumental variable (IV) methods The paper uses data from two waves of the Growing Up in Ireland survey of children when they are 9 and 13 years respectively and uses the biological mother's body mass index (BMI) as an instrument for the child's BMI. Our results demonstrate that child overweight and obesity status do not have a significant effect on healthcare utilisation for children when they are 9 years, but do have a large and significant effect at 13 years. Across all our models, the effects on both GP and hospital inpatient stays are found to be larger when endogeneity in childhood BMI status is addressed. Previous studies that did not address endogeneity concerns are likely to have significantly underestimated the impact of child overweight and obesity status on healthcare utilisation.

Particularly in developing regions of the world, infection burden appears to slow growth during childhood. Using a large database representative of the US population, we examined associations between adult height and leg length and an infection-burden index based on past exposure to Toxocara species, Toxoplasmosis gondii, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, herpes simplex virus 1, and herpes simplex virus 2. In models controlled for age, sex, educational attainment, socioeconomic status, and race-ethnicity, we found that the infection-burden index predicted height (beta = -0.10 [95% CI: -0.15, -0.05], p.001<0.001) but not leg length (beta = 0.04 [95% CI: -0.12, 0.04], p=0.357). Both sex and race-ethnicity moderated this association. In addition, exposures to Toxocara species, cytomegalovirus, and hepatitis A were each individually associated with reduced height and reduced leg length. While associations between growth and infection have been found principally in children in developing regions of the world, our findings suggest that the effects of infection on height may persist into adulthood even in developed nations.

Our study sheds new light on effective corporate governance for Asian REITs that are prone to agency problems. Such agency problems arise from the inequitable distribution of power to sponsors that results from the external management structure. The findings suggest that larger sponsor ownership aligns the interests of sponsors and minority shareholders and enhances the performance of Asian REITs, while such an effect diminishes as sponsors become more entrenched. We find that the incentive alignment effect and entrenchment effect are primarily driven by developer-sponsored REITs. Also evident is that the presence of institutional investors mitigates agency problems and increases firm performance.","[Tang, Cheng Keat; Mori, Masaki] Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Design & Environm, Dept Real Estate, 4 Architecture Dr, Singapore 117566, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Tang, CK (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Design & Environm, Dept Real Estate, 4 Architecture Dr, Singapore 117566, Singapore.",C.K.Tang@lse.ac.uk; rstmm@nus.edu.sg,"Tang, Cheng Keat/AAH-7832-2020; Mori, Masaki/GOK-0275-2022","Tang, Cheng Keat/0000-0002-1401-3588; Mori, Masaki/0000-0003-3269-0715",,,,,39,10,10,2,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The main reason behind this intensification of crises is caused by the transportation sector, as million petroleum based vehicle are waging on the street day and day which initiated carbon emission. The Malaysian government also faced major problem due to this CO2 emission. Because Malaysia is considered as major energy efficient nation. With the aim of obstructing these susceptibilities and endorse a more sustainable economy, the main solution is to change from Petroleum-based vehicles by using green vehicle innovation. Using, Electric Vehicles (EVs) have the probable to lessen the carbon emission, gasoline consumption in order to alleviate the environmental problem. Subsequently, the idea of this paper is to scrutinize whether attitudes (NIT) towards EV adoption by integrating three dimensions of attitude along with the theory of planned behavior the study suggests an assimilated model. A sample of 391 respondent has been collected from Malaysia in order to forecast the customer's purchase intention to adopt EV by using the extended theory of planned behavior.

Resting on a tacit assumption that EU engagement in third states is a good thing, these analyses are framed as positive impact or no impact' and tend to neglect the wider effects of EU policies. This article maintains that EU external action may and often does have unintended consequences, thus expanding the study of EU impact beyond the sheer study of EU effectiveness. Drawing on broader literature on unintended consequences, the article proposes a framework for analyzing unintended consequences of EU external action. It synthesizes and adapts to the EU context a classification of unintended consequences and, in order to illustrate its utility, applies the proposed framework to three empirical examples derived from EU neighbourhood, migration and trade policies.","[Burlyuk, Olga] Univ Ghent, Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Burlyuk, O (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Polit Sci, CEUS, Univ Str 8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",olga.burlyuk@ugent.be,"Burlyuk, Olga/H-6686-2019; Burlyuk, Olga/HRA-2914-2023","Burlyuk, Olga/0000-0002-7477-1655; Burlyuk, Olga/0000-0002-7477-1655",,,,,48,26,27,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The World Health Organization case reports published in 2015 stated that approximately 1.25 million people died each year and more than 50 million people injured as a result of traffic accidents in the world. Considering this situation, it is seen that traffic accidents are mostly human originated and one of the major problems that is negatively affecting life. In this context, many investments and many studies have been performed on the determination of traffic accident black spots to reduce traffic accidents. The current study aimed to get a descriptive model for determining the traffic accident black spots using model-based spatial statistical methods. These methods are Poisson regression, Negative Binomial regression and Empirical Bayesian method. The ultimate goal of this study was to build a model that allowed evaluating all the methods together in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) which is quite widely used nowadays. In the present study, the data were obtained from 300 thousand traffic accidents occurred on 2408 different state roads during the years from 2005 to 2013 from the General Directorate of Highways. The state roads of Turkey were divided into 32,107 sub-segments with the length of 1 km. Based on the study results, 126 sub-segments were determined as traffic accident black spots depending on the method used. According to comparison of the methods used in the present study, the Empirical Bayesian method provided the best results in terms of accuracy and consistency. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent empirical evidence shows that equity capital markets are expected to extend their role in this regard. This paper deals with the long-term performance of IPOs in the seaport industry as a strategic financial dimension for determining the success/failure of the issuance. The study goes beyond general finance theories on IPO performance as it places institutional theory side by side with informational asymmetry theories and symmetric information theories to assess the determinants of long term IPOs' success in the port domain. The paper presents an overarching conceptual framework for addressing IPO performance, thereby focusing on the explanatory power of financial markets, institutional factors and industry specific variables. An ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis is performed on a dataset of over 90 port-related IPOs to test the antecedents of the long-term performance of port-related IPOs. The performance of extant IPOs is expected to influence both the capacity of ports and terminal operating companies to gather additional financial resources from equity capital markets in the future, and the related cost of funding. In addition, it may shape the attitude of private investors toward this equity asset class. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Politicians typically see CC reform as a controversial policy if there is no public support. Yet a CC plan is currently under active development and remains under consideration as a way to mitigate the acute traffic congestion in Jakarta. The CC theme has been recognized as a powerful instrument in both delivering efficient road use and raising revenues. Studies indicate that revenue redistribution is one of the most important determinants of public support for such scheme. Given the absence of studies from the Asian megacity context, this paper presents a systematic study of how public perceptions relate to revenue spending choice behavior. A stated preference (SP) questionnaire is developed to investigate citizen's perceptions of CC reform, their preferences for revenue redistribution and their current travel behavior. Using data collected using this SP questionnaire in 2013, a hybrid revenue allocation (HRA) model is formulated that captures the impact of tangible factors (i.e. charges, socio-demographic characteristics, travel behavior) and intangible factors (perceptions) during process of deciding among revenue spending alternatives. The proposed model is drawn from traditional utilitarian resource (time) allocation theory, with an extension consisting of latent constructs representing subjective individual psychological perceptions. We find that there is a strong correlation between revenue allocation preferences and an individual's subjective psychological perceptions. The most preferred revenue allocations are for public transport improvements and traffic safety improvements, with 54% and 29% agreement, respectively. We find there is little support for spending revenues on other issues such as for stimulating local business (13%) and for parks/green spaces, driving education/enforcement and improving the parking system (4% in total). The findings of sensitivity analysis further disclose that the choice of spending on public transport improvements among respondents who frequently visit the central business district (CBD) is sensitive to the level of the CC charge, while for respondents who frequently enter the CBD by car and have a medium-high income the traffic safety allocation is sensitive to charge.

Consequently, we develop a combination of combinations of p values (CCP) test aimed at maintaining good power properties across such uncertainty. The CCP test is based on a simple union-intersection principle that exploits the weak correspondence between two underlying p value combination methods. Monte Carlo simulations show that the CCP test controls size and closely tracks the power of the best individual methods.

Methods: Data was from Iran's surveillance system for risk factors of non-communicable diseases which was conducted on 89,400 individuals aged 15-64 years in 2005. Principal component analysis was used to create a new variable for defining socioeconomic status of participants. We assessed inequality by calculating a slop index of inequality and concentration index for obesity. Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition analysis was used to determine the determinants of inequality. Results: The slop index of inequality and concentration index for obesity was -13.1 (95% Confidence Intervals [CI]: -16.3 to -9.8) percentage points and -0.123, respectively. The level of inequality varied widely between different provinces in Iran and was more severe in women and urban population. Obesity persisted in 20.2% (95% CI: 19.4-20.9) of the low-socioeconomic group and 11.0% (95% CI: 10.5-11.6) of the high-socioeconomic group. More than 90% of this gap was due to differences of independent variables (mainly age, gender and marital status) in two socioeconomic status groups. Conclusions: A pro-rich inequality existed in the obesity in Iran. Older age, female gender and rural residency contributed most to the economic inequality of obesity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

For example, companies increasingly promote their products and services by engaging in charitable giving and policy makers increasingly push for the implementation of market-driven prosocial initiatives. However, this trend has occurred without being informed by evidence on how the market influences individuals' engagement in prosocial behavior. Using a public goods game that simulates a market and a non-market context, we analyze prosocial behavior and its psychological underpinnings across these two contexts. First, we find that prosocial behavior occurs at lower levels in markets than non-markets. Second, we find that individuals' beliefs about prosocial norms are more important for prosocial behavior in markets than non-markets, while the opposite is true for their autonomous motivation towards prosocial behavior. This suggests that decision-makers need to adjust the means to foster prosocial behavior, depending on the institutional context deemed appropriate for specific prosocial behaviors.","[Fosgaard, Mia Reinholt; Foss, Nicolai Juul] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Strateg Management & Globalizat, Kilevej 14, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Fosgaard, Toke Reinholt] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Foss, Nicolai Juul] Bocconi Univ, Dept Management & Technol, Via Sarfatti 25, Milan, Italy",Copenhagen Business School; University of Copenhagen; Bocconi University,"Fosgaard, TR (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",tf@ifro.ku.dk,"Fosgaard, Toke R./E-6666-2015","Fosgaard, Toke R./0000-0003-0659-5490",,,,,50,7,7,3,42,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,AUG,2017,49.0,2,,,,,231,253,,10.1007/s00355-017-1058-4,0.0,,,23,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,FD9IH,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000407835500001,0

We find significant negative effects of pollution, which persist in the long run. Men and the elderly are impacted the most, while children seem to recover almost completely from these early shocks. For the entire population, an extra standard deviation in the pollution level increases the likelihood of a poor general health status by almost 3%. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We assume that social media allow potential participants to observe the individual participation decisions of others, while traditional mass media allow potential participants to see only the total number of people who participated before them. We show that when individuals' willingness to revolt is publicly known, then both sorts of media foster a successful revolution. However, when willingness to revolt is private information, only social media ensure that a revolt succeeds, with mass media multiple outcomes are possible, one of which has individuals not participating in the revolt. This suggests that social media enhance the likelihood that a revolution triumphs more than traditional mass media.","[Kiss, Hubert Janos] MTA KRTK KTI, Budaorsi Ut 45, H-1112 Budapest, Hungary; [Kiss, Hubert Janos] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Econ, Lagymanyosi Campus, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; [Rodriguez-Lara, Ismael] Middlesex Univ London, Dept Econ, Hendon Campus, London NW4 4BT, England; [Rosa-Garcia, Alfonso] Univ Catolica San Antonio Murcia, Fac Ciencias Jurid & Empresa, Campus Los Jeronimos S-N, Murcia 30107, Spain",Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Research Network; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies; Eotvos Lorand University; Middlesex University; Universidad Catolica de Murcia,"Rodríguez-Lara, I (通讯作者)，Middlesex Univ London, Dept Econ, Hendon Campus, London NW4 4BT, England.",kiss.hubert.janos@krtk.mta.hu; I.Rodriguez-Lara@mdx.ac.uk; arosa@ucam.edu,"Rosa Garcia, Alfonso/C-3224-2016; Kiss, Hubert János/C-6313-2016; Rodriguez-Lara, Ismael/R-1168-2019; Rodriguez-Lara, Ismael/L-1859-2014","Rosa Garcia, Alfonso/0000-0003-2223-007X; Kiss, Hubert János/0000-0003-3666-9331; Rodriguez-Lara, Ismael/0000-0002-0739-6234; Rodriguez-Lara, Ismael/0000-0002-0739-6234","Spanish Ministry of Economics [ECO2014-52372, ECO2014-58297-R, ECO2013-45698-P, ECO2016-76178-P]; Janos Bolyai Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences; National Research, Development and Innovation (NKFIH) [K 119683]","Spanish Ministry of Economics(Spanish Government); Janos Bolyai Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences(Hungarian Academy of Sciences); National Research, Development and Innovation (NKFIH)(National Research, Development & Innovation Office (NRDIO) - Hungary)","We are grateful for comments and suggestions from participants at the MKE Conference in Budapest and the SING 2014 Meeting on Game Theory in Krakow, and seminar participants at the Corvinus Game Theory Seminar (Budapest), the Universidad de Murcia and Universidad de Malaga (Spain).

This article evaluates the impact of different patterns of seasonality on tourism demand forecasting in the light of different volume of tourism flows. With this aim in mind, the monthly tourist overnight stays in four European countries - namely Austria, Finland, Portugal and Netherlands - are analysed for the period January 1990-December 2014.

First, it estimates the differences in the cut points along with the regression coefficient, leading to provide bounds on partial effects. Second, the proposed estimator for the regression coefficient is more efficient.

Are member states or supranational bodies held responsible or are public responsibility attributions (PRA) untargeted? We argue that in complex policy-making systems responsibility tends to be attributed to implementing actors. When, however, a policy does not require active implementation, we expect responsibility attributions to be untargeted. To test these expectations, we analyze PRA in the European public for three EU migration policies: (1) border control policies, (2) the distribution of refugees according to the Dublin'-system, and (3) so-called welfare migration facilitated by the freedom of movement' principle. Our analysis corroborates that PRA reflect the structure of policy implementation: (1) PRA for EU border controls target the EU; (2) PRA for the distribution of refugees target member states; (3) PRA for welfare migration are untargeted. The paper thus highlights an accountability gap for policies that do not require implementation.","[Rittberger, Berthold; Schwarzenbeck, Helena; Zangl, Bernhard] Univ Munich, Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Rittberger, B (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Dept Polit Sci, Chair Int Relat, Oettingenstr 67, D-80538 Munich, Germany.",berthold.rittberger@gsi.lmu.de,,"Rittberger, Berthold/0000-0002-8806-6455",,,,,53,14,15,2,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

To promote the market acceptance of NEVs, Chinese government has launched NEV demonstration projects and issued numerous policies since 2009, which absolutely promoted NEV sales, but also resulted in a subsidies-oriented NEV market. Therefore, Chinese government decided to decrease NEV subsidies gradually in next 5 years. In order to explore the key factors that promote NEV sales, and based on which to offer suggestions on designing and formulating matching policies when subsidies decrease, we utilized multiple linear regression method to analyze electric vehicle (EV) sales with incentive measures and socio-demographic data of 41 pilot cities for year 2013-2014. The result shows that chargers' density, license fee exemption, no driving restriction, and give priority to charging infrastructure construction lands are the four most important factors, which could be continued and strengthened in next few years to keep EV market still present a perfect performance.

Policy entrepreneurs are theorized as actors centrally responsible for either creating an opportunity or capitalizing on an opportunity to pair a public problem with a policy solution. A survey instrument solicited directly the participation of the 200 most populous municipalities within the United States. Using a variety of analytical tools (and merged data sources) a model of municipal transportation policy change is developed that contributes an important perspective to the existing paradigm of policy process theory. Neither individual policy entrepreneurs nor their role or qualities were not significant effectors of change, despite being regularly present. However, where networks of supportive actors (including strong champions/policy entrepreneurs) were present they played a critical role in making projects happen and at larger scales. This finding puts additional emphasis moving forward on the collaborative nature of municipal policy change. Advocates and planners may be more successful by being attuned to these networks and political contexts and taking advantage of open windows of engagement, or by 'manually' opening these windows. Lastly, city population was also associated with implementation, suggesting underlying factors to be explored in the future. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We exploit a natural experiment of the phased implementation of a bike sharing system to different areas of New York City. This allows us to use a difference-in-differences identification strategy. We divide bus routes into control and treatment groups based on if they are located in areas that received bikesharing infrastructure or not. We find a significant decrease in bus ridership on treated routes compared to control routes that coincides with the implementation of the bikesharing system in New York City. The results from our preferred model indicate that every thousand bikesharing docks along a bus route is associated with a 2.42% fall in daily unlinked bus trips on routes in Manhattan and Brooklyn. A second model that also controls for the expansion of bike lanes during this time suggests that the decrease in bus ridership attributable to bikesharing infrastructure alone may be smaller (a 1.69% fall in daily unlinked bus trips). Although the magnitude of the reduction is a small proportion of total bus trips, these findings indicate that either a large proportion of overall bikeshare members are substituting bikesharing for bus trips or that bikesharing may have impacted the travel behavior of non-members, such as private bicyclists. Understanding how bikesharing and public transit systems are interrelated is vital for planning a mutually reinforcing sustainable transport network. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Spain, Italy and Greece, the three main producer countries in Europe, account for 65% of the total world production. The production structure of olive farms in these countries is mainly characterized by traditional small-scale management. In addition to a small size, these farms also have a highly fragmented structure, typically made of several scattered parcels. The fragmented structure hampers farm competitiveness by raising production costs. This leads to a progressive exclusion of these farms from international markets and eventually to land abandonment. Here, we quantify the inefficiency due to parcel fragmentation, in particular losses due to the border effect, and we propose farmers' cooperation as a measure to reduce such losses. The results indicate significantly lower efficiency due to parcel fragmentation. Currently, farmers are managing around 14.4% of olive orchards inefficiently relative to a comparable. situation without fragmentation. The results call for specific agricultural policies that foster cooperation among farmers in order to reduce parcel fragmentation and production costs.","[Colombo, Sergio] Ctr Camino Purchil, IFAPA, Dept Agr Econ, Camino Purchil S-N, Granada 18004, Spain; [Perujo Villanueva, Manuel] Parque Cient & Tecnol Geolit, Ctr Venta del Llano, IFAPA, Ctra Bailen Motril,Km 18,5, Jaen 23620, Spain",,"Colombo, S (通讯作者)，Ctr Camino Purchil, IFAPA, Dept Agr Econ, Camino Purchil S-N, Granada 18004, Spain.",Sergio.colombo@juntadeandalucia.es; Manuel.perujo@juntadeandalucia.es,"Colombo, Sergio/IXD-1645-2023; Colombo, Sergio/D-2143-2011","Colombo, Sergio/0000-0001-7307-9811","Andalusian Council of Economy Innovation, Science, and Employment (CEICE) [P11-AGR-7515]; Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness","Andalusian Council of Economy Innovation, Science, and Employment (CEICE); Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness(Spanish Government)","This research was financed by project P11-AGR-7515 funded by Andalusian Council of Economy Innovation, Science, and Employment (CEICE) and the Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness.",,34,11,11,1,9,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,JUN,2017,16.0,2,,,,,2,10,,,,,,9,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,FA2GI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405258400001,0

This paper studies the incentives for trust funds from the perspective of multilateral agencies, notably the World Bank. A theoretically intriguing type of funds are so-called pass-on funds, in which one unit hosts the fund, then passes on its resources to another type of unit for implementation. Each unit has different preferences for the specific types of activities to be supported by the fund. Interviews with World Bank staff and complementary documents demonstrate the rationale for pass-on funds and the associated division of labor between fundraising network units and implementing regional units. While pass-on funds reflect an efficient division of labor between functionally specialized units, they increase the misalignment between sector-specific global priorities and country-specific needs. Organizational reform drove the sudden explosion of pass-on funds around the millennium turn, facilitated by growing availability of donor monies for specific sectors and by lenient internal regulation. Organizational reform undermined budget autonomy of sector units, causing those units to seek new funds in their areas of expertise. A number of reform features also reduced administrative budgets of country units, increasing their demand for pass-on funding grants. The results contribute to the emerging literature on earmarked funding and highlight the need to consider international organizations as heterogeneous actors.","[Reinsberg, Bernhard] Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Reinsberg, Bernhard] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England",University of Zurich; University of Cambridge,"Reinsberg, B (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.;Reinsberg, B (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England.",br385@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,83,14,14,1,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

As an account that reflects the uncertainty of the age, the narrative offers insights into current discussions concerning the contemporary nature and experience of work generally. More specifically it tells of a loss of confidence and status of technical professionals as they are methodically undermined by the confident assertion of a 'shareholder value' rhetoric. The suggestion is made that the application of commercial-professional rationality to the outsourcing of IT operations may underestimate the commercial risks associated with the loss of embodied technical knowledge gained across time as IT systems evolve to become complex constructions.","[Trusson, Clive] Loughborough Univ Technol, Sch Business & Economics, Human Resource Management & Org Behav, Loughborough, Leics, England; [Woods, Frankie] IT Profess, Loughborough, Leics, England",Loughborough University,"Trusson, C (通讯作者)，Loughborough Univ Technol, Sch Business & Econ, Epinal Way, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",c.r.trusson@lboro.ac.uk,,"Trusson, Clive/0000-0001-7334-1824",,,,,35,8,13,1,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

As a key element of branding, they can inform consumers about the quality and content of goods and services. Yet, researchers are largely unable to conduct rigorous empirical analysis of TMs in the global economy because TM data and economic data are organised differently and cannot be analysed jointly at the industry or sector level. We propose an algorithmic links with probabilities' (ALP) approach to match TM data to economic data and enable joint analysis with these data. Specifically, we construct a NICE class-level concordance that maps TM data into trade and industry categories forward and backward. This concordance allows researchers to analyse differences in TM usage across both economic and TM sectors. We apply this ALP concordance for TMs to characterise patterns in TM registrations across countries and industries and to investigate some key determinants of international technology flows by comparing bilateral TM registrations and bilateral patent grants. We find that international patenting and TM flows are jointly determined by trade-related influences with significant differences in intellectual property usage across industry sectors and income levels.","[Zolas, Nikolas] US Bur Census, Ctr Econ Studies, Washington, DC 20233 USA; [Lybbert, Travis J.] Univ Calif Davis, Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Bhattacharyya, Prantik] Univ Calif Davis, Comp Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Zolas, N (通讯作者)，US Bur Census, Ctr Econ Studies, Washington, DC 20233 USA.",,,,WIPO,WIPO,"Any opinions and conclusions expressed herein are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of the US Census Bureau.

We also document considerable variation in provisioning strategies among slave trading nations and across main regions of slave embarkation.

This paper presents greenhouse gas emission rates that assist forecasting and modelling greenhouse gas emissions from light vehicles, i.e. private passenger vehicles and light commercial vehicles under realistic traffic conditions. It develops confidence intervals for market shares by categories for fuel or energy efficiency on the Australian market for new light vehicles for the period 2016-2030. The model estimates realistic market scenarios by simulating likely variations of capital and running costs of alternatives for car buyers and by considering buyers' willingness-to-pay for fuel/energy efficiency. The results suggest that market forces will be insufficient to promote battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in Australia. On average the widths of the 95% confidence intervals for greenhouse emission rates are about 10-15% of the magnitudes of the emission rates, so that analysts can forecast transport greenhouse gas emissions with a reasonable level of certainty. The study suggests that policy interventions to accelerate the uptake of low or zero emitting vehicles may be required. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Iankov, Ivan; Taylor, Michael A.

Moreover, traditional utilitarian and cue-taking mechanisms should also impact Arab EU attitudes. We empirically test our argument using data from the third wave of the Arab Barometer (AB).

The ARDL bounds testing approach has an advantage that it can be used when I (0) and I (1) variables are mixed.

The household compensation package stimulates domestic tourism considerably but discourages inbound tourism further by contributing to a significant appreciation of the Australian dollar.","[Meng, Sam] Univ New England, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia; [Tien Pham] Griffith Univ, Nathan, Qld, Australia",University of New England; Griffith University,"Meng, S (通讯作者)，Univ New England, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia.",xmeng4@une.edu.au,,,,,,,33,25,25,1,49,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

These estimates should contribute to a better debate on how to manage efficiently motor vehicles externalities by means of both (pigouvian) tax instruments, public transport subsidies and regulation. We also offer a comparison of our results with those reported in the literature. At peak times, marginal external costs per kilometer for petrol cars, diesel cars and buses are estimated at USD 0.51, USD 0.53 and USD 1.80 respectively. When these values are converted to passenger-kilometer, petrol cars, diesel cars and buses impose a marginal external cost of USD 0.41, USD 0.42 and USD 0.04 respectively. At off-peak times, all these values are reduced as congestion decreases significantly. The marginal external cost for petrol cars, diesel cars and buses are USD 0.15, USD 0.16 and USD 0.78 respectively. Differences in marginal external costs per passenger-kilometer between cars and buses shrink as these costs fall to USD 0.12, USD 0.13 and USD 0.05 for petrol car, diesel car and bus respectively.

These applications can be used for external communication and internal knowledge management. Firms can potentially increase their productivity by optimising customer relationship management, marketing, market research and project management. On the other hand, the use of social media might lead to shirking among employees and might be, in general, very time-consuming preventing employees from managing their normal workload. This might lead to a decrease of labour productivity. This paper analyses the relationship between social media applications and labour productivity using firm-level data of 907 German manufacturing and service firms. The analysis is based on a Cobb-Douglas production function. The results reveal that social media might be related to labour productivity in an negative way which points towards a suboptimal use of social media.","[Sarbu, Miruna] Tech Univ Kaiserslautern, Gottlieb Daimler Str,Bldg 42, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany",University of Kaiserslautern,"Sarbu, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kaiserslautern, Gottlieb Daimler Str,Bldg 42, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany.",miruna.sarbu@wiwi.uni-kl.de,"Sarbu, Miruna/ADZ-0273-2022","Sarbu, Miruna/0000-0002-6585-9129",,,,,40,7,7,1,40,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Some commentators see little prospect of ULRs contributing to advancing either workplace learning or union organization due to the constraints of neo-liberal state policy. An opposing view emphasizes union agency in developing a collective approach to learning and extended joint regulation through a process of critical engagement. This article presents analysis of data from the 2009 National Survey of ULRs, which finds a positive relationship between ULR activity and its impact in enhancing training outcomes, increasing union membership and the joint regulation of workplace learning. This supports arguments that agency of ULRs is not inevitably suppressed by the structural limitations of union learning.","[Saundry, Richard] Plymouth Univ, Plymouth Grad Sch Management, HRM & Employment Relat, Plymouth, Devon, England; [Antcliff, Valerie] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Ctr Enterprise, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Hollinrake, Alison] Univ Cent Lancashire, Employee Dev, Preston, Lancs, England; [Hollinrake, Alison] Univ Cent Lancashire, Inst Res Org Work & Employment, Preston, Lancs, England",University of Plymouth; Manchester Metropolitan University; University of Central Lancashire; University of Central Lancashire,"Saundry, R (通讯作者)，Plymouth Univ, Plymouth Grad Management Sch, Mast House, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England.",Richard.Saundry@plymouth.ac.uk,,,,,,,40,1,1,0,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

In particular, it asks whether exporting firms hire more engineers relative to blue-collar workers than nonexporting firms. In a stylized partial-equilibrium model, firms produce goods of varying quality and exporters tend to produce higher quality goods, which are intensive in engineers relative to blue-collar workers. Firms are heterogeneous and more productive firms become exporters and have a higher demand for engineers. The article provides causal evidence in support of these theories using the Chilean Encuesta Nacional Industrial Anual (ENIA), an annual census of manufacturing firms. The results from an instrumental variable estimator suggest that Chilean exporters indeed utilize a higher share of engineers over blue-collar workers.","[Brambilla, Irene; Porto, Guido] Univ Nacl La Plata, Dept Econ, Calle 6 E 47 & 48, RA-1900 La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Lederman, Daniel] World Bank, LCRCE, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",National University of La Plata; The World Bank,"Brambilla, I (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl La Plata, Dept Econ, Calle 6 E 47 & 48, RA-1900 La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina.",irene.brambilla@econo.unlp.edu; dlederman@worldbank.org; guido.porto@depeco.econo.unlp.edu.ar,,,R4D program on Global Issues - Swiss National Science Foundation; Swiss Development Cooperation,R4D program on Global Issues - Swiss National Science Foundation; Swiss Development Cooperation,"We thank M.

We examine the effect of shaming, defined as targeted negative attention by human rights international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs), on donor decisions about how to deliver bilateral aid. We argue that INGO shaming of recipient countries leads donor governments, on average, to bypass the recipient government in favor of non-state aid delivery channels, including international and local NGOs and international organizations (IOs). However, we expect this relationship to be conditional on a donor country's position in the international system. Minor power countries have limited influence in global affairs and are therefore more able to centrally promote human rights in their foreign policy. Major power countries, on the other hand, shape world politics and often confront realpolitik concerns that may require government-to-government aid relations in the presence of INGO shaming. We thus expect aid officials of minor donor countries to be more likely to condition aid delivery decisions on human rights shaming than their counterparts of major donor countries. Using compositional data analysis, we test our argument using originally collected data on human rights shaming events and an originally constructed measure of bilateral aid delivery in a time-series cross-sectional framework from 2004 to 2010. We find support for our hypotheses: On average, OECD donor governments increase the proportion of bypass when INGOs shame the recipient government. When differentiating between donor types we find that this finding holds for minor but not for major powers. These results add to both our understanding of the influences of aid allocation decision-making and our understanding of the role of INGOs on foreign-policy.","[Dietrich, Simone] Univ Essex, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester, Essex, England; [Murdie, Amanda] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Essex; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Dietrich, S (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester, Essex, England.",dietrich.simone@gmail.com; murdiea@missouri.edu,"Murdie, Amanda/GQB-5152-2022","Murdie, Amanda/0000-0002-6459-0594; Dietrich, Simone/0000-0002-7104-3302",,,,,57,55,66,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

DD1 suffers from the following drawback: when each player demands approximately the entire dollar, then if the least greedy player is unique, then this player obtains approximately the entire dollar even if he is only slightly less greedy than the other players. I introduce a parametrized family of 2-person DD games, whose endpoints (the games that correspond to the extreme points of the parameter space) are (1) a variant of DD1, and (2) a game that completely overcomes the greediness-related problem. I also study an n-person generalization of this family. Finally, I show that the modeling choice between discrete and continuous bids may have far-reaching implications in DD games.","[Rachmilevitch, Shiran] Univ Haifa, Dept Econ, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel",University of Haifa,"Rachmilevitch, S (通讯作者)，Univ Haifa, Dept Econ, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.",shiranrach@econ.haifa.ac.il,,,,,,,5,6,7,0,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,MAR,2017,82.0,3,,,,,341,351,,10.1007/s11238-016-9568-6,0.0,,,11,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,EQ3OD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397981500003,0

Productivity and inflation innovations are drawn from generalized extreme value distributions. The model is solved using a third-order perturbation and estimated by the simulated method of moments. Results show that the data reject the hypothesis that innovations are drawn from normal distributions and favor instead the alternative that they are drawn from asymmetric distributions. Estimates indicate that skewness risk accounts for 12% of the risk premia and reduces bond yields by approximately 55 basis points. For a bond that pays 1 dollar at maturity, the adjustment factor associated with skewness risk ranges from 0.15 cents for a 3-month bond to 2.05 cents for a 5-year bond.

However, allowing for period-specific heterogeneous slopes, we find that a negative relationship between wages and regional unemployment emerged in the period 2010Q2-2011Q4 which however was short-lived.

A principle concern in estimation is the presence of market-level unobserved heterogeneity that may be correlated with changes in single male quality, measured as earning potential. To address this concern, we employ a differencing strategy that normalizes the exercise behaviors of single women to those of their married counterparts. Our main results suggest that when potential mate quality in a marriage market decreases, single black women invest less in healthy body weight. For example, we find that a 10 percentage point increase in the proportion of low quality single black males leads to a 5-10% decrease in vigorous exercise taken by single black females. Results for single white women are qualitatively similar, but not consistent across specifications. These results highlight the relationship between male and female human capital acquisition that is driven by participation in the marriage market. Our results suggest that programs designed to improve the economic prospects of single males may yield positive externalities in the form of improved health behaviors, such as more exercise, particularly for single black females.

HFT involves automated algorithmic trading of financial instruments where the objective is to reduce the time scale between the initiation and execution of trades to microseconds (or even nanoseconds) so as to reap competitive advantage. After outlining the contours of a HFT world, the presentation goes on to discuss some of its important consequences and implications. Several matters are discussed in this context: market manipulation, hacking, index construction and violence. Of particular significance for the notion of financial security is the issue of time as embodied in algorithmic trading. In turn this raises concerns over the regulation and management of this new field of financial innovation and trading activity.","[Thompson, Grahame F.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Polit Sci, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Thompson, Grahame F.] Open Univ, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England",University of Copenhagen; Open University - UK,"Thompson, GF (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Polit Sci, Copenhagen, Denmark.;Thompson, GF (通讯作者)，Open Univ, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England.",g.f.thompson@open.ac.uk,,,,,,,50,17,18,0,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

To this end, this study proposes a new simulation-based fleet evolution framework to forecast Americans' long-term (year 2015-2045) adoption levels of CAV technologies under eight different scenarios based on 5% and 10% annual drops in technology prices; 0%, 5%, and 10% annual increments in Americans' willingness to pay (WTP); and changes in government regulations (e.g., mandatory adoption of connectivity on new vehicles). This simulation was calibrated with data obtained from a survey of 2167 Americans, regarding their preferences for CAV technologies (e.g., WTP) and their household's annual vehicle transaction decisions. Long-term fleet evolution suggests that the privately held light-duty-vehicle fleet will have 24.8% Level 4 AV penetration by 2045 if one assumes an annual 5% price drop and constant WTP values (from 2015 forward). This share jumps to 87.2% if one uses a 10% annual rate of decline in prices and a 10% annual rise in WTP values. Overall, simulations suggest that, without a rise in most people's WTP, or policies that promote or require technologies, or unusually rapid reductions in technology costs, it is unlikely that the U.S. light duty vehicle fleet's technology mix will be anywhere near homogeneous by the year 2045.

We provide evidence that SHGs, composed of women only, undertake collective actions for the provision of public goods within village communities. Using a theoretical model, we show that an elected official, whose aim is to maximize re-election chances, exerts higher effort in providing public goods when private citizens undertake collective action and coordinate their voluntary contributions towards the same goods. This effect occurs although government and private contributions are assumed to be substitutes in the technology of providing public goods. Using first-hand data on SHGs in India, we test the prediction of the model and show that, in response to collective action by SHGs, local authorities tackle a larger variety of public issues, and are more likely to tackle issues of interest to SHGs. Our findings highlight how the social behavior of SHGs can influence the governance of rural Indian communities.","[Casini, Paolo] Katholieke Univ Leuven, LICOS Ctr Inst & Econ Performance, Leuven, Belgium; [Casini, Paolo] European Commiss, DG Internal Market Ind Entrepreneurship & SMEs, Geneva, Switzerland; [Vandewalle, Lore] Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Geneva, Switzerland; [Vandewalle, Lore] Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway; [Wahhaj, Zaki] Univ Kent, Canterbury, Kent, England",KU Leuven; University of Oslo; University of Kent,"Vandewalle, L (通讯作者)，Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Geneva, Switzerland.;Vandewalle, L (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway.",paolo.casini@kuleuven.be; lore.vandewalle@graduateinstitute.ch; Z.Wahhaj@kent.ac.uk,,"Vandewalle, Lore/0000-0002-2277-2621",Centre de Recherche en Economie du Developpement (CRED) at the University of Namur; Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique (FNRS) in Belgium; KU Leuven; European Research Council [AdG-230290-SSD]; European Commission under its Seventh Framework Programme [214705 PITN-GA-2008-214705],Centre de Recherche en Economie du Developpement (CRED) at the University of Namur; Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique (FNRS) in Belgium(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS); KU Leuven(KU Leuven); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); European Commission under its Seventh Framework Programme(European Union (EU)),"This work was supported by Centre de Recherche en Economie du Developpement (CRED) at the University of Namur; Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique (FNRS) in Belgium; KU Leuven; and the European Research Council [AdG-230290-SSD].

It argues that Proudhon's dual understanding of both terms was influenced by his reflections on corporate form. Prior to 1848, Proudhon imagined a progressive association which would at once incarnate the mutualist transformation of economic life, be more than a mere cooperative association, and gradually expand in scope and size to take over the national and, eventually, the international economy. During the Second Empire, Proudhon's thinking about business organisation evolved: increasingly he advocated corporate decentralization and no longer focused on economic expansion along mutualist lines.","[Castleton, Edward] Univ Franche Comte, Besancon, France",Universite de Franche-Comte,"Castleton, E (通讯作者)，Univ Franche Comte, Besancon, France.",edward.castleton@univ-fcomte.fr,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,11,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

With the huge client portfolios nowadays, not only the accuracy of liability estimates is of great importance but also the time within which the results are calculated. Especially in the case of estimates of life insurance liability, the computing time can be very high, because the estimation is based on a projection of future cash flow of each contract separately. Therefore, methods to reduce computation time while as do not significantly decrease accuracy are welcomed by many actuaries. Cluster analysis can be applied for this purpose. Basic idea is to split contracts into clusters and represent all contracts within the cluster by a specific contract, so called model point. Projection is only calculated for these model points and weights are assigned to reflect the number of contracts of the cluster. The main contribution of this paper consists in the analysis of clustering variables in the case of approximate life insurance liability model.","[Fojtik, Jan; Prochazka, Jiri; Zimmermann, Pavel; Mackova, Simona; Svehlakova, Marketa] Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Stat & Probabil Calculus, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 3, Czech Republic",,"Fojtík, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Stat & Probabil Calculus, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 3, Czech Republic.",xfojj00@vse.cz; xproj16@vse.cz; zimmerp@vse.cz; xsvem35@vse.cz; simona.mackova@vse.cz,,,grant scheme METHODS FOR FAST ESTIMATION OF LIFE INSURANCE LIABILITIES WITH RESPECT TO DIFFERENT INVESTMENT STRATEGIES [IG410017],grant scheme METHODS FOR FAST ESTIMATION OF LIFE INSURANCE LIABILITIES WITH RESPECT TO DIFFERENT INVESTMENT STRATEGIES,The support of the grant scheme METHODS FOR FAST ESTIMATION OF LIFE INSURANCE LIABILITIES WITH RESPECT TO DIFFERENT INVESTMENT STRATEGIES IG410017 is gladly acknowledged.,,8,1,1,0,0,WYDAWNICTWO UNIW EKONOMICZNEGO & WROCLAWIU,WROCLAW,"UL KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WROCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",2453-9902,,978-83-7695-693-0,APPLI MATH STAT ECON,Applications of Mathematics and Statistics in Economics Conference Proceedings,,2017,,,,,,,145,153,,10.15611/amse.2017.20.11,0.0,,,9,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BP1SD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540714200011,0

Starting from the first two quantitative analyses of the migration of young American economists to Germany for post-graduate training, made by Henry Walcott Farnam and by Jack Myles in, respectively, 1908 and 1956, the article presents for the first time a complete transcription of both Farnam's archival material and Myles's data. Specifically, the artide proposes a survey of the Farnam papers from the various perspectives that, for contemporary historiography, represent the signs of the development and institutionalization of American economics along German lines. The particular focus of the essay concerns the extent and nature of the gap between our image today of the German influence on early twentieth-century American economics and the image that prevailed of that influence among early twentieth-century American economists.","[Foresti, Tiziana] Bocconi Univ, Milan Baffi Carefin Ctr Appl Res Int Markets, Banking, Finance & Regulat, Milan, Italy",Bocconi University,"Foresti, T (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Milan Baffi Carefin Ctr Appl Res Int Markets, Banking, Finance & Regulat, Milan, Italy.",tiziana.foresti@unibocconi.it,,,,,,,43,0,0,0,2,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

There is significant disagreement, however, over how to interpret SOEs' role. Are they instruments of Chinese statecraft, being directed purposefully from Beijing as part of a grand strategy'? Or are they relatively autonomous, profit-maximising businesses, their free-wheeling behaviour often undermining Chinese foreign policy? Finding that there is evidence for both theses, we provide a framework to explain this. We propose theorising party-state/SOEs relations using the concepts of state transformation and regulatory statehood. We show that the Chinese state's fragmentation, decentralisation and internationalisation since the late 1970s has substantially increased SOE autonomy and weakened but also transformed the executive's control, reconfiguring it towards a regulatory mode of governance. Party-state/SOEs relations are thus characterised not by direct command and control but weak oversight and ongoing struggles within the party-state. We illustrate this using a case study of China Power Investment Corporation and its Myitsone hydropower dam project in Myanmar. Here, a central SOE clearly defied and subverted central regulations, profoundly damaging Sino-Myanmar state-to-state relations. Party-state authorities are now struggling to rein in this and other central SOEs.","[Jones, Lee] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Polit & Int Relat, London, England; [Zou, Yizheng] Shenzhen Univ, Ctr Chinas Overseas Interests, Nanhai Ave 3688, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China",University of London; Queen Mary University London; Shenzhen University,"Zou, YZ (通讯作者)，Shenzhen Univ, Ctr Chinas Overseas Interests, Nanhai Ave 3688, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China.",zouyz@szu.edu.cn,,,Australian Research Council [DP1701102647]; Shenzhen University [16QNFC18]; China National Social Science Fund [15@ZH009]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I010157/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/I010157/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Shenzhen University; China National Social Science Fund; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by Australian Research Council [grant number DP1701102647]; Shenzhen University [grant number 16QNFC18]; China National Social Science Fund [grant number 15@ZH009].,,97,92,97,6,86,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

In this work, we have proposed conceptual framework for evaluating the efficiency in processes of public administration. Methodology of the concept is made using the two-step DEA approach. First, individual efficiencies need to be computed. In step two, impact of explanatory variables proposed in conceptual framework is to be determined. This will be done using the truncated regression model. The most crucial thing is selection of the variables, since there is lack of research studies in this field.

Identifying the core problem is easy, but the solution is painfitl. Governments and central banks do not have the will to take the necessary steps to fix the core problem, which is increasing the mountain of debt in the world. The cure is to reduce the level of debt. The next financial crisis could put too much stress on our current system and, thus, governments, economists and central banks will need to develop a new financial system, as well as address the issues of the current one such as debt, derivatives, big banks, money creation and a lack of ethics.

This article tries to highlight the present status of our current financial system, and gives a review of possible alternatives such as bringing back the gold standard, implementing the Chicago plan, the IMF's special drawing rights (SDRs) as the world's reserve currency, Islamic finance, digital cutocurrency, and Clean State.","[Ladasic, Ines Karagianni] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Pula, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Ladasic, IK (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Pula, Croatia.",ines.ladasic@gmail.com,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,2,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

There is a positive relationship between equity blockholders and firm performance, in which firm size plays a negative moderator role in the relationship between equity blockholders and firm performance. This also shows that for firms in the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry in China, ownership concentration with equity blockholders, i.e. ownership controlled by only a small number of large shareholders, will improve firm performance. We also conclude, however, firms of large size should be more careful in designing its ownership structure and they are advised to keep balance between ownership concentration and equity blockholders so as to reduce the negative moderator role played by firm size.","[Li, Yongzhuang; Zhang, Dehuan] CUFE Asset Management Co Ltd, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jia, Qiuhui] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Business, Beijing, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Li, YZ (通讯作者)，CUFE Asset Management Co Ltd, Beijing, Peoples R China.",liyongzhuang507@163.com,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,11,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-423-1,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,33.0,,,,,,814,826,,,,,,13,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6HQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426695800111,0

From Marxist to institutionalist to liberal analyses, the US is said to exhibits a governance model in which state structures are minimally intrusive to capitalist civil society. There is a need for political economy that re-positions the US state as more than just a willing facilitator, lender-of-last-resort or minimal regulator of capitalist dynamics. This paper argues that adaptive accumulation' has normalised in the US context, wherein capital actively allies itself with public state objectives (and mechanisms) to seek new or enhanced profit streams, by transforming or rerouting public revenues, such that they afford private accumulation. The robust entry of capital in areas such as health, education and incarceration are highly notable, inasmuch as they harness public objectives for private but not-so-competitive ends. By shedding light on such domains, the paper contributes to our understanding of capital and its ongoing efforts to stay ahead of investment crises by actively shaping its operative environment - in this case, maintaining both the credibility and regularity of publicly inspired (and often financed) revenue streams while, ultimately, transforming their utilisation and purpose.","[Loeppky, Rodney] York Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada",York University - Canada,"Loeppky, R (通讯作者)，York Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada.",rloeppky@yorku.ca,,"Loeppky, Rodney/0000-0003-2757-375X",,,,,54,0,0,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Moreover, it has to be stated that the legal and governmental arrangements as well as informal institutions underpinning an economy influence corporate strategies, thus profoundly influence the operation and performance of businesses. The methodology in this paper consists of comparing statistical data for the Balkan countries (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania, Serbia, FYROM and Slovenia). The general conclusion drawn in this paper is that Western businesses entering countries with lower degree of institutional development face higher transaction costs such as bribery than in countries with higher degree of institutional development.

For that, the authors use regression and correlation analysis; methods of comparative, structural, and problem analysis; and methods of statistical analysis. The article offers classification of countries according to the quality of infrastructural provision of entrepreneurial activities with distinguishing the categories of countries with leading, moderate, and lagged business infrastructure, determines the role of infrastructure for development of entrepreneurship, and determines and analyzes global infrastructural disproportions of entrepreneurial activities. As a result of the research, the authors made a conclusion that there is a strong direct dependence between the level of development of entrepreneurship and the level of corresponding infrastructural provision. Infrastructure plays an important role in development of entrepreneurship, as it determines conditions of functioning of business structures and provides them with necessary resources. Existence of infrastructural disproportions violates the actions of mechanism of international division of labor and movement of international flows of production factors and final products. Under these conditions, the existing potential of maximization of global economy effectiveness cannot be fully realized. Global enterprises that are organized in the most rational way and allow reducing cyclic character of development of global economy require the leveling of international infrastructure, which is stimulated by the offered infrastructural strategy of global entrepreneurship crisis management.","[Morozova, Irina A.] Volgograd State Tech Univ, Volgograd, Russia; [Litvinova, Tatiana N.] Volgograd State Agrarian Univ, Volgograd, Russia; [Boris, Olga A.] North Caucasus Fed Univ, Stavropol, Russia; [Bogdanov, Vladimir V.; Makarenko, Sergei N.] Southern Fed Univ SFedU, Rostov Na Donu, Russia",Volgograd State Technical University; Volgograd State Agrarian University; North Caucasus Federal University; Southern Federal University,"Litvinova, TN (通讯作者)，Volgograd State Agrarian Univ, Volgograd, Russia.",morozovaira@list.ru; litvinova_t_n@mail.ru; oboris@ncfu.ru; wbogdanov@gmail.com; snmakarenko@sfedu.ru,"Boris, Olga A/S-7217-2016; Makarenko, Sergei/V-2369-2018; Bogdanov, Vladimir/W-1691-2018","Makarenko, Sergei/0000-0002-4081-7141; Bogdanov, Vladimir/0000-0002-9062-4647; Litvinova, Tatiana/0000-0003-3101-2621; Boris, Olga/0000-0002-6245-9250",,,,,18,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1431-1933,,978-3-319-60696-5; 978-3-319-60695-8,CONTRIB ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,329,334,,10.1007/978-3-319-60696-5_42,0.0,,,6,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ5OF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426114200042,0

The major reform of local self-government in Slovenia was implemented in 1994, when the transformation of existing 58 communal municipalities was envisaged. From 1995 onwards, the number of municipalities increased to the current number of 212 municipalities. Consequently, the necessity to implement structural reforms of local self-government in Slovenia has been stressed. The arguments favoring municipal amalgamations stressed that country has become too fragmented and municipal amalgamation would enable the reduction of (administrative) costs, and increase efficiency as well as quality of services provided, indicating that technical aspects of local government operation are targeted. Following, technical efficiency of Slovenian municipalities is estimated with the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method, in order to determine if (and which) municipalities are experiencing increasing returns to scale (i.e., scale economies). The results indicate that there is important scale efficiency component, and predominantly very small municipalities are experiencing economies of scale, but their number is relatively low. Therefore, one of the classical arguments for municipal amalgamation, achieving economies of scale, can only be applied at a limited scale. This does not imply that more extensive amalgamation is not warranted, but it demands that other arguments justifying municipal amalgamation should be presented.","[Pevcin, Primoz] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Adm, Gosarjeva 5, SL-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Pevcin, P (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Adm, Gosarjeva 5, SL-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.",primoz.pevcin@fu.uni-lj.si,,,,,,,14,2,2,0,6,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2017,,,,,,,379,384,,10.18502/kss.v1i2.673,0.0,,,6,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BJ1DU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417433200030,0

This issue has gained importance in the last decade because the market has changed. A significance break has been detected which impacts the nature of the nexus between certain variables. The correlation between the tax revenues and the stock market has increased noticeably, encouraging the revision of the current approach to fiscal policy. This study examines relationship between three variables, namely real GDP, federal government current tax receipts and the stock market represented by the Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index. Quarterly data from 1971 to 2015 are used, divided into two subsets in the year 2000, because there is an obvious change in trend and volatility of the variables. The analysis uses ADF and KPSS unit root tests to find the order of the integration of the data. Subsequent analysis applies Johansen cointegration test, vector error correction model, Granger causality tests and variance decomposition analysis. The results demonstrate that the selected variables are cointegrated, and performance of the stock market significantly increases its influence on government tax revenues in the second period. The findings of this paper are significant for policy makers. Understanding how stock market development and economic growth influence tax revenues and vice versa is crucial for the efficient implementation of successful fiscal policy. Investors in the economy of the United States will be also able to benefit from these results which will help them to understand economic conditions and improve their investment decisions.","[Plihal, Tomas; Urbanovsky, Tomas] Masaryk Univ, Dept Finance, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 507-41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Plíhal, T (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Dept Finance, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 507-41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",370621@mail.muni.cz,"Plíhal, Tomáš/GLU-6154-2022","Plíhal, Tomáš/0000-0002-2578-488X",Masaryk University [MUNI/A/1025/2015],Masaryk University,The support of the Masaryk University internal grant MUNI/A/1025/2015 is gratefully acknowledged.,,18,0,0,0,1,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2017,,,,,,,333,+,,10.18502/kss.v1i2.667,0.0,,,11,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BJ1DU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417433200025,0

The main objective of the research article is to define and to analyze the foreign investment as a tool of regional development. The relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI) and economic growth is the subject of longstanding debates. These foreign investments represent one of the main factors for economic development that can have positive implications for employment and growth in gross domestic product by creating jobs, boosting productivity and competitiveness, industrial specialization, transfer of sophisticated technology and providing fast access to the global market. The basic problem of the regional development is the decreasing of the differences which are considered as negative between the regions and States, also called disparities that are occurring. But, the target would be the maintenance of the strong sites in those regions, especially in the area of the regional diversity existence. To ensure the effective development, the important point derives from the analysis of the factors influencing the increase of the regional competitiveness and the realization of the targeted activities and projects with objective to decrease disparities, to harmonize development, to ensure regional diversities.","[Rentkova, Katarina; Panevski, Darko] Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Bratislava, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Rentkova, K (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Bratislava, Slovakia.",katarina.rentkova@fm.uniba.sk; darko.panevski@st.fm.uniba.sk,,,,,,,22,7,7,0,6,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,326,334,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8SX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428763000033,0

But the contribution of human capital is gradually improved in the process of continuous development and might exceed the contribution of material capital in the near future, which indicates enhancing the local human capital stock would enhance the sustainable development of the economy.","[Song Yanan] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Macau, Peoples R China",Macau University of Science & Technology,"Song, YN (通讯作者)，Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Macau, Peoples R China.",ynsong@must.edu.mo,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,4,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-402-6,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2017,106.0,,,,,,129,132,,,,,,4,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BI9GR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416081200030,0

To overcome this limitation, this study uses empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and phase space reconstruction (PSR) to assist in the task of financial time series forecasting. In addition, we propose an approach that combines these two data preprocessing methods with extreme learning machine (ELM). The approach contains four steps as follows. (1) EMD is used to decompose the dynamics of the exchange rate time series into several components of intrinsic mode function (IMF) and one residual component. (2) The IMF and residual time series phase space is reconstructed to reveal its unseen dynamics according to the optimum time delay t and embedding dimension m. (3) The reconstructed time series datasets are divided into two datasets: training and testing, in which the training datasets are used to build ELM models. (4) A regression forecast model is set up for each IMF as well as the residual component by using ELM. The final prediction results are obtained by compositing the prediction values. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, four exchange rates are chosen as the forecasting targets. Compared with some existing state-of-the-art models, the proposed approach yields superior results. Academically, we demonstrated the validity and superiority of the proposed approach that integrates EMD, PSR, and ELM. Corporations or individuals can apply the results of this study to acquire accurate exchange rate information and reduce exchange rate expenses.","[Yang, Heng-Li; Lin, Han-Chou] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Management Informat Syst, Taipei, Taiwan",National Chengchi University,"Yang, HL (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Management Informat Syst, Taipei, Taiwan.",yanh@nccu.edu.tw; actuallife@hotmail.com,"Yang, Heng-Li/IQW-5319-2023",,,,,,45,16,17,0,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Unfortunately, this view has never been stated explicitly by Wagner and the lack of a precise mathematical formulation led researchers to use various and sometimes incomparable specifications. Moreover, in previous empirical studies state activity was almost always replaced by public spending, and hence Wagner's Law was effectively narrowed down to the Law of Increasing State Spending. This paper is an attempt to restore Wagner's Law. Contrary to previous studies, it examines whether Wagner's Law in its original form held in Australia in the 1901-2008 period by studying the relationship between real per capita income and a composite variable of state activity that takes both financial and legislative activities of the federal government into account. Although this composite variable still falls short of capturing all levels and sorts of state or government activities, it is a far more comprehensive measure than any of its components used individually in earlier studies. The results based on this composite measure provide no empirical evidence in favour of Wagner's Law in Australia.","[Konya, Laszlo] RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Abdullaev, Bekzod] RMIT Univ, Australian APEC Study Ctr, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Kónya, L (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",lkonya@outlook.com; bekzod.abdullaev@rmit.edu.au,"Konya, Laszlo/C-3118-2008","Konya, Laszlo/0000-0001-5613-7258",,,,,40,6,6,0,3,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We compare two nonlinear regression estimation packages called 'NNS', Viole (NNS: nonlinear nonparametric statistics, 2016), and 'np', Hayfield and Racine (J Stat Softw 27(5): 1-32, 2008), with the help of a simulation using deterministic (DT) and stochastic (ST) regressor models. We find the respective coefficients of determination (R-2) are close for DT models, while finding an advantage to NNS in ST and large sample cases. Regression coefficients are sometimes regarded as approximations to partial derivatives, especially in social sciences. Then, NNS alone has the ability to compute a range of partials evaluated at points within the sample and also out-of-sample. Thus NNS can provide a viable alternative to kernel based nonparametric regressions without using bandwidths for smoothing.","[Vinod, Hrishikesh D.; Viole, Fred] 441 E Fordham Rd, Bronx, NY 10458 USA",,"Vinod, HD (通讯作者)，441 E Fordham Rd, Bronx, NY 10458 USA.",vinod@fordham.edu; fred.viole@gmail.com,", H.

This essay analyses one such spatial project, the idea of 'Greater Eurasia', which imagines a new geopolitical geometry centred on Sino-Russian cooperation. The 'Greater Eurasia' discourse provides a new role for Russia in international affairs but also makes far-reaching claims about the nature of the emerging, post-liberal world order. The essay concludes with an analysis of the main challenges to the 'Greater Eurasia' project.","[Lewis, David G.] Univ Exeter, Dept Polit, Amory Bldg, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England",University of Exeter,"Lewis, DG (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Dept Polit, Amory Bldg, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England.",d.lewis@exeter.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/J013056/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,104,32,35,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,NOV 26,2018,70.0,10,,,SI,,1612,1637,,10.1080/09668136.2018.1515348,0.0,,,26,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,HG0NV,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000454643300005,0
