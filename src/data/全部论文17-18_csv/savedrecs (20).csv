Mobilization and utilization of intellectual resources in enterprises create value, thus transforming and accelerating development of national economies towards the knowledge and innovation based economies. Due to these reasons, the most developed economies increase investments in education, information technologies and stimulate innovativeness. On the other hand, less developed countries do not have possibilities for significant investments in creating and employing national intellectual potential. This is reflected in their economic growth rates, as in the case of the Southeastern European (SEE) countries. In that regard, the paper investigates the impact of education, information technologies and innovations, as determinants of national intellectual capital development, on the economic growth in the SEE countries. The aim of this paper is to identify the contribution of the key intellectual capital determinants to the economic growth and development in the SEE countries and propose measures whose implementation lead to further development towards knowledge and innovation economies. The results of correlation analysis revealed positive and statistically significant correlation between GDP per capita and employed measures of national intellectual capital. The research has shown that increase in high-technology export, number of R&D researchers and mobile phone subscribers has a positive and significant impact on economic growth. The authors advise intensified cooperation between business community and institutes and universities to achieve synergetic effects in generating and utilising national intellectual potential.","[Stevanovic, Tatjana; Ivanovic-Dukic, Maja; Radenovic, Tamara; Radovic, Ognjen] Univ Nis, Fac Econ, Trg Kralja Aleksandra Ujedinitelja 11, Nish 18000, Serbia",University of Nis,"Stevanovic, T (通讯作者)，Univ Nis, Fac Econ, Trg Kralja Aleksandra Ujedinitelja 11, Nish 18000, Serbia.",tatjana.stevanovic@eknfak.ni.ac.rs; maja.ivanovic@eknfak.ni.ac.rs; tamara.radjenovic@eknfak.ni.ac.rs; ognjen.radovic@eknfak.ni.ac.rs,"Radjenovic, Tamara A/N-5520-2015","Radjenovic, Tamara A/0000-0003-1632-7772; Radovic, Ognjen/0000-0001-7428-565X",,,,,51,3,3,1,17,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

As soon as nowadays managers have high risk of contradiction in pairwise comparisons due to market dynamics and high level of uncertainty, the proposed evaluation model is based on the use of the consistency-driven linguistic methodology. The subject of the study is the influence of digitalization on customer preferences and development of Latvian insurance companies' strategies. The purpose of this work is to study the development of insurance company strategies based on the shift of the perception values of clients, employees and owners of insurance companies in the era of digital transformation. According to the research results digital transformation is showing shift of customer perception values: simple product gives a greater benefit to the fact that owner only has to enter minimum information, so it is recommended to use smart-functions provided by digital opportunities to meet consumer's expectations.

In the United Nations' current approach, the Human Development Index (HDI) is used for the estimation of the differences existing among different countries. Thus, human capital is in the end measured by health, education and the quality of standard of living. However, health is not measured adequately by HDI: it was found in previous studies that life expectancy ( LE) measures cannot not accurately represent the health of the population because as LE increases the same may happen with the healthy years lost due to diseases and disabilities. Therefore, a simple procedure is proposed and used here for the evaluation of health levels in order to serve positively for the estimation of the real human development of a population. This procedure will be applied as an example in the Eurozone countries. The scope is to measure the number of healthy years lost because of diseases and disabilities in the populations studied and consequently healthy life expectancy at birth. Results indicate that significant differences in health levels exist among the populations studied and thus in the first component of their human capital.","[Zafeiris, Konstantinos N.] Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Hist & Ethnol, Lab P Anthropol, P Tsaldari 1, Komotini 69100, Greece; [Skiadas, Christos] Tech Univ Crete, Manlab, Khania, Greece; [Tsoni, Aspasia] Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Hist & Ethnol, Komotini, Greece",Democritus University of Thrace; Technical University of Crete; Democritus University of Thrace,"Zafeiris, KN (通讯作者)，Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Hist & Ethnol, Lab P Anthropol, P Tsaldari 1, Komotini 69100, Greece.",kzafiris@he.duth.gr; skiadas@cmsim.net; tsoniaspa@gmail.com,"Zafeiris, Konstantinos/IVH-4672-2023; Zafeiris, Konstantinos/GPK-8470-2022","Zafeiris, Konstantinos/0000-0002-2587-6565; Zafeiris, Konstantinos/0000-0002-2587-6565",,,,,13,0,0,0,2,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2281-4,,,,2018,,,,,,,446,455,,,,,,10,Demography; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BO2HN,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000505804100040,0

Consumers have persistently preferred and are willing to pay higher prices for imported rice despite improvements in the quality attributes of local rice brands in the last 5 years. Nigeria's import bill of over $6million daily on rice is not only a drain on the country's Forex reserves, but a threat to the development of the domestic rice industry. Previous studies on rice consumers' behaviours have not explained the underlying reason of how consumers with imported brands preference mind-set make purchasing decisions when faced with both local and imported rice brands with almost similar quality attributes but different market prices. Aim: When making purchase decisions, consumers consider product quality in comparison to its price. This study attempts to explain how the differences in prices and quality attributes of local and imported rice brands determine consumer's inertia against preference for imported rice brands in Nigeria. Setting: This study was conducted in the Federal Capital Territory of Nigeria using data sets collected from a survey of 460 rice consumer households. Methods: Data were collected using a structured questionnaire administered to the household heads during the face-to-face interview. Two separate binary logit regression models were estimated for households' preference and WTP for imported rice. Results: The results show that price, household head's age, household's income and general perception are statistically significant variables explaining household's preference and WTP for imported rice brands. Consumers' inertia against preference and WTP for imported rice persists because of the negative price-quality differential gaps between local and imported rice brands. Conclusion: Rice consumers in Nigeria compare price and quality differentials before making a choice between local and imported rice brands. There is need for implementation of flexible and synergic import restriction and strategic marketing policies that sustain wide price differentials between local and imported rice brands, while improving the quality image of the local brands to narrow consumer's perception of the quality differential between these two sets of brands.","[Obih, Uchenna; Baiyegunhi, Lloyd S.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Discipline Agr Econ, Durban, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Obih, U (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Discipline Agr Econ, Durban, South Africa.",obih_uchenna@yahoo.com,,"Baiyegunhi, Lloyd James Segun/0000-0001-7717-3610",,,,,57,4,4,2,15,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The level of compensation, however, has understated the true harm suffered by purchasers. Hence, victims of a breach of antitrust rules are not fully compensated. This is true especially for consumers because the large majority of damages cases pertain to nonconsumers claiming damages. There has been some case-by-case empirical research on consumer damages but no methodological study has been done on the calculation of consumer compensation in general. This paper aims to fill that gap. By using the example of a cartel, we consider different calculation methods. We determine the theoretical upper and lower limits for compensation. These limits can be easily applied in practice when the consumer's income spent on a cartel good and the overcharge are known. More importantly, by using these limits, consumers are fully compensated for the harm suffered as a result of price-fixing.","[Rosenboom, Nicole S.

The improvement of living conditions in all regions of the island state shall be achieved by a tripartite approach of regional development consisting of the export processing zone, international tourism and marked investments in information and communication technology. The paper analyses whether these strategies are successful in enhancing conditions of living in Mauritius. The regression analysis reveals that the information and communication sector shows a positive impact on regional development only, although it is highly social selective. By contrast international tourism has a significant negative impact on living conditions because of the accompanying scarcity of property resulting in unaffordable housing in tourist areas, whereas the export processing zone displays just a minor negative impact. Thus, the paper discloses that the existing regional development paths in Mauritius are ambivalent and need carefully political improvement to accomplish the purpose of an enhancement of living conditions in all regions of the postcolonial island state.","[Dirksmeier, Peter] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Dept Geosci & Geog, Von Seckendorff Pl 4, D-06120 Halle, Germany; [Dirksmeier, Peter] Humboldt Univ, Geog Inst, Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany",Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Dirksmeier, P (通讯作者)，Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Dept Geosci & Geog, Von Seckendorff Pl 4, D-06120 Halle, Germany.;Dirksmeier, P (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Geog Inst, Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",peter.dirksmeier@geo.hu-berlin.de,,,,,,,68,1,1,1,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

To show this, we construct a VAR model where the orthogonalised shocks feature Student's t distribution as well as time-varying variance. We estimate the model using US data on industrial production growth, inflation, interest rates and stock returns. In terms of in-sample fit, the VAR model featuring both stochastic volatility and t-distributed disturbances outperforms restricted alternatives that feature either attributes. The VAR model with t disturbances results in density forecasts for industrial production and stock returns that are superior to alternatives that assume Gaussianity, and this difference is especially stark over the recent Great Recession. Further international evidence confirms that accounting for both stochastic volatility and Student's t-distributed disturbances may lead to improved forecast accuracy.

To deal with model uncertainty and better utilize multiple VARs, this paper adopts the dynamic model averaging/selection (DMA/DMS) algorithm, in which forecasting models are updated and switch over time in a Bayesian manner. In an empirical application to a pool of Bayesian VAR (BVAR) models whose specifications include level and difference, along with differing lag lengths, we demonstrate that specification-switching VARs are flexible and powerful forecast tools that yield good performance. In particular, they beat the overall best BVAR in most cases and are comparable to or better than the individual best models (for each combination of variable, forecast horizon, and evaluation metrics) for medium-and long-horizon forecasts. We also examine several extensions in which forecast model pools consist of additional individual models in partial differences as well as all level/difference models, and/or time variations in VAR innovations are allowed, and discuss the potential advantages and disadvantages of such specification choices.

This change can move college sports further toward commercialization and quasi-professionalism or it can endeavor to reinforce the historical vision of college sports as an amateur activity subordinated to the educational mission of U.S. colleges. The former path will lead to increasing academic scandals, widespread financial insolvency and diminishing support for Olympic sports and Title IX.

Although, these vehicles are part of our cultural heritage with respect to road transport and mobility, they present (future) environmental concerns, which is a relevant development from policy perspective. Yet, as far as the authors are aware, there is hardly any academic literature addressing this issue. This study aims to provide a first exploration of historic cars and reasons for ownership and use and policy implications. To this end, a large explorative survey is conducted among HV owners of 15 European countries. Focusing on passenger car owners only, a latent class analysis is performed to identify possible segments among historic car owners. Seven latent classes are identified: recreational owners, reserved owners, repair men, die-hard fans, next generation fans, frequent drivers and collectors. Overall, the results indicate that there is large diversity in the ownership and use of historic cars and the reasons behind ownership. However, in general, historic cars are used much less than modern cars. Only the group of 'frequent drivers' (8% of the sample) represent a potential concern regarding emissions from a policy perspective. Finally, policy recommendations are provided for decision makers regarding historic cars.","[Araghi, Yashar; Kroesen, Maarten; van Wee, Bert] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Dept Engn Syst & Serv, Sect Transport & Logist, Jaffalaan 5, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology,"Araghi, Y (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Dept Engn Syst & Serv, Sect Transport & Logist, Jaffalaan 5, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands.",y.araghi@tudelft.nl,,,Federation Internationale des Vehicules Anciens (FIVA),Federation Internationale des Vehicules Anciens (FIVA),This research has been partly financed by a grant of the Federation Internationale des Vehicules Anciens (FIVA).,,23,16,17,0,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

These closed storefronts are plausibly the result of rent seeking-with each and every approval-granting bureaucrat seeking favors, finally depleting the pool of potential resources (potential bribes). This is actually a case of commons, as opposed to the case of Indian reservations where a large number of owners makes it difficult to utilize the resources collectively and efficiently. The first goal of the present study is to clarify the concept of anti-commons. Secondly, we provide a critique of the milestone model of Buchanan and Yoon (J Law Econ 43(1):1-13, 2000) and argue that the earlier model of Buchanan and Tullock (The calculus of consent:logical foundations of constitutional democracy. University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor, 1962) is more compatible with both the commons (employing the any-person rule in resource allocation decisions) and anti-commons (using the unanimity rule).

Given the important role of labour supply in explaining Irish economic growth, we aim to identify the relative influence of structural and cyclical factors in the recent dynamics of Irish labour force participation. Using a number of empirical approaches our results highlight the role of age, nationality and gender on the participation rate. We also find that the recent decline in female participation is entirely a response to the stage in the economic cycle given the weaker labour market, whereas the fall in male and overall participation also reflects the influence of some structural factors. Accordingly a rise in the participation rate is to be expected in the near term as the economic recovery continues, and current measures of slack in the economy should account for this. Combining our results and various population projection scenarios, we show that policy actions to increase female participation may not in and of themselves yield significant changes in the aggregate trend participation rate over the medium term owing to the stronger influence of the falling male trend. Higher immigration is the most effective way of offsetting the expected decline in trend participation out to 2025.","[Byrne, Stephen; O'Brien, Martin D.] Cent Bank Ireland, Dublin, Ireland",European Central Bank; Central Bank of Ireland,"Byrne, S (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.",stephen.byrne@centralbank.ie; martin.obrien@centralbank.ie,,,,,,,24,2,2,0,1,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

The aim of our study is to provide causal evidence on the link between self-control and criminal behavior. We test whether individuals with lower self-control behave in a more antisocial manner and are less risk-averse and thus are, according to both the General Theory of Crime and the economic literature on criminal behavior, more likely to engage in criminal activities. In order to exogenously vary the level of self-control in a laboratory experiment, we use a well-established experimental manipulation, a so-called depletion task. We find that subjects with low self-control take more risk. The effect of self-control on antisocial behavior is small and not significant. In sum, our findings are consistent with the proposition that low self-control is a facilitator of crime to the extent that individuals with lower levels of self-control are less effectively deterred by probabilistic sanctions.

While culture is commonly seen as an institution affecting economic processes, there has been little consideration regarding the mechanisms connecting cultural outlooks within individual practices and actions. This article links the sociological work of Pierre Bourdieu with relational economic geography and practice perspectives to examine how cultural outlooks influence the practices of entrepreneurial actors. Through a qualitative analysis of 73 interviews, this framework is used to examine the patterns of entrepreneurial mentorship in Waterloo and Ottawa, Canada. The article finds that the significant differences in both the rates and the dynamics of mentorship between the two cities are the result of different cultural outlooks toward mentorship that have developed within each region, which in turn have fostered distinct beliefs about the value of mentoring and entrepreneurship.","[Spigel, Ben] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Business, 29 Buccleuch Pl, Edinburgh EH8 9JS, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Spigel, B (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Sch Business, 29 Buccleuch Pl, Edinburgh EH8 9JS, Midlothian, Scotland.",ben.spigel@ed.ac.uk,,"Spigel, Ben/0000-0002-2634-6021",,,,,72,39,40,1,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

It aims to understand how changes in the transport conditions of a region can affect its own and neighboring regions' ability to improve foreign trade. The proposed dynamic spatial panel model extends previous ones in the scant related literature, by accounting for spillover effects and own time lagged responses of export flows to changes in variables related, among others, to network distance and accessibility. The results suggest a considerable number of indirect (spatially lagged) effects that are significant for the regional export trade, including those of highway corridors. Agglomeration economies positively affect manufacturing exports by ship and truck in the own prefecture, while manufacturing specialization has a significant impact on maritime transport. It is also shown that failure to account for long-run responses can significantly underestimate the effect of changes in the distance to major transport facilities on export volume. Especially the enhancement of interregional accessibility and market potential has a major impact on the agricultural exports by road. The findings have implications for the coordination of regional investment policies and the planning of the mainland transport system in connection with the location of logistics hubs.

J,"Haldrup, K",,,,"Haldrup, Karin",,,"On security of collateral in Danish mortgage finance: a formula of property rights, incentives and market mechanisms",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Specialized mortgage intermediaries in Denmark have for over 200 years provided owners and buyers of real property wide access to credit. The present paper sets out to explore the safeguards that nurtured development of a robust, market based financing system and a deep mortgage market. Observations are made on the nature of collateral performance in respect to property rights, mortgage law and market development in search of general features of required institutional arrangements. The robustness of the Danish mortgage finance system is largely accredited to the securitization model based on the balance principle that assigns risks and responsibility to market players in a self-disciplinary manner and protected the mortgage banks against cash flow mismatches even during deep crisis, as history attests. It is shown how property registers and effective enforcement have created transparent property rights and practically reduced legal risks of mortgaging to zero. Standardization and scale of economics supported collateral efficiency, as measured in terms of simplicity, transparency, rapidity and costs. The Danish mortgage finance system illustrates the critical role of government in insuring the quality and enforceability of mortgage collateral, and reducing uncertainty for market players throughout the entire process. The paper suggests that sound incentive structures of the securitization model, strong commitment mechanisms and the market mechanisms constituted a complex formula of safeguards that-rather than specific capital coverage requirements-created the preconditions required for a well-functioning mortgage market.","[Haldrup, Karin] Aalborg Univ, Aalborg, Denmark",Aalborg University,"Haldrup, K (通讯作者)，Aalborg Univ, Aalborg, Denmark.",knh@plan.aau.dk,,,,,,,57,2,2,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

With the effect of New Public Management, implementation of accrual accounting based rules in the local government level has been studied from different aspects and within different contexts. In this study, we seek to further delineate factors affecting the level of compliance to accrual based accounting rules in the local government level in an emerging country - Turkey. We shed lights on two new emerging country-like variables: implementation of European Union funded projects and newly founded municipalities with six control variables including municipal size, municipal wealth, citizen education level, staff education level, debt ratio and external audit. Data, to be analyzed, is gathered from 102 Turkish municipalities. We use compliance index, consisting of 39 items, in order to assess the level of compliance of the municipalities. Institutional theory and resource dependence theory have been employed in order to increase our understanding on the factors affecting the level of compliance to the accrual based rules. The results show moderate compliance, 61.2%, with the accrual based rules. Predictors that have clearly significant effect on the level of compliance are respectively, the external audit (b = .123, beta = .450, p = .000), implementation of EU funded projects (b = .074, beta = .267, p = .002) and being a newly founded municipality (b = .071, beta = .155, p = .031). Moreover, we found that coercive institutional pressure to implement accrual-based rules may become a potent force when a supreme audit institution has control and there is resource dependence on an international body.","[Ada, Selver Seda] Univ Ghent, Suleyman Sah Univ, Dept Publ Governance Management & Finance, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Ghent, Belgium; [Christiaens, Johan] Univ Ghent, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Publ Governance Management & Finance, Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University; Ghent University,"Ada, SS (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Suleyman Sah Univ, Dept Publ Governance Management & Finance, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Ghent, Belgium.",selversedaada@gmail.com; johan.christiaens@ugent.be,"Christiaens, Johan/AAC-9962-2019",,,,,,89,3,3,0,15,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Literature analysis led to the formation of liquidity risk management model assumptions. It was found that although liquidity risk management is frequently studied in the academic literature, most of researches are limited only to the proposal of one or several new liquidity indicators. There are only few attempts to manage liquidity risk by using new statistical methodologies (VaR). The balance among sufficient liquidity, safety and profitability should be the long-term goal of the bank. Nonetheless the authors often forget this and focus only on the accumulation of extremely high liquidity buffer. Therefore, there is a lack of models that would systematise the proposals of individual authors and provide complex liquidity risk measurement and management model based on the best practices, which are suitable for the local banks that are unable to carry out the asset securitisation and do not have access to funding from the parent bank. New liquidity risk management model was proposed based on the best practices described by using 10 indicators. It covers the following 4 aspects of sound liquidity management: compliance with the supervisory requirements, liquidity buffers, as well as the assessment of net funding gap and risk indicators. The model was employed to assess the liquidity risk of local Lithuanian bank. Although the bank complies with the prudential requirements set by the supervisory institution, liquidity risk management model showed that the bank has some serious problems. Backtesting confirmed that the confidence interval is sufficient and LaR conservatively predicts negative changes of bank's liabilities.","[Aniunas, Povilas; Gipiene, Gailute; Valukonis, Mantas] Vilnius Univ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Kaunas Fac, Muitines Str 8, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Vijunas, Mindaugas] Vilnius Univ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Kaunas Fac, Muitines Str 8, LT-50229 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vilnius University; Vilnius University,"Aniunas, P (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Kaunas Fac, Muitines Str 8, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania.",povilas@centras.lt; Gailme.Gipiene@khfvu.lt; manntass1010@yahoo.com; mindaugas.vijunas@khfvu.lt,,,,,,,35,3,3,0,14,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The initial phase of money laundering involves the preparation of the discussed practices, primarily through the deployment of capital acquired from illegal sources (for example through the transfer of capital abroad-this practice helps reduce the risk of detection of money laundering). Among the methods of capital transfers, we can point the following: smuggling, transfer of luxury goods, electronic transfers (Hawala system-an underground banking system) or cyber-laundering. The second stage of money laundering involves the so-called placement, which is accomplished through the introduction of illegal means of payment into the financial system primarily by placing them on bank accounts. The third phase is referred to as layering and is done by hiding the actual source of the money that is transferred to bank accounts deployed in different banks or countries (double placement) with the participation of the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) system. The last step is integration (legalization), which consists in the final legalization of the money.","[Brzezinska, Joanna] Univ Wroclaw, Wroclaw, Poland",University of Wroclaw,"Brzezinska, J (通讯作者)，Univ Wroclaw, Wroclaw, Poland.",joanna.brzezinska@uwr.edu.pl,"Brzezińska, Joanna/AAC-4251-2021","Brzezinska, Joanna/0000-0002-5030-3363",,,,,18,0,0,0,8,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-46319-3; 978-3-319-46318-6,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,5,,,,,,305,316,,10.1007/978-3-319-46319-3_19,0.0,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH5KL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000401101000019,0

A lot of marketers argue that many barriers are found during the implementation of this system. The article aims to summarize the barriers of using CRM system in companies from different studies. This data is obtained from top marketing journals. This article provides insights for future research within the area of customer relationship management.","[Chromcakova, Adela] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Univ Nam 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Chromcáková, A (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Univ Nam 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic.",chromcakova@opf.slu.cz,,,[SGS/7/2017],,This paper was supported by the student grant competition project SGS/7/2017: Acceptance of technology from the perspective of marketing tools.,,38,0,0,0,5,SILESIAN UNIV,KARVINA,"SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION, KARVINA, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-265-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,83,93,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BQ3BQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000583813800008,0

Resorting to real-time vintages, a recursive exercise is conducted in order to assess the real-time reliability of our approach for nowcasting the US output gap, relative to some well-known benchmark models. For our application of interest, the preferred version of our approach is a multivariate singular spectrum analysis, where we use a Fisherg test to infer which components, within the standard business cycle range, should be included in the grouping step. We find that singular spectrum analysis provides a reliable assessment of the cyclical position of the economy in real time, with the multivariate approach outperforming its univariate counterpart substantially.

The algorithm is intuitive and simple to implement, and easily incorporates salient features of the real-time nowcasting environment, such as differences in data reporting lags across series. We evaluate the algorithm's real-time ability to establish new business cycle turning points in the United States quickly and accurately over the past five NBER recessions.

While knowledge bases are distinct theoretical categories, existing studies stress that innovation often involves combinations of analytical, synthetic, and symbolic knowledge. It remains unclear, though, which combinations are most conducive to innovation at the level of the firm and how this is influenced by the knowledge bases available in the region. This article fills this gap by reviewing the conceptual arguments on how and why certain firm and regional knowledge base combinations relate to firm innovativeness and by investigating these relationships econometrically. The knowledge base is captured using detailed occupational data derived from linked employer-employee data sets merged at the firm level with information from Community Innovation Surveys in Sweden. The results indicate that analytical knowledge outweighs the importance of synthetic and symbolic knowledge and that, however, firms benefit most from being located in a region with a balanced mix of all three knowledge bases.","[Grillitsch, Markus; Martin, Roman; Srholec, Martin] Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Solvegatan 16, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Srholec, Martin] Czech Acad Sci, Econ Inst, CERGE EI, Politickych Veznu 7, Prague 11121 1, Czech Republic",Lund University; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague,"Grillitsch, M (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Solvegatan 16, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",Markus.Grillitsch@circle.lu.se; Roman.Martin@circle.lu.se; Martin.Srholec@circle.lu.se,"Martin, Roman/AAE-1297-2022; Grillitsch, Markus/AAS-9067-2021; Srholec, Martin/C-4254-2012","Martin, Roman/0000-0001-5003-0986; Grillitsch, Markus/0000-0002-8406-4727; Srholec, Martin/0000-0001-6115-4116",VINNOVA Core Funding of Centers for Innovation Systems Research project [2010-01370],VINNOVA Core Funding of Centers for Innovation Systems Research project(Vinnova),"An earlier version of the article was presented at the workshop Special Issue of Economic Geography: Combinatorial Knowledge Bases, Regional Innovation and Development Dynamics, CIRCLE, Lund, May 13th-14th, 2014.

In this study, the authors analyze whether diffusion models for media products provide helpful support in the management task of predicting prelaunch sales of the first distribution channel for three different product categories. They compare the performance of predictions based on (a) simple success factor regressions (OLS) and (b) diffusion models against real management predictions. Based on samples covering the German music, film, and the literary market, we show that model-based forecasts outperform the forecasts of management teams for the majority of the products. In contrast, management is superior in forecasting top sellers. This is due to unobserved factors arising from more management attention attached towards super stars. The authors do not find substantial prediction differences between simple success factor regressions and more complex diffusion models. Thus, managers interested in total sales estimates can easily rely on OLS based success factor predictions. Advertising and product differentiation factors with respect to quality (e.g., star power, critics, or country of origin) are across all 3 industries highly relevant for sales predictions, whereas others variables (e.g., price, distribution power, season, or competition) differ across industries.","[Hofmann-Stoelting, Christina] HTW Univ Appl Sci Berlin, Math Stat & Empir Res, Berlin, Germany; [Clement, Michel] Univ Hamburg, Inst Mkt, Mkt & Media, Hamburg, Germany; [Wu, Steven] Univ Hamburg, Inst Mkt, Hamburg, Germany; [Albers, Soenke] Kuhne Logist Univ, Mkt & Innovat, Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg; University of Hamburg; Kuhne Logistics University,"Clement, M (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Inst Mkt, Mkt & Media, Hamburg, Germany.",michel.clement@uni-hamburg.de,"Clement, Michel/GQQ-1785-2022",,,,,,66,11,11,3,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0899-7764,1532-7736,,J MEDIA ECON,J.

The changes are most pronounced among Millennials, those born in the 1980s and 1990s. Much ink has been spilled debating whether these changes in travel behavior are due to changing preferences or economic circumstances. In this paper, we use eight waves of data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to examine recent changes in auto ownership among US families with a particular focus on Millennials. We find that today's young adults do own fewer cars than previous generations did when they were young. However, when we control for whether young adults have become economically independent from their parents, i.e. left the nest, we find that economically independent young adults own slightly more cars than we would expect, given their low incomes and wealth. We caution planners to temper their enthusiasm about peak car, as this may largely be a manifestation of economic factors that could reverse in coming years. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

These occur when the growth in the volume of production of a company or an industry leads to slower growth in total costs. In the long-term, the Federal Republic of Germany has been the most important business partner for the Czech Republic. It has almost a 30% share of the total foreign trade turnover in the Czechia. However, a portion of the goods is re-exported via Hamburg and other German ports to third countries. German companies are also easily the largest investors. Since 1993, they invested over CZK 600 billion in the Czechia. Four thousand German companies are active in the country, and the largest of them alone create approximately 150 thousand jobs. The aim of this paper is to express, using the Helpman-Krugman model of foreign trade, the increase in production volume and the number of companies (as well as the decrease in prices and average costs of companies) in both countries caused by the increase in the mutual foreign trade of the Czechia and Germany.","[Kopecka, Lenka; Soukup, Alexandr] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ Theories, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500 6, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Kopecká, L (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Econ Theories, Fac Econ & Management, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500 6, Czech Republic.",kopeckal@pef.czu.cz; soukupa@pef.czu.cz,"Soukup, Alexandr/J-2629-2017; Kopecka, Lenka/J-2617-2017","Kopecka, Lenka/0000-0002-4781-7259","Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague [20171011]; Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague [20171011]","Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague; Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague","This research project is supported by Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague, grant number 20171011 - Application of Helpman- Krugman model for international exchange in market with food products.",,16,3,3,0,2,VERLAG GUC-GESELLSCHAFT UNTERNEHMENSRECHNUNG CONTROLLING M B H,LOBNITZ,"STEINWEG 32, LOBNITZ, D-08294, GERMANY",,,978-3-86367-051-1,GUC FACHB,,,2017,33,,,,,,93,100,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6KP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426794300010,0

In 2010, the Europe 2020 strategy was proposed as a means of focusing the EU and its Member States on the main task of improving competitiveness and creating conditions for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. As candidate countries for EU membership, Western Balkans are expected to act in accordance with these goals. Hence, this paper implements the Global Competitiveness Index 2015-2016 and a set of supplemental data analysis tools to assess both the level of competitiveness and the region's relative position vis-a-vis the EU member states. The results clearly show that the EU is far from a homogenous entity in terms of competitiveness, whilst the candidates expose a competitiveness profile similar to that of Central and Eastern Europe. Overall, the Western Balkans trail behind the EU-28 countries in building a knowledge-intensive economy and are significantly outdistanced in laying the foundations for 'smart growth', as the European economies press ahead.","[Kostoska, Olivera; Hristoski, Ilija] St Kliment Ohridski Univ Bitola, Fac Econ, Marksova 133, Prilep 7500, Macedonia",St. Clement of Ohrid University of Bitola,"Kostoska, O (通讯作者)，St Kliment Ohridski Univ Bitola, Fac Econ, Marksova 133, Prilep 7500, Macedonia.",olivera.kostoska@uklo.edu.mk; ilija.hristoski@uklo.edu.mk,,,,,,,61,5,5,0,4,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

Firstly, a novel generalized hesitant fuzzy distance measure is proposed to calculate the difference and deviation between two hesitant fuzzy elements (HFEs) without adding any values into the shorter hesitant fuzzy element. Secondly, the coefficient of variation and efficacy coefficient method are extended to accommodate hesitant fuzzy environment and then used to cope with HFMADM. In the analysis process, non-dimensional treatment for hesitant fuzzy decision data is produced. Lastly, the method proposed in this paper is applied to an example of inclusive growth evaluation problem under hesitant fuzzy environment and the case study illustrates the practicality of the proposed method.

However, public transport systems' profitability requires a thorough diagnosis of the services provided based on users' perceptions and expectations. That is, to invest money according to users' requirements. A methodological approach, which combines an Importance-Performance Analysis and a decision tree model, is proposed as means of analyzing rail services performance in Algiers and identifying the aspects that should be prioritized for improvement actions. Three railway transit services were analyzed in Algiers: the tramway, the metro and the commuter rail. More than 450 surveys were collected per mode. After applying the proposed methodology, results show that there are lines of action common to the three services, and specific strategies that may improve customer satisfaction and customer loyalty with the three railway transit services in Algiers. This is the first full experience analysis about service quality in Algiers' railways transit modes. The proposed two-step methodology is, for the first time, applied for analyzing service quality in public transport.","[Luis Machado-Leon, Jose; de Ona, Rocio; de Ona, Juan] Univ Granada, Dept Civil Engn, TRYSE Res Grp, ETSI Caminos Canales & Puertos, C Severo Ochoa S-N, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Baouni, Tahar] Ecole Polytech Architecture & Urbanisme EPAU Alge, Lab Ville Urbanisme & Dev Durable, BP 177, Algiers 16200, Algeria",University of Granada,"de Oña, R (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Dept Civil Engn, TRYSE Res Grp, ETSI Caminos Canales & Puertos, C Severo Ochoa S-N, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",jlmachadoleon@ugr.es; rociodona@ugr.es; tbaouni@yahoo.fr; jdona@ugr.es,"de Oña, Juan/A-4762-2008; de Oña, Rocio/AAB-8720-2019","de Oña, Juan/0000-0001-7133-2481; MACHADO LEON, JOSE LUIS/0000-0001-5160-8487; de Ona, Rocio/0000-0002-5116-5652","Spanish Initiatives of Development Cooperation Center at the University of Granada (CICODE) [1.1, C13P11_2014]",Spanish Initiatives of Development Cooperation Center at the University of Granada (CICODE),"The authors would like to thank the Spanish Initiatives of Development Cooperation Center (Internal Cooperation Plan 2013, Programme 1.1) at the University of Granada (CICODE) that funded the international university cooperation project C13P11_2014.

Populism, it is argued, has long been a feature of liberal democracies in so far as claims are made for democracy to be as directly expressive as possible of the will of its subjects. Yet populisms are hybrid in form and parasitic on existing political arrangements. What unites them is more to do with what they oppose than what they espouse. Above all, it is the norms of liberalism that are brought into question by populist proponents of direct democracy with their characteristic hostility towards elites, experts and the so-called establishment. In so far as all populisms can be dangerous this lies in the degree to which they oppose the existing norms of liberalism and seek to undermine its moderating institutions.

We expand them and build on them to advance scholarly discussion on how social innovation, social entrepreneurship and business model innovation can be used to face inequality and marginalisation. The main idea we place at the centre of the discussion is empowerment of marginalised individuals by social innovation initiatives and social entrepreneurial ventures.

An instrumental variable probit approach is applied to account for the endogeneity of agricultural productivity in household's charcoal participation decision. We find a negative and significant effect of agricultural productivity on household's likelihood of participation in charcoal production. Results also show that higher education, income, asset value, and participation in off-farm employment opportunities reduce the likelihood of participation in charcoal production. Therefore, interventions seeking to reduce charcoal production in rural Zambia could benefit from improving smallholder agricultural productivity, incomes, asset base, and off-farm employment creation. However, interventions need not lose sight of other important macro-level factors. (C) 2017 Department of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Umea.

Applying the two-step robust GMM estimator to 782 banks from over 60 countries covering the period of 2000-2011 we find that both macroprudential and microprudential instruments have insignificant impact on procyclicality of leverage in the non-crisis period. Macroprudential instruments decrease procyclicality of liquidity during non-crisis period and increase procyclicality of leverage during the crisis. Restrictions on the range of activities conducted by banks reduce procyclicality of liquidity risk during non-crisis period. Interaction between macroprudential instruments targeted at risk-taking by borrowers and restrictions on the range of activities taken by banks has been found to be effective in reducing procyclicality of leverage during the crisis period.","[Olszak, Malgorzata; Kowalska, Iwona] Univ Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Olszak, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.",molszak@wz.uw.edu.pl; ikowalska@wz.uw.edu.pl,"Olszak, Malgorzata/C-4952-2016","Olszak, Malgorzata/0000-0001-8920-5309; Kowalska, Iwona/0000-0002-1208-2790",Faculty of Management of University of Warsaw from Ministry of Science and Higher Education,Faculty of Management of University of Warsaw from Ministry of Science and Higher Education,The authors gratefully acknowledge that this study has been financed by the Faculty of Management of University of Warsaw (statutory research) from funds delivered by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education.,,25,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,,978-3-319-54885-2; 978-3-319-54884-5,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,165,180,,10.1007/978-3-319-54885-2_16,0.0,,,16,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI5UA,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412819500016,0

Insurance market monitoring is important for prediction of trends and for a timely adjustment to market changes and conditions. The area of the conducted research encompasses gross premium and business expenses in the health insurance market. Information about trends in the health insurance market is combined with financial indicators and statistical and mathematical methods of modelling for generation of new planning information for decision making. Using this model, planning information is created for the segment of health insurance sales and management of business expenses. Health insurance sales are divided into sales channels and, using the model, trends are analysed and predicted. In this way, the sales channel analysis and trend prediction are facilitated for the coming annual period in the health insurance market. Business expenses in insurance consist of acquisition costs and administrative costs. By the model, planning information is formed for the management of business expenses by the mutual relationship between business expenses and health insurance sales. The model is used for management of the acquisition and administrative costs, As an important category for sales management, commission costs are included in acquisition costs within the model. The aim of the conducted research was to illustrate the model which, using financial planning indicators, generates information about estimation and prediction of the sales channel trends and the amount o  business expenses in the national health insurance market, as well as to expand the information basis for consideration of market trends and for planning of business of 'nsurance companies which operate in the said market, with the purpose of realisation of the planned financial performance.","[Perusko, Ticijan; Biondic, Marija] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic Pula, Pula, Poland",,"Perusko, T (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic Pula, Pula, Poland.",tperusko@unipu.hr; mbiondic@unipu.hr,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,3,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2017,13,,,,,,743,757,,,,,,15,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM4RS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000463854000049,0

Investors will both be totally unaware of this underinvestment and base their decisions on inefficient credit ratings or they will have to supplement the credit ratings with additional information (Ferri, J Appl Econ 7:77-98, 2004). The importance of obtaining a sovereign credit rating from an agency is still underrated in some developing economies and even more so in Africa. Less than half of the African countries have a formal sovereign credit rating even though Africa has been identified as an emerging investment destination. Africa is a very unique continent and African countries are at various development stages and are classified by the World Bank according to income groups. Literature on the determinants of sovereign credit ratings in Africa is scarce. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to determine what the determinants are for sovereign credit ratings in Africa and whether these determinants differ between regions and income groups. A sample of 27 countries' determinants of sovereign credit ratings is compared between 2007 and 2014. Sovereign credit rating variables are classified as categorical variables, and conventional econometric methods used in identifying the determinants are not always appropriate for a model with a categorical-dependent variable. The ordered response panel data model which allows for a categorical-dependent variable and a panel framework that accounts for unobserved country heterogeneity will be employed in addition to the standard panel models. The results indicated that the determinants of sovereign credit ratings differ between African regions and income groups. The Southern African region's determinants were mostly in line with findings in literature. The developmental indicators, including variables such as regulation and corruption, as determinants of sovereign credit ratings were the most significant determinants across most income groups.","[Pretorius, Marinda; Botha, Ilse] Univ Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Johannesburg,"Botha, I (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa.",ilseb@uj.ac.za,"Pretorius, Marinda/O-5057-2018","Pretorius, Marinda/0000-0001-8767-5470; Botha, Ilse/0000-0003-3168-1454",,,,,40,3,3,0,6,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-48454-9; 978-3-319-48453-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,549,563,,10.1007/978-3-319-48454-9_36,0.0,,,15,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1MX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447881400036,0

But to what extent is this the case? In this contribution the connections between populism and liberal democracy are sketched in the context of several areas where discussions about populisms have stressed their discontinuity with the liberal democratic tradition and its practices. The discussion concentrates upon the notions of the people, their representation, elites, constitutional issues and economic policies. In each case it is suggested that continuities are as strong, and sometimes stronger, than discontinuities in these relationships. The contribution ends with a discussion of how it might be possible to defend liberal democracy from a non-liberal position in the face of the critique from populisms.","[Thompson, Grahame F.] Univ Copenhagen, CAST, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Thompson, Grahame F.] Open Univ, POLIS, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England",University of Copenhagen; Open University - UK,"Thompson, GF (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, CAST, Copenhagen, Denmark.;Thompson, GF (通讯作者)，Open Univ, POLIS, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England.",g.f.thompson@open.ac.uk,,,,,,,41,9,9,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

It is found that the pay advantage is persistent over the latest half century, but it started to decline since the late-1990s; in particular, females tend to enjoy a higher wage premium than males. A key technical problem of estimating wage premium is selection bias, because the sector choice is endogenously determined by individual characteristics and job attributes. The main prevailing methods in the current literature are categorised into four main types, and a sample dataset from the Labour Force Survey (UK) in the latest decade is used to apply and compare these methods. The findings suggest that Blinder-Oaxaca and OLS seem to underestimate the wage premium by 2 %, compared to propensity score matching method.","[Wang, Yi] Cardiff Metropolitan Univ, Cardiff Sch Management, Cardiff CF5 2YB, S Glam, Wales; [Zhou, Peng] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff Metropolitan University; Cardiff University,"Wang, Y (通讯作者)，Cardiff Metropolitan Univ, Cardiff Sch Management, Cardiff CF5 2YB, S Glam, Wales.",ywang@cardiffmet.ac.uk; zhoup1@cardiff.ac.uk,"Zhou, Peng/ABI-2373-2020","Zhou, Peng/0000-0002-4310-9474",,,,,53,2,2,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-48454-9; 978-3-319-48453-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,379,409,,10.1007/978-3-319-48454-9_28,0.0,,,31,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1MX,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447881400028,0

Opposition was spearheaded by a taxpayer group that focused on the perceived incompetence and wastefulness of the region's transportation authority. Exercising a liberal imperative of 'permanent critique of government', the taxpayer group assembled evidence addressed to 'taxpayers'. Developing a theoretical account of 'taxpayer governmentality', the paper analyses how people are addressed and fashioned as taxpayer subjects, empowered and responsibilized to govern government, and their own political conduct, as sceptical, calculating, non-political, economic actors. The paper concludes by suggesting that this taxpayer subject may be productive for understanding the practice of liberal critique and limitations of the state.","[Willmott, Kyle] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Willmott, K (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",kyle_willmott@sfu.ca,,"Willmott, Kyle/0000-0001-5561-8770",,,,,46,13,14,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

We use a unique dataset for Italy, which follows the antisocial behavior of a representative cohort of young criminals aged 14 to 24.

When the transmission mechanisms of fathers were proxied to include a set of observable individual and family variables, our regression estimates showed that almost half the father-child correlation is not explained by the controls. More importantly, estimating the father-child association restricting to fathers in prison, we find that this correlation is significantly large for theft and drugs, which suggests that this forced absence acts as a potential determinant of children's criminal careers.","[Pieroni, Luca; Lanari, Donatella] Univ Perugia, Perugia, Italy",University of Perugia,"Pieroni, L (通讯作者)，Dept Polit Sci, Via Pascoli 20, I-06123 Perugia, Italy.",luca.pieroni@unipg.it,,"Pieroni, Luca/0000-0003-1841-4351",,,,,45,2,2,1,134,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",2054-0892,2054-0906,,J DEMOGR ECON,J.Demogr.

This study examined transit equity and the changes in it resulting from a major expansion of the transit network in a metropolitan area. Three stages of transit service provision were defined based on the actual network expansion plans. Transit equity at the global level was measured using the concept of the Gini index. The resultant Gini indices indicated that transit equality has improved and will continue to improve with the provision of additional subway lines. This was followed by a statistical analysis to determine which groups or areas were more likely to benefit from the expansion. When only a linear subway line was added to the bus network, transit dependent groups did not appear to benefit from the increased transit supply. However, with the addition of another circular subway line, females and young people were found to have a significant and positive association with the increased transit supply, indicating a vertically fairer distribution of resources.","[Song, Yena] Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Geog, Gwangju 61186, South Korea; [Kim, Hyun] Univ Tennessee, Dept Geog, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Lee, Keumsook] Sungshin Womens Univ, Dept Geog, Seoul 02844, South Korea; [Ahn, Kwangwon] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Moon Soul Grad Sch Future Strategy, Deajeon 34141, South Korea; [Ahn, Kwangwon] Peking Univ, HSBC Business Sch, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China",Chonnam National University; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; Sungshin Women's University; Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST); Peking University,"Song, Y (通讯作者)，Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Geog, Gwangju 61186, South Korea.",Y.Song@chonnam.ac.kr; hkim56@utk.edu; kslee@sungshin.ac.kr; k.ahn@kaist.ac.kr,"Song, Yena/GXW-1441-2022; Ahn, Kwangwon/Q-2015-2016","Song, Yena/0000-0002-0861-1397; Ahn, Kwangwon/0000-0003-3611-183X",Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2016S1A5A8017806],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2016S1A5A8017806).,,52,12,14,8,38,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

We thereby gain insights into likely conditions of their emergence and functions. Moreover, we extend the dyadic perspective on regional gatekeeper organisations and link it more strongly to the network science and proximity framework literature. An empirical study applies these arguments and investigates the proximity characteristics of critical links in 132 technology-specific subsidised knowledge networks in Germany. The results show that critical links tend be formed between regional gatekeepers that offer related knowledge resources.

We develop a model that identifies when owners will choose to leave coaches with discretion over rookie participation decisions and shows that, in the presence of such discretion, coaches facing a higher termination risk can be expected to use rookies less often.

The bilateral trade flows between these two economies have been increasing since the end of the global financial crisis. There are several factors that determine the trade flows between these two economies. Aim: The research studies the impact of the real exchange rate, market size and economic size on the trade flows between SA and China, applying the gravity model of trade. Time series data for the period of 1995-2014 have been used and a multiple linear regression model was employed in the evaluation process. Methods: To determine the impact of the three underlying variables on the bilateral trade flows of SA and China, the ordinary least squares method was used. The explanatory variables consist of the product of SA's gross domestic product (GDP) and China's GDP, which act as the proxy for economic size, the product of South Africa's population and China's population, which act as the proxy for market size, and the real exchange rate between SA and China. Results: Results revealed that the economic size and the market size have a strong positive impact on trade flows between SA and China and this is consistent with economic theory. On the other hand the real exchange rate has a negative impact on trade flows between SA and China. Conclusion: If two countries each have a large economic and population size trade, this results in high trade flows between the countries as compared to trading with smaller economies. Trade volume is also reduced if the countries trading have a highly volatile exchange rate. Based on the findings of the research, the article recommends that the Department of Trade and Industry should target trade with countries of big economic and market size. The research also shows that the absolute and comparative advantages are not the only basis of trade but other factors should be considered, such as exchange rate, economic size and market size. The central bank should maintain a stable exchange rate between the SA rand and partner countries' currencies before trading. This enhances trade and leads to strong economic growth.","[Mhaka, Simbarashe; Jeke, Leward] Nelson Mandela Univ, Dept Econ, Port Elizabeth, South Africa",Nelson Mandela University,"Jeke, L (通讯作者)，Nelson Mandela Univ, Dept Econ, Port Elizabeth, South Africa.",lewardjeke@gmail.com,,"Jeke, Prof. Leward/0000-0002-8145-4324; Mhaka, Simbarashe/0000-0002-6590-695X",,,,,45,3,4,0,11,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

His goal was to use insights from economics to improve constitutional analysis, in particular seeking to ground constitutional interpretation in quantitative assessments he hoped would be both true to the primary goal of constitution-makers and capable of providing guidance to judges in ways less subject to the pull of political preferences. Despite his concerns with controlling constitutional interpretation in practice, the instincts Manne brought to this endeavor ran more to matters of theory than to its implementation by judges, identifying important propositions for interpretation but failing (by his own admission) to produce a test that fulfilled his aspirations. The strengths and weaknesses of this work provide an intriguing contrast with writings from Antonin Scalia, the American jurist and scholar whose approaches to both constitutional and statutory interpretation had a profound impact on jurisprudence over the past three decades. Like Manne, Scalia highly valued more determinate methods of analysis and was deeply concerned with the architecture of constitutional creation and effectuation. His focus, however, was more on the practical question of what happens when a particular sort of official has the power to implement a highly indeterminate test and what test best constrains interpretation in ways faithful to the interpretive task. Those goals undergird Scalia's commitments to textualism and originalism. Manne's and Scalia's approaches to constitutional interpretation are instructive on the purposes served by analytical tools in disparate settings. In particular, they offer contrasting and complementary visions, providing insights about the domains of law-and-economics, legal analysis, practical judgment, and perspective.","[Cass, Ronald A.] Boston Univ, Sch Law, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Cass, Ronald A.] Ctr Rule Law, Great Falls, VA 22066 USA; [Cass, Ronald A.] Cass & Associates PC, Great Falls, VA 22066 USA; [Cass, Ronald A.] Ctr Study Adm State, Great Falls, VA 22201 USA; [Cass, Ronald A.] Int Ctr Econ Res, Turin, Italy; [Cass, Ronald A.] 10560 Fox Forest Dr, Great Falls, VA 22066 USA",Boston University,"Cass, RA (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Sch Law, Boston, MA 02215 USA.;Cass, RA (通讯作者)，Ctr Rule Law, Great Falls, VA 22066 USA.;Cass, RA (通讯作者)，Cass & Associates PC, Great Falls, VA 22066 USA.;Cass, RA (通讯作者)，Ctr Study Adm State, Great Falls, VA 22201 USA.;Cass, RA (通讯作者)，Int Ctr Econ Res, Turin, Italy.;Cass, RA (通讯作者)，10560 Fox Forest Dr, Great Falls, VA 22066 USA.",roncass@ruleoflaw.org,,,,,,,59,2,2,1,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

In this study, we construct a theoretical model explaining the relationship between the opening of HSR stations and counties' economic growth. We investigate the effects of HSR stations on county development in China, applying the propensity score-matching difference in-difference method to county-level panel data for China from 2006 to 2014, and we examine whether and under what conditions a resource redistribution effect occurs. The findings are as follows. (1) HSR construction is conducive to the economic growth of the site area, with a promotion effect of 14%. (2) The primary source of this promotion effect is a resource redistribution effect in areas located within 30-110 km (26 min) from the station. This attractive radius significantly differs between coastal and inland areas, with the effect being greater in inland regions than in coastal regions. (3) This difference can be attributed to the heterogeneity of the surrounding counties; the larger the market size of the surrounding counties, the smaller the resource redistribution effect is, and vice versa.","[Meng, Xuechen; Lin, Shanlang] Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management, 1 Zhangwu Rd, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Xiaochuan] Shanghai Normal Univ, Sch Tourism & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Tongji University; Shanghai Normal University,"Lin, SL (通讯作者)，Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management, 1 Zhangwu Rd, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.",linshanlang@163.com,,"Zhu, Xiaochuan/0000-0002-0027-7929",,,,,42,72,75,8,109,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

The legal problem of ridesourcing services revolves around the question whether they are of public or private nature. Legislation has been proposed to either ban or legalize the service and to give municipalities the right to regulate its operations. This paper also analyses socio-demographic and travel characteristics of the ridesourcing demand in Brazilian cities. Based on this demand's point of view, a logistic regression model was generated to predict the probability of users choosing a ride-splitting system. The results show that the majority of ridesourcing trips is replacing taxi and public transport trips. Safety and cost are the main reasons that influence the decision of sharing trips via ride-splitting. The use of larger vehicles for sharing trips can introduce competition with the public transport systems. The ridesourcing interference on collective public transportation may be more noticeable than on individual public transport (taxis), given the much greater demand for the former.","[de Souza Silva, Laize Andrea; de Andrade, Mauricio Oliveira; Alves Maia, Maria Leonor] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Ctr Tecnol & Geociencias, BR-50740550 Recife, PE, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Pernambuco,"Silva, LAD (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Pernambuco, Ctr Tecnol & Geociencias, BR-50740550 Recife, PE, Brazil.",laize.civil.upe@gmail.com; mauandrade@gmail.com; nona@ufpe.br,"Maia, Maria Leonor/AAC-5797-2021","Maia, Maria Leonor/0000-0002-7625-2760",,,,,74,61,63,3,35,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

This paper discusses the issues of this new market structure for the Italian Rail Regulator, both in terms of regulatory design and economic regulation practices. Such HSR competition and regulation took place in a very specific and ambivalent context (including declining Italian railway demand, negative European macroeconomic environment), together with a new ambitious and innovating private competitor (NTV) and strong reactions from the incumbent (Trenitalia). The Italian Rail Regulator's interventions look like more or less a set of everyday life decisions and empirical trade-off than a duly achieved economic doctrine and policy. The level of access charges seems to be a strategic variable to enlarge the scope for profitable entry in Italy. However, this new context still does not answer the question whether HSR operators reach their economic equilibrium in open access competition.","[Desmaris, Christian] Univ Lyon, Transport Urban Planning Econ Lab LAET, ISH, 14 Ave Berthelot, F-69365 Lyon 07, France; [Croccolo, Fabio] Minist Infrastruct & Transport, Gen Direct Rail & Marine Invest, Viale Arte 16, I-00144 Rome, Italy",,"Desmaris, C (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon, Transport Urban Planning Econ Lab LAET, ISH, 14 Ave Berthelot, F-69365 Lyon 07, France.",christian.desmaris@sciencespo-lyon.fr; fabio.croccolo@mit.gov.it,,,,,,,66,10,11,2,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

Therefore, the aim of the present study is to test and evaluate the importance of the nine previously identified cost drivers (Camen & Lidestam, 2016) of public bus transports in Sweden. A mixed-method design, which included both focus groups and a questionnaire, was used. The questionnaire, with quantitative rating scales, was sent to representatives from the bus operators and from the Public Transport Authorities (PTAs). In the focus groups, industry associations, consultants, and politicians also participated. The results reveal what the dominating cost factors are, as well as the factors considered to be the most important, according to actors within the Swedish bus transport sector.

In this paper, we draw upon interviews to interpret site selection consultants as intermediaries between a demand for locations emanating from MNEs and a supply of locations provided by national and subnational territories. We show how this intermediary role extends beyond the economizing on search costs and into the rarely appreciated market-creating and value adding opportunities offered by location. We also show how the knowledge mobilised by consultants is quintessentially geographical. Paradoxically, it is the geographical nature of the knowledge mobilised by site selection consultants that presents frictions to the professionalisation and globalisation of the industry despite its seminal role in promoting the mobility of economic activities. In conclusion, we explore elements of a future research agenda centred on the mediated nature of MNE location decisions.","[Phelps, Nicholas A.] UCL, Bartlett Sch Planning, 14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England; [Wood, Andrew M.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Geog, 857 Patterson Off Tower, Lexington, KY 40506 USA",University of London; University College London; University of Kentucky,"Phelps, NA (通讯作者)，UCL, Bartlett Sch Planning, 14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England.",n.phelps@ucl.ac.uk,,"Wood, Andrew/0000-0001-5931-2621","Bartlett School of Planning, University College London; College of Arts and Sciences, University of Kentucky","Bartlett School of Planning, University College London; College of Arts and Sciences, University of Kentucky","The authors are grateful for research funding for this research provided by the Bartlett School of Planning, University College London and the College of Arts and Sciences, University of Kentucky.",,68,18,19,2,40,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

This workshop focused on identifying and categorizing the benefits and costs of public transport service provision, with a particular focus on external benefits and costs. Examples were drawn from a range of service settings, with network effects and social inclusion each seen as potentially very important public transport service benefits. This led to discussion of proposals for funding public transport services and infrastructure in ways that better align benefit/cost incidence with funding flows. Road pricing and value capture associated with public transport infrastructure and services were seen as major funding opportunities. A major Workshop conclusion was that, taking account of the potential scale of public transport beneficial externalities and the value of (user) social inclusion benefits from public transport services, cost recovery rates for urban PT of well under 50% should commonly be expected, for welfare maximization, with rural fare cost-recovery rates lower than urban.","[Stanley, John] Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Ljungberg, Anders] Transport Anal, Stockholm, Sweden",University of Sydney,"Stanley, J (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",john.stanley@sydney.edu.au; anders.ljungberg@trafa.se,,,,,,,21,1,1,1,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

These authorities received a great deal of freedom to implement the tendering in the way they saw fit. Over the years, issues arose that challenged the effectiveness of the tendering approaches. For example, operators were overincentivised to low prices, the administrative burden of tendering proved high, service across concession boundaries was poor, cooperation between authorities and operators was poor. Even though the effect of these issues on patronage and efficiency were hard to distinguish from bigger trends, it is clear that tendering has matured. This article, as its precursors in earlier Thredbo conferences, captures these issues and the lessons drawn over the last 15 years and shows in what phases tendering has matured, based on the Dutch experience, that could help other authorities in the process of maturing their tendering of public transport. Key theme has been integration after the fragmentation that tendering brought through strict definition of roles, formal procedures, small and uni-modal concessions.","[Veeneman, Wijnand] Delft Univ Technol, Bldg 31,Jaffalaan 5,POB 5015, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology,"Veeneman, W (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, Bldg 31,Jaffalaan 5,POB 5015, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands.",w.w.veeneman@tudelft.nl,"Veeneman, Wijnand/AAD-5722-2020","Veeneman, Wijnand/0000-0002-8507-2286",,,,,35,5,5,1,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

It has been performed a breakdown of output multipliers as a sum of direct, indirect and induced effects, and the salary and employment multipliers have also been calculated. The starting point is the creation of a SAM from the existing one of year 2010, but disaggregating the sector of transport into their different modes. Thanks to this, we establish the different impact in the economy of each mode of transport, highlighting their different performance. Regarding freight transport, train offers better effects in terms of output multipliers than transport by road. In transport of passengers, the impact of high speed train is more important than air transport, two modes that compete in some routes.

With the advent of smart (intelligent) mobility, aligned with digital disruption and future connected and collaborative transport including extensions to autonomous vehicles, the question of whether we have a new window of opportunity to tame congestion is now high on the list of possibilities. It is however very unclear what the future will look like in respect of congestion on the roads, especially if we rely on 'smart' technology and continue to reject reform of road user charging and new opportunities to fund the sharing model. This paper looks at a number of themes as a way of highlighting possibilities and challenges and promotes a position that congestion may not be reduced, especially without a significant switch to the sharing economy and relinquishing of private car ownership; the urgent need for government to define the institutional setting within which smart mobility can deliver reductions in congestion; and the crucial role that road pricing reform must play to ensure that those who benefit (suppliers and travellers) contribute to pay for the infrastructure (in particular) that they gain benefit from.","[Hensher, David A.] Univ Sydney, Business Sch, ITLS, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Hensher, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Business Sch, ITLS, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",David.Hensher@sydney.edu.au,,"Hensher, David/0000-0003-0058-2242",ARC-DP grant [DP170100420]; Volvo Research and Education Foundation Bus Rapid Transit (BRT+) Centre of Excellence,ARC-DP grant(Australian Research Council); Volvo Research and Education Foundation Bus Rapid Transit (BRT+) Centre of Excellence,"This paper was motivated by a presentation the author gave to a major projects conference in Sydney in November 2017 and subsequent comments by many stakeholders in Sydney (especially Transport for NSW), who encouraged the author to write up the presentation.

All vagueness-based accounts of the SIA have hitherto assumed the truth of supervaluationism, but supervaluationism has some well-known problems. This paper explores the implications of epistemicism, a leading rival theory. We argue that if epistemicism is true, then options are comparable in small improvement cases. Moreover, even if SIAs do not exploit vagueness, if epistemicism is true, then options cannot be on a par. The epistemicist account of the SIA has an advantage over leading existing rival accounts of the SIA because it accounts for higher-order hard cases.","[Flanigan, Edmund Tweedy] Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, 1737 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02143 USA; [Halstead, John] Founders Pledge, 58 Geldeston Rd, London E5 8SB, England",Harvard University,"Flanigan, ET (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, 1737 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02143 USA.",eflanigan@g.harvard.edu; john.halstead309@gmail.com,,"Flanigan, Edmund/0000-0003-1878-722X",,,,,30,3,3,0,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

These copulas allow for new time series models that have the same serial dependence structure as a state space model, but with an arbitrary marginal distribution, and flexible density forecasts. We examine the time series properties of the copulas, outline serial dependence measures, and estimate the models using likelihood-based methods. Copulas constructed from three example state space models are considered: a stochastic volatility model with an unobserved component, a Markov switching autoregression, and a Gaussian linear unobserved component model. We show that all three inversion copulas with flexible margins improve the fit and density forecasts of quarterly U.S. broad inflation and electricity inflation.

This led to significant changes in access to labor courts for many workers and employers who had to travel further to proceed with conflict litigation. We use this reform to evaluate how access to labor courts affects the labor market. Our empirical approach mainly relies on regression-adjusted conditional differences-in-differences estimations. We find that cities that experienced an increase in the distance to their associated labor court suffered from a lower growth rate of job creation (-4 percentage points), job destruction (-4.6 pp) and firm creation (-6.3 pp) between 2007 and 2012 compared to unaffected cities. We find opposite but insignificant effects for cities that experienced a fall in the distance to the labor court.

One policy action that can potentially change travel behavior is increasing infill development, particularly if that development is located near the center of a major metropolitan region. This study examines the influence of a large-scale, infill development, Atlantic Station, which opened in 2005 just west of Midtown Atlanta. The study uses propensity scores and differences-in-differences research designs to identify how travel patterns changed for new residents and for existing residents of the area around Atlantic Station, respectively. Atlantic Station reduced vehicle miles traveled and increased alternative mode share for its new residents, but it did not reduce the vehicle miles traveled or increase alternative mode share for the existing residents of the area around Atlantic Station.

Understanding the diffusion of carsharing services,TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Carsharing; Adoption; Technology diffusion; Shared-mobility,CAR OWNERSHIP; PREFERENCE; SYSTEMS; IMPACTS,"Carsharing (CS) has gained attention as a measure to reduce vehicle ownership, motivate multimodal mobility and cut greenhouse gases and other pollutants. Some municipalities have adopted specific regulations to support adoption of CS. Initial studies, reflecting outcomes from early adopters, have confirmed the expected effects of CS on reduced car ownership and GHG emissions associated with mobility. This study addresses three questions: a) are early adopters sensitive to one-way vs. two-way carsharing? b) do early and late adopters have different household characteristics? and c) can outcomes associated with early adopters be projected onto later adopters? Our study is based on a 2013 survey of residents in 110 apartment buildings in Metro Vancouver, Canada. 2011 responses were analyzed for possible differentiating factors for early adopters at the household level. We find that early adopters (24% of respondents) have more wage-earners per household, live with fewer older family members in neighbourhoods with better CS access and own fewer cars. Among non-CS membership holders (76% of respondents), roughly one-third stated they would never choose CS. The rest expressed interest in joining if CS accessibility was improved and usage/membership fees were lowered. These households are dissimilar to early adopters; they are more likely to live with elderly family members and to own automobile(s) while less likely to have multiple wage earners in their households. The specific characteristics and circumstances of early CS adopters mean that as CS memberships expand, the past patterns of vehicle utilization, car-shedding, vehicle kilometres travelled shifts, and greenhouse gas reductions may not be replicated. Further investigations are required before concluding that the long-term effects of CS services align with observed benefits to date.","[Namazu, Michiko; Dowlatabadi, Hadi] Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, AERL Bldg 429-2202 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [MacKenzie, Don] Univ Washington, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, More Hall 121B, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Zerriffi, Hisham] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Resources Management, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",University of British Columbia; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of British Columbia,"Namazu, M (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, AERL Bldg 429-2202 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",michiko.namazu@alumni.ubc.ca; dwhm@uw.edu; hisham.zerriffi@ubc.ca; hadi.d@ubc.ca,,"Zerriffi, Hisham/0000-0003-4890-2575","Metro Vancouver; Takenaka Scholarship Foundation from Japan; Carnegie Mellon's Climate and Energy Decision Making Center (CEDM) under US National Science Foundation [SES-1463492]; Canada Research Chairs; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1463492] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Metro Vancouver; Takenaka Scholarship Foundation from Japan; Carnegie Mellon's Climate and Energy Decision Making Center (CEDM) under US National Science Foundation; Canada Research Chairs(Canada Research ChairsCGIAR); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",We would like to acknowledge support from Metro Vancouver for this study.

Most proponents of pricing propose an impersonal and anonymous allocation mechanism based on the willingness-to-pay of the person who travels. This view builds on the concept of private property rights and we confront this view with a different conception of rights, one based on needs. Furthermore, we discuss the results of an illustrative experiment in which respondents allocate access rights to hypothetical travellers.

The amount of disclosure required for a fair process is a question of law, but I argue that the answer to the legal question depends heavily on the practical realities of applying economics and using econometrics in cases. Using examples from recent competition cases, I consider (i) what disclosure is required for a competition authority or court to operate a genuinely fair process, and (ii) the extent to which recent trends in the availability and use of data are changing the extent and nature of the disclosure (at least to advisers) required in competition investigations. The trend towards greater disclosure in UK competition investigations seems likely to play out in other jurisdictions, within both litigation and competition proceedings because economic analyses on cases are increasingly using empirical evidence developed using ever-bigger datasets. Judicial oversight of competition authorities should support this process.","[Davis, Peter] Cornerstone Res London Off, London, England",,"Davis, P (通讯作者)，Cornerstone Res London Off, London, England.",PDavis@cornerstone.com,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

The recent development of the theory of team reasoning addresses this by suggesting that interacting players in games may sometimes reason as members of a team - a group of individuals who act together in the attainment of some common goal. A number of properties have been suggested for team-reasoning decision-makers' goals to satisfy, but a few formal representations have been discussed. In this paper we suggest a possible representation of these goals based on the notion of mutual advantage. We propose a method for measuring extents of individual and mutual advantage to the interacting decision-makers, and define team interests as the attainment of outcomes associated with maximum mutual advantage in the games they play.","[Karpus, Jurgis] Kings Coll London, Dept Philosophy, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Radzvilas, Mantas] London Sch Econ, Dept Philosophy Log & Sci Method, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; King's College London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Karpus, J (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept Philosophy, London WC2R 2LS, England.",jurgis.karpus@kcl.ac.uk; m.radzvilas@lse.ac.uk,"Karpus, Jurgis/IXD-5348-2023","Karpus, Jurgis/0000-0001-7408-9982",European Research Council under the European Union / ERC [283849]; European Research Council (ERC) [283849] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council under the European Union / ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We would particularly like to thank Yair Antler, Jason Alexander, Garth Baughman, Mike Coxhead, Ben Davies, Julien Dutant, Natalie Gold, Clayton Littlejohn, David Pappineau, Klemens Puppe, Andis Sofianos, Robert Sugden, Spyros Terovitis, James Thom, EdwardWebb, and Nicolas Wuthrich for their invaluable comments and suggestions on various earlier versions of this work.

In this paper, we test that intuition within a generalized Polya urn model. We find that if we assume constant feedbacks, in the long run, higher quality products dominate the market regardless of initial market shares, contradicting the common wisdom. However, when we allow for variable feedbacks, initial advantages persist almost indefinitely. Thus, the choice of whether to rush to market or focus on quality depends on market characteristics such as whether the positive feedbacks result from more consistent returns to scale or from more variable social influences.","[Lamberson, P.

As the downstream firms respond to higher input prices by locating further away from the center of the market, constraining them to locate within the linear city allows the upstream manufacturers better to exploit the downstream industry. This leads to higher final good prices and lower consumer welfare (despite the savings on transportation). This result - which is robust to the inclusion of R&D decisions - is in sharp contrast to the case in which the sellers are vertically integrated. Also different, the incentive to invest in cost-reducing R&D is always insufficient compared with the social optimum. Our results thus suggest the importance of taking into account the vertical market structure in formulating zoning (product standard) and R&D policies.","[Li, Youping] East China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, 130 Meilong Rd, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China; [Shuai, Jie] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Wenlan Sch Business, East Lake High Tech Dev Zone, 182 Nanhu Ave, Wuhan 430073, Peoples R China",East China University of Science & Technology; Zhongnan University of Economics & Law,"Shuai, J (通讯作者)，Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Wenlan Sch Business, East Lake High Tech Dev Zone, 182 Nanhu Ave, Wuhan 430073, Peoples R China.",liyouping@ecust.edu.cn; shuaijie@gmail.com,,"Shuai, Jie/0000-0003-1922-1033","National Science Foundation of China [71603083, 71603283]",National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We are indebted to the editor, Lawrence J.

It examines whether characteristics of IT professionals (i.e. age, gender, experience, educational level, and type of organization) influence their ethical attitudes or not. Moreover, it examines whether organizational ethical culture (OEC) moderates the relationships between IT professionals' ethical attitudes and their characteristics and backgrounds. A questionnaire was designed to collect data from 380 IT professionals in public and private organizations in Jordan. Results showed that there was a high level of concern among IT professionals regarding the issues of privacy, piracy, accuracy and access. Significant differences were found between males and females regarding the issues of privacy and piracy. Results also indicated that ethical attitudes towards the issues of privacy, piracy and accuracy were affected by educational level. Moderating analyses revealed that ethical culture moderates the relationship between level of education and ethical attitudes of the respondents towards accuracy. Based on these results, some implications and recommendations were made.","[Al-Shaikh, Fuad N.; Nusir, Sawsan; Abu Haifa, Wesam] Yarmouk Univ, Irbid, Jordan",Yarmouk University,"Al-Shaikh, FN (通讯作者)，Yarmouk Univ, Irbid, Jordan.",eco_fshaikh@yu.edu.jo; sawsan_n@yu.edu.jo; wesam@yu.edujo@yu.edu.jo,,,,,,,52,0,0,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,1158,1178,,,,,,21,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553202020,0

Using panel data econometric techniques, the significance of each factor and the impact of its change on emissions are identified. A better knowledge of the key driving forces is crucial for implementing policies focused on successfully reducing emissions in transport activity.

We compared and analysed the overall order of enterprises based on the calculated financial analysis indicators using TOPSIS and PROMETHEE methods. Each method uses a different approach, which means that the results can often differ from one another. In a PROMETHEE method we do not count with specific value of criteria (indicator), but, we assign functions to two pair of criteria that return the value from the interval <0.1> so we found out that this method is suitable for cases of large fluctuations within the criteria.

At the same time, several shifts in global migration flows have occurred, consequently driving the European Union from net emigration area to net immigration area, with almost three folds larger share of international immigrants in total population in comparison to the global average. The eastern enlargements of the European Union in the early 2000s, which included post-transitional countries at different stages of development in comparison to old member states, significantly affected the stock of migrants in the European Union and, in addition, also the labour markets on both sides. The objective of the paper is to examine the determinants of migration flows that followed the process of European Union enlargement since 2004, which was followed by the liberalisation of migration through removing restrictions to labour markets at different periods of time in different member states. The research will be conducted using the panel data analysis which includes several pull and push factors including economic, geographical, cultural and demographic determinants of migration flows from new European Union member states to old European Union member states, together with estimating the effects of changes in immigration policies within the accession period. The results of the analysis will enable better understanding of migration flows determinants, as an essential prerequisite for estimating future migration flows and their overall potential effects, together with effects on origin and destination countries.","[Franc, Sanja; Casni, Anita Ceh; Barisic, Antea] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, JF Kennedy Sq 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Franc, S (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, JF Kennedy Sq 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",sfranc@efzg.hr; aceh@efzg.hr; abarisic@efzg.hr,"Časni, Anita Čeh/H-9236-2018","Časni, Anita Čeh/0000-0002-2742-8619",,,,,0,0,0,0,4,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,2123,2123,,,,,,1,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553203020,0

Context of research has been created by a noticeable change of a debt mix among biggest companies in Polish economy over last decade resulting in a growth of bond debt in total composition of debt instruments. Author provides the qualitative analysis of information disclosures and focuses on verification whether financial disclosures provided in financial reports based on IFRS have evolved and improved over last decade. Growing scale of funding by bonds is a new situation for transition economies where majority of financing comes traditionally from banks. In many cases banks use their privileged situation to neutralize the asymmetry of information and are able to make areal impact on companies' operating and strategic decisions, which creates the regulating role of banking system in the economy. Observed trend of replacing bank debt with bonds, mostly publicly traded, switches off the regulating role of debt providers. The question is: do borrowers provide sufficient information not only to allow overall understanding and forecasting the future company's cash flows (which is the inherent element of the theoretically declared purpose of financial reporting), but what is even more crucial, do financial disclosures allow understanding if these cash flows will be sufficient to service the upcoming financing payments - the very basic driver of financial liquidity and consequently company's or entire holding's going concern?","[Hasik, Wojciech] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Management Comp Sci & Finance, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Hasik, W (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Management Comp Sci & Finance, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",wojciech.hasik@ue.wroc.pl,,,,,,,15,4,4,0,3,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Labour shortages force companies to compete for employees with other organizations. One of the major factors in this fight can be the employee benefits on offer. Is that really the case? The first part of the paper is devoted to the analysis of the unemployment rate in the EU and the Czech Republic. The second part of the article focuses on employee benefits from several selected perspectives. The results show that the offer of employee benefits is certainly not a significant factor influencing the labour market situation. Social benefits make up only a very small percentage of total labour costs and their amount does not increase. The existence of an offer of employee benefits and their amount is additionally dependent on the size of the organization. Although employee satisfaction with employee benefits is very low, data from the CSO shows that labour shortages are more pronounced in wages that have been growing for a long time. In the context of the research question, it can be said that in the Czech Republic, the low rate of unemployment did not have a major impact on the offer of employee benefits during the reviewed period.","[Hedvicakova, Martina] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Econ, Rokitanskeho 62, Hradec Kralove 50003 3, Czech Republic; [Sokolova, Marcela; Mohelska, Hana] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Management, Rokitanskeho 62, Hradec Kralove 50003 3, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove; University of Hradec Kralove,"Hedvicakova, M (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Econ, Rokitanskeho 62, Hradec Kralove 50003 3, Czech Republic.",martina.hedvicakova@uhk.cz; marcela.sokolova@uhk.cz; hana.mohelska@uhk.cz,"Mohelska, Hana/F-9896-2019; Sokolová, Marcela/B-3452-2012; Hedvicakova, Martina/G-4603-2019","Mohelska, Hana/0000-0003-0441-0712; Sokolová, Marcela/0000-0002-0641-7750; Hedvicakova, Martina/0000-0001-9751-8292","University of Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic [6/2018]","University of Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic","The paper was written with the support of the specific project 6/2018 grant DETERMINANTS OF COGNITIVE PROCESSES IMPACTING THE WORK PERFORMANCE granted by the University of Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic and thanks to help of student Monika Bednarova and Eliska Conkova.",,25,3,3,0,5,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

This confirmed importance of strategic roles of middle managers has opened several avenues of research in different domains. Specifically, in the field of human resource management, there is a relevant question about how HR managers can help middle managers to play effectively their strategic roles. In this perspective, this research has measured the effects of practices used by human resource managers towards middle managers and their effects on strategic roles of middle managers in emerging market companies. The results show the existence of significant and positive effects of specific human resource practices on strategic roles of middle managers. Participation in decisions and team/group incentives are used towards middle managers and influence all strategic roles of middle managers.

Official figures show that net migration from the Eastern European countries which have joined the European Union since 2004 rose sharply. The negative view on migrants from Eastern Europe relies on the fact that these migrants are a major burden for the British social and healthcare system. At the same time, however, the issue of modern slavery is being discussed, based on the fact that East European migrants are willing to work under undignified working conditions in the UK. The aim of the paper is to build up a picture of the economic status of East European migrants in the UK labour market.

As the conclusion, the expected changes in migration after the UK's leaving the European Union scheduled for April 2019, is given.","[Kotynkova, Magdalena] Econ Univ Prague, Sq W Churchill 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",,"Kotynková, M (通讯作者)，Econ Univ Prague, Sq W Churchill 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",kotynkovm@seznam.cz,,,"Internal grant agency of the University of Economics, Prague [IGS F5/12/2018]","Internal grant agency of the University of Economics, Prague","The paper resulted from the grant -financial support of the Internal grant agency of the University of Economics, Prague IGS F5/12/2018.",,13,0,0,0,7,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2281-4,,,,2018,,,,,,,173,183,,,,,,11,Demography; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BO2HN,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000505804100016,0

We incorporated work to family enrichment as mediator and family role salience as moderator in conditional indirect effect paths. Primary data were collected through the survey questionnaire in dyads from the employees and their immediate supervisors (N = 401). The results showed that the main and conditional indirect effects of emotional and instrumental family related social supports from coworkers were positive and significant on both ICBs (person and task focused). In comparison to instrumental support, the main effect of emotional support was more on person focused ICB. Whereas, in comparison to emotional support, the main effect of instrumental support was more on task focused ICB, as hypothesized. Work to family enrichment was found as mediator and family role salience as moderator in conditional indirect effect paths. This study establishes work family enrichment as a bridge in the social exchange process. The resources of emotional and instrumental family related support form coworkers' engendered work to family enrichment, which in turn created the sense of obligation in the employees to reciprocate by performing person and task focused interpersonal citizenship behavior in the workplace. Further the employees high on family role salience experienced work to family enrichment more, due to support resources, and in turn reciprocated more interpersonal citizenship behaviors. Overall, this study contributed by examining a moderated mediation model, by testing work to family enrichment as mediator and family role salience as the boundary condition in relationship between two specific types of social support (i.e., emotional and instrumental) and two specific types of interpersonal citizenship behavior (i.e., person and task focused).","[Kumar, Aneel; Channa, Khalil Ahmed; Bhutto, Niaz Ahmed] Sukkur Inst Business Adm, Sukkur, Pakistan",,"Kumar, A (通讯作者)，Sukkur Inst Business Adm, Sukkur, Pakistan.",aneelkumar.phd@iba-suk.edu.pk; khalilchanna@iba-suk.edu.pk; niaz@iba-suk.edu.pk,"CHANNA, KHALIL AHMED/K-5171-2019; CHANNA, KHALLIL AHMED/Y-9067-2018","CHANNA, KHALIL AHMED/0000-0002-8038-2939; Kumar, Aneel/0000-0003-2350-2102",,,,,54,0,1,2,20,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Even though previous studies on Western business culture have adequately conceptualized operations family businesses, a huge knowledge vacuum and/or several inconsistencies are shown in Eastern business culture in case of survival and longevity of family businesses. Studies from both cultures commonly affirm that family businesses outperform over non-family firms in the short run. Similarly, most studies from Western business culture assure that family businesses are suffering from business survival problem in the long run. Contradicting to this research finding emerged in Western business culture, most Sri Lankan family businesses are reported surviving over generation from the inception. As a result, a requirement of an academic analysis of Sri Lanka family businesses has emerged. Twenty two interviews from twelve family businesses (cases) facilitated an understanding of how family members become dedicated partners of the business and contribute to its survival. Respondents were either managers or owners. Purposive sampling techniques facilitated to select respondents from respective cases. Interviews indicated that education and business challenges motivate family members to remain strongly engaged in the business, as do familial bonds and the subsequent tacit knowledge. Further, respondents revealed the interdependence of business success and the personal success of family members. Therefore, family businesses in the context of Sri Lankan business culture have experienced above-average durations of business survival in comparison to Western business culture.","[Kuruppuge, Ravindra Hewa; Gregar, Ales] Tomas Bata Univ, Fac Management & Econ, Dept Management & Mkt, Zlin, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Kuruppuge, RH (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ, Fac Management & Econ, Dept Management & Mkt, Zlin, Czech Republic.",kuruppuge@yahoo.com; gregar@fame.utb.cz,"Kuruppuge, Ravindra Hewa/AAL-2333-2020","Kuruppuge, Ravindra Hewa/0000-0002-9456-4071; Gregar, Ales/0000-0001-9939-5222",Internal Grant Agency of FaME TBU [IGA/FaME/2016/001],Internal Grant Agency of FaME TBU,"Authors of this article are thankful to the Internal Grant Agency of FaME TBU No. IGA/FaME/2016/001: Enhancing Business Performance through Employees' Knowledge Sharing, for financial support to carry out this research.",,54,0,2,16,80,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Even though shared suppliers have refined capabilities, they may act as hubs for knowledge transfers, exposing their clients to the risk of knowledge leakages to their competitors. Building on Transaction Cost Theory, we argue that a client's ability to benefit from having a shared supplier will be dependent on the appropriability regime of the outsourcing location, whose effectiveness depends on the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) protection within the country, and the tacit and specific nature of the service outsourced. Using primary data at the transaction level from a survey to 170 technology-intensive firms from the EU and the U.S., we find that sharing R&D suppliers with competitors appear to mimic some of the advantages and disadvantages of being collocated with them, especially in countries offering weak IPR protection.","[Martinez-Noya, Andrea; Garcia-Canal, Esteban] Univ Oviedo, Fac Econ & Business, Oviedo, Spain",University of Oviedo,"Martínez-Noya, A (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Fac Econ & Business, Oviedo, Spain.",noya@uniovi.es,"García-Canal, Esteban/AAH-2675-2020; Martinez-Noya, Andrea/K-6605-2017","García-Canal, Esteban/0000-0002-1436-9808; Martinez-Noya, Andrea/0000-0002-7153-6078",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Ministerio de Economia y Competividad) [ECO2013-46235-R],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Ministerio de Economia y Competividad),We gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Ministerio de Economia y Competividad) project reference: ECO2013-46235-R.,,102,23,24,7,59,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Using data from two large-scale District-Level Household Surveys (2002-2004 and 2007-2008), we employ difference-in-difference and fixed-effect regression models to compare the outcomes across earthquake-affected districts and their neighboring districts during 5 years before and after the earthquake. We find that the earthquake led to significant rises in childbirth rates. It also reduced birth spacing among uneducated, tribal, and Muslim women, and the incidence of male births among rural women. We find considerable variation in the demographic effects of the earthquake across location, household socioeconomic status, and parental age and education.","[Nandi, Arindam] Univ Chicago, Tata Ctr Dev, 1155 East 60th St,Ste 285, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Nandi, Arindam] Ctr Dis Dynam Econ & Policy, Washington, DC 20005 USA; [Mazumdar, Sumit] Inst Publ Hlth, Kalyani, W Bengal, India; [Behrman, Jere R.] Univ Penn, Dept Econ, McNeil 160,3718 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Behrman, Jere R.] Univ Penn, Dept Sociol, McNeil 160,3718 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Behrman, Jere R.] Univ Penn, Ctr Populat Studies, McNeil 160,3718 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Chicago; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania,"Nandi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Tata Ctr Dev, 1155 East 60th St,Ste 285, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.;Nandi, A (通讯作者)，Ctr Dis Dynam Econ & Policy, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",anandi@uchicago.edu; sumitmazumdar@gmail.com; jbehrman@econ.upenn.edu,"Behrman, Jere R/A-9734-2009","Nandi, Arindam/0000-0002-3967-2424",,,,,57,48,55,1,44,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

The development of segments is assessed through the indicator of gross value added (in current prices) and employment in the period 1995 to 2017. The situation of the Baltic countries is confronted with the situation in the EU15.We note that the structure of the Baltic countries differs from that of the EU15. The difference is that the service segment has significantly increased its share in value added in the EU15 countries, while a relatively large share of manufacturing industry and also agriculture continues to remain in the Baltic economy. However, the share of services is slowly rising. This divergent development contributes to the structural gap between the Baltic and EU15 countries ranging from 2 to almost 8%.

Among other aspects, MACS information outputs will be analysed in terms of the style of use, its nature and the type of decision. In an attempt to broaden the scope of MACS functions, the paper reviews the MACS literature and provides a theoretical framework for studying the operationalization of MACS. The results obtained indicate that, to operationalise the MACS concept, we can resort to the way the information used is managed and characterised, establishing three categories and six different dimensions. Theoretically, this framework allows us to characterise the existing MACS and to analyse its impact on the company's strategy. In the future, we intend to develop some case studies to analyse its impact on the companies' internationalisation strategy.","[Roque, Ana Filipa M.; Alves, Maria-Ceu G.; Raposo, Mario] Univ Beira Interior, NECE Res Ctr Business Sci, Covilha, Portugal",Universidade da Beira Interior,"Roque, AFM (通讯作者)，Univ Beira Interior, NECE Res Ctr Business Sci, Covilha, Portugal.",anaroque@ubi.pt; mceu@ubi.pt; mraposo@ubi.pt,"Alves, Maria do Céu Gaspar/F-9759-2015; Raposo, Mário Lino Barata/C-8186-2012","Alves, Maria do Céu Gaspar/0000-0003-1608-1872; Raposo, Mário Lino Barata/0000-0001-6213-5355; Roque, Ana Filipa/0000-0002-8712-6065",FCT - Foundation for Science and Technology [UID/GES/04630/2013],FCT - Foundation for Science and Technology(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),The authors would like to thank the funding obtained through the FCT - Foundation for Science and Technology under the project UID/GES/04630/2013.,,52,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,1740,1748,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553202084,0

National regulations and literature go hand in hand with the globalisation processes and play inevitable role in every part of our lives. The vocabulary of a certain country depends on many features: historical, geographical, national, political, and others. Many linguistic analyses imply that there is a similar nature among Slavic languages but these analyses usually didn't involve specific professional vocabulary. The goal of the paper is to examine the level of similarities and differences between the selected professional languages from the Slavic language family in the field of basic accounting terminology. Further, authors test the level of languages' intelligibility among the neighbouring countries. Our research includes following Slavic languages: Croatian, Slovenian, Bosnian, Serbian, Montenegrin, Macedonian, Bulgarian, Slovak, Check, Polish and Russian. The research methodology includes theoretical analysis of main linguistic opinion regarding similarities between the selected languages; word translation method which includes the selection and translation of certain accounting terms. Based on that, the comparative analysis of accounting terminology's correspondence and divergence is performed. Besides, authors explore the linkage between the most similar languages. Findings confirm the notable level of similarities in accounting terms among the tested languages and intelligility among the neighbouring countries.","[Sacer, Ivana Mamic; Tusek, Boris; Zager, Lajos] Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Sacer, IM (通讯作者)，Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia.",imamic@efzg.hr; btusek@efzg.hr; lzager@efzg.hr,"Sačer, Ivana Mamić/H-9069-2018; Tusek, Boris/H-9445-2018",,Croatian Science Foundation under the project Construction of Croatian Accounting Terminology [Struna-2017-09-03],Croatian Science Foundation under the project Construction of Croatian Accounting Terminology,This work has been fully supported by Croatian Science Foundation under the project Construction of Croatian Accounting Terminology (Struna-2017-09-03).,,16,0,0,0,4,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,634,645,,,,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553201013,0

Data set for this research consists of 191 SMEs from Croatia. Structural equation modelling is used for identification of direct and indirect influences on SME growth. Results showed that entrepreneurial orientation, SME age, export, internal financial resources and corruption have direct effect on SME growth while risk taking propensity, customer orientation, growth aspiration and innovativeness have indirect effect on growth through entrepreneurial orientation. Implications of this study are of value to SME owners, managers as well as scholars by indicating growth as the volitional activity exerted through SME's entrepreneurial orientation. The SME increases entrepreneurial orientation by anticipating changes in consumers' needs, by introducing innovative products and services ahead of competitors. In addition, owner/manager's risk taking propensity and intentional growth attitudes of the SME indicate types of activities that are important for entrepreneurial orientation.","[Sarlija, Natasa; Pfeifer, Sanja] Univ JJ Strossmayer Osijek, Fac Econ, Gajev Trg 7, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Sarlija, N (通讯作者)，Univ JJ Strossmayer Osijek, Fac Econ, Gajev Trg 7, Osijek, Croatia.",natasa@efos.hr; pfeifer@efos.hr,,"Sarlija, Natasa/0000-0003-2600-9735; Pfeifer, Sanja/0000-0002-7394-3080",Croatian Science Foundation [3933],Croatian Science Foundation,This work is funded by Croatian Science Foundation under Grant No. 3933 Development and application of growth potential prediction models for SMEs in Croatia.,,48,0,0,0,4,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,3170,3183,,,,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO7SQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000525490800029,0

We use a partial equilibrium model based on intertemporal optimization to estimate the impacts of carbon price (the tax/subsidy rate) on timber harvest volume and price in different time periods and on the change of forest carbon stock over time. The results show that a higher carbon price would lead to higher forest carbon stocks. The tax/subsidy induced annual net carbon sequestration is declining over time. The net carbon sequestration during 2015-2050 would increase by 30.2 to 218.3 million tonnes of CO2, when carbon price increases from 170 SEK to 1428 SEK per tonne of CO2. The associated cost, in terms of reduced total benefits of timber and other non-timber goods, ranges from 80 SEK to 105.8 SEK per tonne of CO2. The change in carbon sequestration (as compared with the baseline case) beyond 2050 is small when carbon price is 680 SEK per tonne of CO2 or lower. With a carbon price of 1428 SEK per tonne of CO2, carbon sequestration will increase by 70 million tonnes of CO2 from the baseline level during 2050-2070, and by 64 million tonnes during 2070-2170.

Sectarian violence engulfed Indonesia in the late 1990s after the fall of the New Order, largely as a result of resource competition and other economic factors. In addition, the revival of customary forms of authority through the national indigenous peoples movement exacerbated the potential for conflict between long-settled indigenes and more recent migrants. A case study shows how the spread of communal conflict to the Lindu plain in Central Sulawesi was averted despite the sectarian violence in a nearby city. Local customary procedures of adjudication were insufficient to cope with such issues in a multiethnic context, as the ethnic groups in the area did not all subscribe to the same body of custom (adat). Instead, a diverse assembly of stakeholders invoked nationalist idioms of harmony and consensus to forge an agreement to avoid violence. Previous legal theorists have pointed to adat as a preexisting respository of restorative justice practices. However, this article argues that interethnic contexts require restorative practice to forge novel syntheses to deal with communal violence. Such syntheses may incorporate adat mechanisms, but they must also integrate other tools that gain the allegiance of multiple groups to work toward reconciliation and avoidance of further violence.","[Acciaioli, Greg] Univ Western Australia, Anthropol & Sociol, Nedlands, WA, Australia; [Acciaioli, Greg] Univ Western Australia, Int Dev, Nedlands, WA, Australia",University of Western Australia; University of Western Australia,"Acciaioli, G (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Anthropol & Sociol, Nedlands, WA, Australia.;Acciaioli, G (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Int Dev, Nedlands, WA, Australia.",gregory.acciaioli@uwa.edu.au,,"Acciaioli, Gregory/0000-0002-4070-5545",Australian Research Council [DP0211816]; Australian Research Council [DP0211816] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"I wish to thank the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) for sponsoring the research upon which this article is based, as well as all the informants at Lindu, both indigenous To Lindu and migrants, for their openness and support.

We show that this methodology is particularly suited to model the goal distribution of a football team and provides a good forecast performance that can be exploited to develop a profitable betting strategy. This paper improves the strand of literature on Poisson-based models, by proposing a specification able to capture the main characteristics of goal distribution. The betting strategy is based on the idea that the odds proposed by the market do not reflect the true probability of the match because they may also incorporate the betting volumes or strategic price settings in order to exploit betters' biases. The out-of-sample performance of the PARX model is better than the reference approach by Dixon and Coles (Applied Statistics, 1997, 46(2), 265-280). We also evaluate our approach in a simple betting strategy, which is applied to English football Premier League data for the 2013-2014, 2014-2015, and 2015-2016 seasons. The results show that the return from the betting strategy is larger than 30% in most of the cases considered and may even exceed 100% if we consider an alternative strategy based on a predetermined threshold, which makes it possible to exploit the inefficiency of the betting market.","[Angelini, Giovanni; De Angelis, Luca] Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, Econometr, Bologna, Italy; [De Angelis, Luca] Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, Via Belle Arti 41, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; Univ Bologna, Sch Econ Management & Stat, Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna; University of Bologna; University of Bologna,"De Angelis, L (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, Via Belle Arti 41, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",l.deangelis@unibo.it,"Angelini, Giovanni/AAZ-3088-2021","ANGELINI, GIOVANNI/0000-0003-3000-9885; DE ANGELIS, LUCA/0000-0003-3222-2620",,,,,32,25,25,4,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

In 2011, Google integrated its comparison site for flight fares (Google Flights) and restaurant ratings (from a recent acquisition of Zagat) into Google's search results. I find that Google's integration of Google Flights led to a reduction in clicks to competing travel agencies for general searches. The acquisition of Zagat's restaurant ratings led to an increase in clicks, regardless of the content of the search term. The contrasting findings may be explained by the fact that Google Flights provides price information and therefore directly competes with other online travel agents while Google Zagat provides quality information, which may encourage more search on competing review sites.","[Chiou, Lesley] Occidental Coll, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USA",Occidental College,"Chiou, L (通讯作者)，Occidental Coll, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USA.",,,,,,,,58,4,4,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

In this explorative study, we assumed that hiking the INT encompasses both universalistic aspects of hiking, in its capacity as a mobility system shared by hikers of long-distance trails worldwide, and particularistic aspects of hiking, that can be identified through the scientific research of hiking using concepts such as place attachment', sense of place', state and nation building', and 'socialisation of civic consciousness', within the particularistic framework of Israeli nationhood, culture, and history. The first stage of our research was the formulation and distribution of a questionnaire aimed at assessing hiker motivation and the nature and features of their hiking mobility on the route, including spatiotemporal dimensions, experiences and behavior, and place identity and sense of place. Altogether, 210 questionnaires were completed by hikers on the INT over a one-year period, from March 2013 to March 2014. Overall, our analysis of the findings through the lens of Parson's particularism vs. universalism pattern variable revealed hiking the INT to be a mobility system characterized by many of the general, universalistic aspects of hiking, but also, and perhaps most notably, by a number of particularistic aspects that are key to understanding the unique role of hiking in Israeli society.","[Collins-Kreiner, Noga; Kliot, Nurit] Univ Haifa, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel",University of Haifa,"Collins-Kreiner, N (通讯作者)，Univ Haifa, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.",nogack@geo.haifa.ac.il; nuritk@geo.haifa.ac.il,"Collins-Kreiner, Noga/AAB-5154-2021; Collins-Kreiner, Noga/AAR-9926-2021","Collins-Kreiner, Noga/0000-0002-9221-7260;",,,,,55,23,23,3,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

In April 2012 Nottingham became the first UK City to implement such a scheme with the revenue generated hypothecated for funding transport improvements. The lag between the introduction of the WPL and the opening of related public transport improvements represents an opportunity to study the impact of a WPL on congestion as a standalone measure. In order to achieve this it is necessary to consider changes to variables external to the WPL, which also impact on congestion, which may obscure any beneficial impact of the scheme. An autoregressive time series model which accounts for the impact of these exogenous variables is used to evaluate the impact of the introduction of the WPL on congestion. Delay per Vehicle Mile is used as the dependent variable to represent congestion while the number of Liable Workplace Parking Places (LWPP) is used as a continuous intervention variable representing the introduction of the WPL. The model also contains a number of economic, transportation and climatic control variables. The results indicate that the introduction of the WPL as measured by the number of LWPP has a statistically significant impact on traffic congestion in Nottingham. Additionally, external explanatory variables are also shown to impact on congestion, suggesting that these may be masking the true impact of the scheme. This research represents the first statistical analysis of the link between the introduction of a WPL and a reduction in congestion.","[Dale, Simon; Frost, Matthew; Ison, Stephen; Quddus, Mohammed] Loughborough Univ, Ctr Innovat & Collaborat Construct Engn, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England; [Dale, Simon; Warren, Peter] Nottingham City Council, Highway Metr Team, Loxley House,Stn St, Nottingham NG2 3NG, England",Loughborough University,"Dale, S (通讯作者)，Loughborough Univ, Ctr Innovat & Collaborat Construct Engn, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",simon.dale@nottinghamcity.gov.uk; M.W.Frost@lboro.ac.uk; S.G.Ison@lboro.ac.uk; peter.warren@nottinghamcity.gov.uk,,,,,,,41,14,14,2,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Although the clear majority of routes is operated on a monopoly basis, competition does play a key role on routes with a sufficiently large base of (potential) customers. From a spatial perspective, three years after deregulation, the entire interurban bus network connects 60 percent of all 644 larger German cities with the intensity of entry being dependent on the number of inhabitants, average income, the share of under 24 years old and the presence of intermodal competition by intercity railway services.","[Duerr, Niklas S.; Hueschelrath, Kai] ZEW Ctr European Econ Res, Competit & Regulat Res Grp, POB 10 34 43, D-68034 Mannheim, Germany; [Duerr, Niklas S.; Hueschelrath, Kai] MaCCl Mannheim Ctr Competit & Innovat, POB 10 34 43, D-68034 Mannheim, Germany; [Hueschelrath, Kai] Univ Mannheim, L7,3-5, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); University of Mannheim,"Hüschelrath, K (通讯作者)，ZEW Ctr European Econ Res, Competit & Regulat Res Grp, POB 10 34 43, D-68034 Mannheim, Germany.",duerr@zew.de; hueschelrath@zew.de,,,,,,,24,10,10,0,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

The light-handed regulation (LHR), as in place at Australia's top four airports, has been suggested as the 'frontier of international policy', leading to increasing interest among transport policymakers and researchers. This article offers an in-depth examination of the LHR with focus on a) the market power of the regulated airports, b) the commercial price negotiations between airports and airlines, and c) the airports' behaviour towards infrastructure investment. The article reports on data from 21 semi-structured interviews conducted with key stakeholder groups affected by, or with expertise in, the LHR. Findings suggest that despite airports possessing significant market power, particularly in the domestic market, the light-handed approach seems to balance the forces in a market where an airline duopoly prevails (Qantas and Virgin Australia groups). In addition, both airports and airlines perceive that commercial price negotiations are improving and refrain from a return to a stronger regulation environment. For airlines, value-for-money is the primary concern in new infrastructure investments. Interviewees also outlined specific recommendations for improving the LHR framework, including a more accessible arbitrator and improved methodologies to monitor prices and quality of service. The findings point towards the significance of vertical relationships, long-term arrangements, and transparency as key aspects of the LHR and the development of airport infrastructure.","[Lohmann, Gui] Griffith Univ, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Trischler, Jakob] Karlstad Univ, CTF Serv Res Ctr, Univ Gatan 2, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden",Griffith University; Karlstad University,"Lohmann, G (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Nathan, Qld, Australia.",g.lohmann@griffith.edu.au; jakob.trischler@gmx.net,"Lohmann, Gui/AAL-3457-2021; Lohmann, Gui/ABC-3019-2020","Lohmann, Gui/0000-0002-3374-9734; Lohmann, Gui/0000-0002-3374-9734; Trischler, Jakob/0000-0002-2887-2463",Queensland Airports Ltd (QAL),Queensland Airports Ltd (QAL),"The authors acknowledge the financial support received to undertake this research which is part of a university-industry collaboration scheme grant in partnership with Queensland Airports Ltd (QAL).

The implications of these high rates are severe in that food insecurity has been associated with a wide range of health, behavioral, social, and cognitive difficulties. This article examines the relationship between the School Breakfast Program (SBP) and food insecurity outcomes. The SBP has the potential to reduce food insecurity because of the direct provision of breakfast to students and the implied income transfer to households. We use state-level cutoffs tied to school-level poverty rates that mandate the provision of the SBP to compare the food security outcomes of students in similar schools, but with different requirements to provide breakfast. Our estimates suggest that state policies requiring schools to offer the SBP have reduced food insecurity for young children.","[Fletcher, Jason M.] Univ Wisconsin, La Follette Sch Publ Affairs, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Frisvold, David E.] Univ Iowa, Econ, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Iowa,"Fletcher, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, La Follette Sch Publ Affairs, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",jason.fletcher@wisc.edu; david-frisvold@uiowa.edu,"Frisvold, David/JGM-1733-2023","Frisvold, David/0000-0001-8720-8995","University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research (UKCPR); UKCPR through U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service [AG-3198-B-10-0028]; Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin-Madison","University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research (UKCPR); UKCPR through U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service; Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin-Madison","Jason M.

As a result, women often do not conduct investment planning until it is too late, and they are confronted with a financial crisis or a life predicament such as a divorce or death. In addition, limited scientific research exists on the investment planning practices of women in South Africa. This study contributes to the body of knowledge on investment planning by better understanding the unique financial needs and challenges of women. Recommendations made by this study will assist women and financial planners to make more informed investment decisions as they progress through life. Aim: Therefore, the primary objective of this research was to investigate the factors that influence women's perceived successful investment planning in the Nelson Mandela Bay area. After conducting a comprehensive literature study, six factors (independent variables), namely, values, attitudes, time horizon, personal life cycle, risks and returns, and investment knowledge, were identified as influencing the perceived successful investment planning (dependent variable) of women. Setting: As this study focussed on the perceptions of women concerning the factors that influence successful investment planning, the target population was all women in the Nelson Mandela Bay area older than 20 years with some investment experience. Methods: A quantitative research methodology was followed, and data were collected from 207 women using a structured self-administered questionnaire. Results: The results of the multiple regression analysis revealed that only one independent variable emerged as having a significant influence on perceived successful investment planning of women, namely, investment knowledge. Conclusion: Based on the empirical results of this study, several recommendations have been made in an attempt to assist women to make more informed investment decisions and manage their investment planning more effectively as they progress through life.","[Venter, Elmarie; Kruger, Janine] Nelson Mandela Univ, Dept Business Management, Sch Management Sci, Port Elizabeth, South Africa",Nelson Mandela University,"Venter, E (通讯作者)，Nelson Mandela Univ, Dept Business Management, Sch Management Sci, Port Elizabeth, South Africa.",elmarie.venter@nmmu.ac.za,,,,,,,92,2,2,0,2,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

We leverage these candidate-specific refusals to accept PAC monies to uncover concomitant spikes in the pattern of corporate executives' personal campaign contributions that are most pronounced for executives at firms with active PACs which contributed to the candidates in question.

Previous studies have examined the roles of both the continuous and jump components of the total variance in forecasting. This paper considers how index level jumps and cojumps can be used across index constituents for forecasting the variance of index-level returns. A range of jump and cojump detection methods, based on daily and intraday data, are used. Moving beyond the magnitudes of the past index jumps used in existing models, it is found that incorporating the estimated jump intensity from a point process model leads to forecast accuracy gains. Another important contribution is the finding that cojumps across underlying constituent stocks are also useful for forecasting index-level behaviour. Improvements in forecast performance are particularly apparent on the days when jumps or cojumps occur.

These criticisms have led regulators to employ countercyclical measures in subsequent Basel accords. One of these measures, the countercyclical capital buffer (CCB), has been proposed as an effective countercyclical measure in expansionary periods as a deterrent to excessive lending through increased bank capital requirements. Aim: The effectiveness of the CCB during contractions is not obvious. Contingent convertible (CoCo) bonds - which are bond-like until triggered by a deterioration of a prescribed capital metric, at which point they convert into a form of equity - are explored as a supplementary countercyclical capital measure for such periods to establish whether or not they function effectively. Setting: The analysis is undertaken using global bank CoCo data, and then applied to South African banks. Methods: The Hodrick Prescott filter was applied to empirical historical data. Results: The CCB functions as a good countercyclical capital measure in times of economic expansion by absorbing losses and stabilising the capital base through equity issuance. Conclusion: The issuance of CoCo bonds - if their trigger mechanisms are designed correctly may prove helpful to banks and the broader financial sector in times of economic contraction through the countercyclical capital properties that manifest through CoCo bonds under these economic conditions.","[Liebenberg, Francois; van Vuuren, Gary; Heymans, Andre] North West Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Risk Management, Potchefstroom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"van Vuuren, G (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Risk Management, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",vvgary@hotmail.com,"van Vuuren, Gary/B-5453-2019; Heymans, André/W-7520-2019","van Vuuren, Gary/0000-0001-6811-0538; Heymans, André/0000-0003-3879-6887",,,,,76,1,1,0,0,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The results provide consistent support for both the child-replacement hypothesis and the precautionary demand for children.

Community-level malaria incidence among children has a positive effect on subsequent fertility choices, and this positive effect is stronger the more the disease is fatal to children who are infected.

We find high levels of cord cutting during this time, and evidence that it became relatively more prevalent among low-income and younger households-suggesting this group responded to changes in OTA and streaming options.

Empirically, these factors are incorporated into a first hit time duration model, focusing on time to first birth, estimated with data from the Democratic Republic of Congo. The results provide nuanced insights into the income-fertility puzzle. Our evidence suggests that educated women start childbearing later, and are better able to use contraception, even less effective contraception. Thus, there are education-related heterogeneities in contraceptive effectiveness. Further, we find that women using more effective contraception start childbearing at a later age, as do women with better access to contraception. Both improved female education and improved access to modern contraception have the potential to hasten the fertility transition in the Democratic Republic of Congo.","[Tshiswaka-Kashalala, Gauthier; Koch, Steven F.] Univ Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Koch, SF (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa.",steve.koch@up.ac.za,,"Koch, Steven/0000-0002-2097-4027",William and Flora Hewlett Foundation [G15085485]; Economic Research Southern Africa,William and Flora Hewlett Foundation; Economic Research Southern Africa,"This research was supported by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation under grant G15085485.

To do so, we develop a general estimation approach to incorporate volatility proxy information into dynamic factor models with stochastic volatility. The resulting model parameter estimates are highly efficient, which one hopes would translate into superior predictive performance. We explore this conjecture in the context of density prediction of U.S. bond yields by incorporating realized volatility into a dynamic Nelson-Siegel (DNS) model with stochastic volatility. The results clearly indicate that using realized volatility improves density forecasts relative to popular specifications in the DNS literature that neglect realized volatility.

There is an extensive literature on this topic, whereas modeling online auction price process constitutes one of the most active research areas. Most of the research, however, only focuses on modeling price curves, ignoring the bidding process. In this paper, a semiparametric regression model is proposed to model the online auction process. This model captures two main features of online auction data: changing arrival rates of bidding processes and changing dynamics of prices. A new inference procedure using B-splines is also established for parameter estimation. The proposed model is used to forecast the price of an online auction. The advantage of this proposed approach is that the price can be forecast dynamically and the prediction can be updated according to newly arriving information. The model is applied to Xbox data with satisfactory forecasting properties.

We explore the role of two potential barriers/enablers to accessing financial advice. First, we explore the role of a variety of financial literacy measures to explain observed financial advice consultation. Second, we introduce a newly developed measure of financial adviser anxiety. We define adviser anxiety as (an existing or prospective clients') concerns involving the prospect of meeting with a financial adviser. The notion of adviser anxiety is inspired by evidence from medical settings that suggest individuals may refrain from seeking advice when objectively, it is in their best interests to do so. This anxiety may be due to embarrassment, worry, or other forms of apprehension associated with the consultation process. A new scale is presented which has strong validity and a demonstrated ability to explain reported future levels of professional advice seeking.","[Gerrans, Paul] Univ Western Australia, UWA Business Sch, Finance, Nedlands, WA, Australia; [Hershey, Douglas A.] Oklahoma State Univ, Psychol, Dept Psychol, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",University of Western Australia; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Gerrans, P (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, UWA Business Sch, Finance, Nedlands, WA, Australia.",paul.gerrans@uwa.edu.au; douglas.hershey@okstate.edu,,"Gerrans, Paul/0000-0002-5690-7141",National Seniors Productive Ageing Centre,National Seniors Productive Ageing Centre,We gratefully acknowledge a grant from the National Seniors Productive Ageing Centre which made this research possible.

O'Driscoll was an automatic selection for Ireland's rugby team yet missed matches through injury, allowing us to treat injury as random. We estimate that O'Driscoll was worth a converted try per game and improved the chance of victory by more than home advantage. None of O'Driscoll's Irish contemporaries made such a contribution. His impact also compares favourably with New Zealand's best players of the era. Our estimates have implications for debates about wages in professional rugby. They also demonstrate how statistical techniques can be applied to an everyday issue, allowing us to conclude that perceptions of one Irishman's greatness were warranted.","[Lunn, Peter D.] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland; [Lunn, Peter D.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [Duffy, David] Property Ind Ireland, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin,"Lunn, PD (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland.;Lunn, PD (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",pete.lunn@esri.ie,,"Lunn, Peter/0000-0002-7174-5320",,,,,11,0,0,0,0,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

But the increased use of RPM occurred under a pre-existing rule that permitted RPM as long as no formal agreement over price was reached. This paper documents not only the increased use of RPM post Leegin but also the importance of avoiding the appearance of agreements to control resale prices. The paper then discusses how plaintiffs, previously enamored of claims of RPM, are now recasting vertical RPM arrangements as ancillary to horizontal agreements among distributors that are made effective though enforcement by producers.","[Marvel, Howard P.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, 1945 North High St, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Marvel, HP (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, 1945 North High St, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",marvel.2@osu.edu,,,,,,,15,3,3,0,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

However, they are not without problems. The STB argued in 2001 that as Class I railroads have become fewer and larger, it may be difficult to find alternative purchasers for the firm whose shares are in the trust if the STB turns down the proposal. The Antitrust Division argued in 2016 that joint stock ownership creates anticompetitive and/or otherwise undesirable incentives, even if the independence of the voting trustee is complete. On the other hand, the functions served by voting trusts in railroad mergers are served by simple lockup agreements in other parts of the economy, without the same incentive problems as voting trusts. Thus voting trusts may no longer serve a useful function in railroad merger deliberations.","[Pittman, Russell] US Dept Justice, Antitrust Div, Econ Res, Washington, DC USA; [Pittman, Russell] Kyiv Sch Econ, Kiev, Ukraine; [Pittman, Russell] New Econ Sch, Moscow, Russia",Kyiv School of Economics; New Economic School,"Pittman, R (通讯作者)，US Dept Justice, Antitrust Div, Econ Res, Washington, DC USA.;Pittman, R (通讯作者)，Kyiv Sch Econ, Kiev, Ukraine.;Pittman, R (通讯作者)，New Econ Sch, Moscow, Russia.",Russell.pittman@usdoj.gov,,,,,,,55,1,1,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

All these changes also increase the level of stress and can lead to even irreparable damage to the physical and mental health of police officers making their activity very difficult from the perspective of the efficiency of the missions carried out. Policemen live constantly under the threat of physical hazards, have an irregular and prolonged work schedule, and by their job nature they come into contact with harmful factors and very unpleasant aspects of life. Specific to police activities is that these risks can not be controlled to the same extent as in other areas of activity, which makes this profession very difficult. Difficulties derive also from the fact that even the legal act that governs the safety and health at work in Romania excludes law enforcement activities, relatively refering to particular cases in which police, army and emergency activities are in contradiction with the same laws that govern such activities. Taking into consideration the fact that in the specialty literature the issue of security and health in the field of policing is very little addressed or not at all, the paper aims at reviewing the cases of violence to which the policemen are exposed during their work, corroborated with statistical data provided by human resources offices within the Romanian Ministry of Internal Affairs.","[Achim, Adrian-Constantin] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Achim, AC (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",achim_adrian@yahoo.com,,,,,,,38,1,1,0,2,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",2286-1440,,,INT MANAGE CONF,,,2017,,,,,,,965,971,,,,,,7,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM6KT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000466917100099,0

To date, research on the real-world processes of price formation has been scant in economic geography and extant literatures. This article addresses this by focusing on price formation in geographically distant but connected markets, and the interaction between global and local price dynamics. The article employs a new framework that builds on chain and network approaches by integrating concepts from marketization and institutional approaches. The study finds that the world price of coffee has become increasingly volatile as a result of the behavior of international coffee traders and broader shifts in the character of global capital accumulation. It also demonstrates the varying role domestic marketing and local-level institutions play in shaping price formation and cushioning Tanzanian producers from sudden price changes. Finally, the study highlights the role prices, via these local-level institutions, play in extenuating differentiation between producers, creating winners and losers.","[Bargawi, Hannah K.] Univ London, Dept Econ, SOAS, Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England; [Newman, Susan A.] Univ West England, Bristol Business Sch, Frenchay Campus,Coldharbour Lane, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England; [Newman, Susan A.] Univ Johannesburg, Econ & Financial Sci, Kingsway Campus, Auckland Pk 2006, South Africa",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); University of West England; University of Johannesburg,"Bargawi, HK (通讯作者)，Univ London, Dept Econ, SOAS, Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England.",hb19@soas.ac.uk; Susan3.newman@uwe.ac.uk,,"Newman, Susan/0000-0001-7220-4326",,,,,56,13,13,1,49,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

The information enables citizens to make an informed assessment of the actions of administration and to take part in the debates and in the decisions that concern them. Effective collaboration between public authorities at all levels of governance and cooperation between the latter and non-governmental actors are essential to ensure good governance and sustainable economic development. The public sector must provide, in a fair and efficient way, essential services that meet citizens' needs, economic growth opportunities, and facilitate citizen involvement and participation in public policy development to promote the participation and welfare of all people. E-governance and innovation can provide significant opportunities to turn public administration into a sustainable development tool. The aim of this article is to study the benefits of eGovernment in the process of innovation and transformation into the economy and governance of public institutions. The methodology of this paper is focused on literature review and analysis of the main international studies and surveys in the field. Furthermore, it was performed a comparative analysis on the world e-government leaders from the past five years, emphasizing the number of countries grouped by E-Government Development index (EGDI) level and geographical regions.","[Bilal, Jibai T.] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Bilal, JT (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",bilahibai@hotmail.com,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,3,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",2286-1440,,,INT MANAGE CONF,,,2017,,,,,,,88,98,,,,,,11,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM6KT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000466917100010,0

Particularly important are those distortions that result from various emotional states of a person responsible for perceiving warning signals. Making people responsible for monitoring the risk aware of existing different channels for providing warning information depending on the emotional state of the perceivers, seems to be the solution to this issue. This awareness should enable to significantly improve the perception of risk through simple information activity. The innovation of conducted research and analysis are three models that together represent the basic mechanisms of warning signals perception. Relatively new proposal submitted mainly by researchers of psychological sciences, regarding the fragmentary work on this issue, is to include jointly those three presented models in monitoring systems of risks and threats to an organization. The usefulness of taking into account those proposed models was presented in the course of two empirical studies described in this paper.","[Cwik, Bogdan] Wojskowa Akad Tech Warszawie, Ul Gen Sylwestra Kaliskiego 2, PL-00908 Warsaw, Poland",Military University of Technology in Warsaw,"Cwik, B (通讯作者)，Wojskowa Akad Tech Warszawie, Ul Gen Sylwestra Kaliskiego 2, PL-00908 Warsaw, Poland.",bogdan.cwik@wat.edu.pl,"Ćwik, Bogdan/W-4359-2017","Ćwik, Bogdan/0000-0001-8774-9054",,,,,10,1,1,1,2,VOLKSON PRESS,KUALA LUMPUR,"C-3A-15 CENTRIO PANTAI HILLPARK, JALAN PANTAI MURNI, BANGSAR SOUTH,, KUALA LUMPUR, WILAYAH PERSEKUTUAN KUALA LUMPUR 59200, MALAYSIA",,,978-1-948012-02-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,309,312,,10.26480/icemi.01.2017.309.312,0.0,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM2GZ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000461012100107,0

The variation of institutional changes from the proclaimed direction of the reform and its turn to institutional deviations, which have negatively impacted economy and society are analysed The article explores and explains the transformation of the institutional vacuum to quasi-institutional monism, which has grown into a phenomenon of institutional nihilism, with a consistent application of interest oriented neoliberal solutions. Thus, institutions are not universal means of protecting people from the government's tyranny. That happens due to the dominant neoliberal rhetoric, and privileged (non market) rules conduct that surpass the institutional domain. This paper attempts to explain: the essence of neglecting the real institutionalization in the post socialist countries, through the identification of the quasi institutionalization model and a short analysis of such reasons, as well as the paradox of the established phenomenon that the institutions, as the stipulations and constraints, have become the barrier for their unlimited avoidance and quasi-institutionalization. Oddly enough, nomenclature authorities are those who should implement institutional changes and form the alternative institutions (from the shadows). Hence, contrary to the recommendations of the NET, they speak out against the formal and informal institutions, interests of citizens as well as social and economic development.","[Draskovic, Mimo] Univ Montenegro, Maritime Fac Kotor, Dobrota 36, Kotor 85330, Montenegro",University of Montenegro,"Draskovic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Montenegro, Maritime Fac Kotor, Dobrota 36, Kotor 85330, Montenegro.",rookie@t-com.me,"Draskovic, Mimo/W-4245-2019","Draskovic, Mimo/0000-0003-0638-1943",,,,,41,4,4,0,2,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Dominant carbon mitigation efforts resemble what Michel Callon calls civilizing markets', a deliberate harnessing of formal markets to achieve social goals by engaging with multiple political constituencies in market design. This paper looks at carbon marketization in the Democratic Republic of Congo and finds that, despite inclusive planning, climate finance experts produce unintended consequences by assigning social and environmental goals separate strategies within a national portfolio of climate finance interventions. Resulting from the challenges of finding commensurate criteria for measuring market impacts in both social and environmental domains, this programmatic segregation obscures the interconnections between poverty, forest use and climate change in the Congo. Findings suggest a need to reconcile the design of environmental-focused markets with the difficult-to-measure embedded social benefits of informal natural resource economies.","[Gray, Ian] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Sociol, Box 951551, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Gray, I (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Sociol, Box 951551, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",igray@ucla.edu,,,"Woods Hole Research Center; Public Service Fellowship from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Graduate Summer Research Mentorship from the University of California, Los Angeles","Woods Hole Research Center; Public Service Fellowship from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Graduate Summer Research Mentorship from the University of California, Los Angeles(University of California System)","Fieldwork for this project was supported by the Woods Hole Research Center and a Public Service Fellowship from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

One of the most important principles is the fair value concept. The main purpose of the paper is to investigate and analyse the accounting standards from the point of implementation of fair value concept as required or permitted accounting policy for measurement and valuation of economic categories. Also, the aim of this paper is to explore the usefulness of the information about the fair value of assets and liabilities for financial statement users. The paper critically evaluates the accounting standards with special reference to the application of fair value accounting in order to serve the interests of financial statement users. The research results show that different financial statement users have different interests, which means that the implementation of fair value concept contributes to achieving the interests of only individual financial statement users, while the interests of other financial statement users have not been fulfilled. The above shows that the implementation of fair value concept leads to the fulfilment of the objectives of only a certain number of financial statement users. Also, the research results indicate that the implementation of fair value concept has significant influence on the qualitative characteristics of accounting information.","[Gulin, Danimir; Hladika, Mirjana; Micin, Marina] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Accounting, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Gulin, D (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Accounting, Zagreb, Croatia.",dgulin@efzg.hr; mhladika@efzg.hr; mmicin@efzg.hr,"Hladika, Mirjana/I-1152-2018; Ercegovic, Marina/H-8303-2018; Gulin, Danimir/I-1145-2018; Hladika, Mirjana/I-1145-2018","Ercegovic, Marina/0000-0003-1156-6416; Gulin, Danimir/0000-0002-9905-1937; Hladika, Mirjana/0000-0003-3170-9138",,,,,35,2,2,0,14,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-46319-3; 978-3-319-46318-6,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,5,,,,,,553,570,,10.1007/978-3-319-46319-3_34,0.0,,,18,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH5KL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000401101000034,0

A clear difference between biofuel and natural gas should help to reduce the price of heating noticeably. However, even though biofuel is 2-3 times cheaper than natural gas, the heat that was produced by utilising biofuel is only slightly cheaper than the one produced using natural gas. The object of this research is district heating sector. The research aims at investigating the savings that could be achieved after replacing natural gas with biofuel in heat production. The methods of research: the analysis of scientific and technical literature, articles, and statistical data. The results of research: the study showed that regulation is an integral part of the heating sector. The analysis of scientific and technical literature showed that the most widely analysed cost-cutting measure of heat production is the use of biofuels. The main part of the cost of heat produced by gas consists of fuel cost, i.e. natural gas. Scientists justify the shift to biofuel technology by the price of biofuels as they are more than two times cheaper than gas. On the other hand, biofuels are local raw materials, which do not have to be imported so the money can be kept in their economies. The measures on heat savings analysed by the researchers are related to the introduction of new technologies. Introduction of new technologies requires investment. As technology that enables heat production from biofuels is complex and very expensive, it is necessary to assess whether the investment in heat preparation with biofuels is cost-effective. It was found that the scientists use net present value method in investment assessment to calculate the discount rate and the cash flow generated by the investment.","[Jovovic, Radislav] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Finance Engn, Fac Business Management, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Simanaviciene, Zaneta] Mykolas Romeris Univ, Dept Banking & Investments, Fac Econ & Finance Management, Ateities G 20, LT-08303 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Dirma, Virgilijus] Mykolas Romeris Univ, Inst Econ, Fac Econ & Finance Management, Ateities G 20, LT-08303 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Mykolas Romeris University; Mykolas Romeris University,"Simanaviciene, Z (通讯作者)，Mykolas Romeris Univ, Dept Banking & Investments, Fac Econ & Finance Management, Ateities G 20, LT-08303 Vilnius, Lithuania.",zasiman@mruni.eu; virgilijus@dirma.eu,"Simanaviciene, Zaneta/U-7817-2019; Simanaviciene, Zaneta/W-3675-2019","Simanaviciene, Zaneta/0000-0001-6008-2405",,,,,22,6,6,0,2,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Development of human resources and knowledge management emerges as the main source of competitive advantage. Today it is necessary to adapt to the challenges that arise in the market. In order to give a timely response to the challenges it is necessary to constantly invest into knowledge and competence of human resources. Economy of scale is unsustainable, organizations today are struggling with entry into the knowledge economy, or into the production of high value and quality. The components of the economy then and now are different. With the arrival of digital technology information are spreading and changing faster than ever. Requests for transfer of knowledge have been changed, For human resources, today it is necessary to systematically and continuously upgrade the knowledge and new skills. Due to their specific requirements, sometimes it is difficult to organize group training that would include the necessary topics. Individual approach is necessary, Digital technology allows the combination of individual and group access to new knowledge, as well as defining new challenges and solving problems. Digital technologies enable learning without additional spatial and temporal resources. They allow education in the workplace during working hours.

We are usually confronted with the decision-making process in an uncertain environment, and the fuzzy set theory is an efficient tool to handle this uncertainty. Interval type-2 fuzzy sets are one of the extensions of the fuzzy sets which are very flexible to model an uncertain environment. This study is related to MCDM problems within the context of interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs). The evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS) method is a new and efficient MCDM method, and assessment of alternatives in this method is based on the distance of them from average solution with respect to all criteria. In the EDAS method, each alternative has positive and negative distances which are used to determine the appraisal score of it. In this research, we present an extended EDAS method, which is named EDAS-IT2FSs, for dealing with multicriteria group decision-making problems with interval type-2 fuzzy sets. Basic concepts of interval type-2 fuzzy sets and the arithmetic operations of trapezoidal IT2FSs are used to develop the extended EDAS method. A numerical example of multi-criteria subcontractor evaluation problem is used to illustrate the process of using the extended EDAS method. The example involves eight subcontractors that need to be evaluated with respect to seven criteria. A comparison and a sensitivity analysis based on different sets of criteria weights are also performed to show the validity of the proposed method. The results of these analyses show the efficiency and stability of the extended EDAS method.","[Keshavarz Ghorabaee, Mehdi; Amiri, Maghsoud] Allameh Tabatabai Univ, Fac Management & Accounting, Dept Ind Management, Tehran, Iran; [Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras; Turskis, Zenonas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Res Inst Smart Bldg Technol, Vilnius, Lithuania",Allameh Tabataba'i University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Keshavarz Ghorabaee, M (通讯作者)，Allameh Tabatabai Univ, Fac Management & Accounting, Dept Ind Management, Tehran, Iran.",m.keshavarz_gh@yahoo.com; m.amiri.atu@gmail.com; edmundas.zavadskas@vgtu.lt; zenonas.turskis@vgtu.lt,"bill, dr/AAB-9639-2022; Turskis, Zenonas/H-3035-2018; Keshavarz-Ghorabaee, Mehdi/J-5488-2014; Amiri, Maghsoud/Z-3160-2019; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/Q-6048-2018; Turskis, Zenonas/AAA-9159-2021","Keshavarz-Ghorabaee, Mehdi/0000-0002-0362-1633; Amiri, Maghsoud/0000-0002-0650-2584; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/0000-0002-3201-949X; Turskis, Zenonas/0000-0002-5835-9388",,,,,38,60,61,0,37,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The focus on agriculture is needed to streamline the implementation of the OBOR initiative. Agricultural trade between China and Central Asia has increased annually (18.34%), and benefits complementarily among products. In this paper, we attempt to investigate whether OBOR initiative brings certain impacts to the Agricultural Trade of China and Central Asia. Using the panel dataset covering the period of 1992-2015, we employ System-Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) to estimate the dynamic gravity models. We find that OBOR increases the agricultural trade between China and Central Asia by 8.8%, and the growth of bilateral trade is contributed to the precise measures and policy under the OBOR. The governance capacity of Central Asian countries has noteworthy effects on China and Central Asian trade.

The aim of the paper is to assess the transparency level of municipalities in the Czech Republic. It focuses on the lawful and voluntary publication of in-formation on the websites of randomly selected group of municipalities. The content analysis on the internet was used. The thesis focuses on qualitative and quantitative data acquisition as the most effective combination. The research sample consists of 100 municipalities, which were randomly selected from a set of all municipalities in the Czech Republic with populations ranging between 2,000 to 10,000 inhabitants. The paper's introductory part defines the basic concepts and obligations, which are laid down to the municipalities by international and especially Czech legislation. It is followed by the analysis of selected municipalities on the Internet, which is divided into municipalities' management and documents regarding their activities, the office's communication with its citizens and accessibility of the sites. A synthesis of findings presents the most transparent municipalities and regions. Czech municipalities have been heterogeneous in the analysis of digital transparency. Once the legislation precisely defines the scope and form of mandatory disclosure of information on municipalities' websites, there is a great deal of improvement and the efforts of municipalities to fulfil this obligation. The degree of disclosure is decreasing with the freedom for municipalities to publish information. The conclusion of the paper is devoted to the overall assessment and recommendations for the given situation in the Czech Republic.","[Mohelska, Hana; Sokolova, Marcela] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Management, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove,"Mohelská, H (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Management, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.",hana.mohelska@uhk.cz; marcela.sokolova@uhk.cz,"Mohelska, Hana/F-9896-2019; Sokolová, Marcela/B-3452-2012","Mohelska, Hana/0000-0003-0441-0712; Sokolová, Marcela/0000-0002-0641-7750","University of Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic [6/2017]","University of Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic","The paper was written with the support of the specific project 6/2017 grant Determinants affecting job satisfaction granted by the University of Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic and thanks to help of student Sarka Jelinkova.",,26,8,8,2,8,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

According to the literature, the majority of researchers follow Kyle (1985) and they distinguish between three dimensions of market liquidity as special liquidity characteristics: market depth, market tightness, and market resiliency. The paper presents a preliminary study of interaction between market depth and market tightness on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE). The order ratio (OR) is employed as a proxy of market depth, while market tightness is approximated using the relative spread (RS). The 20 most liquid WSE-listed big companies are investigated. The high-frequency intraday data covers the period from January 3, 2005 to June 30, 2015. Moreover, the paper provides a robustness analysis of the obtained results with respect to the whole sample period and three adjacent subsamples of equal size: the pre-crisis, crisis, and post-crisis periods. The hypothesis concerning the statistical significance of the Fisher's z-transformed correlation coefficients between daily values of the OR and RS indicators for each stock is tested. The empirical results reveal that although, in general, low daily order ratios are accompanied by narrow daily relative spreads (as both indicate high liquidity), and high daily order ratios are accompanied by wide daily relative spreads, the majority of correlation coefficients between daily values of the OR and RS indicators are not significantly different from zero. Furthermore, the results turn out to be robust to the choice of the sample. Our findings indicate that both ratios seem to capture various sources of market liquidity, which is consistent with the literature.","[Olbrys, Joanna] Bialystok Tech Univ, Wiejska 45A, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Olbrys, J (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Wiejska 45A, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland.",j.olbrys@pb.edu.pl,"Olbrys, Joanna/P-8237-2018","Olbrys, Joanna/0000-0002-0928-0040",Bialystok University of Technology [S/WI/1/2014],Bialystok University of Technology,The present study was supported by a grant S/WI/1/2014 from Bialystok University of Technology and founded from the resources for research by Ministry of Science and Higher Education.,,25,7,7,0,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-54885-2; 978-3-319-54884-5,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,103,111,,10.1007/978-3-319-54885-2_10,0.0,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI5UA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412819500010,0

Ratings should therefore be assigned without taking the business cycle into account. If the business cycle is taken into account in the process of rating assignments, ratings are assigned procyclically. This paper empirically investigates the behaviour of rating agencies when assigning sovereign ratings for African countries. It makes use of ordered probit models which control for macroeconomic factors to determine if Standard and Poor's, Fitch, Moody's and a South African based research entity, NKC African Economics take the business cycle into account in their rating processes.

It reflects a more recent distribution conflict over the economic rents created by large firms. In this respect, these firms resemble political institutions more than economic entities. To take up this observation theoretically, rent-seeking theory is employed in this paper to analyze CSR more thoroughly. First, CSR may be a form of productive rent-seeking or rent-creation if it provides goods and services with those ethical standards that are coincidental with customers' preferences. Second, CSR could be unproductive rent-seeking if existing rents were simply redistributed. Third, CSR could be rent-shrinking if redistributing rents diluted control incentives within firms with the effect to reduce firm output or profitability. However, the CSR-induced rent competition between owners/shareholders, managers and stakeholders may also alter the rent allocation of firms to the advantage of owners/shareholders via stakeholder preferences. Prudent forms of CSR, therefore, can enhance welfare.","[Prinz, Aloys Leo] Univ Munster, Munster, North Rhine Wes, Germany",University of Munster,"Prinz, AL (通讯作者)，Univ Munster, Munster, North Rhine Wes, Germany.",Aloys.Prinz@wiwi.uni-muenster.de,,,,,,,28,1,1,0,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2211-2707,,978-3-319-48802-8; 978-3-319-48801-1,ETHICAL ECON,,,2017,52,,,,,,39,53,,10.1007/978-3-319-48802-8_4,0.0,,,15,Economics; Ethics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BI6HA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413288200004,0

A typical stampede accident has such prominent features: its odds are low but it can take place in a sudden and result in a serious consequence. So far our government has already adopted certain measures to both prevent and handle stampede accident, but they are not working well as those measures are designed not to deter stampede accident from happening in the origin place. After a deep reflection on the failure of previous measures and on the basis of thousands of documents and thesis concerning stampede accident, an useful conclusion is made that only by legal means will stampede accident be successfully handled. To support the above finding, the necessity of adopting legal means must be analyzed and the legal frameworks which consist of legal means must be introduced. It then turns out that four legal frameworks must be adopted to better handle stampede accident. Those legal frameworks include: (a) enacting special laws which regulate on public activities of massive crowd; (b) taking preventive legal measures on the part of administrative agencies concerned; (c) establishing and developing ex post regimes both of responsibility taking and relief seeking; (d) enhancing ordinary people's security education and propaganda on stampede accident.","[Shan Jiadi; Shen Laijin] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Arts & Law, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Technology,"Shan, JD (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Arts & Law, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China.",63000978@qq.com; 30198211@qq.com,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,1,VOLKSON PRESS,KUALA LUMPUR,"C-3A-15 CENTRIO PANTAI HILLPARK, JALAN PANTAI MURNI, BANGSAR SOUTH,, KUALA LUMPUR, WILAYAH PERSEKUTUAN KUALA LUMPUR 59200, MALAYSIA",,,978-1-948012-02-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,27,29,,10.26480/icemi.01.2017.27.29,0.0,,,3,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM2GZ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000461012100009,0

The empirical evidence is based on data from Eurostat and the OECD tax database. Within the EU, only Germany, Finland and Estonia do not currently have a tax policy aimed directly at stimulating innovation. The results indicate the existence of substantial differences in provided incentives - from negative support or tax burden (in Germany, Denmark and Finland) to 43% tax subsidy (for SMEs in France). The most generous R&D tax incentives are in Portugal, France and Spain. Some countries differentiate the level of support across firm types and offer more generous subsidy for SMEs than for large firms. e.g. subsidy tax rate are 29% vs. 10% in the UK and 26% vs. 43% in France.

New Zealand's experience suggests the effects of government programmes to provide carbon credits to forest owners could be enhanced if forward markets, futures markets, or carbon-lending markets were used to manage risks. This paper provides a comparative institutions approach based on the history of commodity markets to argue that carbon lending markets, not forward or futures markets, are likely to be the most convenient form of a forestry carbon market. A carbon lending market will raise the total returns from forestry investments with minimal risks to forest owners, and simultaneously reduce the risks facing other firms contemplating carbon reducing investments. For this reason, governments wishing to include forest sequestration in an Emissions Trading Scheme may wish to encourage the development of a carbon lending market.","[Coleman, Andrew] Univ Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand",University of Otago,"Coleman, A (通讯作者)，POB 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand.",,,,New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry,New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry,"I would like to thank Bridget Beals, Tui Head, Suzi Kerr, Lucas King-Meyer, and Dominick Stephens for useful comments.

When the seller has a strong bargaining position and can condition the asking price to the intermediaries' business model choice, all intermediaries specialize in agency. The seller's and intermediaries' joint profits equal the seller's profits when he has access to all buyers. When the seller does not have such bargaining power, the level of the referral fee and the degree of competition among intermediaries determine the business mode adoption.

This study aims to investigate the potential competitiveness of HSR against bus and airway alternatives in the future lines (Ankara-Bursa, Ankara-Izmir and Ankara-Sivas). Using modal attributes and user survey data from current lines, first, statistically significant 3 binary logit models were developed, which were later employed for the future HSR lines (with known travel times and assumed pricing scenarios), HSR competitiveness were estimated. In all three lines, HSR was estimated to be preferred over bus strongly (93%- 100%), if the HSR ticket prices would not exceed bus ticket price more than 30%, which was parallel to participant statements in the survey. For the HSR lines to compete with airway alternative, ticket prices should definitely be lower than air ticket prices. The rate of competitiveness would vary depending on the corridor characteristics: for Ankara-Sivas and Ankara-Izmir lines, where the travel time reductions by HSR would be significant compared to relatively longer average air travel times (due to existence of large number of indirect flights), HSR is expected to compete with airway at (48%-100%). However, for Ankara-Bursa line, which was served directly but once a day by air, models estimated low competitiveness, as models did not include service frequency as a statistically significant variable. As HSR is a newly introduced mode in Turkey, there is a limited data and studies on it. This study is valuable due to its survey data collection and predictions for future lines. Also, it is an example study for the HSR competitiveness in developing country context.","[Dalkic, Gulcin; Tuydes-Yaman, Hediye] Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Ankara, Turkey",Middle East Technical University,"Dalkic, G (通讯作者)，Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Ankara, Turkey.",dalkic@metu.edu.tr,"Dalkic-Melek, Gulcin/ABA-1360-2020; tuydes-yaman, hediye/AAT-3697-2020","tuydes-yaman, hediye/0000-0003-2053-992X; DALKIC-MELEK, GULCIN/0000-0001-9663-657X",,,,,58,0,0,1,12,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

As individuals interact and exchange information with, or observe the behaviors of, those in close proximity of themselves, they are likely to shape their behavioral choices accordingly. For this reason, econometric choice models that account for spatial dependency effects have been developed and applied in a number of fields, including transportation. However, spatial dependence models to date have largely defined the strength of association across behavioral units based on spatial or geographic proximity. In the current context of social media platforms and ubiquitous intenet and mobile connectivity, the strength of associations among individuals is no longer solely dependent on spatial proximity. Rather, the strength of associations among individuals may be based on shared attitudes and preferences as well. In other words, behavioral choice models may benefit from defining dependency effects based on attitudes and constructs in addition to geographical constructs. In this paper, frequency of usage of car-sharing and ride-hailing services is modeled using a generalized heterogeneous data model (GHDM) framework that incorporates multi-dimensional dependencies among decision-makers. The model system is estimated on the 2014-2015 Puget Sound Regional Travel Study survey sample, with proximity in latent attitudinal constructs defined by a number of personality trait variables. Model estimation results show that social dependency effects arising from similarities in attitudes and preferences are significant in explaining shared mobility service usage. Ignoring such effects may lead to erroneous estimates of the adoption and usage of future transportation technologies and mobility services.","[Vinayak, Pragun] Cambridge Systemat Inc, 515 S Figueroa St,Suite 1975, Los Angeles, CA 90071 USA; [Dias, Felipe F.; Astroza, Sebastian; Bhat, Chandra R.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, 301 E Dean Keeton St,Stop C1761, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Astroza, Sebastian] Univ Concepcion, Dept Ingn Ind, Edmundo Larenas 219, Concepcion, Chile; [Bhat, Chandra R.] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Pendyala, Ram M.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainable Engn & Built Environm, 660 S Coll Ave, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Garikapati, Venu M.] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Syst Anal & Integrat Sect, 15013 Denver West Pkwy, Golden, CO 80401 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Universidad de Concepcion; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA,"Bhat, CR (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, 301 E Dean Keeton St,Stop C1761, Austin, TX 78712 USA.;Bhat, CR (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",pragunvinayak@utexas.edu; fdias@utexas.edu; sastroza@utexas.edu; bhat@mail.utexas.edu; ram.pendyala@asu.edu; venu.garikapati@nrel.gov,"Pendyala, Ram/AAI-2564-2021; Astroza, Sebastian/AHD-5862-2022; Bhat, Chandra/AAC-6965-2019","Pendyala, Ram/0000-0002-1552-9447; Astroza, Sebastian/0000-0002-2964-2790; Bhat, Chandra/0000-0002-0715-8121; Garikapati, Venu/0000-0003-1603-1883",Center for Teaching Old Models New Tricks (TOMNET) Tier 1 University Transportation Center - US Department of Transportation [69A3551747116]; Data-Supported Transportation Operations and Planning (D-STOP) Center Tier 1 University Transportation Center - US Department of Transportation [DTRT13GUTC58],Center for Teaching Old Models New Tricks (TOMNET) Tier 1 University Transportation Center - US Department of Transportation; Data-Supported Transportation Operations and Planning (D-STOP) Center Tier 1 University Transportation Center - US Department of Transportation,"This research was partially supported by the Center for Teaching Old Models New Tricks (TOMNET) (Grant No. 69A3551747116) as well as the Data-Supported Transportation Operations and Planning (D-STOP) Center (Grant No. DTRT13GUTC58), both of which are Tier 1 University Transportation Centers sponsored by the US Department of Transportation.

J,"Cilliers, F",,,,"Cilliers, Frans",,,The experienced impact of systems psychodynamic leadership coaching amongst professionals in a financial services organisation,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Background: Systems psychodynamic leadership coaching is a depth psychology perspective that provides opportunities for coachees to explore their leadership identity as it manifests in their conscious and unconscious role behaviour. Aim: The research aim was to explore the experienced impact of systems psychodynamic leadership coaching amongst professionals in a financial services organisation, and to report on how this impact can be understood in the context of the literature guidelines on coaching and leadership effectiveness. Setting: The research was undertaken in a large South African financial services organisation where individual leadership coaching forms part of the leadership development programme (LDP). Methods: The research was qualitative, explorative and descriptive in nature. A multi-case approach was used. Sampling was convenient and opportunistic and comprised of 15 charted accountants who attended six 90-min coaching sessions over 12 weeks. Data gathering comprised field notes and coachee essays during and after coaching. Hermeneutic phenomenology was used as the interpretive stance. Results: Anxiety, task, role, boundaries, authorisation and identity manifested as themes. Coachees explored how their leadership identity was informed by their anxiety and defence mechanisms, how they took up their leadership role, authorised themselves and their colleagues, and managed their boundaries effectively. Compared to the general guidelines for leadership coaching effectiveness and the general indicators for effective leadership, systems psychodynamic leadership coaching seems to add value to leadership effectiveness. Conclusion: Professionals in this financial services organisation experienced systems psychodynamic leadership coaching as demanding, challenging and yet fulfilling towards the exploration of their leadership identity. It seems that systems psychodynamics, as coaching stance, created a safe and good-enough container for these financial professionals to explore their own unconscious leadership behaviour and to gain a significant level of understanding and awareness of their own anxiety and defensive behaviours in their interaction with followers.","[Cilliers, Frans] Univ South Africa, Sch Management Sci, Coll Econ & Management Sci, Dept Ind & Org Psychol, Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Cilliers, F (通讯作者)，Univ South Africa, Sch Management Sci, Coll Econ & Management Sci, Dept Ind & Org Psychol, Pretoria, South Africa.",franscilliers1@gmail.com,"Cilliers, Frans/O-7314-2014","Cilliers, Frans/0000-0001-6185-6978",,,,,89,2,3,2,15,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

This research used detailed travel data from Katy Freeway MLs and general purpose lanes (GPLs) in Huston to estimate the option value of MLs. Based on these data, this research recommends ML option users to be defined as only those travelers who used MLs at least once a year as opposed to all travelers who could have used the MLs (even those who never used MLs). This research used the Small-Rosen log sum method (1981) and the Black-Scholes option pricing method (1973) to estimate the option value of MLs. The log sum method frequently provided an unrealistically high option value based on times when the option value should logically be close to $0. Thus, the Black-Scholes method was recommended. The option value of the MLs was found to be similar to the value of travel time savings from the MLs for the ML option users. Thus, the option value of MLs is an important component of the total value of MLs.","[Lee, Sunghoon] Samsung Card, Seoul, South Korea; [Burris, Mark W.] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Burris, MW (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",sunghoonleebest@gmail.com; mburris@tamu.edu,,"Burris, Mark/0000-0003-4216-708X",Southwest Region University Transportation Center; Texas Department of Transportation,Southwest Region University Transportation Center; Texas Department of Transportation,"The authors are grateful for all of the support received for this research.

In particular, some have conjectured that the prevalence of social media use among the millennial generation may be partially responsible for a shift away from car driving and toward more sustainable travel modes. This paper uses a purpose-designed survey to examine the relationship between physical and virtual social interaction. It quantified the frequency of interaction with members of one's social network through telephone, email, texting and social media and explored the association with face-to-face social interaction. Multiple regression and structural equation modelling revealed that in general, more frequent 'virtual' interaction was associated with more frequent face-to-face interaction, not less, even after controlling for income, age, gender, extroversion, and other covariates. The relationships differed in strength across different age groups; notably, social media interaction was only associated with face-to-face interaction amongst 18-29 year olds. This provides no evidence to support the hypothesis that social media use is reducing travel demand amongst the younger generation.","[Delbosc, Alexa] Monash Univ, Inst Transport Studies, Dept Civil Engn, 23 Coll Walk, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Mokhtarian, Patricia] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",Monash University; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Delbosc, A (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Inst Transport Studies, Dept Civil Engn, 23 Coll Walk, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",alexa.delbosc@monash.edu,"Delbosc, Alexa/ABG-5920-2020; Mokhtarian, Patricia/B-3374-2011","Delbosc, Alexa/0000-0001-8744-3469; Mokhtarian, Patricia/0000-0001-7104-499X",,,,,39,24,27,1,51,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

A price-based tradable credits scheme is introduced into the park-and-ride (P&R) design in which the credit price is determined by the government. The C-logit model is used to analyze the linear monocentric city's route choice behavior. A bi-level programming model is proposed to study the P&R location problem. The upper level minimizes the social cost by optimizing the quantity and location of P&R stations and the price-based tradable credits scheme. The lower level is to determine the equilibrium assignments on the multi-mode network. Finally, a numerical example is used to investigate the effects of the price-based tradable credits scheme, bodily congestion in transit carriages and P&R facilities' investment on social cost, traveler behavior and P&R locations. It is found that besides the price-based tradable credits scheme, bodily congestion and P&R facilities investment also have an important influence on the P&R location design and the social cost.","[Gao, Ge; Sun, Huijun] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, MOE Key Lab Urban Transportat Complex Syst Theory, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Gao, Ge] Shandong Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Transportat, Qingdao 266590, Peoples R China; [Wu, Jianjun] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Minist Transport, Key Lab Transport Ind Big Data Applicat Technol C, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xinmin] Shandong Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Econ & Management, Qingdao 266590, Peoples R China; [Chen, Weiya] Cent South Univ, Sch Traff & Transportat Engn, Changsha 410075, Hunan, Peoples R China",Beijing Jiaotong University; Shandong University of Science & Technology; Beijing Jiaotong University; Shandong University of Science & Technology; Central South University,"Sun, HJ (通讯作者)，Beijing Jiaotong Univ, MOE Key Lab Urban Transportat Complex Syst Theory, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.",gegao06@bjtu.edu.cn; hjsun1@bjtu.edu.cn; jjwu1@bjtu.edu.cn; liu-xinmin@163.com; wychen@csu.edu.cn,"Chen, Weiya/JTV-4907-2023",,"NSFC [71771018, 71621001, 71303017, 71371111, 61203162]; foundation of Beijing Jiaotong University [2016RC012]",NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); foundation of Beijing Jiaotong University,"The authors would like to thank the two anonymous reviewers for the constructive comments and suggestions.

In order to better understand how the travel patterns vary, we propose to set up a large scale scenario based on MATSim for guarantying an accurate assessment of the impact of river floods on the transportation system. As inputs, the current agent-based model requires a base year population. A synthetic population with respective set of attributes is generated as a key input. Afterwards, agents are assigned activity chains through an activity-based generation process. Finally, the synthetic population and the transportation network are integrated into MATSim. Regarding data, households travel surveys, OD matrix of Belgium have been used to set up the demand. For simulating river floods effects, a steady-state inundation map has been integrated within MATSim. In the current study, five scenarios have been tested where critical links are associated various levels of service, i.e. 10%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% (base case scenario). They are systematically compared to the standard scenario to estimate the deviations in terms of traffic patterns and travel times. The results suggest that compared to the standard scenario, the average trip travel time increased by 16.36%, 44.44%, 126.77% and 144.44% with respect to scenarios 75%, 50%, 25% and 10% respectively.

In line with the perceived ethnic threat theory, people with a higher level of education advocate a more generous judgement of asylum applications than people with a low level of education. Surprisingly, income has the opposite effect. The effect of the (perceived) presence of out-groups members on the attitudes towards asylum seekers appears to vary between different scale levels. The higher people estimate the size of the immigrant groups at the national level, the less support they express for a generous judgement of asylum applications. At the neighbourhood level, more interethnic exposure leads to more support for a generous judgement of asylum applications. This may indicate that the ethnic competition theory works at a macro level, while at the neighbourhood level the contact hypothesis applies.","[Bolt, Gideon] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Dept Human Geog & Planning, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands; [Wetsteijn, Eva] Fac Social Sci, Padualaan 14, NL-3584 CH Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Bolt, G (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Dept Human Geog & Planning, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands.",G.S.Bolt@uu.nl; E.J.Wetsteijn@students.uu.nl,,,,,,,17,3,3,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

By exploiting data from IPUMS-USA (N= 4,958,722) and exogenous variation from state-level sentencing reforms, the study finds that the decline in the relative supply of marriageable males significantly increases the incidence of never-married female family headship for blacks but not for whites.","[Craigie, Terry-Ann] Connecticut Coll, New London, CT 06320 USA; [Myers, Samuel L., Jr.] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Darity, William A., Jr.] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Connecticut College; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Duke University,"Craigie, TA (通讯作者)，Connecticut Coll, Dept Econ, 270 Mohegan Ave, New London, CT 06320 USA.",tcraigie@conncoll.edu,"Myers, Samuel/ABI-5801-2020",,NICHD NIH HHS [P2C HD041023] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,68,4,8,1,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",2054-0892,2054-0906,,J DEMOGR ECON,J.Demogr.

Recent work has documented the prevalence of opportunism in a number of government bounty schemes, exploring how private entrepreneurs may rook the state and hence undermine the stated aims of these programs. We draw on transaction cost economics to provide a theory that explains the variation in the extent of opportunism in public-private exchange. The nature and extent of opportunism depends on the ability of the public authority to observe the production process of the good being claimed and the incentives to deny false claims. Where transaction costs limit observation, alternative (i.e., opportunistic) production processes will be prevalent. Where institutional features incentivize lax enforcement, opportunistic production processes will be prevalent. We illustrate our theory with two cases: navigational prizes in Great Britain and wolf bounties in North America. The cases provide evidence consistent with our theory. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Workshop 7 was specifically concerned with the way in which the widespread adoption of portable and/or wearable internet-connected devices such as smartphones has opened up new possibilities in the transport sector. These are referred to as 'uberisation' by some and the creation of Mobility as a Service (MaaS) by others. In some cities and countries, these new services have been welcomed and even facilitated, while in others there have been clashes with regulators as well as with incumbent operators. Workshop 7 considered how these new services might be integrated into the market and whether more widespread development of ride-hailing or ride-sharing might lead to new ways of creating flexible and truly on-demand urban bus services, or alternatively would the way public transport is organized and financed ultimately be disrupted so that what is viable in terms of competition, contracts and governance would need to be reconsidered. The Workshop presented evidence and undertook discussion that could be considered under four themes: conceptual; the role of MaaS in the uncertain future, including the new digital era; the experience of flexible transport in developing countries as compared to Australia and finally, how MaaS might provide for community needs. Over and above the detail provided by the evidence in papers, the Workshop discussion identified a tension between policy formulation and operator viewpoints, the need for flexibility in developing contracts, the importance of partnership in developing MaaS packages, including bundling mobility with other services provided by government and a need to address consumer protection issues. The Workshop developed a long list of areas worthy of further research including understanding how to move travel behaviour from ownership to mobility as a service, a need for further pilots to develop the evidence base, defining the regulatory frameworks and understanding pricing strategies.","[Mulley, Corinne] Univ Sydney, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Business Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Kronsell, Annica] Univ Gothenberg, Sch Global Studies, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Sydney; University of Gothenburg,"Mulley, C (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Business Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",corinne.mulley@sydney.edu.au; annica.kronsell@gu.se,"Mulley, Corinne/ACN-0179-2022",,,,,,14,26,28,4,53,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

Although railways are generally said to have their own option and non-use values compared with buses, conventional cost benefit analysis does not evaluate these values sufficiently because there have been few quantitative research studies into this issue. This paper, focusing on three different Japanese local railways, estimates railways' additional value over buses using the contingent valuation method (CVM). The CVM here is to estimate not an absolute total economic value of a specific railway but a relative value of railway to replacement buses. Therefore, our survey research has the advantage that data obtained from different railways can be comparable to a certain extent. The results show that two of three cases have their own additional value over buses of around twenty percent, and the other one has additional value of around ten percent. There is no big difference in evaluation between direct users and non-users at present. Also, the survey shows that, if train frequency increases, a certain number of residents, including potential users, are willing to pay more than the current fares.","[Utsunomiya, Kiyohito] Kansai Univ, Fac Econ, 3-3-35 Yamate, Suita, Osaka 5648680, Japan",Kansai University,"Utsunomiya, K (通讯作者)，Kansai Univ, Fac Econ, 3-3-35 Yamate, Suita, Osaka 5648680, Japan.",t110025@kansai-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,9,7,7,0,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

The study also found that port authorities controlled by States and Municipalities have better financial and operational results and use more management practices than those managed by the Brazilian Federal Government.","[Constante, Jonas Mendes] Erasmus Rotterdam Univ, Erasmus Ctr Urban Port & Transport Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [De Langen, Peter] Copenhagen Business Sch & Port & Logisitcs Adviso, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Borges Vieira, Guilherme Bergmann] Univ Caxias do Sul, Ctr Ciencias Socials Aplicadas, Caxias Do Sul, Brazil; [Lunkes, Rogerio Joao] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Ctr Ciencias Contabilidade, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [van der Lugt, Larissa] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Ctr Urban Port & Transport Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Universidade de Caxias do Sul; Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Constante, JM (通讯作者)，Erasmus Rotterdam Univ, Erasmus Ctr Urban Port & Transport Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",mendesconstante@ese.eul.nl; peter@pl-advisory.com; gbbvieir@ucs.br; lunkes@ufsc.br; vanderlugt@ese.eur.nl,"Vieira, Guilherme Bergmann Borges/U-1905-2017; Lunkes, Rogério João/HGA-8326-2022; Constante, Jonas Mendes/AAH-5576-2019; langen, peter d/G-3823-2011; de langen, peter w/U-3588-2018; Constante, Jonas M/H-7859-2012; Vieira, Guilherme/U-1905-2017","Vieira, Guilherme Bergmann Borges/0000-0001-6121-4174; Lunkes, Rogério João/0000-0003-4232-5746; Constante, Jonas Mendes/0000-0001-6236-1846; de langen, peter w/0000-0002-7703-5370; Vieira, Guilherme/0000-0001-6463-9987",,,,,44,5,5,0,19,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

The results indicate that lane-mile additions of intra-provincial road infrastructure may increase the industrial concentration in the central municipalities of the northeastern region, and this effect will grow stronger over the years. Our results also confirm the ambiguous effects of improvements in inter-provincial road facilities on manufacturing agglomeration. Moreover, road infrastructure construction, both intra- and inter provincial roads, was clearly not influenced by the location of prior manufacturing firms. Important policy implications appear from our findings for further decision making on road infrastructure expanding or planning in Northeast China, and other less developed regions worldwide with a similar economic and political environment.","[Yu, Nannan; Yu, Bo; Hong, Tao] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Yu, Nannan] Minist Educ, 14YJC630175, Beijing, Peoples R China; [de Jong, Martin] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Delft, Netherlands",Harbin Institute of Technology; Delft University of Technology,"Yu, NN (通讯作者)，Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.;Yu, NN (通讯作者)，Minist Educ, 14YJC630175, Beijing, Peoples R China.",nyuhit@gmail.com,"Hong, Tao/GLT-2559-2022","Hong, Tao/0000-0003-4056-9069","National Nature and Science Foundation at China [71403067, 71473059]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2013M540300, 2015T80364]; Humanities and Social Science Foundation",National Nature and Science Foundation at China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Humanities and Social Science Foundation,"We express our appreciation for the support of the project granted by National Nature and Science Foundation at China (No. 71403067 and 71473059), project granted by China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2013M540300 and No. 2015T80364) and project granted by Humanities and Social Science Foundation.",,41,0,0,2,40,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

This philosophical position, while common, often misses what is concretely at stake in the diagnosis and analyses of anti-Black racism in the United States. This article argues that racism is part of a deliberate strategy of academic philosophy to keep the discipline white. When one considers the demographic underrepresentation of Blacks compared to other groups in the academy, the use of universal pretenses to negate the experiences of racial minorities, and the sociological realities of race and racism in America, academic philosophy emerges as one of many ideological stratagems used to deny the realities of death and dying in our society. The authors argue that race neutrality and colorblindness cloak the societal consequences and disciplinary practices that allow segregation, violence, and anti-Black death to continue unabated.","[Curry, Tommy J.] Texas A&M Univ, Philosophy, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Curry, Gwenetta] Univ Alabama, Gender & Race Studies, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Curry, TJ (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Philosophy, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",tjcurry@tamu.edu; gcurry@ua.edu,"Curry, Gwenetta/X-8195-2019; Curry, Tommy/ABC-4108-2021","Curry, Gwenetta/0000-0003-3427-6630;",,,,,54,7,12,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

This study seeks to contribute to the debate from an emerging economy (South Africa) perspective. Aim: The study investigated whether there is a gender gap in SME access to venture capital, a distinct source of finance. Setting: SMEs play a significant role in South Africa's economy. Despite the importance of SMEs, access to finance is one of the major constraints affecting their success rate. Globally, to enhance the probability of SME survival, small business practitioners and governments are in search of relevant support measures. One of those measures could be adequate access to venture capital. However, it is sad to note that SMEs seldom use this distinct source of finance. Methods: The study made use of the quantitative method of research and is descriptive by design. Self-administered questionnaires were emailed to respondents for the purposes of gathering primary data. The t-test was used to statistically analyse primary data. Results: The results reveal that there is a statistically significant difference in the accessibility of venture capital between male-and female-owned SMEs. Conclusion: The article concludes that a gender gap in access to venture capital exists owing to differences in business approach between female entrepreneurs and their male counterparts. Female entrepreneurs are cautious about the level of risk they are willing to take and the amount of control they wish to exercise in firm ownership.","[Shava, Herring] Univ Ft Hare, Dept Business Management, Alice, South Africa",University of Fort Hare,"Shava, H (通讯作者)，Univ Ft Hare, Dept Business Management, Alice, South Africa.",hshava@ufh.ac.za,,"Shava, Herring/0000-0002-2094-9585",,,,,62,2,4,1,27,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Aim: Learning from and applying post-mortem analysis (PMA) is investigated to propose an evaluation framework. Setting: Following the problems by and expectations of the Regulator to 'govern' the business rescue (BR) industry, a recent decision to decentralise the accreditation of business rescue practitioners (BRPs) changed the landscape significantly. Methods: From literature and interviews, the study identified seven interactive evaluation criteria from PMA thinking to be included in a conceptual framework. Results: Following the determination of the contextual difficulty evaluation, the measurement criteria included: taking management control, initial feasibility judgement, viability analysis, decision-making, BRP competencies, the rescue plan and compliance within the supreme task. One mediating factor, namely the BRP dominated. Secondly, the evaluation process can be costly to ensure validity of the data, collection and evaluators. Finally, BRE evaluators (executors/decision makers) require a high level understanding of contextual issues that may disproportionately influence an evaluation. Expert and master level competencies are required to inform the proper judgement of the evaluation criteria and variables. Conclusion: The study addresses educators' need for a framework for PMA to guide the teaching of BRP competencies, direct the regulatory authorities (and professional bodies) accreditation framework for licensing BRPs, inform banks as creditors to enhance their information systems, advise upcoming BRPs on outcomes while courts may consider the framework as useful for judging issues.","[Pretorius, Marius] Univ Pretoria, Dept Business Management, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Pretorius, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Business Management, Pretoria, South Africa.",marius.pretorius@up.ac.za,"Pretorius, Marius/AAP-3344-2021","Pretorius, Marius/0000-0001-9729-3716",,,,,42,1,2,0,6,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

For the case of megaprojects, overestimation of benefits and underestimation of costs and risks is a common problem all over the world, leading to the 'survival of the unfittest' (Flyvbjerg, 2009). The main causes were identified in the optimism bias, strategic misrepresentation, path dependency leading to lock-in and poor oversight; however, the 'survival' of these causes is still unclear. For this purpose, the survival of the unfittest megaprojects is re-conceptualised into a proper cognitive-evolutionary framework. By introducing an innovative taxonomy of policy knowledge, this paper aims to argue that a specific policy community can 'survive' by strategically using a 'cognitive monopoly' of some of the relevant policy knowledge for megaprojects. Based on the case of the new `Watermael - Schuman - Josaphat' rail junction in Brussels, findings show the critical role played by the Federal Ministry for Communications thanks to a long-standing and context-specific know-how on underground works. While missing knowledge was outsourced and instrumentally used to overcome potential lock-in, the Ministry was able to build the only new large metropolitan infrastructure of Belgium during a period of high uncertainty due to decentralisation. The paper concludes discussing the effects of preserving this policy knowledge as well as negative issues related to this 'cognitive monopoly'.","[Dotti, Nicola Francesco] Univ Libre Bruxelles ULB, ICITE, Brussels, Belgium; [Dotti, Nicola Francesco] Univ Catholique Louvain UCL, ISPOLE, Louvain, Belgium",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Dotti, NF (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, Bldg H,Off H4-239,Ave FD Roosevelt 42, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",Nicola.Dotti@uclouvain.be,"Dotti, Nicola Francesco/J-8998-2015","Dotti, Nicola Francesco/0000-0003-1029-173X",Innoviris,Innoviris(Innoviris),"Innoviris supported this work under the grant Prospective Research for Brussels (2013-2016) for the project on the Europeanization of Research and Policy Innovations in Brussels.

As scenario analyses are used for informing decision-makers, it is of interest to contrast the similarities and differences between the scenario processes and outcomes using quantitative and qualitative approaches and to explore the underlying causes of differences. This paper uses the output from a qualitative scenario study to design forest sector model (FSM) scenarios and compares the results from the two approaches. We analyse two cases on wood products markets in Norway: i) Wood products suppliers establish a developer firm specializing on wood construction to boost demand, and ii) Levying a carbon tax while reducing CO2 emissions in cement production. Comparing the qualitative studies (innovation diffusion analysis, backcasting and Delphi) and FSM analyses (NorFor model), the results resemble for case ii) but deviate strongly for case i). Notably, the strategy aiming to boost the demand for domestic wood products leads in NorFor mainly to an increase in imports with limited impact on Norwegian sawnwood production. Causes of the discrepancies are discussed. Despite the challenges of combining the two frameworks, we believe that the method where assumptions based on stakeholder input or other qualitative research approaches are elaborated in a FSM and compared, should be more explored. Importantly, applying various methods and frameworks allows for complementing and diversifying the picture, and thus improving the knowledge base.

Since the opening of the first HSR, several studies have been undertaken to evaluate the increased accessibility HSR provides. The accessibility indicators used in these assessments consider the characteristics of the new transport system (speed, layout, stops, etc.) that are fundamentally related to the infrastructure itself. However, many studies on HSR have also highlighted the importance of providing services (timetables, frequencies, and fares). A high-performance infrastructure such as HSR may not reach its full potential in terms of accessibility and reducing travel times unless adequate services are provided. Considering this service approach, the paper presents a comparative accessibility analysis of the Spanish high-speed rail network based on two indicators: one focused on the potential connectivity between stations (location-based measure) and the other based on actual HSR services (schedule-based measure). This latter calculation has been established taking into account the available time at the destination and the associated travel costs. The use of this measure to assess the accessibility of the Spanish HSR network provides a new perspective on the real usefulness of this infrastructure. Comparing these two measures helps us evaluate the extent to which the services provided in each city allow the HSR network to reach its full potential accessibility. The comparison also highlights many dissimilarities among cities. This method provides a useful tool for transport planning and improving city design strategies.","[Moyano, Amparo; Coronado, Jose M.] Univ Castilla La Mancha UCLM, Dept Civil Engn, Av Camilo Jose Cela S-N, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain; [Martinez, Hector S.] Univ Castilla La Mancha UCLM, Geog & Land Planning, Av Camilo Jose Cela S-N, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Moyano, A (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha UCLM, Dept Civil Engn, Av Camilo Jose Cela S-N, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain.",amparo.moyano@uclm.es; hectors.martinez@uclm.es; josemaria.coronado@uclm.es,"Sánchez-Mateos, Héctor S Martínez/J-7262-2017; José María CORONADO, Engineer/D-7470-2011; Moyano, Amparo/I-5000-2015","Sánchez-Mateos, Héctor S Martínez/0000-0002-3613-9958; José María CORONADO, Engineer/0000-0002-8080-1689; Moyano, Amparo/0000-0003-1201-1025",Spanish Ministry of Education [FPU 13/01066]; Ministry of Science and Innovation [TRA2011-28465-0O3-01]; Department of Civil Engineering; Department of Geography and Land Planning in the University of Castilla La Mancha (UCLM),Spanish Ministry of Education(Spanish Government); Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Department of Civil Engineering; Department of Geography and Land Planning in the University of Castilla La Mancha (UCLM),"This study was supported by a grant from the Spanish Ministry of Education (Grant N FPU 13/01066, Programa FPU del Ministerio de Educacion, Cultura y Deporte), the Ministry of Science and Innovation (Grant N TRA2011-28465-0O3-01) and the funds provided by the Department of Civil Engineering and the Department of Geography and Land Planning in the University of Castilla La Mancha (UCLM).

Because of this 'lack of time' feeling, alternative work arrangements such as flexitime, telecommuting and practices such as work-life balance have emerged as popular topics for researchers, employees, organisations and the like in the past few decades. Setting: Women are still the main caregivers of family members and households, and compared to men, they are less likely to be granted flexitime by their employers. It therefore seems realistic to imagine that women would suffer more from work-life conflict. Women still earn, on average, less than men and are more likely to have part-time jobs. This has an impact on the financial well-being of women. These issues have yet to be investigated in an institution of higher learning in South Africa. Aim: This study was aimed at determining: (1) the relationship between flexi work, financial well-being and work-life balance, productivity and job satisfaction, (2) the role of flexible work, financial well-being and work-life balance in productivity and job satisfaction, and (3) the mediating effect of productivity (job satisfaction in the alternative model) in the relationship between flexible work, financial well-being and work-life balance and job satisfaction (productivity in the alternative model). Methods: A cross-sectional survey was used with a convenience sample (n = 252) of female support employees, employed in a higher education institution in the North West province of South Africa. Results: Findings of the study indicated a statistically significant relationship between the variables. Results indicated that financial well-being, work-life balance and productivity were statistically significant predictors of job satisfaction, and in addition, subjective experiences of productivity serve as partial mediators in the relationship between financial well-being and work-life balance on the one hand, and job satisfaction on the other hand. Conclusion: It seems like financial well-being and work-life balance play a more important role in job satisfaction and that financial well-being and work-life balance are more important for job satisfaction through subjective experiences of productivity. It would therefore make sense to increase experiences of financial well-being and work-life balance to address experiences of low levels of job satisfaction and subjective experiences of productivity.","[Jackson, Leon T.

Organizing as a corporation, a limited company, or a partnership shapes the firm's access to capital markets, its governance arrangements and tax liabilities, and its treatment in bankruptcy. We use multinomial choice models to estimate the determinants of enterprise form using firm-level data on Spain for the period 1886-1936. Our results support hypotheses drawn from the corporate-finance and ownership literatures; entrepreneurs preferred the corporation for the largest firms and for firms vulnerable to holdup. In 1919, Spain introduced a new legal form, a limited company combining attributes of the corporation and the partnership. This Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada (SRL) displaced both corporations and partnerships, and was especially popular for small and medium-sized firms whose owners were unrelated. Counterfactual calculations suggest that few enterprises created prior to 1919 would have chosen the SRL even if it had been available.","[Guinnane, Timothy W.] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Martinez-Rodriguez, Susana] Univ Murcia, Dept Appl Econ, Reg Campus Int Excellence Campus Mare Nostrum, Murcia, Spain",Yale University; University of Murcia,"Guinnane, TW (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",timothy.guinnane@yale.edu; susanamartinezr@um.es,"Martinez-Rodriguez, Susana/AAM-9066-2020",,National Science Foundation; Yale University Economic Growth Center; McMillan Center at Yale; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [HAR2013-42013-R],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Yale University Economic Growth Center; McMillan Center at Yale; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"The authors appreciate helpful comments from Cihan Artunc , Benito Arrun ada, Jose Antonio Espin-Sanchez, Amanda Gregg, Fernando Go mez-Pomar, Leslie Hannah, Philip Haile, Eric Hilt, Naomi Lamoreaux, Thomas Mroz, Aldo Musacchio, Tom Nicholas, Jean-Laurent Rosenthal, Francesca Trivellato, Maribel Sa ez-Lacave, and Ebonya Washington.

J,"Hovenkamp, H",,,,"Hovenkamp, Herbert",,,The NCAA and the Rule of Reason,REVIEW OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Antitrust; NCAA; Rule of reason; Balancing,,"This brief essay considers the use of antitrust's rule of reason in assessing challenges to rule-making by the NCAA. In particular, it looks at the O'Bannon case, which involved challenges to NCAA rules that limit the compensation of student athletes under the NCAA rubric that protects the amateur status of collegiate athletes. Within that rubric, the Ninth Circuit got the right answer. That outcome leads to a broader question, however: Should the NCAA's long held goal, frequently supported by the courts, of preserving athletic amateurism be jettisoned? Given the dual role that colleges play, that is a complex question, which raises issues that are not only commercial but also educational. More important for the purpose at hand, is whether jettisoning amateurism in NCAA athletics is a suitable task for an antitrust tribunal. This paper argues that antitrust law is not an appropriate vehicle for addressing that issue. This does not mean that antitrust has no role to play in policing athlete compensation in NCAA schools. But it does suggest that that role be limited to addressing restraints on trade that occur within the rubric of amateur status-at least until such time as a more competent body decides whether amateurism in collegiate athletics is worth preserving.","[Hovenkamp, Herbert] Univ Penn, Penn Law & Wharton Business, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Hovenkamp, H (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Penn Law & Wharton Business, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",hhovenka@law.upenn.edu,,,,,,,9,2,6,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

Advances in information and communication technologies (ICTs), especially mobile phones and the internet, have expanded the possibility to communicate across geographical distances and to integrate into commercial value chains. By using a novel combination of conceptual considerations on ICTs, value chains, and relational proximity, this paper assesses: 1. How the use of ICTs affects the integration of small-scale farmers into the value chains (by analysing the information and knowledge flow, the financial and market transactions) and 2. to what extent the use of ICTs is on the other side influenced by the value chain context (i.e. the structure and coordination of the chain and the relational proximity between farmer and buyer). Our findings showed that even simple ICTs (phones) can lead to improvements for farmers to integrate into the chain as they facilitate simple information and complex knowledge flow, financial transactions, and market access, even though a greater structural transformation was absent. However, our results showed that the extent of the effects depends on the context in the value chains, in particular their structure, coordination, and the relational proximity between the actors. In this way, this paper contributes to the conceptual discussions on information and communication for development (ICT4D) and the dynamics in value chains.","[Krone, Madlen; Dannenberg, Peter] Univ Cologne, Inst Geog, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Krone, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Inst Geog, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",m.krone@uni-koeln.de,"Dannenberg, Peter/J-5771-2016","Dannenberg, Peter/0000-0002-4159-6635",German Research Foundation (DFG) [DA1128/4-1],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This work was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) [DA1128/4-1].,,62,10,10,1,26,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

For that purpose, conceptualizations of hegemony by word-system scholars, namely Immanuel Wallerstein and Giovanni Arrighi, are being contrasted with John Agnew's account in political geography. The main difference refers to the geographies of hegemony: For Agnew, a stateless hegemony is conceivable, while for Wallerstein and Arrighi hegemony in the capitalist world-system requires a state to exercise it. The paper than goes on to argue that in order to operate successfully capitalism needs the cooperation of political and economic power and hence the bringing together of the spaces of places of the former and the spaces of flows of the latter. Against this backdrop I contend that Trump's nationalist rhetoric and (so far conceivable) politics embody and communicate the loss of U.S. hegemony both inwards and outwards. While Trump's geographical imaginations of power are downscaled to the national, U.S. big business is ever more moving in and using global commodity chains. The fusion of the political spaces of territory and the economic spaces of flows are drifting apart. Moreover, hegemony in the capitalist world-system is global by definition. In the paper's conclusion, the notion of a stateless hegemony is questioned.","[Parnreiter, Christof] Univ Hamburg, Dept Earth Sci, Inst Geog, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Parnreiter, C (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Dept Earth Sci, Inst Geog, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",christof.parnreiter@uni-hamburg.de,,,,,,,70,15,15,0,39,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

It also seeks to understand how these factors are articulated in the production of such effects. This paper presents a case study conducted in a Portuguese seaport. The complexity of the interactions between the various actors turns the seaport into a very interesting empirical ground for research. Evidence suggests that compatibility/incompatibility of goals and power can be crucial drivers for the creation or deterioration of Collective Intellectual Capital in a seaport context. These concepts, as well as the ones of collaborative and conflictive behaviors are encapsulated in an integrated framework, in which both dyadic and more complex relationships are depicted. Seaports are still underexplored empirical settings, from an IC perspective. Hence, we take a new approach in order to establish causal relationships between the concepts of collaboration and also conflict, at both dyadic and networking levels, with the ones of collective intellectual assets and collective intellectual liabilities. The paper provides practitioners with valuable insights, namely those responsible for network coordinator organizations (such as port authorities) who are concerned with the achievement of a meta-organization's goals. This study contributes to the development of IC research in practice, specifically in a setting a meta-organization in which a collective service is provided. Hence, generalization to other situations should only be conducted in a theoretically framed manner.","[Vale, Jose] CEOS PP, Porto Accounting & Business Sch, Polytech Porto, Rua Jaime Lopes Amorim S-N, P-4465004 Porto, Portugal; [Vale, Jose] CEPESE, Rua Jaime Lopes Amorim S-N, P-4465004 Porto, Portugal; [Branco, Manuel Castelo; Ribeiro, Joao] Univ Porto, Fac Econ, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200464 Porto, Portugal",Instituto Politecnico do Porto; Universidade do Porto,"Vale, J (通讯作者)，CEOS PP, Porto Accounting & Business Sch, Polytech Porto, Rua Jaime Lopes Amorim S-N, P-4465004 Porto, Portugal.;Vale, J (通讯作者)，CEPESE, Rua Jaime Lopes Amorim S-N, P-4465004 Porto, Portugal.",josevale@iscap.ipp.pt; mcbranco@fep.up.pt; joao.ribeiro@fep.up.pt,"Branco, Manuel Castelo/D-1705-2010; Vale, José/L-9389-2017; Vale, Jose/A-7276-2015","Branco, Manuel Castelo/0000-0003-3715-0881; Ribeiro, Joao/0000-0001-9949-5880; Vale, Jose/0000-0001-8406-0462",,,,,54,2,2,0,15,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

The data show that trade credit is a crucial component in the liability portfolios of unlisted Saudi firms. Moreover, we employ fixed-effects panel estimation to control for firm-specific, time-invariant heterogeneity. Our results provide strong support for the idea of substitution effect between traditional debt and debt provided by suppliers. Moreover, the results reveal that older firms tend to have a lower level of trade credit and larger companies tend to have higher levels. Consistent with the pecking order hypothesis, profitability is negatively correlated with the level of trade credit. The findings also suggest that firms with abundant current assets receive more financing from their suppliers. However, the number of growth opportunities appears to influence the level of trade credit only in small- and medium-sized companies where a significant negative relationship is observed.","[Al Dohaiman, Mohammed Saleh] Al Imam Muhammad Ibn Saud Islamic Univ, Coll Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Finance & Investment, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University (IMSIU),"Al Dohaiman, MS (通讯作者)，Al Imam Muhammad Ibn Saud Islamic Univ, Coll Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Finance & Investment, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",mdhaiman@gmail.com,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,6930,6941,,,,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553207090,0

The available studies present many different and mutually contradictory factors that need to be taken into account in the strategic financial decisions of managers. Their importance and intensity are different for individual business entities. Given the specificities of companies in the SME segment, achieving an optimal capital structure is a challenging task as there is no model of an optimal capital structure that can be universally applied in corporate practice. For this reason, we decided to realize our research. The main aim of the paper is to identify determinants of the SME's capital structure. We studied the impact of four determinants: region, business area, number of employees and business duration, on the manager's decisions about capital structure in the enterprise. Our research is based on the database 'Albertina', which consist of all SME in the Czech Republic. We applied ordinal logistic regression and estimated five models. These models were used to predict attitude of SME to the capital structure. Analysis was done in R Software. The main finding is that the size of the company measured by the number of employees effects its attitude to volume of foreign and own capital used to finance its activities. Analysis also showed that entrepreneurs with longer duration of taking their business prefer more foreign capital than their own capital. Business area and region where enterprise is located do not significantly affect capital structure.","[Belas, Jaroslav] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Zlin, Czech Republic; [Gavurova, Beata] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Banking & Investment, Kosice, Slovakia; [Toth, Peter] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, Kosice, Slovakia",Tomas Bata University Zlin; Technical University Kosice; Technical University Kosice,"Gavurova, B (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Banking & Investment, Kosice, Slovakia.",beata.gavurova@tuke.sk,"Tóth, Peter/IWD-7027-2023; Tóth, Peter/AAP-2131-2020; Belas, Jaroslav/AGS-6813-2022; Gavurová, Beáta/N-9159-2018","Tóth, Peter/0000-0002-5616-5520; Belas, Jaroslav/0000-0002-5900-997X; Gavurová, Beáta/0000-0002-0606-879X",,,,,33,37,37,4,35,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Research results have shown that trust based on knowledge and identification positively affect organizational outcomes (where the impact of trust based on identification is stronger). On the other hand, trust based on calculation either does not affect the results or its impact is negative. This means, first of all, that the durability of relationships that build trust has an impact on the results achieved by the organization as a whole: The more permanent the relationships between the participants of the organization, the better results the organization achieves. It also proves that not every type of trust always positively affects the organization's results.

The mission of marketers is increasingly difficult because they have to develop a marketing mix able to target efficiently all customers, invoking satisfaction and loyal behavior. Communication strategy therefore has a special role to play. While Millennials are easier to target, persuade even influence through social media, Gen Xers are more conservative, preferring to look for additional information about products and companies themselves, which makes the marketer's job even more difficult. Nowadays, social media plays an increasingly important part in influencing consumers and their consumption behavior. Being able to expand beyond geographical borders, social media creates strong links between consumers in different states and social environments. Research conducted among Gen Xers and Millennials shows that whenever they choose food products and tourist services based on recommendations and the information available on social media, their purchasing behavior depends on their own personal desire to become informed, and the characteristics they expect from a piece of information and from the Internet as a general source of information. Given this, companies changed and adapted their communication strategies in order to be more present online. In addition, for those interested, companies create official pages that can represent a strong support for those interested in acquiring information. Quite often, consumers have the possibility to compare goods and services before buying, minimizing the risks attached to these acquisitions. The results reveal that Millennials have stronger affinity with, and place greater reliance upon online information than Gen Xers. From a managerial perspective, this paper provides retailers with the opportunity to better understand the behavior of customers of different ages, making their targeting more successful.","[Dabija, Dan-Cristian; Bejan, Brindu.

In this paper multi agent MCDM is represented as an evolutionary game and the evolutionary strategies are defined as sustainable decisions. Here we consider the problem of decision making in Indian Tea Industry. The agents in this game are essentially Indian Tea Estate owner and Indian Tea board. The replicator dynamics of the evolutionary game are studied to obtain evolutionary strategies which could be defined as sustainable strategies. The multi agent MCDM in Indian Tea Industry is considered under different socio-political and Corporate Social Responsibility scenario and groups of Indian Tea Industry. Again, the impacts of imprecision and market volatility on the outcome of some strategies (decisions) are studied. In this paper the imprecision on the impact of the strategies are modelled as fuzzy numbers whereas the market volatility is taken into account as white noise. Hence the MCDM problem for Indian Tea Industry is modelled as a hybrid evolutionary game. The probabilities of strategies are obtained by solving hybrid evolutionary game and could be represented as a Dempster-Shafer belief structure. The simulation results facilitate the Decision Makers to choose the strategies (decisions) under different type of uncertainty.","[Debnath, Animesh] Vivekananda Mahavidyalaya, Dept Econ, Burdwan East 713103, India; [Bandyopadhyay, Abhirup; Roy, Jagannath; Kar, Samarjit] Natl Inst Technol, Dept Math, Durgapur 713209, India",National Institute of Technology (NIT System); National Institute of Technology Durgapur,"Kar, S (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Technol, Dept Math, Durgapur 713209, India.",kar_s_k@yahoo.com,"Debnath, Animesh/AAY-4144-2021; Roy, Jagannath/L-4813-2016; Debnath, Animesh/I-5399-2019; Kar, Samarjit/R-3128-2019","Debnath, Animesh/0000-0001-9008-3070; Roy, Jagannath/0000-0002-5252-5736; Debnath, Animesh/0000-0001-9008-3070;",,,,,27,18,22,4,56,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

These reforms have often been included in a larger discussion of economic reforms and the withdrawal of the state from the Egyptian market. While certainly market-based, these reforms were interpreted and implemented in a uniquely Egyptian context and moved forward not through a market logic but with a specific understanding of political feasibility. Despite these local peculiarities, Egypt experienced a backlash familiar to researchers of structural adjustment internationally. How did Egypt's structural adjustment and other liberalizing' reforms produce spatialized and sectoral backlash and drive workers from quiescence to militancy? Based on extensive fieldwork and interviews conducted in 2011-2013, this paper argues that the choices made by the Egyptian regime from 1991 to 2010 generated labour lacunae' - spaces in the political-economic structure where methods of interest aggregation were replaced by coercion or neglect - allowing militancy to flourish. I explore how labour entrepreneurs exploited these lacunae' to redefine local' protest in the run-up to the Egyptian Revolution of 2011.","[Hartshorn, Ian M.] Univ Nevada, Dept Polit Sci, Reno 1664 N Virginia St,MS 0302, Reno, NV 89557 USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno,"Hartshorn, IM (通讯作者)，Univ Nevada, Dept Polit Sci, Reno 1664 N Virginia St,MS 0302, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",ihartshorn@unr.edu,"Hartshorn, Ian M./AAC-6988-2019","Hartshorn, Ian M./0000-0002-6621-0532",,,,,26,2,2,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

The theoretical background of the research are bibliographic and electronical sources. The paper is dealing with maintaining liquidity, financial analysis, reorganizational plan, restructuralization and its possible innovative solutions. The base of the practical research are the sales statistics of the steel industrial company Tom-ferr Ltd. and its partner companies: the direct information derive from the 32 selected partner steel companies, and from the official state database. The analysis collected information from direct survey research method and indirect method of filtering databases. The results of the research showed that automatic renovation processes were launched due to negative effects and forces of the economic crisis, however, bringing off these processes doesn't mean recovery from the economic crisis. Fifty-two percent of the examined companies said that without the innovative steps of the restructuralization their company would not have survived the most difficult periods of the economic crisis. The study provides a practical guide to perform those measures, which should help to survive and to stabilize the company in crisis periods.","[Matus, Andor] J Selye Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Bratislavska Cesta 3322, Komarno 94501, Slovakia",J.

It examines the relationships between company-cause congruence, corporate credibility, altruism attribution and perceived CSR, and CSR with consumer loyalty, and analyzes the moderating effect of the type of communication medium (ie. traditional medium vs. social medium). This study is original because it fills the gap in the CSR communication literature in the evaluation of how the use of one or another type of meditun to advertise a cause related marketing activity influences the effect of perceived CSR on consumer loyalty. An empirical study was conducted with two samples of consumers, each of which was exposed to the same advertisement, inserted in either a newspaper or posted on a social network. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results carry implications for CSR activities and communications management as they validate the proposed model that integrates the antecedents of perceived CSR and its influence on loyalty, and show that the traditional medium model has a better fit and its overall effect is greater than the social medium model. From a practical perspective, this study has several implications regarding the importance of communicating CSR activities.","[Mercade-Mele, Pere; Fernandez-Morales, Antonio] Univ Malaga, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Stat & Econometr, Campus El Ejido S-N, E-29071 Malaga, Spain; [Molinillo, Sebastian] Univ Malaga, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Business Management, Campus El Ejido S-N, E-29071 Malaga, Spain; [Porcu, Lucia] Univ Granada, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Mkt & Market Res, Campus La Cartuja S-N, E-18071 Granada, Spain",Universidad de Malaga; Universidad de Malaga; University of Granada,"Molinillo, S (通讯作者)，Univ Malaga, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Business Management, Campus El Ejido S-N, E-29071 Malaga, Spain.",smolinillo@uma.es,"MELÉ, PERE PMM MERCADÉ/R-5277-2016; Porcu, Lucia/H-8147-2015; Fernández-Morales, Antonio/C-8244-2011; Molinillo, Sebastian/I-2420-2015","MELÉ, PERE PMM MERCADÉ/0000-0002-6002-0930; Fernández-Morales, Antonio/0000-0001-7891-7634; Molinillo, Sebastian/0000-0001-9132-5190",,,,,79,28,29,5,35,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

However, little empirical research has been conducted on the effect of website design on eWOM intention. The objective of this paper is to investigate the impact of website design (aesthetic and usability) on eWOM intention, which is based on the adoption of the stimulus - organism - response model. To test the hypotheses, the study uses the Partial Least Squares (PLS) to test a total of 290 respondents collected from Taiwanese customers via an online survey. The outcomes show the impact of the website's design on the attitude toward it, which would lead to positive eWOM. The study also provides empirical evidence on the moderating role of online purchasing experience and the mediating effect of attitude toward a website on eWOM intention.

However, the slowing growth of sharia banks, especially sharia commercial banks in the last 5 years, has become a bad report for the Indonesian economy, so there is a need for an appropriate assessment and strategy to improve the performance of sharia commercial banks. This research uses descriptive research method with quantitative approach, the Balanced Scorecard approach is done by assessing the performance of four perspectives, namely financial perspective, customer perspective, internal business process perspective, and growth and learning perspective. Based on the weighting of the Balanced Scorecard conducted on the performance of sharia commercial banks obtained by the number of weighted scores of 281, the final value of the total performance measurement of sharia commercial banks is 70.25%. The total value of 70.25% shows that the performance of the 2014-2016 Islamic banks is healthy with category A. Based on the measurement results, there are still some performance that still need to be improved, namely; (1) In the perspective of internal business processes, Sharia Banks need to improve new product innovations and improve services, one of which is to increase infrastructure which is expected to improve bank after-sales services. In fact, it can be said that the infrastructure owned by Islamic banks is currently limited. (2) In a financial perspective, sharia commercial banks must be able to increase the return of assets and increase cost efficiency towards operating income. (3) Although the financial, customer, and growth and learning perspectives are in the healthy category, this does not mean that the efforts of Islamic commercial banks to improve their performance are enough to arrive here. The healthy category obtained by this perspective is in the last categorization criteria, which means that sharia commercial banks have the potential to fall into the unhealthy category. So, Islamic commercial banks must continue to make various kinds of efforts to improve their performance. In the end, it is expected that performance measurement with balance scorecard can become a means to measure and then become a tool to design strategies implemented in an effort to improve the performance of Islamic commercial banks.","[Ratnawati, Aryanti; Saepudin, Saepudin; Hardiyanti, Siti Asri] Univ Sangga Buana, Fak Ekon, Bandung, Indonesia",,"Ratnawati, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sangga Buana, Fak Ekon, Bandung, Indonesia.",aryanti.ratnawati@usbypkp.ac.id; saepudin.ciamis@yahoo.co.id; sitiasri123@gmail.com,"Ratnawati, Aryanti/AAC-2243-2021",,"Faculty of Economics, Sangga Buana University","Faculty of Economics, Sangga Buana University","This research was supported by the Faculty of Economics, Sangga Buana University.

IFRS 9 addresses all the relevant aspects on the accounting for financial instruments, including classification and measurement, impairment of financial assets and general hedge accounting, followed by the macro hedge accounting model which will be important for risk management. Approach: This publication presents a number of important points and focuses on just one topic in IFRS 9: the hedge accounting. IFRS 9 aligns hedge accounting more closely with risk management, establishes a more principle-based approach to hedge accounting and addresses inconsistencies and weaknesses in the hedge accounting model in IAS 39. Findings: We present the benefits of the new approach compared with the older IAS 39 approach. The International Accounting Standard Board (IASB) has fundamentally reconsidered the purpose and objective of Hedge Accounting and decided that the objective of Hedge Accounting should be to reflect the effects of the modern risk management activities in the financial statements. Practical implications: As a first result, the IASB has broadened the application of Hedge Accounting for more entities to include many more modern risk management activities in the new IFRS 9. As a result of this, there is the potential for entities to significantly reduce reported profit or loss volatility through economic hedging activities and the application of the new Hedge Accounting rules. Originality: There are benefits in the two new hedge accounting models from the standard IFRS 9 compared with the IAS 39. IAS 39 was a standard for the risk management done in the last decade, now there are more complex and flexible strategies done by the companies and the accounting rules must try to reflect them as best as possible. We think IFRS 9 is on a way to make the best advantages out of the lessons lernt in the financial crisis and new risk management. Conclusion is that the standard setter IASB did a good piece of work with the new hedge accounting rules in IFRS 9, but in future there will be always a need for new rules regarding to new risk management strategies.","[Ringsdorf, Bastian; Kajanova, Jana] Comenius Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Fac Management, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava 82005 25, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Ringsdorf, B (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, PhD Program, Bratislava, Slovakia.",b.ringsdorf@ringsdorf.co,"Kajanova, Jana/N-6019-2014",,,,,,10,0,0,0,8,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,3921,3927,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO7SQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000525490800105,0

It is necessary to carry out navigation (full-scale) tests in real conditions to confirm the scientific research results in order to ensure safe navigation on several real marine features, for example, sea vessels, which seems to be quite difficult. Moreover, such full-scale tests may take too much time to prepare and / or restore a marine feature into an original situation. In addition, incidents that are likely possible on a real marine feature can have significant social and / or economic consequences. In this paper the researchers present the results of developing a virtual polygon to simulate safe ship navigation. The authors use software such as the Unreal Engine 4 physics engine, the Visual Studio programming environment, and 3DS MAX and Cinema 4D to design three-dimensional offshore facilities. The scholars outline program elements of the virtual polygon, illustrate their structure and correlation.

The participation of companies in the shadow economy affects their operations, and thus the processes of their growth. On the one hand, it stimulates the efficiency of companies while, on the other hand, it increases the risk of failure due to the possibility of overestimating the effects of income x through the inclusion of illusory effects in profitability estimation, which results in the emergence of problems in growth management. An analysis of the reasons behind the risk of growth failure of companies operating in the shadow economy was conducted on the basis of 131 Polish SMEs. The research shows that the risk rises with the increase in the share of the shadow economy in the financing of business growth. The risk of growth failure of companies operating in the shadow economy increases due to errors in management resulting from a lack of competencies and experience of entrepreneurs from the SME sector. It does, however, decrease when the use of an anticipatory strategy of growth, but increases when an ad hoc growth strategy is used.","[Stawasz, Edward] Univ Lodz, Fac Management, Lodz, Poland; [Stos, Daniel] Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz; University of Lodz,"Stawasz, E (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Fac Management, Lodz, Poland.",stawasz@uni.lodz.pl; danstos@poczta.fm,,", Daniel Stos/0000-0002-7974-076X; Stawasz, Edward/0000-0003-4744-6096",,,,,22,0,0,0,7,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-68285-3; 978-3-319-68284-6,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,203,218,,10.1007/978-3-319-68285-3_16,0.0,,,16,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1XS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448589400016,0

For a high age, certain illnesses that will require the care of other people are identified. At the same time, older workers may cause a drop in employment if the retirement age is increased. This contribution focuses on selected health constraints in terms of severity and duration, which prevail in older people and which therefore become more important in the conditions of the aging population.

Contrary to mainstream economic thought, however, the various types of market failure (notably externalities, public goods and information asymmetries) are not separate descriptions of distinct empirical phenomena, but simply offer different perspectives on the same problem, as I contend in this paper. Because these types of market failure do not stand in an orthogonal, equidistant relationship to one another, if, when and how a market failure occurs is by no means objectively clear. Using the cases of higher education and the global financial crisis, I argue that the conditions in which markets fail, like markets themselves, are socially embedded, context-specific, and the result of often unrecognized political decision-making. The elusiveness of defining market failure therefore does not just seriously question the concept's usefulness, but can even render it counter-productive, as it turns an essentially political debate into a technical one, tending to privilege certain private interests over the public good.","[Vormann, Boris] Bard Coll Berlin, Polit Concentrat, Platanenstr 24, D-13156 Berlin, Germany",,"Vormann, B (通讯作者)，Bard Coll Berlin, Polit Concentrat, Platanenstr 24, D-13156 Berlin, Germany.",b.vormann@berlin.bard.edu,,,,,,,57,1,1,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

A data set of A-share listed companies in China during 2008-2016 was employed to explore the effect of industry specialization on audit costs and the moderating effect of industry homogeneity. This study selected audit fees and delays as proxy for audit costs. Moreover, Big 4 and non-Big 4 auditors were compared and scrutinized to distinguish the different effects of reputation concerns and economies of scale on audit costs. In addition, further investigation was conducted to verify whether reduced audit costs caused by economies of scale impaired audit quality. Results show that industry specialization has a significantly positive effect on audit fees and that no significant difference in audit delays exists between industry and non-industry specialists. Audit fees and audit delays decrease substantially in homogeneous industries, but audit fees charged by Big 4 auditors do not decline significantly. Industry specialization can also improve audit quality, while economies of scale resulting from industry homogeneity do not impair audit quality. In terms of competitive strategy, industry specialist auditors in homogeneous industries should adopt a cost leadership strategy to achieve competitive advantages. The findings in this study can provide far-reaching implications for auditor industry-specialized investments and clarify the reasonable pricing of audit service.","[Xiong, Yi; Zhang, Youtang] Wuhan Univ Technol, Coll Management, 122 Luoshi South Rd, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Technology,"Xiong, Y (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ Technol, Coll Management, 122 Luoshi South Rd, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China.",xy_whut@sina.com; zyt@whut.edu.cn,,,National Social Science Foundation of China [15AGL008],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),This study was supported by National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 15AGL008).,,37,0,0,2,9,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The design of an auto-enrolment scheme for Ireland is motivated by international experiences of autoenrolment. Using a bootstrap approach to model historical returns for 24 hypothetical portfolios over a 40-year period, we investigate the probability of achieving a target pension income. The purpose of this empirical analysis is to determine what strategies and portfolio design will best achieve a projected target income replacement ratio for a typical member of a national auto-enrolment scheme. The simulated results indicate that a contribution rate of 8 per cent should, for the median outcome, be sufficient to generate a pension income close to 65 per cent of final salary. However, the State Contributory Pension plays an important and significant buffer for retirees, especially in the unlucky outcome when asset values have fallen just before retiring.","[Gallagher, Liam A.] Dublin City Univ, Dublin, Ireland; [Ryan, Fionnuala] Pens Author, Dublin, Ireland",Dublin City University,"Gallagher, LA (通讯作者)，Dublin City Univ, Dublin, Ireland.",Liam.Gallagher@dcu.ie,,"Gallagher, Liam/0000-0002-3513-8013",,,,,38,2,3,0,1,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

Two mergers, Anthem with Cigna and Aetna with Humana, threatened to dramatically alter the face of commercial health insurance. The Anthem case raised questions of how to evaluate a claim that competition costs billions annually in potential medical cost savings. The Aetna case raised questions of how commercial insurers compete against the public programs-specifically Medicare. The Division also litigated numerous other civil matters including a proposed merger of nuclear waste disposal facilities. In that case, economists had to explore the scope and bounds of competition within a variety of regulatory regimes. And, in a merger of two new technologies that improve the efficiency of planting seeds, the emerging nature of the market led to interesting variations in the analysis. This overview of the economic issues in these particular cases is intended to provide insights into the challenges of enforcing antitrust law and the way in which economic analysis in particular is used to address those challenges.","[Gerstle, Ari D.; Knudsen, Helen C.; Lee, June K.; Majure, W.

There are major contributions in this paper which include the introduction of an input selection criterion when utilizing an expansive universe of inputs, a hybrid combination of partial swarm optimizer (PSO) with radial basis function (RBF) neural networks, the application of a PSO algorithm to a traditional autoregressive moving model (ARMA), the application of a PSO algorithm to a higher-order neural network and, finally, the introduction of a multi-objective algorithm to optimize statistical and trading performance when trading an index. All the machine learning-based methodologies and the conventional models are adapted and optimized to model the index. A PSO algorithm is used to optimize the weights in a traditional RBF neural network, in a higher-order neural network (HONN) and the AR and MA terms of an ARMA model. In terms of checking the statistical and empirical accuracy of the novel models, we benchmark them with a traditional HONN, with an ARMA, with a moving average convergence/divergence model (MACD) and with a naive strategy. More specifically, the trading and statistical performance of all models is investigated in a forecast simulation of the FTSE 100 and DAX 30 ETF time series over the period January 2004 to December 2015 using the last 3years for out-of-sample testing. Finally, the empirical and statistical results indicate that the PSO-RBF model outperforms all other examined models in terms of trading accuracy and profitability, even with mixed inputs and with only autoregressive inputs.

It provides an overview of gender equality in the labour market in Ireland over a 50-year period. It takes as its starting point two studies published by ESRI researchers in the early 1970s including a survey of women carried out in 1973. Five themes are identified in these early studies, which are then carried through to the current period. These are: patterns of female labour force participation; gender segregation; sectoral labour demand; attitudes; and appropriate policy responses. The study then outlines how many of the normative, legislative and institutional constraints to women's employment were removed during the following decades and discusses key educational and fertility trends that influenced labour force participation. Policy responses have also shifted over the period. We find that while there has been distinct change in the normative culture, a major upward shift in the scale of female employment, and a decline in gender segregation, women's and men's employment remains strongly gendered.","[Russell, Helen; McGinnity, Frances] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland; [Russell, Helen; McGinnity, Frances] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [O'Connell, Philip J.] Univ Coll Dublin, UCD Geary Inst Publ Policy, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin; University College Dublin,"Russell, H (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland.;Russell, H (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",Helen.Russell@esri.ie,"O'Connell, Philip John/AFK-9353-2022","O'Connell, Philip John/0000-0002-2036-283X",,,,,52,18,18,0,5,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

There is no unambiguous theoretical evidence which explains the impact of exchange rate on economic growth; in fact, both theories and evidences are diverging. Most of the theories are emphasizing on explaining indirect relation between exchange rate and economic growth as exchange rate stimulates growth in terms of exports, investment and foreign direct investment (FDI). This study is an attempt to explore the relationship between exchange rate and economic growth in Pakistan for period 1976-2010. Using simultaneous equation model, employing two, three stage least square (2SLS and 3SLS) techniques and found that exchange rate has a positive association with economic growth through the channel of export promotion incentives, enlarging the volume of investment, enhancing FDI inflow and promoting import substitute industry. Although, exchange rate is positively affecting economic growth, yet it can't be used as a policy tool.","[Aman, Qaiser] Qurtuba Univ Sci & IT, Dept Management Sci & IT, Dera Ismail Khan, Pakistan; [Ullah, Irfan] Gomal Univ, Econ Dept, Dera Ismail Khan, Pakistan; [Khan, Muhammad Imran; Khan, Saif-ud-Din] Qurtuba Univ, Dera Ismail Khan, Pakistan",Gomal University,"Aman, Q (通讯作者)，Qurtuba Univ Sci & IT, Dept Management Sci & IT, Dera Ismail Khan, Pakistan.",amanf15@yahoo.com; irfanecon@gmail.com; imrankhanjanjua@yahoo.com; saifjan2002@yahoo.com,"Aman, Qaiser/D-3808-2019; Ullah, Irfan/AAW-9177-2020; DIN, SAIF UD/GVT-1188-2022","Aman, Qaiser/0000-0003-4358-7940; Din, Saif Ud/0000-0002-5096-8365",,,,,24,7,7,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

But, the compatibility of the principle of legal certainty with ideals such as liberalism and free market economy must not lead to the hastened conclusion that therefore the principle of legal certainty would be compatible and tantamount to the principle of economic efficiency. We intend to analyse the efficiency rationale of an important general principle of EU law-the principle of legal certainty. In this paper, we shall assert that not only does the EU legal certainty principle encapsulate an efficiency rationale, but most importantly, it has been interpreted by the ECJ as such. The economic perspective of the principle of legal certainty in the European context has, so far, never been adopted. Hence, we intend to fill in this gap and propose the representation of the principle of legal certainty as a principle of economic efficiency. After having deciphered the principle of legal certainty from a law and economics perspective (1), we shall delve into the jurisprudence of the ECJ so that the judicial reasoning of the Court as this reasoning proves the relevance of the proposed representation (2).

Furthermore, under a new EU Directive, signed into law on November 26, 2014, parent company liability is likely to be extended to private antitrust damages actions. In the United States (U.S.), in contrast, courts are very reluctant to hold parent companies liable for antitrust infringements by their subsidiaries, whether criminally or in private suits. Against this background, I explore in this article whether parent company liability in the antitrust context is justified from an efficiency perspective. I build on works dealing with the economic analysis of antitrust enforcement, corporate torts, vicarious liability, criminal penalties, and limited as well as unlimited shareholder liability to assess the efficiency of parent company liability for antitrust infringements by subsidiaries. Based on an analysis of both the legal framework and the economic situation, I explain under what circumstances it is justified to hold parent companies liable and how parent company liability relates to other antitrust enforcement instruments.

We study how resolution responds to changes in price and communication using a new, extensive data set of copyright infringement incidences by firms. The data cover two field experiments run by a large stock-photography agency. We find that substantially reducing the requested amount generates a small increase in the settlement rate. However, for the same reduced request, a message informing infringers of the price reduction and acknowledging the possible unintentionality generates a large increase in the settlement rate; including a deadline further increases response rate. The small price effect, compared to the large message effect, can be explained by two countervailing effects of a lower price: an inducement to settle early, but a lower threat of escalation. Furthermore, acknowledging possible unintentionality may encourage settlement due to the typically inadvertent nature of these incidences. The resulting higher settlement rate prevents additional legal action and significantly reduces social costs.","[Luo, Hong] Harvard Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA; [Mortimer, Julie Holland] Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA; [Mortimer, Julie Holland] NBER, Chestnut Hill, MA USA",Harvard University; Boston College; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Luo, H (通讯作者)，Harvard Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA.",hluo@hbs.edu; julie.mortimer.2@bc.edu,,,,,,,46,7,8,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

The certifier maximizes a weighted sum of its own revenue and social welfare. The higher the relative weight placed on revenue, the stronger the certifier's incentive to mislead consumers. Certification is analyzed as a costly signaling mechanism that, besides displaying labels, transmits information through market prices. Honest certification requires that prices credibly signal environmental quality to prevent cheating. I show that certification can only be honest when the certifier is driven more by social welfare than by profit. In the reverse case, the certifier cannot help jamming the price signal, thereby granting unreliable labels.","[Mahenc, Philippe] Univ Montpellier I LAMETA, Ave Raymond Dugrand,Site Richter,CS 79606, F-34960 Montpellier 2, France",,"Mahenc, P (通讯作者)，Univ Montpellier I LAMETA, Ave Raymond Dugrand,Site Richter,CS 79606, F-34960 Montpellier 2, France.",philippe.mahenc@univ-montp1.fr,,,French Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-15-CE05-0008]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-15-CE05-0008] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR),French Agence Nationale de la Recherche(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),This research received funding from the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche within the framework of the project GREENGO - New Tools for Environmental Governance: the role of NGOs - ANR-15-CE05-0008.

On the demand-side, service differentiation addresses the primary obstacle to adoption, which is the lack of perceived need for Internet service, and reflects the growing heterogeneity of consumer demand. On the supply-side, monopolistic competition has long underscored how product differentiation can create stable equilibria with multiple providers-notwithstanding the presence of unexhausted economies of scale-by allowing competitors to target subsegments of the overall market that place a higher value on particular services. Conversely, prohibiting service differentiation would restrict competition to price and network size, which are factors that favor the largest players. These dynamics are well illustrated by global enforcement patterns with respect to a practice known as zero rating, which permits subscribers to access certain content without having that traffic count against their data caps. Of the six countries that have brought enforcement actions against zero rating, only India has categorically banned the practice. The other five countries (the United States, Chile, Canada, Slovenia, and The Netherlands) have adopted a more nuanced approach. A case-by-case approach is consistent with the empirical literature on vertical integration and restraints and the well-established principles for determining when to impose per se illegality and when to apply the rule of reason. The U.S. Supreme Court's antitrust jurisprudence also helps identify factors that militate against liability, such as the lack of market power, nonexclusivity, and nonproprietary services.","[Yoo, Christopher S.] Univ Penn, Sch Law, 3501 Sansom St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Yoo, CS (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Sch Law, 3501 Sansom St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",csyoo@law.upenn.edu,,,Facebook,Facebook(Facebook Inc),"This article is adapted from comments that were submitted with the financial support of Facebook in a proceeding before the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of India on January 6, 2016.

A literature review confirmed that trust, compliance, fairness and good faith can be confidently regarded as universally desirable social conditions in all forms of individual or collective labour relationships between employers and employees. Aim: The purpose of this study was to determine if primary labour relationship quality (PLQ) can be confidently conceptualised as a social construct that strongly relates to the perceived levels of compliance, fairness and good faith in supervisory or primary labour relationships. Setting: A combination of random and convenience sampling approaches was implemented to collect PLQ related data from 454 voluntary respondents, who were subordinate employees in the Tshwane region. Methods: A quantitative research methodology was adopted. This included conceptual definition of the PLQ construct, objective measurement of PLQ levels of voluntary respondents in an adequately sized sample, factor analysis and testing for relationships and differences in means between variables. Results: Data analysis results confirmed that it can be confidently concluded that the conceptual definition of PLQ was valid, and that positive PLQ perceptions of subordinate employees were significantly related to at least two other forms of desirable organisational outcomes. Conclusion: PLQ perceptions can be confidently defined as a distinct subjective quality estimate that is assimilated from unique expectations and perceptions of the levels of compliance, fairness, good faith and trust that a supervisor displays in a labour relationship with an immediate subordinate.","[Ehlers, Lukas I.] Tshwane Univ Technol, Dept People Management & Dev, Pretoria, South Africa",Tshwane University of Technology,"Ehlers, LI (通讯作者)，Tshwane Univ Technol, Dept People Management & Dev, Pretoria, South Africa.",ehlers.lukas@gmail.com,,"van Wyk, Danielle/0000-0002-4867-6988; Dippenaar, Mareli/0000-0002-1589-0187",,,,,59,5,5,0,2,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

In the present paper, we argue that the co-worker networks across plants that are established by labour moves are important for both local learning opportunities and job matching quality and should hence facilitate regional growth. We therefore propose a new homophily-biased perspective on co-worker network creation and show that it suits geographical analyses better than random networks do. Moreover, panel vector autoregression models provide systematic evidence that an increase in co-worker network density is positively related to regional productivity growth. This is found to be important even when only ties across plants that are not directly linked by labour mobility are included.","[Lengyel, Balazs] Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Econ & Reg Studies, Budaorsi Ut 45, H-1112 Budapest, Hungary; [Lengyel, Balazs] Int Business Sch Budapest, Zahony Utca 7, H-1031 Budapest, Hungary; [Lengyel, Balazs; Eriksson, Rikard H.] Umea Univ, Dept Geog & Econ Hist, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden",Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Research Network; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies; Umea University,"Lengyel, B (通讯作者)，Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Econ & Reg Studies, Budaorsi Ut 45, H-1112 Budapest, Hungary.",lengyel.balazs@krtk.mta.hu,,"Eriksson, Rikard/0000-0003-3570-7690","Hungarian Scientific Research Fund [K112330]; research program 'Mobility, Transformation and Regional Growth' at Umea University; Riksbankens Jubileumsfond [P13-1004:1]","Hungarian Scientific Research Fund(Orszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok (OTKA)); research program 'Mobility, Transformation and Regional Growth' at Umea University; Riksbankens Jubileumsfond(Swedish Foundation for Humanities & Social Sciences)","This work was supported by the Hungarian Scientific Research Fund [K112330 to B.L.]; the research program 'Mobility, Transformation and Regional Growth' at Umea University (to B.L.) and Riksbankens Jubileumsfond [P13-1004:1 to R.H.E.]",,78,19,20,3,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

While unrelated variety fosters radical innovations and the creation of regional paths, related variety supports incremental novelties and regional branching. However, so far only little is known about the spatial distribution of unrelated and related variety and the relation between regional characteristics. Public R&D is one important actor of knowledge creation and diffusion and crucially affects regional R&D landscapes. This study analyzes the relationship between public R&D and unrelated and related variety in 258 German labor market regions. We use patent data to estimate unrelated and related variety for each region and describe both varieties' spatial distribution. Our empirical results show that the regional organization of technologically unrelated and related R&D activities differs highly across space. The findings of our spatial regression indicate that regions with universities and polytechnics tend to be characterized by related variety.","[Mewes, Lars; Broekel, Tom] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Wirtsch & Kulturgeog, Schneiderberg 50, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Broekel, Tom] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands",Leibniz University Hannover; Utrecht University,"Mewes, L (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Wirtsch & Kulturgeog, Schneiderberg 50, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",mewes@wigeo.uni-hannover.de; broekel@wigeo.uni-hannover.de,"Broekel, Tom/K-7048-2014; Mewes, Lars/AAA-5736-2019","Broekel, Tom/0000-0003-4516-4626; Mewes, Lars/0000-0001-9838-2673",,,,,47,1,1,1,24,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

The authors aimed to research this phenomenon specifically within the context of two different cultures as to date, this had not been done. This research explored the differing levels of extrinsic and intrinsic motivation in Germans and South Africans. Aim: The main objective of this study was to investigate similarities and differences concerning extrinsic and intrinsic motivation in the workplace between German and South African cultures by examining individuals with working experience and tertiary education specifically. In addition, the research investigated differences in the motivation of respondents with regard to demographics such as gender, age and income. Setting: The setting took place in South Africa and Germany. Methods: In the study, exploratory factor analysis was utilised to prove validity of Cinar, Bektas and Aslan's two-dimensional measure of extrinsic and intrinsic motivation. Moreover, analysis of variance and t-tests were used to show differences among demographic variables. Descriptive statistics such as means, central tendency and Cronbach's alpha were also utilised. Results: The results revealed preferences for intrinsic motivational factors for the whole sample with higher levels of intrinsic motivation for the South African respondents compared to German respondents. Demographic characteristics played a minor role in determining levels of intrinsic motivation within individuals. Culture, however, played the biggest role in determining one's levels of intrinsic or extrinsic motivation. Conclusion: These findings play an important role in explaining differences in motivation between the two countries Germany and South Africa. It highlights the important role that cultural differences play in shaping one's form of motivation.","[Snelgar, Robin; Shelton, Stacy A.; Giesser, Anne] Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Dept Ind & Org Psychol, Port Elizabeth, South Africa",Nelson Mandela University,"Shelton, SA (通讯作者)，Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Dept Ind & Org Psychol, Port Elizabeth, South Africa.",stacy.shelton@nmmu.ac.za,,,,,,,51,7,14,3,14,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Results show that the challenges in terms of usage rate and economic sustainability of bikesharing systems in small cities are considerable. The density of bikesharing networks, the existing modal share for each city, and possible target groups are elements that must be taken into account to improve the performance of bikesharing systems. The Swiss experience also suggests that the ability to develop partnerships as well as communication and accountability play a critical role.","[Audikana, Ander] Univ Deusto, Bilbao, Spain; [Ravalet, Emmanuel; Baranger, Virginie; Kaufmann, Vincent] Ecole Polytechn Federate Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Deusto,"Audikana, A (通讯作者)，Univ Deusto, Bilbao, Spain.",ander.audikana@deusto.es,,"Audikana, Ander/0000-0002-2588-1751",,,,,43,42,48,3,66,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

The article presents a ladder of online participation activities which distinguishes between three forms and several types of online participation based on their intensity. What follows is a statistical analysis of citizens' actual online participation. The analysis describes actual online participation by Czech citizens. This analysis describes various associations of sociodemographic characteristics and attitudes with the different types of participation. It also uses data on citizens' actual online participation in public life and relations to public administration that were collected in a sample survey in the towns of Blatnd, Ceskji Krumlov and Velke Illezifia. The survey demonstrated the fact that everyday participation activities with lower levels of intensity (such as mailing public authorities) are more likely to be attended by those more closely engaged in community life (running local businesses or raising their children in the community) and more interested in life around them. Less-frequent but more intensive everyday participation activities (e.g., signing an online petition) are more likely attended by young people with better IT skills. It is our hope that the results will be useful for the public administration's effort to communicate strategically and use the Internet to increase local citizens' engagement in community life. This in turn might enhance efforts to integrate those citizens who would normally be excluded from participation in public life because, for instance, they live in isolated settlements or with physical disabilities. Electronic communication also saves time and cost and represents an opportunity to get more young people to become engaged in community life and spark their interest in public affairs.","[Burda, Petr; Abrham, Josef] Univ Econ, Fac Int Relat, Dept Tourism, Prague Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic; [Horvathova, Zuzana] Metropolitan Univ Prague, Dept Law & Publ Adm, Dubecska 900-10, Prague 10031 10, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Metropolitan University Prague,"Burda, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Int Relat, Dept Tourism, Prague Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",petr_burda@email.cz; josef.abrham@vse.cz; zuzana.horvathova@mup.cz,"Abrhám, Josef/AAL-8271-2021","Abrhám, Josef/0000-0003-2484-8439; Horvathova, Zuzana/0000-0001-8838-2792",[IG206015],,"The paper was elaborated within the project IG206015; Evaluation of effectiveness of promotion of tourism and regional development; Faculty of International Relations University of Economics, reg. no.

This essay is going to demonstrate the steps of evaluating a U.S. public company's stock, Keysights Technology, Inc. To generate a convincing stock research, analysists need to apply scientific methods. The idea is to set a target price of a company's stock price and argue whether and why the price could reach the target price or not. Then, analysists need to glean supporting evidences to have a conclusion. For example, the Keysights Technology, Inc's stock price was $37.56, and my goal price is $41.5; hence, my argumentation will be centered in presenting the company's financial facts and applying financial models, which all supports that the company's stock price could be likely to reach the target. Hence, price setting needs to be rational.

The empirical results show that religious belief instilled since childhood, religious believers, and people's attitude towards religion have significant impact on participation frequency of religious activities. The results also show that personal income and household economic situation have significant impacts on religious contributions. Sample grouping estimates indicate that Taiwanese men with unemployment experiences have higher participation rate in religious activities than men without such experience. As age increases, Taiwanese women's participation rate in religious activities becomes higher but the age impact on participation rate in Mainland is not significant. In addition, the empirical data collected in Taiwan show that there is a trade-off relationship between people's income and their participation in religious activities as well as their contributions made. That is, the higher the personal income of an individual, the lower his/her participation in religious activities, but this correlation is not significant in the Chinese society.","[Chou, Li-Chen] Wenzhou Business Coll, Dept Econ, Chaoyang St, Wenzhou 325035, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Lin, Shiue-Hung] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Nan Fang Coll, Business Sch, 882 Wenquan Ave, Guangzhou 510970, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Chen, Kun-Dang] Wenzhou Univ, Coll Teacher Educ, Chaoyang St, Wenzhou 325035, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Wan-Hao] Wenzhou Business Coll, Dept Finance, Chaoyang St, Wenzhou 325035, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University; Wenzhou University,"Chen, KD (通讯作者)，Wenzhou Univ, Coll Teacher Educ, Chaoyang St, Wenzhou 325035, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",zlc@wzbc.edu.cn; 98258507@nccu.edu.tw; ckdwzbc@gmail.com; wanhaozhang@foxmail.com,"Zhang, Wan-Hao/O-8990-2018","Chou, Li-Chen/0000-0002-5228-9518; Zhang, Wan-Hao/0000-0003-1785-7281",,,,,33,0,0,1,12,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Besides, most of the scientists focus on the transmission of shocks to the real economy in the USA, China, and other largest world economies. For this reason this empirical study focuses on macroeconomic shocks transmission through real channel in the CEECs countries. The empirical results show a strong effect of real GDP shock in main export partners on the real GDP in the CEECs countries and this effect is almost the same strong as the GDP shock in the domestic countries. The empirical results suggest that real exports flows of the CEECs react to the external shocks in the main export countries stronger compared to GDP. The empirical results confirm that the CEECs are very sensitive to shocks in main export partners; however, the effect is not very long lasting suggesting that CEECs adjust to the external macroeconomic changes.","[Deltuvaite, Vilma] Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio Str 20, Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Deltuvaitè, V (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio Str 20, Kaunas, Lithuania.",vilma.deltuvaite@ktu.lt,,,Research Council of Lithuania [MIP-016/2015],Research Council of Lithuania(Research Council of Lithuania (LMTLT)),This research was funded by a grant (No. MIP-016/2015) from the Research Council of Lithuania.,,32,1,1,0,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-48454-9; 978-3-319-48453-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,653,669,,10.1007/978-3-319-48454-9_44,0.0,,,17,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1MX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447881400044,0

The results reveal that there is a significant change in Thailand's economic structure between1961 - 2014. The proportion of agricultural output to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) dramatically declines as a result of slower increase of agricultural output compared to other sectors; meanwhile, the share of Thai GDP derived from industrial sector definitely increases as a result of the continual Thailand's national economic and social development plans since 1961, the promotion of international trade, and the export-oriented Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Additionally, it is found that export, as economic motivator, accounts around 70 percent of Thai GDP which one of the stylized tools to boost trade is an agressive trade deal promising vast amount of traded volume.

The study was conducted in the years 2007-2013. The research shows that businesses established in the food industry are actively involved in the use of knowledge management instruments including: elements, tools and all kinds of sources of cooperation. The company's production processes use various sources of knowledge. It should be noted that outstanding cooperation takes place between customers and suppliers, as well as in external training. A weak interest of the surveyed enterprises in using the knowledge of the acquired business, and very insignificant cooperation with universities or research centres was discovered. Companies frequently acquire knowledge in trade relations, but also from specialist companies with an appropriate base which was also recognized as the most useful sources. The lack of cooperation with universities and research centres can attest to the impossibility of its use in practical applications in enterprises, or a lack of understanding of the benefits of this kind of cooperation. It is stated that, in the years 2007-2012, less than 2/3 of the surveyed enterprises of the food industry carried out activities related to the implementation of elements of knowledge management in the enterprise; internal training proved to be the most supportive in implementing acquisition and transfer of knowledge; more than half of the surveyed enterprises of the food industry spend funds on knowledge management, increasing them annually; surveyed companies noted the annual increase in the average level of financial resources incurred for the management of knowledge in the years 2007-2011 (except 2010).","[Firlej, Krzysztof] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Strategy Management & Org Dev, Krakow, Poland; [Zmija, Dariusz] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Econ Policy & Dev Programming, Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics; Cracow University of Economics,"Firlej, K (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Strategy Management & Org Dev, Krakow, Poland.",krzysztof.firlej@uek.krakow.pl; zmijad@uek.krakow.pl,"Krzysztof, Firlej/ABH-8570-2020","Krzysztof, Firlej/0000-0001-7870-046X",National Centre for Science in Poland [2011/01/B/HS4/06302],National Centre for Science in Poland,"The project was financed from the funds of the National Centre for Science in Poland, Grant no. 2011/01/B/HS4/06302",,12,13,13,0,14,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The argument has important implications for explaining how the housing market works and describing the distinctiveness of each housing submarkets, having determined, a priori, its segmentation. The most commonly used method for identifying housing submarkets is based on cluster analysis, although hedonic analysis has been extensively used. The hedonic analysis is used to derive dimensionality of the housing market by estimating what attributes are significant factors influencing housing price. Those attributes or variables can then be used for cluster analysis. The paper proposes an analysis of the real estate market in San Cristoforo, Catania, trying to integrate two different clustering analysis approaches to defining its possible submarkets articulation. The first one is a hard clustering approach using the K-means method and hypothesizing different numbers of clusters. The second one can be considered a verification of the previous results: a fuzzy algorithm is applied to obtain the fuzzy set membership degree of each data point to housing submarkets defined within the examined urban area. The comparison between the results coming from the two different approaches suggests some reflections about the use of these powerful techniques for integrating the knowledge of the complex and multi-layered real estate markets in the urban recovery policies.","[Gabrielli, Laura] Univ Ferrara, Dept Architecture, Ferrara, Italy; [Giuffrida, Salvatore; Trovato, Maria Rosa] Univ Catania, Dept Civil Engn & Architecture, Catania, Italy",University of Ferrara; University of Catania,"Gabrielli, L (通讯作者)，Univ Ferrara, Dept Architecture, Ferrara, Italy.",laura.gabrielli@unife.it; sgiuffrida@dica.unict.it; mrtrovato@dica.unict.it,"Trovato, Maria Rosa/Q-6172-2016; Gabrielli, Laura/JNE-8710-2023; Giuffrida, Salvatore/A-8579-2015","Trovato, Maria Rosa/0000-0002-6220-7483; Gabrielli, Laura/0000-0001-7233-6935; Giuffrida, Salvatore/0000-0001-6652-6441",,,,,12,39,39,0,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1865-3529,,978-3-319-49676-4; 978-3-319-49675-7,GREEN ENERGY TECHNOL,,,2017,,,,,,,203,219,,10.1007/978-3-319-49676-4_15,0.0,,,17,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI6HB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413289600015,0

Firms will need a mix of regional and global leaders. If leaders want to succeed in today's volatile global economy, they must be prepared to do business all around the world. The global leaders should not seek to sever or hide their own roots to become global citizens. Global leaders need to understand the factors that shape international interactions in their businesses, by undertaking a structured examination of cross-country differences and their effects. That is what a survey of academic thought leaders recently concluded should be the focus of the globalization of curricula in the universities.

Based on an analysis of survey data, it examines the relationship between network ties and innovation. These are considered as the strategic network ties associated with open innovation and the embedded ties associated with entrepreneurial networks. It is found that both strategic and embedded ties are significantly associated with rates of innovation for entrepreneurial firms, although for the former this relationship is driven by a minority of larger or highly innovative firms. Strategic ties are most strongly linked to product and organisational innovations, whilst process innovations are more related to embedded network ties. There is some evidence of complementarity between the two forms of network tie. It is concluded that in the entrepreneurial context, the open innovation concept should be broadened to encompass the role performed by embedded network ties.","[Huggins, Robert] Cardiff Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Thompson, Piers] Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Business, Nottingham, England",Cardiff University; Nottingham Trent University,"Huggins, R (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.",hugginsr@cardiff.ac.uk,"Thompson, Piers/R-5828-2019","Thompson, Piers/0000-0003-1961-7441",,,,,170,32,34,6,98,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

The use of a factor analysis allowed us to identify two unobservable factors. Those factors account for most of the variance of the nine observed variables characteristic of the economic and financial development, the banking sector's financial position and the structure of the financial sector. We manage to identify factors representing variables correlated with financial system development and growth of the banking sector, but factors' roles differ among the analyzed groups of countries. The development of the banking sector is significantly associated with the economic development in both groups. Yet, in advanced economies some importance might be also attached to the stock market, which is not the case for post-communist countries. The results show that there is higher homogeneity in the financial system development patterns in post-communist countries, while the roles of both factors are more heterogeneous among advanced economies.

Against the backdrop of armed conflict, reform processes triggered by the country's EU candidacy and socio-economic change, Diyarbakir has become a contested zone over which the Turkish government and the Kurdish movement have been competing for control. Local business associations have also been implicated in such contestation. Considering the situation of dual power and moral economy at the local level, the paper examines how these associations deal with an adverse situation that is characterized by political instability and uncertainty. The analysis shows that business leaders have been able to make the 'best' of the situation.","[Kilic, Azer] Max Planck Inst Study Societies, Cologne, Germany; [Kilic, Azer] Koc Univ, Dept Sociol, TR-34450 Istanbul, Turkey",Max Planck Society; Koc University,"Kiliç, A (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Study Societies, Cologne, Germany.;Kiliç, A (通讯作者)，Koc Univ, Dept Sociol, TR-34450 Istanbul, Turkey.",azerkilic@gmail.com,"Kılıç, Azer/AAD-3844-2021","Kilic, Azer/0000-0002-8786-9563",AXA Research Fund,AXA Research Fund(AXA Research Fund),This work was supported by the AXA Research Fund through postdoctoral fellowships (2014-2015).,,58,2,2,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

In that context it is necessary to put a stronger emphasis on the research of links (conditionality and/or exclusiveness) of the knowledge economy and the knowledge-based economy. The paper raises a hypothesis that the crisis of knowledge in the context of modern economic thought is a result of ideological stereotypes, individual views and domination of corporatism. The author concludes that the knowledge may represent a tool of manipulation and that it is abused for the purpose of modelling, when it is least systematically rational. Scientifically based knowledge economy should offer an objective approach to economic analyses: projections and suggestions.","[Lakic, Slobodan] Univ Montenegro, Fac Econ, Jovna Tomasevica 37, Podgorica, Montenegro",University of Montenegro,"Lakic, S (通讯作者)，Univ Montenegro, Fac Econ, Jovna Tomasevica 37, Podgorica, Montenegro.",sasalakic@gmail.com,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,0,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

J,"Lastuvková, J",,,,"Lastuvkova, Jana",,,DIMENSIONS OF LIQUIDITY AND THEIR FACTORS IN THE SLOVENIAN BANKING SECTOR,E & M EKONOMIE A MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Slovenian banking sector; dimension of liquidity; liquidity determinants; internal factors,RISK,"The present article focuses on the internal factors which have potential influence on the liquidity of the Slovenian banking sector. Unlike other studies, this paper uses multiple dependent variables, encompassing different views on liquidity and leading to higher complexity. These include the creation of liquidity, its outflow, net change and total reallocation, determined on the basis of a specific method of liquidity measurement - the gross liquidity flows. The chosen independent variables include various items of internal character such as loans, deposits, profit, capital and the size of the bank. Robust regression analyses are performed. The results indicate that internal factors have the greatest influence on the creation of liquidity, where almost all the variables considered were significant. Used factors do not only affect liquidity creation, often investigated by authors, but affect other dimensions of liquidity as well. A significant item which played a role in multiple dimensions of liquidity was the value of loans and the size of the bank (total assets). The models have shown that any given factor only has an influence on the creation of liquidity without influencing its outflow and vice versa. Thus, when looking for determinants only for the creation or only for the outflow of liquidity, the results need not necessarily comprehensively show the influence of the given factors, and can lead to erroneous conclusions. It is therefore suitable to include multiple views on the value of liquidity, since the influence of a factor can be more dominant in a different dimension of liquidity and affect the final value.","[Lastuvkova, Jana] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Finance, Brno, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Lastuvková, J (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Finance, Brno, Czech Republic.",Jana.lastuvkova@mendelu.cz,,,internal grant PEF (IGA PEF) Mendel University in Brno [PEF_DP_2015_013],internal grant PEF (IGA PEF) Mendel University in Brno,"This paper was created as a part of the project supported by an internal grant PEF (IGA PEF) Mendel University in Brno, PEF_DP_2015_013 entitled: Liquidity relationship with macroeconomic variables, variables on the level of banking sector and individual banks.",,29,0,0,0,16,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

It uses a detailed survey on the finances of almost 40,000 UK Small-and Medium-Sized Enterprises for 2011-2013 to investigate both the extent and type of applications for bank finance by innovative firms in peripheral regions, whether funders accept their applications and whether acceptance rates reflect objective criteria, such as credit scores, or their location. The article finds evidence of higher demand for bank finance for innovative firms in peripheral areas, but that these firms are more likely to be discouraged from applying. However, there is strong evidence that innovative firms in peripheral regions are more likely to have their applications for finance rejected, even when controlling for factors such as credit score. The findings suggest that geography matters in the financing of innovative firms and firms in peripheral areas may suffer a ` liability of distance' which potentially reinforces regional disparities. The implications of these findings for public policy are outlined.","[Lee, Neil] Univ St Andrews, Ctr Responsible Banking & Finance, Sch Management, St Andrews KY16 9RJ, Fife, Scotland; [Lee, Neil; Brown, Ross] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of St Andrews; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Lee, N (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",n.d.lee@lse.ac.uk,,"Brown, Ross/0000-0002-6164-7639",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,90,55,57,2,44,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

It allowed us to decompose the Russian regions' tax systems risks, to evaluate the contribution of various activities to it and to determine the critical zones of instability. We evaluated the level of diversification of regional economies using a range of indices. Finally, we established positive correlation between the regions tax systems risk and return as well as positive impact of economy diversification on stability of the tax systems of Russian regions.

In this paper the Panzar-Rosse approach is used to assess competition of banking sectors in CEE. By using General Method of Moments on the panel data for 300 banks for the period 1999-2009, empirical evidence indicates that banks operating in the CEE exert monopoly behaviour. From the methodological point of view, the findings suggest that using a price equation or controlling for total assets in a Panzar-Rosse approach produces upwards biased and invalid estimates of the H-statistic. Therefore, further support is provided for maintaining a reducedform revenue equation when estimating a Panzar-Rosse model. The findings also suggest that banks operating in the non-EU countries of the CEE region have exerted stronger market power compared to the banks operating in the EU countries of this region. Policy-makers should improve competitive conditions and general ` enabling' environment for the banking sectors, especially the non-EU countries of the CEE region, while balancing competition-stability trade-off.","[Mustafa, Arben] Univ Kadri Zeka Gjilan, Fac Econ, Gjilan 60000, Kosovo; [Mustafa, Arben] CERGE EI Teaching Career Integrat, Gjilan, Kosovo; [Toci, Valentin] Univ Prishtina Hasan Prishtina, Fac Econ, Prishtina 10000, Kosovo",,"Mustafa, A (通讯作者)，Univ Kadri Zeka Gjilan, Fac Econ, Gjilan 60000, Kosovo.;Mustafa, A (通讯作者)，CERGE EI Teaching Career Integrat, Gjilan, Kosovo.",arben.mustafa@uni-gjilan.net; valentintoci@gmail.com,,,,,,,44,3,3,0,4,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

The data also reveal the relationship among these experiential factors in retail atmosphere. This article brings out the understanding needed in experiential marketing, which aims at fulfilling expectations of customers for rich experiences which are devoid of negative cues, yet full of positive cues.

The OLS regression approach suggests that the land use tax revenues is positively related to housing prices, while the personal income tax revenues negatively related. The event study approach finds that all five key changes made to the personal income tax, corporate income tax and non-farm land use tax have caused the housing prices to decline on average 6-11% during the event window, but only the impact of the personal income tax changes is statistically significant. Our findings offer some implications for the government. This, together with the finding from the test of determinants of housing prices, suggests that the personal income tax policy could be one of the key influential factors that determine housing prices.

J,"Pinchasik, DR; Hovi, IB",,,,"Pinchasik, Daniel Ruben; Hovi, Inger Beate",,,A CO2-fund for the transport industry: The case of Norway,TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ENERGY; HYDROGEN,"Emissions from heavy trucks constitute a large and increasing share of Norwegian CO2-emissions. The Norwegian Green Tax Commission recently presented recommendations for emission reductions, largely confined to 'sticks', in the form of taxes and levies. Another way to reduce emissions and to force the phase-in of alternative propulsion systems on heavy trucks, is the use of more positive measures for the industry. In Norway, establishment of a CO2-fund for the industry, modeled after the existing Norwegian NOx-fund, has been proposed. Rather than paying a levy on every litre fuel consumed, participants to the fund will pay a (lower) participation fee in exchange for committing to emission reducing measures. The fund's proceeds will then be used on (partial) subsidies towards the additional investment costs for renewable-based rolling stock and infrastructure. The analysis in this study shows that it is most cost-effective to direct the fund's subsidies towards biodiesel alternatives, but that the availability of sustainable fuel might become a challenge. A fund should therefore also consider subsidizing more expensive renewable technologies based on biogas, electricity, or hydrogen.

The analysis of this issue, the reasons why the young scientists leave the country, and the adoption of economic policy measures that will deal with the roots of the problem are the biggest challenges. The purpose of this article is to describe this phenomenon and to highlight the most important factors that affect it. Firstly, some quantitative data are presented about the size of the phenomenon, secondly it is presented a bibliography review relevant to the topic, and finally it presents the empirical results of a survey on a sample of 379 people who have already emigrated and work abroad so as to become aware of the important factors that influenced their decision to emigrate abroad. With this in mind, the data analysis was examined by using the Microsoft Office Excel and the SPSS statistical package. After that, it was held a Descriptive Statistical Analysis, a Factor Analysis, a Variance Analysis, and a Reliability Analysis of the data of the research. The factor analysis uses mathematical procedures to simplify interrelated measures so as to be discovered patterns in a set of variables. Large data sets that consist of several variables can reduce their number by observing variable groups (factors). The Principal Component Analysis was used in order to export the factors of the factor analysis with Orthogonal rotation axes with the Varimax method, which is considered as one of the most reliable and popular methods. The suitability of the factor analysis was examined with the Bartlett's Sphericity statistical test and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin statistic test. The factor analysis drew on sixteen (16) factors. Afterwards, an analysis of variance was carried out so as to be determined the accuracy of the research model and to be examined the research hypotheses credibility of the research. For the reliability of the results beyond the level of importance it was checked and the reliability indicator of Cronbach's Alpha for each research hypothesis. Finally, the reliability of the variables was proved by repeating the statistical measure Cronbach's Alpha, for all the variables of the research.","[Spanou, Dimitra; Karasavvoglou, Anastasios G.; Tsourgiannis, Lambros] Eastern Macedonia & Thrace Inst Technol, Dept Accounting & Finance, Kavala, Greece; [Tsoukalidis, Yiannis] Support Struct Org Social Econ & Entrepreneurship, Kavala, Greece; [Kostas, Antonios] Sci Soc Social Cohes & Dev, Kavala, Greece",,"Karasavvoglou, AG (通讯作者)，Eastern Macedonia & Thrace Inst Technol, Dept Accounting & Finance, Kavala, Greece.",akarasa@teiemt.gr,,"KOSTAS, ANTONIOS/0000-0002-3386-6877",,,,,24,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-48454-9; 978-3-319-48453-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,809,822,,10.1007/978-3-319-48454-9_53,0.0,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1MX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447881400053,0

The research applied the survey method where three layers of human resources were examined, i.e. employees, members of the organizations and volunteers. After a hierarchy of the indicated problems had been identified, it was demonstrated that the greatest problems included: the low activity of members of the organizations and a shortage of time for matters related to the activities of the organizations (62% of respondents complained about it). The annoying factors also included the poor involvement of volunteers (46 %), members (39 %) and employees (31 %). The results indicate that regional NGOs have to cope with different problems related to human resource management; therefore, this problem should be explored on an in-depth basis and guidance should be developed for these organizations.

Insurance policies reflect this possibility through so-called subrogation provisions that give insurers the right to step into the shoes of insureds and to bring suits against injurers. In a basic case, the optimal subrogation provisions involve full retention by the insurer of the proceeds from a successful suit and the pursuit of all positive expected value suits. This eliminates litigation risks for insureds and results in lower premiums-financed by the litigation income of insurers, including from suits that insureds would not otherwise have brought. Moreover, optimal subrogation provisions are characterized in the presence of moral hazard, administrative costs, and non-monetary losses, and it is demonstrated that optimal provisions entail sharing litigation proceeds with insureds in the first two cases but not when losses are non-monetary.","[Polinsky, A.

It aims to identify enhancements for further development of workforce forecasting models and compares the capacity and reliability of different forecasting methods. Past and present modeling trends are described and critiqued based on their relevance to current requirements. Several approaches are reviewed, such as time series modeling and system dynamics simulation. Sensitivity analysis in models is assessed. The models are decomposed into three modes: supply-based, demand-based, and need-based, which in some cases provide substantially different estimates of future workforce need. The chronological progression of models' development is analyzed. The articles are also classified based on the countries and the sectors that have paid great attention to workforce prediction research.

However, the capacity of SSABs to cement foreign alliances to capitalise on business opportunities that the expansion of global markets presents, while simultaneously mitigating against the negative forces of globalisation remains a grey area. Aim: The study sought to contribute to internationalisation literature by examining: (1) the extent to which SSABs' owner and/or managers in selected South African provinces establish foreign alliances, (2) whether there are any statistically significant differences in SSABs' performance based on their extent of establishment of foreign alliances. Setting: The setting for this study was Vryburg-Pokwani in the North West and Northern Cape provinces of South Africa, respectively. Method: A survey was conducted on 151 SSAB owner and/or managers in the aforementioned study area. Results: The results revealed that although a majority (51.7%) had some (i.e. few) foreign alliances, 48.3% of SSABs had no foreign alliances at all. The results also demonstrated that the establishment of foreign alliances was positively and statistically significantly related to the performance of SSABs in the Vryburg-Pokwani area. Post-hoc comparisons (Bonferroni) results showed that while SSABs with 1-2 foreign alliances perform better than those with no foreign alliances at all, those SSABs with 6-10 foreign alliances perform better than those with none, 1-2 and 3-5 foreign linkages respectively. Conclusion: Since SSABs with foreign alliances tended to outperform those that were dependent on domestic links, the extent to which the economic benefits derived from internationalisation are reinvested into the businesses for the continued sustenance of businesses needs more rigorous investigation.","[Rambe, Patient; Agbotame, Livingstone A.

We also utilize the Central Register of Establishments and Enterprises (CRE) for structural developments in the bus industry. We first present some overall tendencies, including developments in number of bids per tender, contract size and cost developments. We use the cost implied by the winning bid as our cost indicator. The average cost per kilometre in the winning bid has increased substantially more than the general rate of inflation. At the same time, the average number of bidders per contract has fallen. Second, we build regression models to identify key drivers of cost developments in the bids. Contract sizes, in terms of vehicle-kilometres are found on average to be on the low side and an increase would reduce unit prices. We find as expected a significant effect of the number of bidders on unit prices. This leads us to a further investigation of factors explaining the number of bids per tender.

Sustainability performance is then explored for cities with only Public operations or others with some degree of commercial operation (Non-Public). Results show no significant difference in aggregate total sustainability indicator scores between world cities with Public/Non-Public operations. However Social Sustainability indicators are significantly different with Public operations having better Social Sustainability performance than Non-Public. For individual component indicators, three of the four Social Sustainability component indicators have average normalised scores suggesting statistically significant differences between Public and Non-Public city scores with Public cities performing better than Non-Public. The indicators and their relative positive sustainability scores for Public cities compared to 'Non-Public' cities are; Trip distance (24%), Affordability (34%) and PT related deaths (29%). However results also show that operating costs per passenger km are lower and cost recovery are higher in Non-Public cities suggesting higher elements of Economic Sustainability in Non-Public based Public Transport cities. The paper concludes with a summary and discussion of the results including implications for regulatory practices and areas for future research.","[Currie, Graham; Truong, Long; De Gruyter, Chris] Monash Univ, Inst Transport Studies, Publ Transport Res Grp, 23 Coll Walk,Clayton Campus, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Monash University,"Currie, G (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Inst Transport Studies, Publ Transport Res Grp, 23 Coll Walk,Clayton Campus, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",graham.currie@monash.edu; long.truong@monash.edu; chris.degruyter@monash.edu,"Currie, Graham/ABC-6611-2020; Currie, Graham/P-5431-2019; Truong, Long/O-6792-2014","Currie, Graham/0000-0001-7190-7548; De Gruyter, Chris/0000-0001-5069-3018; Truong, Long/0000-0003-0643-8970",,,,,23,18,18,1,21,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

Most of the studies on the quantity surcharge phenomenon date back over three decades and none have explored the phenomenon in online shopping settings. In this study, utilizing data from an online shopping environment, the incidence of quantity surcharges is examined across various product categories. The drivers of both quantity surcharges and quantity discounts are examined. The findings indicate that quantity surcharges and quantity discounts are affected by the format of prices presented to consumers, the number of quantity options available, online product ratings, and the product category.

Recent personal experience is the best predictor of debt tolerance. Unemployment and difficulty paying bills increase tolerance of debt to meet living expenses by 20%-30%. A woman who has one of these negative experiences is substantially less likely than a man to approve of debt used to buy luxuries. While neither recent macroeconomic events nor macroeconomic conditions in young adulthood affect debt tolerance, there is some evidence of a gendered response to the Great Recession. As women observed the negative effects of the mortgage crisis and the Great Recession on other women, it reinforced their belief that it is okay for people like them to use credit to bridge gaps in income.","[George, Erin E.] Hood Coll, Econ, Frederick, MD 21701 USA; [Hansen, Mary Eschelbach] Amer Univ, Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Routzahn, Julie Lyn] McDaniel Coll, Econ & Business Adm, Westminster, MD USA",American University,"George, EE (通讯作者)，Hood Coll, Econ, Frederick, MD 21701 USA.",george@hood.edu; mhansen@american.edu; jroutzahn@mcdaniel.edu,,"Hansen, Mary/0000-0002-3621-1809",,,,,60,6,7,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

In Zimbabwe, competitive tendering was identified in 2012 as a tool to address the urban transport challenges emanating from a deregulated urban public transport market. To date, the tendering option has not been implemented. This paper examines the institutional preparedness to bus tendering in Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe. A mixed-methods research paradigm was used to obtain data and information from three relevant transport stakeholder clusters comprising public, private and academia sectors. The findings of the study have shown that the key stakeholders have a clear understanding of what competitive tendering entails, but implementation is hindered by inter alia lack of infrastructure and support systems, lack of commitment to policy implementation and a reluctance to interfere with the status quo that generates revenue for the economy through both legal and illegal means. The study is of value to other developing countries, particularly Africa, which may draw lessons from the Zimbabwe experiences. The study recommended the need for a detailed diagnostic study to analyse the deep-rooted political and economic factors or pressures that impede a movement from the status quo.","[Mbara, Tatenda] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Transport & Supply Chain Management, POB 524, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Dumba, Smart] Univ Zimbabwe, Dept Rural & Urban Planning, POB MP167, Harare, Zimbabwe",University of Johannesburg; University of Zimbabwe,"Mbara, T (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Dept Transport & Supply Chain Management, POB 524, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa.",tmbara@uj.ac.za; smart.dumba@gmail.com,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

Although good practices in public transportation do exist, many cities in Brazil and around the world are not able to maintain these improvements due to strong direct and indirect pressures from key stakeholders. The lack of trust among stakeholders has been stronger than the trust between them. Understanding the relationships between stakeholders and evaluating the critical paths are key to facilitating the implementation of improvements. This paper develops a qualitative and quantitative model that represents the stakeholders' network involved in planning, operating and monitoring public bus transportation, and identifies key stakeholders and critical paths for decision-making. To demonstrate the application of the model, we performed a case study in Porto Alegre. We identified 13 key stakeholders directly and indirectly involved in the process. Through the Stakeholder Value Network methodology, it was possible to qualify and quantify 59 value flows between stakeholders that can influence the implementation of improvements in the public transportation system. The results provide useful information to facilitate improvements and in the services provided to the population.","[Pereira, Brenda Medeiros] Univ Fed Santa Maria, Lab Mobilidade & Logist, Campus Cachoeira do Sul,Rua Ernesto Barros, BR-96506322 Cachoeira Do Sul, Brazil; [dos Santos Senna, Luiz Afonso] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, PPGEP, Lab Sistemas Transportes, Ave Osvaldo Aranha 99,5 Andar, BR-90035190 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Lindau, Luis Antonio] WRI Brasil Cidades Sustentaveis, Ave Independencia 1299,Sala 401, BR-90035077 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM); Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,"Pereira, BM (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Santa Maria, Lab Mobilidade & Logist, Campus Cachoeira do Sul,Rua Ernesto Barros, BR-96506322 Cachoeira Do Sul, Brazil.",brenda.pereira@ufsm.br; lsenna@producao.ufrgs.br; toni.lindau@wri.org,,,Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul; World Resources Institute,Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul; World Resources Institute,"The authors acknowledge the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul and the World Resources Institute for institutional and financial support.

If managers care about keeping their position or avoiding interference, and they can make strategic choices that affect both expected firm profits and their riskiness, even if competition at first pushes the manager towards profit maximization, further increases in competition might lead him to take excessive risks. To curb this possibility, the principal owner optimally reduces the degree of autonomy granted to the manager. Hence, higher levels of managerial autonomy are more likely for intermediate levels of competition.","[Ruzzier, Christian A.] Univ San Andres, Dept Econ, Victoria, Argentina",Universidad de San Andres Argentina,"Ruzzier, CA (通讯作者)，Univ San Andres, Dept Econ, Victoria, Argentina.",cruzzier@udesa.edu.ar,,,,,,,105,0,0,0,3,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,CHICHESTER,"THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0143-6570,1099-1468,,MANAG DECIS ECON,Manag.

Our results show a large gender difference: women tend to retire earlier than men. Between employees and entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs retire later. People in larger regions tend to retire later. Higher house prices, and the share of small firms in a region correlate with a lower likelihood of retirement. The local tax rate and the share of blue-collar workers in a region is significantly related to lower retirement age. A high average wage, commuting intensity, and high human capital in a region is associated with later retirement.","[Klaesson, Johan; Oner, Ozge] Jonkoping Univ, Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Ctr Entrepreneurship & Spatial Econ CEnSE, Jonkoping, Sweden; [Klaesson, Johan; Oner, Ozge] Res Inst Ind Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Lopez, Esteban] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Sch Business, Ctr Econ & Reg Policy, Santiago, Chile",Jonkoping University; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); Universidad Adolfo Ibanez,"Klaesson, J (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Univ, Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Ctr Entrepreneurship & Spatial Econ CEnSE, Jonkoping, Sweden.;Klaesson, J (通讯作者)，Res Inst Ind Econ, Stockholm, Sweden.",johan.klaesson@ju.se; esteban.lopez@uai.cl; ozge.oner@ju.se,"Lopez, Esteban/AAE-4711-2021; Lopez Ochoa, Esteban/GRN-7804-2022; Lopez Ochoa, Esteban/H-8766-2018","Klaesson, Johan/0000-0001-8752-0428; Lopez Ochoa, Esteban/0000-0003-1028-3852; Oner, Ozge/0000-0001-9590-8019",,,,,53,0,2,1,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Thus, the emergence of such new technology has become a major topic for organisations to study factors that have influenced the people's adoption and acceptance of new technology as well as mutual influence. Setting: The Technology Acceptance Model is one of the most studied models of behavioural intention to use new information technology. Aim: However, in terms of the causal relationship of variables in the model, one variable is considered independent, ignoring the possibility of mutual influence, and many samples are required for statistical empirical research. This study aims to resolve these above two deficiencies. Methods: This study adopts the Decision-Making and Trial Evaluation Laboratory method, and applies the latest Technology Acceptance Model (TAM3) to examine. Results: The results found several extra causal relationships which are not present in the TAM3 model, and understood that Experience and Computer Playfulness are the driving factors of third-party e-commerce payment, and Computer Anxiety is the core factor. Conclusion: The feasibility of this approach was demonstrated through an empirical study, and these results could be used to guide management direction and marketing strategy.","[Chen, Jih K.] Xiamen Univ, Tan Kah Kee Coll, Sch Management, Xiamen, Peoples R China",Xiamen University,"Chen, JK (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Tan Kah Kee Coll, Sch Management, Xiamen, Peoples R China.",pony1146@163.com,,"Chen, Jih Kuang/0000-0003-2357-5109",,,,,28,7,7,1,44,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Such regulation has the potential to adversely affect the labor market integration of foreign-born citizens and can be an obstacle to the free movement of labor toward its most productive uses. Before the backdrop of increased levels of migration into Germany, and the discussion about harmonizing labor standards in Europe, this paper empirically examines the effects of the deregulation of occupational licensing in the German crafts sector on the proportion of migrants working in this sector. The results suggest that the deregulation has increased the proportion of migrants among self-employed as well as employed craftsmen in the fully deregulated trades.","[Runst, Petrik] Univ Gottingen, Inst Small Business Res, Econ Dept, Heinrich Duker Weg 6, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Runst, P (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Inst Small Business Res, Econ Dept, Heinrich Duker Weg 6, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",petrik.runst@wiwi.uni-goettingen.de,,,,,,,52,6,6,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

This research adapts and extends the information search model (Schmidt and Spreng 1996) by providing new insight on information search as not only a prepurchase but also a consumption stage activity. Findings suggest that expiration date search effort is influenced by perceived risk, time pressure while grocery shopping, and the motivation of checking expiration dates.

Systematic racial discrimination in housing was unconstitutionally developed and implemented by state and federal agencies. Laws, regulations, and private practices in the real estate industry were used to promote legally enforced residential segregation in the United States. Zoning, redlining, and blockbusting created the division of our urban landscape along the color line: black and white. Residential segregation has had debilitating impacts on African Americans in cities in terms of lost opportunities for economic prosperity and the denial of homeownership and the wealth-building potential that comes from it. Oakland, California is at the center of this research, where urban renewal and an interstate highway destroyed whole neighborhoods in West Oakland. The Acorn Housing Project was built in the aftermath of the urban renewal program. Title VIII of the Fair Housing Act remains the most promising basis for developing strategies for African Americans to fully engage in American's legacy of wealth building through homeownershipthe American Dream. Historically, that dream was designed only for white America.

Using data on juvenile deportation proceedings, we examine how tougher immigration enforcement might have influenced judicial rulings on these cases and, ultimately, these youths' ability to stay in the country. We find that the average increase in immigration enforcement over that period is associated with a 15% reduction in the share of juvenile cases ending with permission to stay. The result underscores the importance of the immigration policy context in which courts operate on their rulings, even if immigration law is within the jurisdiction of the Federal government. Given the gravity of the circumstances these children are escaping, further attention to how the piecemeal approach to immigration enforcement might impact the protection of their humanitarian rights is warranted.","[Amuedo-Dorantes, Catalina] San Diego State Univ, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Puttitanun, Thitima] Kasetsart Univ, Bangkok, Thailand",California State University System; San Diego State University; Kasetsart University,"Amuedo-Dorantes, C (通讯作者)，San Diego State Univ, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",camuedod@mail.sdsu.edu; fecotmp@ku.ac.th,"Islam, Md/Q-8401-2018; Amuedo-Dorantes, Catalina/AAI-7730-2020","Amuedo-Dorantes, Catalina/0000-0002-4750-309X",,,,,51,7,10,0,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

This paper studies the social capital processes of CBC, particular focus being on how power and trust relations are manifested in project networking and implementation governed by public authorities. The examination focuses on the border towns of Tornio (Finland) and Haparanda (Sweden) which share a common cultural history and a long tradition of co-operation. The results, based on document analysis and 16 interviews, show that the CBC at Tornio-Haparanda is not unproblematic but contested by different interest groups and actors. It involves practices of inclusion and exclusion that influence mobilisation, engagement and trust building between different actors. The social capital processes are intertwined with the local norms and values as well as with the strategic networking and pursuance of specific development objectives.","[Jakola, Fredriika; Prokkola, Eeva-Kaisa] Geog Res Unit, Box 3000, Oulu 90014, Finland",,"Jakola, F (通讯作者)，Geog Res Unit, Box 3000, Oulu 90014, Finland.",fredriika.jakola@oulu.fi; eeva-kaisa.prokkola@oulu.fi,"Prokkola, Eeva-Kaisa/C-8420-2013",,CoE RELATE,CoE RELATE,"We wish to thank the anonymous referee for her/his constructive review on the previous draft.

We propose a model, namely a heterogeneous volatility spillover-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model, to investigate volatility spillover. The model specification is parsimonious and can be used to analyze the time variation property of the spillover effect. Our in-sample evidence shows the existence of strong volatility spillover from the US to five major stock markets and indicates that the spillover was stronger during business cycle recessions in the USA.

The analysis utilizes the Data-Based Mechanistic (DBM) approach to the modelling and forecasting where, in this application, the unobserved component model includes a novel hybrid Box Jenkins stochastic model in which the relationship between RTF and GTA is based on a continuous time transfer function (differential equation) model. This model then provides the basis for short term, inter-annual to decadal, forecasting of the GTA, using a transfer function form of the Kalman Filter, which produces a good prediction of the 'pause' or 'levelling' in the temperature rise over the period 2000 to 2011. This derives in part from the effects of a quasi-periodic component that is modelled and forecast by a Dynamic Harmonic Regression (DHR) relationship and is shown to be correlated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) index.

Urban areas are developing rapidly from a technological viewpoint, and innovative technologies create new possibilities for smart mobility management. Therefore, this study investigates the relationship between the implementation of the smart city concept and the idea of sustainable transport, particularly with regard to the reduction of transport generated CO2 emissions. The study estimates CO2 emissions for different potential scenarios of development for the Warsaw transport system until 2050 using the United Nations' ForFITS (For Future Inland Transport Systems) model. The study also analyses the additional impact on CO2 emissions of smart city elements as determinants of mobility. The results show that meeting the reduction targets set by the European Union 2011 White Paper on Transport will be challenging, requiring an in-depth transformation of the transport and energy sectors. This study also confirms that smart city solutions can play a crucial role in mitigating transport emissions and meeting reduction goals.

The implication of this rational design model of commercial contracting behavior is that courts should pay close attention to the plain or ordinary meaning of the language in a standardized term and interpret observed changes in terminology as embodying new meaning that varies from the original formulation. Using a study of the sovereign bond market, we examine the rational design model as applied to standard-form contracting. In NML v. Argentina, federal courts in New York attached great weight to the precise phrasing of the boilerplate contract terms at issue. The industry promptly condemned the decision for endorsing a supposedly erroneous interpretation of a variant of a hoary boilerplate clause. Utilizing data on how contracting practices responded to the courts' decisions, we ask whether the market response indicates that parties in fact intended the variations in their standard contract language to embody different meanings The data support a model of evolution of boilerplate language that is closer to random mutation rather than rational design.","[Choi, Stephen J.] NYU, Law Sch, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Gulati, Mitu] Duke Law Sch, Durham, NC USA; [Scott, Robert E.] Columbia Univ, Law Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA",New York University; Duke University; Columbia University,"Scott, RE (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Law Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA.",rscott@law.columbia.edu,,,,,,,35,10,10,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1465-7252,1465-7260,,AM LAW ECON REV,Am.

In the case of the German cement cartel that operated over 1991-2002, the primary source of noncartel supply was imports from Eastern European cement manufacturers. Testimonies in a private enforcement case have claimed that the cartel sought to control imports by sharing rents with intermediaries in order to discourage them from sourcing foreign supply. Specifically, cartel members would allow an intermediary to issue the invoice for a transaction and charge a fee even though the output went directly from the cartel member's plant to the customer. We investigate this claim by first developing a theory of collusive pricing that takes account of the option of bribing intermediaries. The theory predicts that the cement cartel members are more likely to share rents with an intermediary when the nearest Eastern European plant is closer and there is more Eastern European capacity outside of the control of the cartel. Estimating a logit model that predicts when a cartel member sells through an intermediary, the empirical analysis supports both predictions.","[Harrington, Joseph E., Jr.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Business Econ & Publ Policy, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Hueschelrath, Kai] Univ Appl Sci, Fac Business & Econ, Blechhammer 9, D-98574 Schmalkalden, Germany; [Laitenberger, Ulrich] Telecom ParisTech, Dept Sci Sociales & Econ, 46 Rue Barrault, F-75013 Paris, France; [Hueschelrath, Kai; Laitenberger, Ulrich] ZEW Ctr European Econ Res, Mannheim, Germany",University of Pennsylvania; IMT - Institut Mines-Telecom; Institut Polytechnique de Paris; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Harrington, JE (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Business Econ & Publ Policy, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",harrij@wharton.upenn.edu; hueschel@hs-sm.de; laitenberger@enst.fr,,"Laitenberger, Ulrich/0000-0002-7009-0190","State Government of Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany through the research program Strengthening Efficiency and Competitiveness in the European Knowledge Economies (SEEK); CDC","State Government of Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany through the research program Strengthening Efficiency and Competitiveness in the European Knowledge Economies (SEEK); CDC(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesCenters for Disease Control & Prevention - USA)","The project was financially supported by the State Government of Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany, through the research program Strengthening Efficiency and Competitiveness in the European Knowledge Economies (SEEK).

These policies appear to be paternalistic, even though a traditional view would deny that they are paternalistic on the grounds that policies such as nudges do not restrict individual liberty. it appears to many that a new definition of paternalism that takes its cue from behavioural economics is needed Furthermore, if one revises the definition of paternalism, one must revisit traditional views concerning whether paternalist policies are wise. In Government Paternalism, Julian Le Grand and Bill New make a valuable start, although some corrections are needed. This essay provides a general setting for revising the definition of paternalism and suggests a revised definition of paternalism.","[Hausman, Daniel M.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Philosophy, 5197 Helen C White Hall,600 N Pk St, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Hausman, DM (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Philosophy, 5197 Helen C White Hall,600 N Pk St, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",dhausman@wisc.edu,,,,,,,13,5,6,1,19,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

In both models, bargaining failure is driven by asymmetric information. The difference between the models lies in the bargaining structure: In the signaling game, the informed party makes the final offer, while in the screening game the uninformed party makes the final offer. We conduct experiments for both models under a common set of parameter values, allowing only the identity of the party making the final offer to change. We find the anomalous behavior to be more common in the signaling game, but the frequency of this behavior diminishes in the later rounds of the experiment. Across both games, in the later rounds of the experiment over 90% of offers are consistent with the theory. Having the right to make the offer raises a player's expected payoffs, but by much less than is predicted by theory.

Main goal of these changes was to deliver higher level of quality of transport services, defined through a diverse array of system objectives: ensuring cost-efficient service delivery, reducing subsidy, minimizing negative environmental impacts etc. To successfully achieve these objectives it is necessary to specify in detail all of the obligations, rights and risks that can be produced within and outside the system and have a strong impact on its efficiency and effectiveness. One of the main goals of defining a comprehensive contracting in the public transport of passengers is distribution of competencies and responsibilities between the parties. In the Republic of Serbia, majority of UPT systems have migrated from regulated monopoly to competitive tendering for parts or entire transport network, with dominant use of gross cost contracts. However, after initial benefits, mainly cost savings and increased quality of service, a number of deficiencies have emerged. This paper presents modified gross cost contract in which the authority remains responsible for revenues, but part of revenue risk is shared with operators based on their performance.

Detailed economic and transport data have been collected from companies producing more than 500 million of bus-kilometers in Italy observed in 2011. We draw upon the Bottom-Up approach for the estimation of the cost of the driving personnel and the economic cost of the rolling stock which usually cover more than 50% of the total economic cost. We thus adjust for efficiency the number of bus-kilometers per vehicle and the number of net driving hours per driver, which are characterized by very different levels of efficiency across Italian Regions. We resort to the Top-Down approach for the estimation of other costs. We find that an increase in the number of net driving hours per driver produces higher savings in urban services than intercity services. Conversely, the impact of an increase in the number of bus-kilometers per vehicle in the case of urban services is almost equal to that in the case of intercity services. The applied model allows us to tune the required level of efficiency according to regional desiderata. Our results might then be useful in order to define the maximum economic compensation that can be required by any local public transport firm which takes part in competitive tendering procedures for the allotment of service concessions or which is entitled with monopoly rights by political choice and/or local public ownership.","[Avenali, Alessandro; Catalano, Giuseppe; D'Alfonso, Tiziana; Matteucci, Giorgio] Sapienza Univ Roma, Dept Comp Control & Management Engn, Via Ariosto 25, Rome, Italy; [Boitani, Andrea] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Econ & Finance, Via Necchi 5, Milan, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Matteucci, G (通讯作者)，Sapienza Univ Roma, Dept Comp Control & Management Engn, Via Ariosto 25, Rome, Italy.",matteucci@dis.uniroma1.it,"Catalano, Giuseppe/AAM-6030-2020","matteucci, giorgio/0000-0002-5811-599X",,,,,43,12,12,2,15,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

This paper identifies two types of development (measured as 2008-2010 GDP growth) effects associated to smart policies: one, short-run, associated to urban smartness initiatives, and a second, long run, linked to S3. Instrumental variables estimates are used to support the conceptual framework suggested for the link between these two types of policies, which are both found to have a positive impact on regional economic performance.","[Caragliu, Andrea] Politecn Milan, Milan, Italy; [Del Bo, Chiara] Univ Milan, Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan; University of Milan,"Caragliu, A (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, Milan, Italy.",andrea.caragliu@polimi.it; chiara.delbo@unimi.it,"Caragliu, Andrea/AAI-2320-2020","Caragliu, Andrea/0000-0003-0865-3404",,,,,26,8,10,0,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

The risks transferred from employing the public-private partnership (P3) model are closely related to the choice of repayment schemes. Discount rates used in practice are similar across studies despite wide-ranging debates over appropriate rates in the literature. VfM studies show the advantages of agency municipal bonds are reduced when favorable borrowing rates are available to private partners.

The research findings indicate that higher-order functional spaces (e.g. shopping mall), municipal separation and relatively large geographic distance between Jewish and Arab towns enhance willingness for inter-group contacts, feelings of comfort and security and a shared ethnic identity of sites.

These coasts receive the highest number of international arrivals in Spain. This paper has been developed to gain a better knowledge of the determinants of this international tourism demand. A nonlinear dynamic model that analyses how previous tourists can affect tourism demand decisions is proposed. This nonlinear dynamic specification extends the standard dynamic equation for tourism demand to include interaction effects between previous tourists and two destination characteristics: the quality of the tourism services and tourist congestion. Both characteristics are important to define the reputation or attractiveness of the destination. We test the model using panel data from the 11 provinces which make up the Spanish Mediterranean coasts, and the 7 European countries which are the main origin markets for the period 2005-2015. The system GMM procedure is applied to estimate the econometric model. The econometric results show evidence of strong persistence in international tourism demand. Previous tourists have an important positive and non-constant effect, and this effect is positively influenced by the quality of the tourism services, and negatively by tourist congestion. Therefore, the effect of previous tourists is not constant but varies across provinces and over time. This effect is stronger in provinces with high quality tourism services and lower congestion. Additionally, the impact of previous tourists has not remained constant over time, but has increased in the Mediterranean provinces since 2005. The investments realized in quality and quantity of hotel services during this period have enhanced their reputation.","[Albaladejo, Isabel; Gonzalez-Martinez, Maribel] Univ Murcia, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Metodos Cuantitat Econ & Empresa, Murcia, Spain",University of Murcia,"Albaladejo, I (通讯作者)，Univ Murcia, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Metodos Cuantitat Econ & Empresa, Murcia, Spain.",isalba@um.es; maribel@um.es,"Albaladejo, Isabel P./F-2388-2016; González-Martínez, María Isabel/AAA-1437-2019","Albaladejo, Isabel P./0000-0001-7441-7392; González-Martínez, María Isabel/0000-0001-6564-9298","MEC [ECO2013-45698P, ECO2016-76178P]",MEC,Isabel P.

The paper presents the results of a primary survey covering two regions (Lublin Province and Mazovia Province), which allowed the authors to conduct a comparative analysis of the respondents' opinions about new food products. The results of the primary survey allow for an observation that the surveyed final buyers of food products identify the notion of a new food product mostly with products that meet new needs. Furthermore, a large group of respondents related the notion to products that have been changed in different ways. Products with greater value for the buyer (such as products categorised as special foods) were chosen the most frequently as products that the respondents perceived in the most positive manner. It seems thus that products whose novelty resulted from modifications to their composition received relatively higher rating from the respondents than food products which were identified as new due to such changes as modifications to their packaging.","[Bialoskurski, Sebastian] Univ Life Sci Lublin, Fac Agrobioengn, Dept Management & Mkt, Lublin, Poland; [Wesolowski, Grzegorz] John Paul II Catholic Univ Lublin, Inst Econ & Management, Fac Social Sci, Dept Employees Management Org, Lublin, Poland",University of Life Sciences in Lublin; Catholic University of Lublin,"Bialoskurski, S (通讯作者)，Univ Life Sci Lublin, Fac Agrobioengn, Dept Management & Mkt, Lublin, Poland.",sb79@interia.pl; wesolowski.g@gmail.com,,"Bialoskurski, Sebastian/0000-0002-0156-0750",,,,,15,0,0,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,4807,4814,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553205085,0

Unlike other upward cycles, this boom spanned across virtually all products and categories. The analysis of the causes of this particular boom has led economists to question whether the commodity market as a whole tends to experience price trends uniformly, or whether the prices of individual commodities evolve in unique patterns. In this article, however, it is argued that different commodities experience unique price evolutions due to the differing degrees to which they are affected by a variety of economic, environmental, and political factors. Through a principal component factor analysis, the historical price trends of a selection of 23 representative commodities, demonstrating that their price movements are in fact attributable to distinct factors are studied.

Using a representative sample of Spanish firms with 10 or more employees over the period 1993-2009, the role played by firm age and productivity in firm survival is empirically analysed across three stages of the life cycle of forty-seven 3-digit manufacturing sectors. In the early' stage of the ILC, firm age is negatively correlated with hazard rates while firm productivity is not. Firm productivity is associated with lower hazard in the mature' stage of the ILC, when competition is primarily efficiency-driven, while firm age does not play a significant role for firm survival. In the intermediate' stage, both age and productivity play a role in reducing firms' hazard rates.","[Esteve-Perez, Silviano] Univ Valencia, Dept Appl Econ 2, Valencia, Spain; [Pieri, Fabio] Univ Trento, Dept Econ & Management, Trento, Italy; [Rodriguez, Diego] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Appl Econ 2, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid, Spain",University of Valencia; University of Trento; Complutense University of Madrid,"Esteve-Pérez, S (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Dept Appl Econ 2, Valencia, Spain.",sesteve@uv.es,"Pieri, Fabio/AAB-8384-2020; ESTEVE, SILVIANO/AAD-2029-2021","ESTEVE, SILVIANO/0000-0001-8096-6259",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [MINECO/FEDER ECO2015-68057-R]; Valencian Regional Government [PROMETEOII/2014/053],Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Valencian Regional Government,This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [Project number MINECO/FEDER ECO2015-68057-R]; Valencian Regional Government [PROMETEOII/2014/053].,,64,28,29,2,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

The effects of pollution on forest species most often make their presence felt in areas where various metallochemical combinations exist, which, through the existence of very strong and increasingly dangerous emissions in recent years, threatens large forest areas. The most frequent changes occurring in such cases are the decrease in diameter and height of different species of trees and shrubs, thus also influencing the economic power through a smaller amount of wood. In order to reduce the effects of pollution on forests, it is necessary to implement certain techniques and methods that we find in the work, which according to the law on forestry protection will lead to the decrease of pollution below the admissible limits.","[Gole, Iulian; Postolache, Alexandru Gabriel; Troaca, Victor Adrian; Rotaru, Ciprian; Georgescu, Raluca] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Gole, I (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",iuliangole@yahoo.com; alexandru.postolache04@gmail.com; adrian.troaca@gmail.com; rotaru.ciprian84@yahoo.com; raluca.georgescu@infinitumgroup.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,5106,5111,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553206011,0

However, the spatiality of the gender wage gap has received little attention. I ask whether, where, and how the gender wage gap changed with the Great Recession. Using American Community Survey pooled surveys for 2005-2007 and 2011-2013, I model counterfactual wage distributions for full-time male and female workers in the top one hundred metro areas of the United States, controlling for education, age, experience, and occupation. Gender inequality is polarizing spatially and across the wage distribution, and the recession exacerbates this pattern. Gender gaps decline most in the Rustbelt, but show relative increases in many Western metro areas. Further, declines are mostly among below-median earning workers, whereas increases are likely at the seventy-fifth or ninetieth percentiles. Disproportionate returns to men's characteristics explain much of these geographic and distributional shifts. The combination of geographic and distributional analysis reveals a more thorough picture of how gender inequality shifted with the recession, since previous patterns of uneven development under economic restructuring are still evident. The analysis also signposts regions of emerging gender inequality where relative equality is often presumed, suggesting critical research directions for feminist and economic geographers.","[Goodwin-White, Jamie] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Goodwin-White, Jamie] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Calif Ctr Populat Res, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Goodwin-White, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.;Goodwin-White, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Calif Ctr Populat Res, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",goodwin-white@geog.ucla.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [1263427]; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [R24 HD042828, R24 HD041022]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1263427] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [1263427] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","I gratefully acknowledge extremely helpful suggestions from Don Webber, Richard Black, David Rigby, Cindy Fan, Helga Leitner, Michael Shin, and Paula England, as well as cartographic and figure support from Heather Agnew and Matt Zebrowski.

Budgetary funds may not be enough to satisfy the amount of capital expenditures required to create and maintain infrastructure objects. In this regard, it is important for the state to attract private investment for the implementation of major construction programs and projects. In different countries, various legal constructions are developed and applied to ensure the most effective interaction between the state and the private sector. World and Russian experience shows that public-private partnership is one of the key mechanisms. The main purpose of this article is to assess the effectiveness of the level of integration of the state and private sector on the terms of partnership in several countries. It will enable determining the current position and future prospects of the public-private partnership development in a particular country.Design/methodology/approach: Basing on the author's methodology proposed in the article, an assessment of the effectiveness of the level of integration of the state and the private sector was made on the example of public-private partnership in several countries. The method is based on a comprehensive system of indicators that allows assessing the level of development of the institutional environment, the current experience of projects implementation, as well as the readiness of the state, private actors and society to successfully implement projects on public-private partnership. In the course of study, the analysis, synthesis and comparison methods, and rating method were applied.Findings: The effectiveness of the integration of the state and the private sector (on the example of public-private partnerships) is at different levels in various countries. Global experience shows for some countries (mostly developed ones) the use of public-private partnership is a specific feature of the economy in construction sphere; the probability of successful implementation of projects is very high. As Russian experience shows, that the internal environment is characterized by moderate uncertainty; the probability of successful implementation of projects depends on the selected variant of the project financing.Research/practical implications: This study may be useful for scientific community members, government representatives, experts of big companies and analytical centers who are professionally interested in increasing the effectiveness of public-private partnerships.","[Gorodnova, Natalia V.; Peshkova, Anastasiya A.] Ural Fed Univ, Ekaterinburg, Russia; [Mokronosov, Alexander G.; Voronov, Dmitrii S.] Ural State Univ Econ, Ekaterinburg, Russia",Ural Federal University; Ural State University of Economics,"Gorodnova, NV (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, Ekaterinburg, Russia.",n.v.gorodnova@urfu.ru; amokronosov@mail.ru; vds1234@yandex.ru; np91@list.ru,"Воронов, Дмитрий Sergeevich/O-1504-2016; Gorodnova, Natalia/J-6019-2016","Gorodnova, Natalia/0000-0001-7053-0240",Ural Federal University,Ural Federal University,Our research was supported by the Ural Federal University and the Ural State University of Economics during preparation of the manuscript.,,25,1,1,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,1210,1220,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553202023,0

The author analyzes the system of VAT rates in Russia and China that include standard, reduced, and special rates. Positive and negative effects that occur as a result of charging differing rates and a single positive rate of VAT are studied. The author proves the need to abolish the reduced VAT rates in Russia and in China and to switch over to a single positive VAT rate. The conclusion is drawn that a transition to a unified (identical) VAT rate in Russia and in China could spur the implementation of the Silk Road Economic Belt project, but it would be difficult to agree on the rate and appears unnecessary. At the same time, applying a country-specific flat positive VAT rate in each of the countries (Russia, China) would streamline the process of calculating and regulating the tax, reduce tax evasion, considerably increase VAT revenue and improve the efficiency of VAT collection.","[Iadrennikova, Elena] Ural Fed Univ, Ekaterinburg, Russia",Ural Federal University,"Iadrennikova, E (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, Ekaterinburg, Russia.",elena.yadrennikova@mail.ru,"Iadrennikova, Elena/AAS-7661-2020","Iadrennikova, Elena/0000-0002-8530-3312",Russian Foundation for Basic Research [17-22-21001],Russian Foundation for Basic Research(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)Spanish Government),"The work was supported by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research, contract No 17-22-21001.",,16,0,0,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,5070,5078,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553206007,0

Its adoption determines the method of valuation and presentation of an entity's assets and liabilities. The commencement of bankruptcy proceedings involves the inability to continue as a going concern, whereas opening restructuring proceedings does not. Restructuring proceedings are divided into four types of proceedings: arrangement approval proceedings, accelerated arrangement proceedings, arrangement proceedings, and remedial proceedings. Remedial proceedings are addressed to debtors in the most difficult financial situation and are characterised by the lowest effectiveness. This provides grounds for the question whether remedial proceedings constitute a premise for the declaration of the inability to continue as a going concern. In remedial proceedings, the court revokes the debtor's administration and hence it is unable to declare that it will continue its operations without a material change of their scope. Its influence on the situation of the enterprise is limited. The paper proves that restructuring proceedings should not be treated alike.

Taking into consideration central bank's goals and functions, possible consequences of Bitcoin usage are discussed. It is shown, that any purchase of Bitcoins in no way could increase inflation. To the contrary, it may tend to support deflation. What concerns financial stability: Bitcoin does not yet have the scale to act as a systemic contagion of instability or lapse in network integrity. But the real problem could be substantial involvement of financial institutions in cryptocurrencies. From a central bank's perspective this might be quite dangerous and should be limited by law.

The starting point was the idea of permanently sustainable development. The authors focused on the problem of limitation of emission of gases pollution in the context of sustainable development. The results which were arrived at were matched with other voivodships and comparative analysis was made.The analysed problem has been widely discussed on the global scale. It points out the necessity to limit the use of conventional energy and gradual transformation towards renewable energy. In this paper research covers all voivodships, with particular attention paid to the Lubuskie voivodship.Purpose of the article: The aim of the article is the evaluation of the changes of emission of pollutants and their context including the determining of the social, economic and environmental equilibrium. Such an approach is connected with both a long and short term horizon, which results from the necessity to protect the needs to use clean air and healthy atmosphere at present as well as for future generations, however taking into consideration the economic, social and environmental context. In that sense we are looking for the alternative within the frame of recommendations of the conception of permanent sustainability of development throughout the voivodship.Methodology/methods: The paper looked at different solutions to decrease the use of coal to achieve the aims within the reduction of CO2 emissions throughout the Lubuskie voivodship by means of an econometric model. The authors used a fixed effects model and selected statistical tests serving to evaluate and chose the right model. For evaluating the levels of penetration of different technologies considering their economical technical and environmental characteristics, a probabilistic approach and historical data were used. Innovative procedures at regional stage were presented, such as spatial planning, promoting renewable energy resources and change of life style, which play increasingly important role in accelerating the degree of CO2 reduction.Findings & Value added: In the context of sustainable development variables such as forestation, wages, number of plants, the level of poverty and population density have proven to be important. All these factors explain a significant impact on the sustainable social, economic and environmental development. Conducted regional policy exhibits a diverse mechanism of regulation of priorities between these areas and the phenomenon of substitution between economic and environmental effects, but in the short term. So it is possible to sort the province considered in terms of the balance achieved.","[Kulyk, Piotr; Augustowski, Lukasz] Univ Zielona Gora, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Int Econ, Zielona Gora, Poland",University of Zielona Gora,"Kulyk, P (通讯作者)，Univ Zielona Gora, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Int Econ, Zielona Gora, Poland.",p.kulyk@wez.uz.zgora.pl; l.augustowski@wez.uz.zgora.pl,"Augustowski, Łukasz/ABC-3194-2021","Augustowski, Łukasz/0000-0001-7212-4115",,,,,16,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,2212,2221,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553203030,0

For instance, the user preferences for different IPT options such as autorickshaws, company or chartered buses, shared autorickshaws etc. are not sufficiently investigated. A lack of understanding about user preferences for IPT and the absence of a strong regulatory framework for these modes have impeded progress towards forming and implementing specific policies directed at IPT. Differences in supply and operating characteristics of various IPT alternatives warrant framing unique policies for each of these modes. However, conventional mode choice models either combine these individual IPT alternatives and/or constrain the coefficients in their utilities to be equal which limits the scope for analysis of distinct and directed policies for each IPT mode. A fully disaggregated model is proposed in this study which relaxes both these restrictions. The proposed model offers two advantages in terms of policy analysis with respect to conventional models: each IPT alternative is analyzed individually as a separate alternative as opposed to a composite alternative; the user preference and responsiveness is allowed to vary across different IPT alternatives. The models are used to evaluate and illustrate the impacts of policy related to regulatory fare structures of autorickshaw. The results provide statistical evidence that combining distinct IPT alternatives or constraining their utilities could lead to bias in model coefficients, inaccurate forecasts, erroneous behavioral inferences and misleading policy evaluation.","[Kunhikrishnan, Parthan] BMS Coll Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Bengaluru 560019, India; [Kunhikrishnan, Parthan; Srinivasan, Karthik K.] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Transportat Div, Madras 600036, Tamil Nadu, India",BMS College of Engineering; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Madras,"Kunhikrishnan, P (通讯作者)，BMS Coll Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Bengaluru 560019, India.",kparthan86@gmail.com; hsmnp@yahoo.com,"Parthan, K/AAW-2692-2020","Parthan, K/0000-0002-0934-880X","Centre of Excellence in Urban Transport at IIT Madras - Ministry of Urban Development, Government of India","Centre of Excellence in Urban Transport at IIT Madras - Ministry of Urban Development, Government of India","The support for this work in part by the Centre of Excellence in Urban Transport at IIT Madras, funded by the Ministry of Urban Development, Government of India, is gratefully acknowledged.

Although there already exists a number of companies experimenting with augmented reality, little implementation has gone beyond the pilot project phase. This may be attributed mainly to the hardware and software limitations of the technologies - especially when running augmented reality applications on mobile phones. Limitations such as the need for low latency and smarter object recognition as well as the lack of standards in the development of augmented reality applications across various devices all contribute to the technology's slow adoption.

The current study explores this paradox with the data from 249 public listed Chinese firms that have received venture capital investment. The results show that both venture capitalists' social ties and entrepreneurs' social ties negatively affect these firms' technological innovation performance, including total patents granted, R&D expenditure, and total factor productivity. In other words, venture capitalists' social ties as well as entrepreneurs' social ties actually impede, rather than facilitate their firms' technological innovation. The results also show that entrepreneurs' social capital mediates the impact of venture capitalists' social capital on technological innovation performance.

In this field there is a discussion ranging from the eligibility of fiscal decentralization, its advantages and threats, to searching for the fiscal decentralization's impact on certain macroeconomic indicators. Research focusing on investigating for fiscal decentralization determinants has not clear answer to this question. It considers various indicators often with their ambiguous impact on fiscal decentralization. In this paper, the problem of fiscal decentralization determinants is investigated on the EU countries sample in period 1995-2015. EU countries are divided into groups according to their fiscal decentralization average degree using the cluster analysis. Fiscal decentralization different measures refer on the expenditure, revenue, tax and grant decentralization. For each cluster a panel model is estimated to reveal an influence of selected variables on fiscal decentralization, while fiscal decentralization as dependent variable is measured by chosen various measure. Sensitivity of the estimation results on the fiscal decentralization measurement is obvious. Obtained results partially support assumptions given on basics of related literature. Significant appearance of the economy openness variable, GDP per capita growth and inflation rate, public and local debt variable and variable based on dependency ratio, and population density is influenced by construction of the fiscal decentralization indicator.

Social bond, in particular, has traditionally stressed the importance of social interactions between product/service providers on one hand and customers on the other hand. According to Nichollos (2010) the theoretical concept of relational bonds has passed further buyer-seller dyad relationship and has penetrated into the relationship among customers themselves, which is referred to customer-to-customer interactions. To underline the importance of the concept of the customer-to-customer interactions in the larger paradigm shift of relationship marketing, Clark (1994) called customer-to-customer interaction as a forgotten part of the relationship marketing. In general and based on Nichollos (2010), CCI could happen either during the process in which service is delivered in the service encounter (on-site) or after encounter (off-site). In this research, the effect of positive and negative on-site customer-to-customer interactions on customer perceived value is explored and CCI interactions in a coffee house is taken as an example. Dependency orientation of customers is taken as a moderating variable to explore if the dependency orientation of customers would make an effect on the relationship between the CCI and customer perceived value. With respects to on-site customer-to-customer interaction, which is the focus of this study, there are two major categories of CCI as direct and indirect interactions Kim (2012). First one stresses indirect interactions which focus on customers' understanding, perceptions and assessment of other present customers in the process of providing service, whilst the second one focuses on customers' direct interaction with other customers through any type of verbal or action exchanges. This study is on its pilot stage, where experimental design is utilized as the research methodology to test hypothesis. After determining the dependency, orientation of participants six different treatments are planned under two experiments as direct interaction experiment and indirect interaction experiment. Interdependent Scale/Independent Scale Singelis (1994) will be used to measure dependency orientation of respondents. The scale developed by Voss (2003) is used to measure customer perceived value. Six different scenarios are written for the treatments by keeping all variables involved constant except independent variables.","[Mirzaei, Afshin] Anadolu Univ, Grad Sch Social Sci, Eskisehir, Turkey; [Ozturk, Sevgi A.] Anadolu Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Eskisehir, Turkey",Anadolu University; Anadolu University,"Mirzaei, A (通讯作者)，Anadolu Univ, Grad Sch Social Sci, Eskisehir, Turkey.",Mirzaei.afshin@gmail.com; sozturk@anadolu.edu.tr,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,4180,4180,,,,,,1,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553205019,0

On the other hand, that creativeness (based on knowledge absorption) is strongly influenced by networking skills - either internal, or external.

Many private enterprises have been established or replaced state-owned enterprises and cooperatives. During this period these enterprises have stabilized their activities and strengthened their profile, while weaker ones were withdrawn from the market. Nowadays businesses are facing problems that act as a milestone in their lifecycle. Both business owners and entrepreneurs themselves have to face the need for a new generation to manage and operate businesses and take over the ownership of the business. The generational exchange figures as a complex issue and must be approached from different angles. The present study is focusing on the issue of human resources and the reproduction of human capital in the SME sector. Compared to small and medium-sized enterprises, large companies are systematically addressing the need for generational exchange of the human capital. The sample of our primary research conducted in the SME sector in Slovakia shows the absence of systematic approach towards the generational exchange in businesses. This problem acts as an obstacle to further development of business activities in the SME sector.","[Rafajova, Lucia; Pafco, Martin; Mazak, Michal] Pan European Univ Bratislava, Fac Econ & Business, Tematinska 10, Bratislava 85105, Slovakia",Pan-European University,"Rafajová, L (通讯作者)，Pan European Univ Bratislava, Fac Econ & Business, Tematinska 10, Bratislava 85105, Slovakia.",rafajova.lucia@gmail.com; martinpafco@hotmail.com; mazak@lxt.sk,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,1,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2238-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,404,413,,,,,,10,Demography; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BO2QE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000507522000038,0

Using an innovative combination of spatial statistics and remotely sensed data, this research shows that the likelihood of an area being converted to agriculture is closely tied to how land is used in a location's surroundings. The results also suggest that this spatial spillover effect cannot be tied exclusively to the distribution of natural suitability characteristics. Rather, the likelihood of an area being converted to agriculture appears to reflect the dynamic socio-economic conditions of a location's surroundings. The findings imply that (i) agricultural agencies or experts seeking to support developing agricultural regions should recognize the importance of returns to scale and local clustering and that (ii) land use modeling can be improved by accounting for suitability and land uses in nearby locations.","[Richards, Peter] US Agcy Int Dev, Bur Food Secur, Washington, DC 20523 USA",United States Agency for International Development (USAID),"Richards, P (通讯作者)，US Agcy Int Dev, Bur Food Secur, Washington, DC 20523 USA.",Peter.richards.d@gmail.com,,,"National Science Foundation Fellowship in Interdisciplinary Research in Behavioral and Social Award, Brazil's New Green Revolution: Capital, Investment, and Agricultural Expansion [1305489]; SBE Off Of Multidisciplinary Activities; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1305489] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation Fellowship in Interdisciplinary Research in Behavioral and Social Award, Brazil's New Green Revolution: Capital, Investment, and Agricultural Expansion; SBE Off Of Multidisciplinary Activities; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This research acknowledges support from National Science Foundation Fellowship in Interdisciplinary Research in Behavioral and Social Award (#1305489), Brazil's New Green Revolution: Capital, Investment, and Agricultural Expansion.

Using the Path Analysis method for banks listed on the Stock Exchange, there is evidence that Institutional Ownership and Managerial Ownership influence Corporate Financial Performance through the mediation of earnings management. Both of these variables negatively affect earnings management, and earnings management has a negative influence on the company's financial performance. That is every increase in managerial ownership and institutional ownership increases, causing a decrease in earnings management, while a decrease in earnings management can increase the company's financial performance. This study succeeded in proving in the banking sector that earnings management can be suppressed by a self-control mechanism to reduce the effect of agency theory, among others by (1) ownership of company shares by the manager (managerial ownership); (2) share ownership by institutions (institutional ownership).

Also the integration and consolidation of healthcare organizations are not unusual themes in professional resources. The specialists observe especially a vertical and horizontal integration of hospitals and its influence to the increase of an effectiveness of healthcare provision. The results of these studies, however, do not conclusively prove the impact of all kinds of integration of hospitals to their efficiency and effectiveness growth. The present article focuses on horizontal integrated hospitals in the Czech Republic and the perception of advantages and disadvantages of integration of the hospitals by hospital managers themselves. The main aim of the research was to answer following research questions: Does the perception of advantages and disadvantages of participation in integration depend on the length of integration's lifetime? Does the perception of advantages and disadvantages of participation in integration depend on the kind of integration? Regarding the overall view of the trend of integration, hospital managers see integration as promising. Further, the research results revealed that based on the research sample, we cannot unequivocally confirm a statistically significant difference between the two studied types of integration (holding and mergers). A statistically significant difference in the perception of the overall view of the advantages of integration also cannot be confirmed given a length of involvement in holding or merger. Overall, the hospital sees as disadvantages particularly the reduction of autonomy, the increased difficulty of promotion of changes and communication problems. As for the benefits, 93% of hospitals evaluated that the integration gives them a better negotiating ability with suppliers, 80% of hospitals noticed better negotiating ability with health insurance companies and about 80% report that there has been a reduction in costs.","[Stankova, Pavla] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Dept Management & Mkt, Zlin, Czech Republic; [Papadaki, Sarka; Dvorsky, Jan] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Dept Enterprise Econ, Zlin, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin; Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Stanková, P (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Dept Management & Mkt, Zlin, Czech Republic.",stankova@fame.utb.cz; papadaki@fame.utb.cz; j1dvorsky@fame.utb.cz,"Dvorsky, Jan/C-9213-2018","Dvorsky, Jan/0000-0002-6078-2636; Stankova, Pavla/0000-0001-7068-8937",Internal Grant Agency of FaME [RO/2016/12],Internal Grant Agency of FaME,This paper was supported by Internal Grant Agency of FaME RO/2016/12 (Management of healthcare organizations effectiveness).,,26,4,5,1,15,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Relationships between the variables and the associated intensity values were then identified using document coding, as well as by gathering expert opinions through a workshop. A fuzzy cognitive map analysis was then conducted to investigate the relationships between the variables and the resulting impacts by the transportation sector on climate change. A scenario analysis was also conducted in order to identify the most effective policies in reducing the impacts of transportation on climate change, at both the local and global levels.

An RCT is an evaluation technique that draws from experimental design in order to measure the impact of a development project. Due to randomizationrandomly distributing people or communities to receive either control or treatmentadvocates suggest that it is possible to measure the impact of an intervention, and attribute a causal relationship between the intervention and its outcome. As such, proponents claim that RCTs are able to get to the heart of what really works for development interventions. This article charts the rise of RCTs within two major development institutions: the World Bank and the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Drawing from fieldwork at these two institutions, we follow RCTs as a technology of development, finding that they take divergent forms at each of the institutions. The article examines the contested and uneven paths of RCTs as they have proliferated throughout development economics scholarship and practice, and teases out the new problems, subjects, spaces, and governance regimes of development that RCTs engender. We build on existing economic geography research concerned with the rise of behavioralism within development. By centering the methodology of RCTs, we find institutional and geographic variation as well as a reconfiguration of development governance through experimentation.","[Webber, Sophie] Univ Sydney, Sch Geosci, Camperdown, NSW, Australia; [Prouse, Carolyn] Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of Sydney; University of British Columbia,"Webber, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Geosci, Camperdown, NSW, Australia.",,,"Webber, Sophie/0000-0002-7597-4622",Social Science and Humanities Research Council Canada; Liu Institute for Global Issues at the University of British Columbia,Social Science and Humanities Research Council Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Liu Institute for Global Issues at the University of British Columbia,"We are grateful to numerous interlocutors at the World Bank and J-PAL, especially Ellen Hamilton for her assistance navigating the institutions.

The purpose of this study is to propose integrated FMCDM methodology including FAHP, WASPAS-F, EDAS-F and ARAS-F. In these methods, relative importances of the criteria are determined by FAHP. Managerial and financial perspective is determined as the most important criteria by FAHP methods. Then WASPAS-F, EDAS-F and ARAS-F methods are carried out to rank the alternatives. The practical implication of the integrated FMCDM methods is the use of linguistic variables for assessment of the criteria and the alternatives. As a research implication, Hybrid Based Strategy is determined as the best organizational strategy. The originality and value of study is to present comparative analyzes using the newly developed WASPAS-F, EDAS-F and ARAS-F integrated with FAHP methods.

Significant interrelations between the integral index of subjective economic wellbeing, revealing a generalized assessment of the present and future material life, and self-assessment of personal competitiveness, as well as with coping strategies seeking social support, solving problems were revealed.

Due to the fact that our time-span of almost 16 years is permeated with tranquil and crisis periods, we divided full-sample into three subsamples - before, during and after World financial crisis (WFC) via modified ICSS algorithm. We find that spillover effects happen mostly from the commodity markets toward RTS index in all three subsamples. However, during relatively calm periods (first and third sub-periods), spillover effects are very moderate and they occur in relatively few wavelet scales, which points that duration of these effects is limited in peaceful times. On the other hand, duration of spillover effects and its intensity increased during WFC. Also, wavelet coherence indicates that there are areas of stronger co-movements in period of WFC at higher wavelet scales for pairs such as RTS-Brent, - gasoline and - platinum. Commodities that have the strongest transmission effect on RTS index are Brent oil, gasoline and palladium, while gold has strong volatility transmission only during WFC.","[Zivkov, Dejan; Njegic, Jovan; Momcilovic, Mirela] Univ Novi Sad, Novi Sad Sch Business, Vladimira Perica Valtera 4, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia",University of Novi Sad,"Zivkov, D (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Novi Sad Sch Business, Vladimira Perica Valtera 4, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia.",dejanzivkov@gmail.com; jovan.nj@gmail.com; bizniscentar@gmail.com,"Njegic, Jovan/K-9087-2019",,,,,,38,4,4,1,6,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

The aim of the paper is to study whether entrepreneurial activity in regions with high economic growth is to a different degree responsive to region-specific dimensions than in low developed regions in a transition economy. The analysis of regional dimension of entrepreneurship was done on the example of Polish NUTS-2 regions for 2002-2015 period. Data sources were Eurostat and the Statistics Poland. The Ordinary Least Squared regression with robust standard errors was used for hypothesis testing. Durbin-Watson test was used to control for the autocorrelation. The main finding is that depending the level of economic growth, entrepreneurial activity in a transition economy responds heterogeneously to region-specific characteristic.

In order to obtain permission to leave the island, and thus continue their journeys towards northern Europe, arriving refugees first have to go through a registration process. During 2015, this registration resulted in refugees being given an administrative deportation order,' which de jure expelled the refugees from Greek territory but de facto allowed them to leave the island and continue their travels. This administrative deportation order' was therefore pursued by the arriving refugees as a travel' rather than expulsion' document. Following the experiences of a group of Syrian refugees in their endeavors to get registered and leave the island of Lesvos in June 2015, this paper illustrates how refugees actively navigate the systems that govern their (im)mobility - and how their alternative reading and usage of the administrative deportation order also has broader political consequences.","[Franck, Anja K.] Univ Gothenburg, Sch Global Studies, POB 700, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Franck, AK (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Sch Global Studies, POB 700, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",anja.franck@globalstudies.gu.se,,,,,,,16,9,9,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Previous studies have found that the estimated models change over time, but the implications of the time-varying behavior have not been thoroughly examined. This paper presents an adaptive estimation approach that allows for the parameters of the estimated models to be time varying. It is shown that a two-state Gaussian hidden Markov model with time-varying parameters is able to reproduce the long memory of squared daily returns that was previously believed to be the most difficult fact to reproduce with a hidden Markov model. Capturing the time-varying behavior of the parameters also leads to improved one-step density forecasts. Finally, it is shown that the forecasting performance of the estimated models can be further improved using local smoothing to forecast the parameter variations.

In this paper, the relationship between trends in mortality and trends in temperature change (as a proxy) is investigated using annual data and for specified (warm and cold) periods during the year in the UK. A thoughtful statistical analysis is implemented and a new stochastic, central mortality rate model is proposed. The new model encompasses the good features of the Lee and Carter (Journal of the American Statistical Association, 1992, 87: 659-671) model and its recent extensions, and for the very first time includes an exogenous factor which is a temperature-related factor. The new model is shown to provide a significantly better-fitting performance and more interpretable forecasts.

Aim: The aim is to quantify systemic risk as the capital shortfall an institution is likely to experience, conditional to the entire financial sector being undercapitalised. Setting: We measure the systemic risk index (SRISK) of the South African (SA) banking sector between 2001 and 2013. Methods: Systemic risk is measured with the SRISK. Results: Although the results indicated only moderate systemic risk in the SA financial sector over this period, there were significant spikes in the levels of systemic risk during periods of financial turmoil in other countries. Especially the stock market crash in 2002 and the subprime crisis in 2008. Based on our results, the largest contributor to systemic risk during quiet periods was Investec, the bank in our sample which had the lowest market capitalisation. However, during periods of financial turmoil, the contributions of other larger banks increased markedly. Conclusion: The implication of these spikes is that systemic risk levels may also be highly dependent on external economic factors, in addition to internal banking characteristics. The results indicate that the economic fundamentals of SA itself seem to have little effect on the amount of systemic risk present in the financial sector. A more significant relationship seems to exist with the stability of the financial sectors in foreign countries. The implication therefore is that complying with individual banking regulations, such as Basel, and corporate governance regulations promoting ethical behaviour, such as King III, may not be adequate. It is therefore proposed that banks should always have sufficient capital reserves in order to mitigate the effects of a financial crisis in a foreign country. The use of worst-case scenario analyses (such as those in this study) could aid in determining exactly how much capital banks could need in order to be considered sufficiently capitalised during a financial crisis, and therefore safe from systemic risk.","[Foggitt, Gregory M.; Heymans, Andre; van Vuuren, Gary W.; Pretorius, Anmar] North West Univ, Dept Risk Management, Sch Econ, Potchefstroom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"Foggitt, GM (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Dept Risk Management, Sch Econ, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",gregmf90@gmail.com,"Pretorius, Anmar/AAM-5370-2020; Heymans, André/W-7520-2019; van Vuuren, Gary/B-5453-2019","Heymans, André/0000-0003-3879-6887; van Vuuren, Gary/0000-0001-6811-0538",North-West University School of Economics,North-West University School of Economics,We gratefully acknowledge the support of the North-West University School of Economics and the reviewers for their valuable feedback.,,31,4,5,0,6,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Taking an existing route in Kolkata city which is served by private buses, several scenarios were investigated to achieve the viability of service through interventions in fare, design of service, and supply of buses. A simulation framework was used for the evaluation of various scenarios. The study brings out new evidences to question the conventional approach of increasing the bus fare to satisfy the operational viability. It is shown that the fare and the revenue requirements are distorted due to the oversupply of buses and non-optimal service. The analysis shows that even with the present fare, it is possible to resolve the viability issue by optimizing the service and supply. The results presented in the paper are case specific but are likely to encourage policy makers to carry out similar investigations in other cities in India as well as in other developing countries to improve urban bus service without putting an additional burden on the users.","[Dandapat, Saurabh; Cheranchery, Munavar Fairooz; Maitra, Bhargab] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur,"Maitra, B (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.",saurabhdandapat@gmail.com; fairoozmunavarc@gmail.com; bhargab@civil.iitkgp.ernet.in,"Cheranchery, Munavar Fairooz/AAZ-3179-2021; Dandapat, Saurabh/O-5193-2017","Dandapat, Saurabh/0000-0002-8310-5224; Maitra, Bhargab/0000-0003-2083-9930","Housing and Urban Development Corporation (Hudco), Government of India [HSMI/RD/20/2012-13]; Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government of India [4-22/2014-TS.I]","Housing and Urban Development Corporation (Hudco), Government of India; Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government of India(Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government of India)","This work was supported by Housing and Urban Development Corporation (Hudco), Government of India [grant number HSMI/R&D/20/2012-13] and Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government of India [grant number F.No. 4-22/2014-TS.I].",,32,13,14,0,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

This paper shows how such tolls affect the distribution of trip lengths. A static model is presented in which travelers with potentially different trip lengths decide whether to drive into a downtown zone governed by a Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD), with each traveler's choice probability declining as tolls and travel time rise. An application of Little's Law allows the model's equilibria to be derived in terms of a familiar supply/demand framework. Analysis proves and numerical simulation demonstrates that, if trip lengths and the value of a trip both vary across travelers, then access tolls inefficiently shift the distribution of car trip lengths toward long trips, whereas a distance toll can achieve the welfare-maximizing set of car trips.","[Lehe, Lewis J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Lehe, LJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",lewis500@berkeley.edu,,"Lehe, Lewis/0000-0001-8029-1706",UC CONNECT,UC CONNECT,"The author is indebted to Carlos Daganzo, Richard Arnott, Mogens Fosgerau and two anonymous reviewers for comments that have greatly improved the paper.

We do not specify a model for Y-t, but assume that there exists a px1 parameter vector Phi such that the conditional distribution of Z(t)vertical bar Z(t-1) is the same as that of Z(t)vertical bar Phi(T)Z(t-1), where Z(t-1) = ( Z(t-1), ... , Z(t-p))(T) for some lag p >= 1. Consequently, the conditional variance of Yt is some function of Phi(T)Z(t-1). To estimate Phi, we propose a robust estimation methodology based on density power divergences (DPD) indexed by a tuning parameter alpha is an element of [0, 1], which yields a continuum of estimators, {(Phi) over cap (alpha); alpha is an element of [0, 1]}, where alpha controls the trade-off between robustness and efficiency of the DPD estimators. For each alpha, (Phi) over cap (alpha) is shown to be strongly consistent. We develop data-dependent criteria for the selection of optimal alpha and lag p in practice. We illustrate the usefulness of our DPD methodology via simulation studies for ARCH-type models, where the errors are drawn from a gross-error contamination model and the conditional variance is a linear and/or nonlinear function of Phi(T)Z(t-1). Furthermore, we analyze the Chicago Board Options Exchange Dow Jones volatility index data and show that our DPD approach yields viable models for the conditional variance, which are as good as, or superior to, ARCH/GARCH models and two other divergence-based models in terms of in-sample and out-of-sample forecasts.","[Park, Jin-Hong] Coll Charleston, Dept Math, Charleston, SC 29424 USA; [Sriram, T.

To capture these properties simultaneously, we utilize a Markov switching autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average (MS-ARFIMA) model to forecast the realized volatility by combining the long memory process with regime switching component, and compare its forecast performances with the competing models at various horizons. The full-sample estimation results show that the dynamics of the realized volatility of agricultural commodity futures are characterized by two levels of long memory: one associated with the low-volatility regime and the other with the high-volatility regime, and the probability to stay in the low-volatility regime is higher than that in the high-volatility regime. The out-of-sample volatility forecast results show that the combination of long memory with switching regimes improves the performance of realized volatility forecast, and the proposed model represents a superior out-of-sample realized volatility forecast to the competing models.

This demographic trend has many impacts on society, as in many regards solos behave differently than other strata's of the population. The objective of this paper is to explore the transport-related implications of the growth in single-person households in Canadian cities. The 2010 Canadian General Social Survey (N=15,390) provides individual level socio demographic characteristics and time use diary that are used to classify individual's living situation (living alone, roommates, single parents, couples, and families) and to asses six transportation behaviours (owning a driver's license, access to a vehicle, commute distance, travel time by mode, overall trip frequency and trip frequency by purposes). Logistic, ordered logistic and negative binomial regressions are used to uncover the relationships between household types and travel behaviours, and to determine the transport-related implications of single person households beyond other socio demographic characteristics in Canadian cities. Our findings confirm associations between single-person households and transportation behaviours and suggest they adopt a more environmentally sustainable lifestyle, at least with respect to travel. On average, single-person households commute shorter distances and are less likely to own a driver's license or have access to a vehicle than respondents from family households. The share of solos using a car is 17 percentage points lower than respondents living in family households and rates of use of active modes are 9 percentage points higher than respondents in couple households. Despite solos' overall trip frequency not significantly differing from family households, solos do partake in more food and social related trips. Age group difference exists within the solos category. The growth of single-person households may have considerable implications on urban transportation demand. If solos do chose to locate in places where alternative transportation modes are not accessible, the growth of this group may result in an increase in overall motorization rates because they are less likely to share a car.","[Young, Mischa; Lachapelle, Ugo] Univ Quebec, Ecole Sci Gest, Dept Etud Urbaines & Tourist, Case Postale 888,Succursale Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Young, Mischa] Univ Toronto, Dept Geog & Planning, 100 St George St,Room 5047, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; University of Toronto,"Lachapelle, U (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec, Ecole Sci Gest, Dept Etud Urbaines & Tourist, Case Postale 888,Succursale Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",mischa.young@mail.utoronto.ca; lachapelle.ugo@uqam.ca,"Young, Mischa/AAE-8207-2020","Lachapelle, Ugo/0000-0003-2306-6021",Social Science and Humanities Research Council Grant,Social Science and Humanities Research Council Grant,Social Science and Humanities Research Council Grant.,,41,14,15,2,20,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

However, the international evidence that estimates the causal effect of education on voter turnout is mixed. There is no evidence for such a causal effect in Ireland. Using data from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA), and employing the instrumental variable (IV) probit model, we investigate whether education has a causal effect on individuals' political participation in their later lives. We find that individuals with more education are more likely to vote in the general election. The effects are larger for individuals whose parents have only primary education or below, and for individuals growing up in a poor family. The findings provide motivations for increasing targeted public supports in education for students coming from a disadvantaged family.","[Ma, Yuanyuan] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Wenlan Sch Business, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Ma, Yuanyuan] Trinity Coll Dublin, Irish Longitudinal Study Ageing TILDA, Dublin, Ireland",Zhongnan University of Economics & Law; Trinity College Dublin,"Ma, YY (通讯作者)，Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Wenlan Sch Business, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.;Ma, YY (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Irish Longitudinal Study Ageing TILDA, Dublin, Ireland.",mayuanyuan@zuel.edu.cn,"Ma, Yuanyuan/HSH-7412-2023","Ma, Yuanyuan/0000-0002-1090-4551",,,,,25,2,2,0,8,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

The work of Kelsen is treated as a meta-theoretical analysis that reveals some of the presumptions of theoretical approaches to law that claim to be scientific and, in particular, that claim to scientifically analyse the law's influence on behaviour.

Using a detailed survey dataset from the Korea Information Society Development Institute (KISDI), I find that Internet subscribers who previously bundled are less likely to switch their Internet service provider than are those who did not bundle. The results are robust to correction for the potential selection problem through the use of an endogenous treatment model. The finding that bundling reduces the probability of switching service providers and locks-in existing users can have important implications for market competitiveness and consumer welfare.","[Lee, Stephanie] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, 579 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Lee, S (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, 579 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",slee88@stanford.edu,,,,,,,27,8,8,3,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

Instead of traditional referenda, it is possible to structure plebiscites which would only bind a subset of the population (e.g., to be subject to a carbon tax) if that subset's individually chosen conditions for participation are met. While provision-point mechanisms with exogenously set provision points have garnered billions of dollars in private contributions, a broader class of social contracting mechanisms exist that allow individuals to bid on their preferred provision points. This article shows how both partial and probabilistic bidding schemes might foster voluntary subpopulation participation in a range of public good applications (including sexual assault reporting and civil disobedience), and reports results from a series of randomized surveys of Internet respondents assessing the potential support for such subgroup social contracting. The respondent bids would, for example, support an equilibrium in which approximately 25% of the public would voluntarily commit to pay an additional 10% tax on electricity.","[Ayres, Ian] Yale Law Sch, POB 208215, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University,"Ayres, I (通讯作者)，Yale Law Sch, POB 208215, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",ian.ayres@yale.edu,,,,,,,59,7,7,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1465-7252,1465-7260,,AM LAW ECON REV,Am.

We use a control function approach to develop a binary discrete choice model with spatial interactions. We find that a municipality's decision to cooperate over the provision of local public goods depends on the decisions made by its neighbours. In particular, the probability of cooperating with neighbouring municipalities is higher if the latter already provide joint local public goods. This suggests that functional cooperation is likely to emerge due to a mimicking motivation and is poorly motivated by political alignment.

The free-market equilibrium is iniquitous, both because the households have different resources and because the children have different access to education. Public policy is thus called for, for vertical as well as horizontal equity purposes. Conventional wisdom has it that both objectives could be achieved using price control instruments, i.e. income taxes and price subsidies. We find instead that income taxes reduce equality of opportunity and that price subsidies cannot remedy this. Quantity controls become necessary: a compulsory education package, financed by a redistributive tax system, achieves both types of equity.

This paper proposes a structural equation model (SEM) to comprehensively consider the hi-directional relationship between multimodal transportation investment and economic development. To account for the complicated interactions between transportation investment and economic growth, travel demand is added as an endogenous variable in the model system. In addition, the SEM model system is formulated with variables that reflect transportation supply in geographically adjacent areas to investigate spatial spillover effects. Empirical analysis based on a panel dataset at the reginal level in China from 1986 to 2011 is conducted. Results show transportation investment in the current region or other regions have impacts on economic growth, but are obviously different at national level and provincial level. These differences can be associated with phases of economic development, transportation investment policy, transportation infrastructure service level, spillovers from other regions, as well as reform policies carried out by the central government.","[Jiang, Xiushan; Qin, Huanhuan] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Traff & Transportat, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [He, Xiang; Shao, Fengru] China Acad Civil Aviat Sci & Technol, Beijing 100028, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lei] Univ Maryland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",Beijing Jiaotong University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Jiang, XS (通讯作者)，Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Traff & Transportat, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.",xshjiang@bjtu.edu.cn,,,"Center of Cooperative Innovation for Beijing Metropolitan Transportation in China; National Transportation Center on Strategic Transportation Policies, Investments and Decisions for Economic Competitiveness at the University of Maryland in the U.S.","Center of Cooperative Innovation for Beijing Metropolitan Transportation in China; National Transportation Center on Strategic Transportation Policies, Investments and Decisions for Economic Competitiveness at the University of Maryland in the U.S.","This research is supported by Center of Cooperative Innovation for Beijing Metropolitan Transportation in China and the National Transportation Center on Strategic Transportation Policies, Investments and Decisions for Economic Competitiveness at the University of Maryland in the U.S.",,43,64,70,10,96,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

We find that the supervisory board structure reflects both outside control by major shareholders and inside control by other stakeholders. The largest group among non-employee board members is made up of bank managers. The high proportion of former executives and German board representation indicates significant inside control. The chairpersons of banks controlled by banks are less likely to be former executives of the same bank than are the chairpersons of banks controlled by non-banks. Over time, representation of industrial and insurance companies on banks' supervisory boards has decreased and the representation of banks and foreign shareholders has increased.","[Johansen, Kathrin; Laser, Saskia; Neuberger, Doris] Univ Rostock, Dept Econ, Ulmenstr 69, D-18057 Rostock, Germany; [Neuberger, Doris] IFF, Hamburg, Germany; [Andreani, Ettore] UniCredit SpA, Via San Protaso 3, I-20121 Milan, Italy",University of Rostock; UniCredit Group,"Neuberger, D (通讯作者)，Univ Rostock, Dept Econ, Ulmenstr 69, D-18057 Rostock, Germany.",kathrin.johansen@uni-rostock.de; saskialaser@me.com; doris.neuberger@uni-rostock.de; ettore.andreani@unicredit.eu,,"Neuberger, Doris/0000-0003-3114-0615",,,,,65,3,3,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

We apply this method to French males, comparing those whose parents are North African immigrants and those with native parents. We find that both the raw and the unexplained ethnic employment differentials are larger for low-employability workers than for high-employability ones. We show in a theoretical framework that this heterogeneity can be accounted for by homogeneous underlying mechanisms and is not evidence for, say, heterogeneous discrimination.

Despite the great importance, there is little focus in recent literature which provided empirical evidence on the effect of global financial crisis and post crisis on the banks of Bangladesh and other determinants of Bangladesh bank efficiency. Thus, this paper aims to examine the effect of global financial crisis and post-crisis, and other determinants of the efficiency of Bangladesh commercial banks. By employing the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method, we computed the technical efficiency of individual banks operating in the Bangladesh banking sector during 2000 to 2013. The empirical findings indicate that the Bangladesh banking sector has exhibited the highest efficiency level during 2001, while efficiency seems to be at the lowest level during 2010. The study finds that crisis along with bank size, capital adequacy ratio, return on average equity and real interest rate have a significant effect on bank efficiency in Bangladesh. In order to keep the sound financial development of Bangladesh, banks operating in the Bangladesh banking sector have to consider all the potential technologies which could improve their profit efficiency levels, since the main motive of banks is to maximise shareholders' value or wealth through profit maximisation.","[Banna, Hasanul; Ahmad, Rubi; Koh, Eric H.

This article aims to show the relationship between the amounts drawn from the selected operational program of ESI funds and per capita income level in various regions NUTS 3 during 2007-2015 in the Czech Republic. For the purpose of achieving the set goals time series analysis of variables and correlation analysis using Pearson correlation coefficient have been used. Time series data has been controlled by Durbin-Watson test of autocorrelation. Results of theoretical research brought a positive response that subsidies should positively affect the economic level of the population and should help lagging EU Member States and regions within those Member States in their economic growth. The results of empirical research showed that the correlation relationship of the amount of EU subsidies paid to the regions in the Czech Republic and the level of income cannot be clearly demonstrated. Significant correlation has been found in few of regions. However, in most cases dependence has not been demonstrated, thus, correlation between income level and amount of ESI funds from EU is not submitted. It can be concluded that in the short term, the level of per capita income in the region is getting closer to the most developed region of the City of Prague and therefore lagging regions of the country get economically closer. However, this fact cannot be clearly attributed to the amounts allocated through ESI subsidies in various regions of the Czech Republic.","[Brzakova, Kristyna; Kraft, Jiri] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Liberec, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Brzáková, K (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Liberec, Czech Republic.",kristyna.brzakova@tul.cz; jiri.kraft@tul.cz,"Kraft, Jiri/P-2722-2017","Kraft, Jiri/0000-0002-4269-0009",,,,,45,5,5,0,13,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

These insights provide novel theoretical and practical insights into the business model, innovation and sustainability literatures.","[Inigo, Edurne A.; Albareda, Laura] Univ Deusto, Deusto Business Sch, Bilbao, Spain; [Albareda, Laura; Ritala, Paavo] Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Sch Business & Management, Lappeenranta, Finland",University of Deusto; Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT,"Inigo, EA (通讯作者)，Univ Deusto, Deusto Business Sch, Bilbao, Spain.",ea.inigo@gmail.com,"Hallstedt, Sophie I./A-4669-2015; Ritala, Paavo/JOZ-8801-2023","Ritala, Paavo/0000-0002-8525-4610; Albareda, Laura/0000-0002-1558-5262; Inigo, Edurne Angosto/0000-0003-2353-2272",,,,,84,113,134,12,200,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

As the social and political consequences of faltering growth and increasing inequality, debt and insecurity gradually manifest themselves, and with automation and artificial intelligence lurking in the wings, the future of capitalism, at least in its current form, looks increasingly uncertain. With this, the question of what property and property rights might look like in the future, in a potentially post-capitalist society, is becoming ever more pertinent. Is the choice simply between private property and markets, and public (state-owned) property and planning? Or can individual and social property in the (same) means of production co-exist, as Marx suggested? This paper explores ways in which they might, through an examination of the Chinese household responsibility system (HRS) and the fuzzy' and seemingly confusing regime of land ownership that it instituted. It examines the HRS against the backdrop of Marx's ideas about property and subsequent (post-Marx) theorizing about the legal nature of property in which property has come widely to be conceptualized not as a single, unitary ownership' right to a thing (or, indeed, as the thing itself) but as a bundle of rights'. The bundle-of-rights idea of property, it suggests, enables us to see not only that individual' and socialized' property' in the (same) means of production might indeed co-exist, but that the range of institutional possibility is far greater than that between capitalism and socialism/communism as traditionally conceived.","[Ireland, Paddy] Univ Bristol, Sch Law, Wills Mem Bldg, Bristol, Avon, England; [Meng, Gaofeng] Univ Glasgow, Sch Law, Stair Bldg, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of Bristol; University of Glasgow,"Ireland, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Sch Law, Wills Mem Bldg, Bristol, Avon, England.",paddy.ireland@bristol.ac.uk; g.meng.1@research.gla.ac.uk,,,,,,,99,6,7,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

The main objective is to increase the self-reliance and self-sufficiency of municipalities related to allocation efficiency and possible adjustment to the local conditions. The municipalities in the Czech Republic have the possibility to affect the tax revenue on immovable property by means of the coefficients being thus the only assigned tax. The aim of the paper is to determine the use of legislative tools to increase the tax revenue on immovable property in the regions of the Czech Republic. Access of municipalities to the increase in the tax revenues on immovable property is then studied through three coefficients within the Moravian-Silesian Region. Examples of good practice in motivating municipalities to implement or modify selected coefficients leading to an increase in municipal budgets are examined. The article also performs a description of the development of the tax on immovable property in the Czech Republic, on the basis of the time series of tax imposed as a follow-up to the legislative changes. Methodically the research relies on the evaluation of secondary statistical data of the Czech Statistical Office and Financial Administration of the Czech Republic, and the primary research that was implemented in 2016 focuses on the application of the coefficients by municipalities of the Moravian-Silesian Region. This research closely follows up on the research of the use of local coefficients, which was carried out in 2014 and 2015.","[Janouskova, Jana; Sobotovicova, Sarka] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Finance & Accounting, Opava, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Janousková, J (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Finance & Accounting, Opava, Czech Republic.",janouskova@opf.slu.cz; sobotovicova@opf.slu.cz,"Sobotovicova, Sarka/AAA-6033-2021","Sobotovicova, Sarka/0000-0001-9665-2043","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports Czech Republic","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech RepublicCzech Republic Government)","This paper was supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports Czech Republic within the Institutional Support for Long-term Development of a Research Organization in 2017.",,30,7,7,2,10,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

While there have been a large number of studies on factors that affect research productivity or performance, their empirical results have been quite inconclusive and conflicting. We argue that one of the reasons for mixed results involves the measurement of research performance. To tackle the problem, we measure the quality of government-funded research through journal impact factors as well as journal rankings, considering the specific features of academic disciplines. We find that the magnitude and degree of factors vary depending on how research quality is measured. More interestingly, several variables including researchers' ages, the number of authors, and international collaboration show completely different results according to the level of journal ranking. Based on the empirical results, we suggest policy interventions that can improve the quality of government-supported research.","[Jung, Hyejin] Korea Univ Technol & Educ, Ctr Technol Innovat Management, Cheonan Si, Chungcheongam D, South Korea; [Seo, Inseok] Anyang Univ, Sch Publ Adm, Anyang Si, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Kim, Jaesik] Natl Res Fdn, Directorate Adm Management, Daejeon Si, South Korea; [Kim, Byung-Keun] Korea Univ Technol & Educ, Sch Management Technol, Cheonan Si, Chungcheongnam, South Korea",Korea University of Technology & Education; Anyang University; Korea University of Technology & Education,"Kim, BK (通讯作者)，Korea Univ Technol & Educ, Sch Management Technol, Cheonan Si, Chungcheongnam, South Korea.",b.kim@koreatech.ac.kr,,"Seo, Inseok/0000-0003-2079-3856; Jung, Hyejin/0000-0002-5880-0137; Kim, Byung-Keun/0000-0002-6238-0569",National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A5B8061859],National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government,This work was supported by a National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A5B8061859].,,66,10,10,2,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

(i) Brand awareness, brand association, and the perceived quality have significant positive influences on brand involvement. (ii) Brand involvement has a significant positive impact on brand value. (iii) Brand involvement has a mediating effect on the relationships, which brand awareness, brand association, and perceived quality influence on brand value. Finally, the present study provides targeted marketing advice for brand building in the field of dragon boat racing, and for promoting the rapid development of the dragon boat race industry in China.","[Lin, Lung-Chi] Dhurakij Pundit Univ, China ASEAN Int Coll, Art Design, Bangkok, Thailand; [He, Peng-Fei] Dhurakij Pundit Univ, China ASEAN Int Coll, Bangkok, Thailand",,"Lin, LC (通讯作者)，Dhurakij Pundit Univ, China ASEAN Int Coll, Art Design, Bangkok, Thailand.",lung-chi.lin@dpu.ac.th,,,,,,,12,0,0,1,12,VOLKSON PRESS,KUALA LUMPUR,"C-3A-15 CENTRIO PANTAI HILLPARK, JALAN PANTAI MURNI, BANGSAR SOUTH,, KUALA LUMPUR, WILAYAH PERSEKUTUAN KUALA LUMPUR 59200, MALAYSIA",,,978-1-948012-02-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,136,138,,10.26480/icemi.01.2017.136.138,0.0,,,3,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM2GZ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000461012100049,0

Therefore, companies' communication policies must be based on an environmentally compatible distribution, environmentally compatible production and environmentally compatible products. Because of this, appropriate systems have to be implemented within the company in order to be able to influence the environmental effects. This can be done with the implementation of an environmental management system. The systematic environmental management was also introduced in Europe in 1988.

The purpose of this cross-cultural study is to identify to to what extent the cultural factor influences the attitude towards work and what and if there are the common characteristics of young employees that cross over cultural boundaries. For this purpose, an intercultural study on work attitude was conducted in six countries: Hungary, India, Italy, Netherlands, Romania, and Sweden. A part of the study was discusses in depth in a previous paper, so, within this paper we will mainly focus on the similarities and differences between the young generations of the six countries.

On the other hand, there is no consensus about which model would be the most appropriate and easy to use for the estimation of cost of equity in emerging markets. The aim of this research is to analyze on the basis of Estrada's work (2000; 2007) four different risk measures based on standard deviation, beta, downside risk and downside beta, as well as corresponding asset pricing models for capital markets of Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia in order to determine the most appropriate asset pricing model and to estimate the costs of equity for selected markets. It should be pointed out that asset pricing research in general is scarce for selected markets and that similar research was not done for them. Results of the research show that for total selected market the most appropriate risk measure out of four proposed is downside risk, while the model that best explains full sample mean returns contains combination of downside risk and downside beta. Results of the research favor downside risk measure for each selected market. When considering multiple regressions with the highest explanatory power for each selected market, results show that all multiple regressions contain downside risk as a risk variable and beta or downside beta as additional systematic risk variable, indicating one more time importance of downside risk for Slovenian, Croatian and Serbian capital markets. The results show that the average cost of equity estimated on the basis of asset pricing model with downside risk as a risk measure amounts to 20.16% for full sample. The results also indicate that Serbia has the highest cost of equity and that the cost of equity for Slovenian and Croatian capital markets is lower and rather similar.","[Momcilovic, Mirela; Zivkov, Dejan; Begovic, Sanja Vlaovic] Univ Novi Sad, Business Sch, Dept Finance, Novi Sad, Serbia",University of Novi Sad,"Momcilovic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Business Sch, Dept Finance, Novi Sad, Serbia.",bizniscentar@gmail.com; deja.zivkov@vps.ns.ac.rs; sanja.vbegovic@vps.ns.ac.rs,,,,,,,38,3,3,2,4,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Due to its complexity and different perceptions, it has not been uniquely defined yet and neither has its measurement system been completely developed. The problem of the conducted research arises from the fact that the countries mostly due to structural and other constraints in the economy (or in cases where they have high levels of GDP) do not use the available inputs in the best way, i.e. they do not achieve a satisfactory level of economic efficiency, which is then reflected on the competitiveness of their economies. The aim of the research paper is to demonstrate how a combination of using Data Envelopment Analysis Method (DEA) and the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) in ranking the countries according to the macroeconomic competitiveness is more realistic than it is in the case of using the traditional indicators. In the paper, in evaluating the competitiveness of selected EU Member States the Data Envelopment Analysis Method (DEA) is used. Based on the previous researches and our research results it is found that the traditional indicators of competitiveness are incomplete because they do not consider the macroeconomic efficiency of the country. Therefore, we propose to apply a combination of GCI and the efficiency results obtained by DEA in order to achieve a more realistic evaluation of macroeconomic competitiveness. As a key outcome of the research, the new measure of competitiveness is proposed: a combination of traditional competitiveness indicator and the results of the evaluation of countries' macroeconomic efficiency obtained by applying BCC model of DEA method.","[Segota, Alemka; Tomljanovic, Marko; Hudek, Ivona] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Segota, A (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",alemka.segota@efri.hr; marko.tomljanovic@efri.hr; ivona.hudjek@gmail.com,"Tomljanovic, Marko/Q-7047-2018","Tomljanovic, Marko/0000-0003-0394-7518",,,,,54,14,14,0,5,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

The model is aimed at divergent and sustained competitive performance, specifying measures for improving strategic management, rationalizing management functions and assessing influence of its results on SME competitiveness. The respective technique is proposed for enterprise efficiency evaluation in terms of strategic and functional management. As to prepare the proper strategy for SME restructuring the author have determined and hence recommend the regularities for strategic decisions making towards restructuring as well as the ones for the rational selection of restructuring techniques. When executing SME restructuring author proposes to use the complex set of measures determined in order to ensure the reasonable efficiency of functions of the enterprise as well as its products. In order to ensure rational management of restructuring the respective technique is also proposed to evaluate the efficiency of SME restructuring. This let as to evaluate the benefit of the executed changes within the enterprise as to identify the directions and actions needed to continue increasing the efficiency of the enterprise activity. Based on the outcome of empirical investigations of SME restructuring in the EU over the last decade, underlining its specifics and complexity, the paper reveals the benefit of use of the proposed model specifying all its phases to relevant techniques and actions. Results of its application in practice also confirm the prevailing flexibility when applying the model while characteristics of the complex of measures set under the latter can be adjusted to the specifics of SME and its business environment. While leading to greater possibilities to rationalize restructuring process, the model created by the author also provides an SME with prerequisites to improve the use and development of human, material and financial potentials with pivotal contribution to its sustained competitiveness even in a changing business environment.","[Tamosiunas, Andrius] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Business Management, Dept Social Econ & Management, Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Tamosiunas, A (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Business Management, Dept Social Econ & Management, Vilnius, Lithuania.",andrius.tamosiunas@vgtu.lt,,"Tamosiunas, Andrius/0000-0003-1521-0572",,,,,39,6,6,2,26,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

PCE management tools and methods currently used by households are not helpful either as rational distribution of funds among the purchases is usually out of their scope. Therefore, rational use of resources still remains a challenging task for many households. The goal of this study is to analyse the PCE management process in households and the obstacles preventing its efficiency. Methods used in the article comprise: comparative and critical analysis methods; vector analysis tools. The paper identifies shortcomings of currently used PCE management methods and tools and introduces a system of quantitative criteria enabling objective evaluation of consumption alternatives. The use of quantitative criteria limits the influence of subjective, non-economic factors on consumption-related resource management in households and can positively affect its efficiency. The criteria are justified theoretically and the benefits from their use demonstrated with some practical evidence.","[Taujanskaite, Kamile; Dobrovolskiene, Nomeda] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Finance Engn, Fac Business Management, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Milcius, Eugenijus] Kaunas Univ Technol, Ctr Packaging Innovat & Res, Fac Mech Engn & Design, K Donelaicio G 73, LT-44249 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Kaunas University of Technology,"Taujanskaite, K (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Finance Engn, Fac Business Management, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",kamile.taujanskaite@vgtu.lt; eugenijus.milcius@ktu.lt; nomeda.dobrovolskiene@vgtu.lt,,,,,,,62,1,1,1,12,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Providing a sense of success to a regular student is often a challenge, but giving the same feeling of achievement to a special needs student is especially difficult. It is a duty of the teacher to evoke trust in their students, to build up relations which foster cooperation, mutual understanding and make the student to work harder and more effectively not only for his/her own success, but also for the didactic success of their teacher. The issue of good relations is crucial.

By integrating dynamic capability theory and upper echelon theory, the present research discusses the role of DCAC and explores its main antecedents and consequences. Exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and hierarchical linear regression are conducted to analyze the data collected from 156 fashion enterprises. The results from qualitative interviews and quantitative analysis indicate that managerial cognition (MC) is a critical antecedent of DCAC. In addition, supply chain flexibility has a significantly positive moderating effect on the relationship between MC and DCAC. Further, DCAC primarily predicts firm performance.

Cash payments are measured as a share of total payments credited to bank accounts. By estimating an econometric model, we show that the levels of, respectively, income and financial deepening of Italian municipalities are negatively related to the use of cash, as predicted by the theory, whilst the latter is positively affected by the local intensity of criminal activity and money laundering. The analysis allows us to identify the Italian municipalities where the amount of cash transactions is farthest above what is explained by the local socioeconomic 'fundamentals'. In these municipalities one can observe the highest share of cash inflows explained by measures of local illegal activities. Based on the results, we provide territorial indicators of the risk associated to anomalous cash handling. The econometric findings, and the related distribution of money laundering provincial risk, are shown to be robust to different model specifications (cross-section GLM and linear fixed-effects panel). From the perspective of a Financial Intelligence Unit, the study has relevant operational implications: risk indicators help target on-site as well as off-site activities on riskiest municipalities. Judicial authorities and law enforcement agencies, too, could benefit in their activities from the geographical distribution of (cash-related) money laundering risk emerging from the methodology developed in this study.

Our hybrid methodology consists into two steps. The first step aims at modeling the conditional mean of the time series, using a generalized fractional model with k-factor of Gegenbauer termed the k-factor GARMA model; the parameters of this model are estimated using the wavelet approach based on the discrete wavelet packet transform (DWPT). The second step aims at estimating the conditional variance, so we adopt the local linear wavelet neural network (LLWNN) model. The proposed hybrid model is tested using the hourly log-returns of electricity spot price from the Nord Pool market. The empirical results were compared with the predictions of the ARFIMA-LLWNN, the k-factor GARMA-FIGARCH and the individual LLWNN models. It is shown that the proposed hybrid k-factor GARMA-LLWNN model outperforms all other competing methods. Hence it is a robust tool in forecasting time series.","[Ben Amor, Souhir; Boubaker, Heni; Belkacem, Lotfi] Inst High Commercial Studies Sousse IHEC, Res Lab Econ Management & Quantitat Finance LaREM, 40 Route Ceinture Sahloul 3, Sousse 4054, Tunisia; [Ben Amor, Souhir; Boubaker, Heni] Univ Sousse, Sousse, Tunisia; [Belkacem, Lotfi] Univ Sousse, Quantitat Methods, Sousse, Tunisia; [Belkacem, Lotfi] Univ Sousse, Lab Res Econ Management & Quantitat Finance LaREM, Inst High Commercial Studies IHEC, Sousse, Tunisia; [Boubaker, Heni] IPAG Business Sch, IPAG LAB, F-75006 Paris, France",Universite de Sousse; Universite de Sousse; Universite de Sousse; IPAG Business School,"Ben Amor, S (通讯作者)，Inst High Commercial Studies Sousse IHEC, Res Lab Econ Management & Quantitat Finance LaREM, 40 Route Ceinture Sahloul 3, Sousse 4054, Tunisia.",souhirbenamor@live.fr,"Belkacem, Lotfi/AAT-7998-2020",,,,,,52,8,8,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

The Oslo Intercity Regional Model, comprising roughly 43 per cent of Norway's five million population, was used to study short distance trips in southeastern Norway, i.e. in and around the capital city of Oslo. The NTM6 model for domestic, long distance travel was used to analyze domestic trips longer than 70 km one way. Both of these are network models of travel demand, predicting car ownership, trip frequency, destination choice, mode choice and route choice under user specified input assumptions. The following three policy options have been studied: (i) tripled toll rates and ferry fares everywhere in Norway, (ii) a NOK 0.20 (= (sic) 0.024) per vehicle km road charge or equivalently higher fuel tax, and (iii) abolishment of the commuter tax credit, which in 2014 amounted to roughly (sic) 0.05 per km for long-distance commuters. By design, these three policy options give rise to similar reductions in CO2 emissions from travel. While option (i) turns out to be highly inefficient, options (ii) and (iii) appear, in a partial travel demand analysis, to be welfare increasing even before CO2 abatement benefits. However, when the policy options are ordered according to their equity effects, the ranking becomes completely reversed. The abolishment of the commuter tax credit appears to hit people in low income neighbourhoods five to fifteen times harder than those living in high income zones. The fuel tax increase gives rise to corresponding inequity ratios between three and seven. The main explanation is that residents of remote, low income areas generally sustain longer commutes, and also to a larger extent depend on their cars for commuting than do workers in densely populated urban or suburban districts.","[Steinsland, Christian; Fridstrom, Lasse; Madslien, Anne; Minken, Harald] Inst Transport Econ TOI, Gaustadalleen 21, NO-0349 Oslo, Norway",Institute of Transport Economics,"Fridstrom, L (通讯作者)，Inst Transport Econ TOI, Gaustadalleen 21, NO-0349 Oslo, Norway.",lef@toi.no,,"Fridstrom, Lasse/0000-0001-9205-7992",BISEK -a Swedish Norwegian research programme on the social and economic significance of the private car [TRV 2015/7976],BISEK -a Swedish Norwegian research programme on the social and economic significance of the private car,"This research was funded primarily through BISEK -a Swedish Norwegian research programme (TRV 2015/7976) on the social and economic significance of the private car.

To do so, we specify an econometric model where the representative consumer chooses the utility maximizing alternative among the differentiated products offered by the airlines which compete in terms of prices. It is a fairly reasonable and well accepted representation of the competition in the airline industry, assuming that the structure of their networks is given in the short run. The present solidarity tax has increased the average price for the European airlines by only 0.08% and could increase average prices by 1% if it were applied to all European airlines. Implemented by all countries it would lead to a 0.17% increase in Air France prices while the price increase would be 1.05% for the other airlines in our sample. These numbers compared to the growth rate of the air traffic show that the impact of the solidarity tax would be very small. Overall the air ticket levy applied by all European airlines would not affect significantly the degree of competition among airlines.","[Ivaldi, Marc] Toulouse Sch Econ, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31015 Toulouse 6, France; [Toru-Delibasi, Tuba] Bahcesehir Univ, Ciragan Caddesi Osmanpasa Mektebi Sokak 4-6, TR-34353 Istanbul, Turkey",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Bahcesehir University,"Ivaldi, M (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31015 Toulouse 6, France.",marc.ivaldi@tse-fr.eu; tuba.toru@eas.bahcesehir.edu.tr,"Delibasi, Tuba Toru/R-5213-2018","Toru Delibasi, Tuba/0000-0001-7417-7798",World Health Organization,World Health Organization(World Health Organization),The authors wish to thank the World Health Organization for financial support.

The aim of this paper is the specification and estimation of models that simulate users' behaviour when they are choosing among parking alternatives in the city: free on street parking, paid on street parking, paid on underground parking and Park and Ride (not currently available). For this purpose, we propose a multinomial logit model that consider systematic and random variations in tastes. Data of users' behaviour from the different alternatives of parking have been obtained with a stated preference surveys campaign which have been done in May 2015 in the principal parking zones of the city of Santander.

Do EMNEs' absorptive capacity and status positively moderate the relationship between their post-deal innovative output and the innovative capacity of the target firm and/or region? We explore these questions by analyzing the universe of cross-border acquisitions accomplished by Chinese and Indian medium to high-tech firms in Europe (EU28) and the USA during 2003-2011. We find that EMNEs benefit from investing in regions with higher innovative capacities, with the exception of the most innovative hubs where post-acquisition impacts on EMNEs' innovative outputs turn out to be less straightforward than we expected. We also observe that EMNEs are often unable to benefit from innovative target firms, which is also in contrast with our predictions. Hence, we do not find conclusive evidence about the positive impact of EMNEs' investments in developed countries. Rather, we reverse this perspective and argue that it is not just a matter of how innovative the target actors are in the host country, but of whether the investing EMNEs are able to mobilize these actors' knowledge resources and interests to their own advantage. Only EMNEs with strong knowledge bases and high status standing can make it, the rest remain stranded, no matter how innovative their target firm or location is.","[Amendolagine, Vito] Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Sci Polit & Sociali, Corso Str Nuova 65, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Giuliani, Elisa] Univ Pisa, Dept Econ & Management, Via Ridolfi 10, I-56124 Pisa, Italy; [Martinelli, Arianna] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Piazza Martini della Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy; [Rabellotti, Roberta] Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Sci Polit & Sociali, Str Nuova 65, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Rabellotti, Roberta] Aalborg Univ, Dept Business & Management, Frederikskaj 10B, DK-2450 Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Pavia; University of Pisa; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; University of Pavia; Aalborg University,"Giuliani, E (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, Dept Econ & Management, Via Ridolfi 10, I-56124 Pisa, Italy.",elisa.giuliani@unipi.it,"Rabellotti, Roberta/AAX-1086-2020","Rabellotti, Roberta/0000-0001-7637-3645; MARTINELLI, Arianna/0000-0002-5425-1038; Giuliani, Elisa/0000-0002-3813-1861; Amendolagine, Vito/0000-0002-5699-5233",Riksbankens Jubileumsfond-Sweden; Aalborg University AAU grant [771107]; University of Pisa (PRA) [2015_082],Riksbankens Jubileumsfond-Sweden; Aalborg University AAU grant; University of Pisa (PRA),"The authors would like to thank the editors and three anonymous referees for very useful comments on earlier drafts of this manuscript.

In a unique development case of the Dutch railway sector two decision-making processes regarding the same issue are performed in two consecutive years. Although, from a technical perspective, the elements of the processes are similar, the decisions in each year are different. In this paper, we use game concepts to explain the different outcomes. Other frequently adopted decision-based models that focus on the technical perspective do not distinguish between both processes. Game concepts are able to reveal the hidden actor and context dynamics of the process and provide action perspective. To identify the game concepts present in the decision-making process, we first consider whether these concepts are mentioned in interviews with decision-makers in our case. Thereafter, we interpret the processes using the identified game concepts. The fact that, in the second year, more external issues are discussed and pressure increased created room for another decision.","[Bekius, Femke; Meijer, Sebastiaan; de Bruijn, Hans] Delft Univ Technol, Jaffalaan 5, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands; [Meijer, Sebastiaan] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Halsovagen 11C, Stockholm, Sweden",Delft University of Technology; Royal Institute of Technology,"Bekius, F (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, Jaffalaan 5, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands.",f.a.bekius@tudelft.nl; Sebastiaan.Meijer@tudelft.nl; J.A.deBruijn@tudelft.nl,"Meijer, Sebastiaan/E-8283-2011","Meijer, Sebastiaan/0000-0003-1126-3781",Delft University of Technology,Delft University of Technology,"We especially thank the reviewers for their valuable contributions and their inputs have very much helped to improve the paper.

New research has added a further dimension to the social impact of transport, the value that may be added in rural communities. This relates to the leadership role adopted by some bus operators, and their willingness to support the good functioning and vibrancy of their local communities, with important social and economic outcomes that should be included in both CBA evaluations and taken into account in bus service contracts. The authors argue that it is important that these wider benefits are taken into account in transport evaluations, broadening the potential value to both encompass social and associated economic outcomes.","[Lowe, Chris] Bus Assoc Victoria, 450 Graham St, Melbourne, Vic 3207, Australia; [Stanley, John] Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Inst Transport & Logist Studies C13, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Stanley, Janet] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Sydney; University of Melbourne,"Lowe, C (通讯作者)，Bus Assoc Victoria, 450 Graham St, Melbourne, Vic 3207, Australia.",clowe@busvic.asn.au; j.stan@bigpond.net.au; janet.stanley@unimelb.edu.au,,"Lowe, Christopher/0000-0002-2971-896X",,,,,38,6,6,0,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

This paper details the historical and current state of the carrying of bicycles on buses in some local and international jurisdictions and suggests two theories that underpin the initiative, being agency theory and the stakeholder perspective. It is expected the results will aid in the decision making associated with the greater proliferation of bicycle racks on buses. This paper extends the hypothesis of agency theory with two agents and presents a case study exemplar for other VPAs (or industry representative bodies) looking at developing industry-wide responses to societal issues.","[Lowe, Christopher] Bus Assoc Victoria Inc, 450Graham St, Port Melbourne, Vic 3207, Australia; [Wright, Robert] MorelandBus, 65 Colebrook St, Brunswick, Vic 3056, Australia",,"Lowe, C (通讯作者)，Bus Assoc Victoria Inc, 450Graham St, Port Melbourne, Vic 3207, Australia.",clowe@busvic.asn.au; rwright@morelandbus.com.au,,"Lowe, Christopher/0000-0002-2971-896X",,,,,15,2,2,0,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

The estimated equilibrium model is used to perform several counterfactual exercises that involve the sale to various buyers of parts of a firm's productive capacity-with and without synergies-instead of the sale of the whole firm to a single buyer, as is usually considered in the literature.

These companies have also increasingly pursued external assurance of their CSR disclosures in recent years. The increased regulation of CSR disclosure and the increased rate of obtaining assurance of these disclosures motivated us to perform our study. Aim: To examine the association between CSR reporting, including both CSR disclosure and CSR assurance, and firm value of large South African companies. Setting: The JSE listing requirements place South Africa, the setting for our study, at the forefront of corporate governance and CSR reporting. Method: Tobin's Q is used as a measure of firm value. Three measures of CSR disclosure and three of CSR assurance are used in this study. The measures are based on data collected by Klynveld Peat Marwick Goerdeler (KPMG) International on the CSR reporting practices of large South African companies. The sample period for this study coincides with the sample period covered in the KPMG surveys conducted during 2008, 2011 and 2013. Results: No significant association is found between CSR disclosure and firm value. However, a significant negative association is found between CSR assurance and firm value. Additional analysis found that the negative association between firm value and CSR assurance is more significant for companies that are not listed on the Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) index. Conclusion: The results found between CSR disclosure and firm value may suggest that firm value is unaffected by CSR disclosures. Taken together, the findings on CSR assurance and firm value and the additional analysis may suggest that in South Africa managers with negative CSR issues are more likely to obtain assurance on their CSR disclosure. The findings may be of interest to regulators when considering current and future disclosure and assurance requirements for CSR reporting in South Africa, as well as other parts of the world, shareholders when considering investment options, and managers when considering the benefit of certain CSR reporting practices.","[Horn, Riana] Univ South Africa, Dept Financial Accounting, Pretoria, South Africa; [de Klerk, Marna; de Villiers, Charl] Univ Pretoria, Dept Accounting, Pretoria, South Africa; [de Villiers, Charl] Univ Auckland, Grad Sch Management, Auckland, New Zealand",University of South Africa; University of Pretoria; University of Auckland,"Horn, R (通讯作者)，Univ South Africa, Dept Financial Accounting, Pretoria, South Africa.",hornrh@unisa.ac.za,"de Villiers, Charl/G-1334-2019","de Villiers, Charl/0000-0002-0715-8957",,,,,39,11,19,2,15,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The findings of this study, which applied a grounded theory approach of analysis, led to the development of a theoretical framework that displays the dynamic interrelationships between individuals' external and internal influences, and their roles in shaping individuals' travel mode behaviors and future mobility expectations. This framework also shows the complex process by which individuals evoke value negotiations and adjustments before arriving at their desirable choice of travel mode. Coping mechanisms or strategies are also innovated by commuters when the available mobility services are not perceived to meet their value expectations and needs for different commuting purposes. The variables constituting the external and internal influences of our theoretical model remind us that a typical transport user should be ideally considered and defined in light of some fundamental parameters. The findings of this study are expected to benefit policymakers in identifying and navigating potential barriers and drivers of change that could support the formulation of future transport policies and the adoption of transport technologies.","[Kurniawan, Jude Herijadi] Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog & Environm Management, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Ong, Corinne] Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Lee Kuan Yew Ctr Innovat Cities, 8 Somapah Rd, Singapore 487372, Singapore; [Cheah, Lynette] Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Engn Syst & Design, 8 Somapah Rd, Singapore 487372, Singapore",University of Waterloo; Singapore University of Technology & Design; Singapore University of Technology & Design,"Kurniawan, JH (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog & Environm Management, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",hkurniawan@uwaterloo.ca; corinne_ong@sutd.edu.sg; lynette@sutd.edu.sg,"Cheah, Lynette/AAY-2005-2020; Cheah, Lynette/ABB-1629-2020","Cheah, Lynette/0000-0001-6312-0331; Cheah, Lynette/0000-0001-6312-0331; Kurniawan, Jude Herijadi/0000-0001-5774-5845",Singapore Ministry of National Development; National Research Foundation under L2 NIC Award [RGL2NIC1402]; Energy Council of Canada; University of Waterloo Humanities and Social Sciences Endowment Fund,Singapore Ministry of National Development; National Research Foundation under L2 NIC Award; Energy Council of Canada; University of Waterloo Humanities and Social Sciences Endowment Fund,"This material is based on work supported in part by the Singapore Ministry of National Development and National Research Foundation under L2 NIC Award No. RGL2NIC1402.

Aim: This paper aimed to describe funding structures of companies in South Africa liable for tax and how this relates to other characteristics, including ownership, of the companies. Setting: The research was performed using data from tax returns submitted by companies liable for income tax in South Africa. Methods: This paper reports on descriptive analyses of the research conducted. Results: The results showed that the mean interest-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) ratio for certain foreign-owned entities differed significantly from that of domestically owned entities. Conclusion: The results may present evidence of profit-shifting activities. They also highlight trends in interest-to-EBITDA ratios that may be of relevance for future legislative developments.

However, left unanswered is whether it is rational for individuals to become team members, leaving a gap between reasons for individuals and reasons for team members. In what follows, I take up Susan Hurley's attempt to show that it is rational for an individual to become a team member. I argue that her account fails to show that becoming a team member is necessary to gain the advantages of coordination in Hi-Lo games or cooperation in Prisoner's Dilemma-type situations, and that individuals will often fare better reasoning as individual agents than as members of a team. I argue further that there is a more general problem for team reasoning, specifically that the conditions needed to make it rational for a team member to employ team reasoning make becoming a team member unnecessary.","[Browne, Katharine] Langara Coll, Dept Philosophy, 100 W 49th Ave, Vancouver, BC V5Y 2Z6, Canada",,"Browne, K (通讯作者)，Langara Coll, Dept Philosophy, 100 W 49th Ave, Vancouver, BC V5Y 2Z6, Canada.",kbrowne@langara.ca,,,Research Council of Norway through its Centres of Excellence [179566/V20]; Francoise Baylis' Canada Research Chair in Bioethics and Philosophy at Dalhousie University,Research Council of Norway through its Centres of Excellence(Research Council of Norway); Francoise Baylis' Canada Research Chair in Bioethics and Philosophy at Dalhousie University,"This work was supported in part by the Research Council of Norway through its Centres of Excellence funding scheme, project number 179566/V20, and by Francoise Baylis' Canada Research Chair in Bioethics and Philosophy at Dalhousie University.",,20,4,4,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

Environmental concerns, included in broader neoliberal frameworks of governance, play a central role in the performance of such scales. Thus, this case shows some of the patterns of relations between scalarity and the management of key ecological features. Additionally, territorial governance and scalar production occur in a geographical context over which the State has low effective degree of direct control.

Fifteen food-labeling governance actors in Australia and New Zealand were asked to view an online presentation of the findings from a previous study exploring consumer perspectives on food labeling and trust before completing a one-hour, in-depth, semi-structured interview. Colebatch's social constructionist perspective on policy was adopted in the analysis. Participants used their own constructions of Australian food policy, the role of labeling and consumer trust as a means to minimize the consumer concerns. Inadequate critical engagement with the moral dimension of consumer concerns is a core driver of the inertia demonstrated in the Australian government's approach to addressing consumer concerns regarding food matters.","[Tonkin, Emma; Coveney, John; Wilson, Annabelle M.] Flinders Univ South Australia, Discipline Publ Hlth, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Meyer, Samantha B.] Univ Waterloo, Sch Publ Hlth & Hlth Syst, Waterloo, ON, Canada",Flinders University South Australia; University of Waterloo,"Tonkin, E (通讯作者)，Flinders Univ South Australia, Discipline Publ Hlth, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",emma.tonkin@flinders.edu.au; John.coveney@flinders.edu.au; trevor.webb@foodstandards.gov.au; annabelle.wilson@flinders.edu.au; samantha.meyer@uwaterloo.ca,"Wilson, Annabelle M/S-1482-2018","Tonkin, Emma/0000-0001-9941-4251",,,,,41,7,7,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

Firms have imperfect cumulative evidence of the collusion. That is, cartel conviction is not automatic if one firm reports. Reporting makes conviction only more likely: the more that firms report, the more likely is conviction. Furthermore, the evidence is distributed asymmetrically among firms. This set-up allows us meaningfully to analyze three typical features of leniency programs: minimum-evidence standards; ringleader discrimination; and marker systems. Minimum-evidence standards provide high-evidence firms with proper incentives to report. They are better at deterring than is ringleader discrimination. Under a marker system only one firm reports so that the antitrust authority never gets the entire available evidence. Appropriate minimum-evidence standards make a marker system redundant.","[Blatter, Marc] Univ Bern, Swiss Natl Bank, Bern, Switzerland; [Emons, Winand] Univ Bern, Dept Volkswirtschaftslehre, Swiss Competit Commiss, CEPR, Schanzeneckstr 1,Postfach 8573, CH-3001 Bern, Switzerland; [Sticher, Silvio] Swiss Fed Railways, Bern, Switzerland",Swiss National Bank (SNB); University of Bern; University of Bern,"Emons, W (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, Dept Volkswirtschaftslehre, Swiss Competit Commiss, CEPR, Schanzeneckstr 1,Postfach 8573, CH-3001 Bern, Switzerland.",marc.blatter@vwi.unibe.ch; winand.emons@vwi.unibe.ch; silvio.sticher@sbb.ch,,"Emons, Winand/0000-0002-0649-0704",,,,,27,9,9,2,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

We show that inequality increased substantially between 1977 and 1992, and that partner-associate ratios changed in ways consistent with the hypothesis that coordination costs fell during this period. We then propose a hierarchical production function and estimate its parameters in each period. We find that coordination costs fell over time, so that hiring one's first associate leveraged a partner's skill by about 30% more in 1992 than 1977. We find also that changes in lawyers' hierarchical organization account for about two-third of the increase in earnings inequality among lawyers in the upper tail, but much less of the increase between lawyers in the upper tail and other lawyers.

Prior to the riot, the Greenwood community was among the wealthiest African-American neighborhoods in the state. Residents of Greenwood had successfully developed their own business infrastructure, and by the early 1920s the neighborhood was rapidly expanding and flourishing economically. The attack by white citizens on a flourishing black neighborhood not only resulted in mass casualties, but it destroyed nearly all of the African-American-owned businesses and churches, as well as many residential properties. The economic prosperity of Greenwood was literally obliterated overnight. The Greenwood community was perceived as a threat to white hegemony. The riot and its aftermath served to effectively impede African-American prosperity. The city of Tulsa provided very little monetary assistance following the event. Greenwood residents attempted to rebuild following the destruction, but the community never regained the same economic standing. We argue that the Tulsa riot of 1921 was one of many examples of racial violence during the early part of the 20(th) century that had long-lasting economic and social legacies for African Americans.","[Messer, Chris M.] Colorado State Univ Pueblo, Sociol, Pueblo, CO 81001 USA; [Shriver, Thomas E.] North Carolina State Univ, Sociol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Adams, Alison E.] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",Colorado State University; North Carolina State University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Messer, CM (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ Pueblo, Sociol, Pueblo, CO 81001 USA.",chris.messer@csupueblo.edu; tom_shriver@ncsu.edu; alison.adams@ufl.edu,,"Shriver, Thomas/0000-0002-4868-6449",,,,,67,17,43,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

J,"Zondo, RWD",,,,"Zondo, Robert W. D.",,,The impact of gainsharing in the automotive parts manufacturing industry of South Africa,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The majority of South Africans expect greater prosperity that can be accomplished through greater employment, high productivity and wage increases. Increased productivity can finance higher wages without burdening the customer with higher selling prices. Consequently, there should be strong co-operation between management and labour to improve productivity, thereby ensuring the survival of South African companies. To achieve this objective, organisations find themselves turning to their employees for creative suggestions and ideas on better ways of doing things. This sentiment underpins the concept of gainsharing. Gainsharing is a formula-based company-wide programme that offers employees a share in the financial gains of a company as a result of its improved performance. This motivation boosts a company's productivity and radically reduces the cost of waste, spoilage, rejects and rework. This study examined the impact of a gainsharing programme on the improvement of labour productivity in the automotive parts manufacturing sector. The study investigated the production and related experience of two automotive parts manufacturing companies (referred to as A and B in this study) that have adopted a gainsharing strategy. The two companies operate in the eThekwini District Municipality in KwaZulu-Natal. It assessed if gainsharing is responsible for company labour productivity improvements. The investigation was achieved by collecting pre- and post-gainsharing quarterly data for spoilage, absenteeism, capital investment and labour productivity. Gainsharing improves labour productivity and reduces spoilage and absenteeism rates. In order to maximise performance, a comprehensive performance policy must be developed, which aligns pay (and other incentives) to performance. The study uncovered the strengths and weaknesses of gainsharing for labour productivity improvement in South Africa.","[Zondo, Robert W.

A review from 1985 to 2016,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,,,English,Review,,,,,,,UNIT-ROOT; COINTEGRATION; INFORMATION,"Background: The ability of the Baltic Dry Index to predict economic activity has been evaluated in a number of developed and developing countries. Aim: Firstly, the article determines the primary factors driving the dynamics of the Baltic Dry Index (BDI) and, secondly, whether the BDI can predict future share price reactions on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange All Share Index (JSE ALSI), South Africa. Setting: This article investigates the dynamics and predictive properties of the BDI in South Africa between 1985 and 2016. Methods: The article uses a review of a wide range of published data and two time-series data sets to adopt a mixed methods approach. An inductive contents analysis is used to answer the first research question and a combination of a unit root test, correlation analysis and a Granger causality model is employed to test the second research question. Results: The results show that the BDI price is primarily driven by four underlying constructs that include the supply and demand for dry bulk shipping, as well as risk, cost and logistics management factors. Secondly, the results indicate a break in the BDI data set in July 2008 that influences a fundamental change in its relationship with the JSE ALSI index. In the pre-break period (1985 to 2008), the BDI is positively correlated with the ALSI (0.837, alpha = 0.05) before sharply diverging in the second period from August 2008 to 2016. In the first period, the BDI showed an optimal lag period of 6 months as a predictor of the ALSI index, but this predictive ability ceases after July 2008. The article makes a two-part contribution. Firstly, it demonstrates that the BDI is a useful predictor of future economic activity in an African developing country. Secondly, the BDI can be incorporated in government and industry sector planning models as a variable to assess future gross domestic product trends. Conclusion: The study confirms that the BDI is only a reliable indicator of future economic activity when the supply of shipping capacity is well matched with the demand.","[Sartorius, Kurt] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Accounting, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Sartorius, Benn] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Publ Hlth, Durban, South Africa; [Zuccollo, Dino] Westbrooke Alternat Asset Management, Sandton, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand; University of Kwazulu Natal,"Sartorius, K (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Accounting, Johannesburg, South Africa.",Kurt.Sartorius@wits.ac.za,,", bennsartorius/0000-0001-6761-2325; sartorius, kurt/0000-0002-8912-9059",National Research Foundation,National Research Foundation,This study was funded by the National Research Foundation.,,38,2,3,3,16,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

We exploit the variation in access to the program generated by date of birth and the variation in resources between various districts of the country. We find that an increase in schooling, triggered by the program, has an impact on women's attitudes toward matters that impact women's health and on attitudes regarding violence against women. An increase in education reduces the number of desired children by women and increases their propensity to use modern contraception and to be tested for AIDS. While education makes women more intolerant of practices that conflict with their well-being, increased education has no impact on men's attitudes toward women's well-being. Thus, it is unclear whether the change in attitudes would translate into behavioral changes. Consistent with this finding, education (on this margin) has no impact on women's propensity to get married, their age at first marriage or age at first birth.","[Cannonier, Colin] Belmont Univ, Nashville, TN USA; [Mocan, Naci] Louisiana State Univ, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Mocan, Naci] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Mocan, Naci] IZA, Durham, NC USA",Belmont University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Mocan, N (通讯作者)，Louisiana State Univ, EJ Ourso Coll Business, Dept Econ, 3039 Business Educ Complex, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",mocan@lsu.edu,"Cannonier, Colin/JUV-7093-2023","Cannonier, Colin/0000-0001-8884-5785",,,,,48,16,21,0,19,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",2054-0892,2054-0906,,J DEMOGR ECON,J.Demogr.

Even if a strong nondelegation doctrine provides legislators an incentive to draft narrow statutes, they would have many reasons to persist in broad delegations, and it is not clear whether the doctrinal incentives predominate. Here, I examine the relationship between the nondelegation doctrine and lawmaking behavior at the state level using several novel datasets, including a collection of state session laws between 1990 and 2010, and a comprehensive survey of state nondelegation judicial decisions over the last 20 years. Contrary to the common assumption, I find that the robustness of the nondelegation doctrine appears essentially unrelated to legislative drafting practices. This pattern suggests the limited extent to which judicial doctrine can control legislative practices; it also suggests a revived nondelegation doctrine at the federal level is unlikely to effectuate the hopes of proponents or the fears of opponents.","[Stiglitz, Edward H.] Cornell Law Sch, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Stiglitz, EH (通讯作者)，Cornell Law Sch, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",js2758@cornell.edu,,,,,,,46,11,12,0,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

The term buyout refers to the fact that these games allow skipping the auction by paying a price. The ongoing research suggests that high consideration needs to be put on the road design before developing a game-theoretic model. It also suggests that from an operations point of view, if a buyout lottery system can be implemented successfully, then its conversion to a buyout auction system becomes straightforward. Therefore, this paper aims at: (1) testing a buyout lottery-based metering (LBM) system in a real case scenario, and (2) introducing a game-theoretic model that recommends to its users the strategy to adopt when deciding between paying the toll or playing the lottery. This paper introduces a microsimulation model of an LBM system that is applied to the city of Minneapolis. This model is then used to evaluate the system's congestion and revenue effects, always assuming that drivers adopt what is referred as the safest strategy. hi the evaluation, a set of most likely lottery scenarios is also obtained. Finally, a game-theoretic model is introduced for obtaining the best strategy. This strategy is compared with the safest strategy, in the context of the most likely lottery scenarios. The results from the microsimulation model suggest that the LBM system reduces congestion significantly and increases revenue. The best strategy obtained from the game-theoretic model presents challenges for its calculation. But in the context of the most likely scenarios, this paper suggests that drivers should adopt the safest strategy.

Previous studies have identified the need for more proactive management practices in this domain as shrewd strategies can be a key differential for advancement. However, there are few practical guides available to managers to help them improve their performance. This paper addresses this deficit and expands the discussion on subsidiary role development practices in terms of selection and evaluation. We present an explanatory framework which comprises an integrated suite of strategic options derived from the extant literature. From this analysis, an instrument that allows decision makers to assess their company against best practice was developed and tested. Findings from our study reveal that the instrument or audit tool is an accurate, reliable and valid mechanism to measure a subsidiary's role development strategies. Our research contributes to an advancement of the debate in subsidiary role development. Furthermore, the development of a practical and innovative tool for managers bridges the gap from theory to practice.","[Corry, Sinead; Cormican, Kathryn] Natl Univ Ireland, Coll Engn & Informat, Galway, Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway,"Cormican, K (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.",Kathryn.Cormican@nuigalway.ie,"Cormican, Kathryn/AAE-7274-2022","Cormican, Kathryn/0000-0003-1688-1087",,,,,56,0,0,0,1,UNIV MINHO,GUIMARAES,"CAMPUS AZUREM, GUIMARAES, 4800-058, PORTUGAL",2183-3974,,978-989-97050-8-1,ICOPEV INT C PROJ EC,,,2018,,,,,,,192,198,,,,,,7,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BN0TO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000473533800032,0

The conclusions of the study underline that, in order to sustain the economic growth, Romania needs to increase its human capital stock, especially that related to the secondary education, to reduce pollution and waste, and to raise the level of the social inclusion. This last aspect could be achieved through adequate policies and active re-qualification measures meant to reduce unemployment, poverty and wage inequalities.","[Diaconu (Maxim), Laura] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Econ & Int Business, Carol I Ave 22, Iasi 700505, Romania; [Maxim, Andrei] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Management Mkt & Business Adm, Carol I Ave 22, Iasi 700505, Romania; [Dornean, Adina] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Finance Money & Publ Adm, Carol I Ave 22, Iasi 700505, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University; Alexandru Ioan Cuza University; Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Diaconu, L (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Econ & Int Business, Carol I Ave 22, Iasi 700505, Romania.",laura.diaconu@feaa.uaic.ro; andrei.maxim@feaa.uaic.ro; amartin@uaic.ro,"Dornean, Adina/H-7626-2019","Dornean, Adina/0000-0002-8009-4961",,,,,75,5,5,0,10,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Arguments based on national rationality, forming the basis for shaping the protectionist trade policy, appeared even in the case of the biggest advocates of free trade and were often prioritised over arguments based on global rationality. This was especially true in times of worse economic conditions in the global economy. The scientific goal of the article is, based on the theoretical achievements, justification for the use of protectionism tools in contemporary trade policy in countries with various levels of economic development. Strategic trade policy and new industrial policy are the concepts of modern trade policy that emerged in connection with the globalisation of the management process, growing competition from emerging economies and the global economic crisis of 2007/2008+. On the basis of the conducted research, it can be stated that virtually every country supported or supports fledgling industries and the development of industries considered to be modern. The choice of protectionist policy tools depends on the level of economic development and the degree of government involvement in the implemented development policy.","[Drelich-Skulska, Boguslawa; Domiter, Malgorzata] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Econ Sci, Dept Int Econ Relat, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Drelich-Skulska, B (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Econ Sci, Dept Int Econ Relat, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",boguslawa.drelich-skulska@ue.wroc.pl; malgorzata.domiter@ue.wroc.pl,"Drelich - Skulska, Boguslawa/P-4518-2018","Drelich - Skulska, Boguslawa/0000-0003-0233-1850",,,,,46,1,1,2,11,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Although prior literature has argued that perceived desirability and perceived feasibility are the two main antecedents of the intentional behavior of entrepreneurs, little is known about the antecedents of the intentional behavior of business angels. We address this gap by linking the role of regulatory focus and entrepreneurial alertness to the formation of investment intentions. We begin by collecting qualitative data via semi-structured interviews with business angels to gain a broad perspective on business angels' intentional behavior, their goals, planning activities and several characteristics related to cognition. We collected survey data from an international sample of business angels to find that entrepreneurial alertness with its scanning and search dimension plays an important role in intentionality. Furthermore, business angels that have promotion regulatory focus are more likely to form investment intentions.","[Drnovsek, Mateja; Slavec, Alenka] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Acad Unit Entrepreneurship, Kardeljeva Pl 17, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Franic, Sanda] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Kardeljeva Pl 17, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana; University of Ljubljana,"Drnovsek, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Acad Unit Entrepreneurship, Kardeljeva Pl 17, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",mateja.drnovsek@ef.uni-lj.si; sanda.franic@mst-intersped.hr; alenka.slavec@ef.uni-lj.si,"Drnovšek, Mateja/AAQ-1716-2020",,,,,,80,3,3,4,24,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

Actually, there are many studies in the economic literature about determining the factors affecting labor productivity. At this point, this study aims to investigate the relationship between labor productivity and government educational expenditure by using the data covering the period of 1971-2015 for Turkey. To this aim, it is applied linear and non-linear autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL). By using the bound testing approach, the long run relationship between variables has been investigated. Both models have been applied to determine whether the relationship between variables is linear or nonlinear. An asymmetric relationship between labor productivity and government educational expenditure was determined. For this reason, nonlinear model is preferred. The empirical findings indicate that positive changes in educational expenditure has negative effect on labor productivity and negative changes in educational expenditure has positive effect on labor productivity. The long run coefficient of openness is significantly positive; the short run coefficient of it is significantly negative for all lags. On the other hand, the effect of GDP growth on the labor productivity is significantly positive in both short and long run. While the effect of average annual labor worked hours is significantly negative for the first two lags, it is significantly positive the last two lags in short run, it is positive but not significant in long run.","[Durmaz, Atakan] Bayburt Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Econ, TR-69000 Bayburt, Turkey; [Pabuccu, Hakan] Bayburt Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Business, TR-69000 Bayburt, Turkey",Bayburt University; Bayburt University,"Durmaz, A (通讯作者)，Bayburt Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Econ, TR-69000 Bayburt, Turkey.",adurmaz@bayburt.edu.tr; hpabuccu@bayburt.edu.tr,"pabuçcu, hakan/AAH-6964-2019",,,,,,38,1,1,1,8,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

One of the objectives of implementing regional autonomy and fiscal decentralization is to increase regional independence and reduce fiscal dependence on the central government. Increasing regional independence is very close to the ability of regions to manage their regional revenues and produce locally generated revenue and other sources. This management ability reflects regional financial performance.

If the transaction cost is lower, companies showed the tendency to target capital structure adjustment; when the cash flow is not enough to adjust the capital structure deviation part, companies showed deviation from the target capital structure. However, when the cash flow is more than capital structure deviation, state-owned and non-state-owned companies both show the tendency of excessive adjustment, whether excessive debt or insufficient liabilities. We further study the influence of financing constraints on capital structure adjustment. The results show that compared with non-state-owned companies, the capital structure adjustment of state-owned companies is significantly affected by financing constraints. On the contrary, financing constraints has no significant influence on non-state-owned companies.","[Gan, Lining; Wei, Pengzhen; Zheng, Xiaosong] Shanghai Univ, SHU UTS SILC Business Sch, 20 Cheng Zhong Rd, Shanghai 201899, Peoples R China; [Wang, Junqiu] East China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, 130Mei Rong Rd, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China",Shanghai University; East China University of Science & Technology,"Zheng, XS (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ, SHU UTS SILC Business Sch, 20 Cheng Zhong Rd, Shanghai 201899, Peoples R China.",ganlining@shu.edu.cn; 972589386@qq.com; ganlining100@163.com; xiaosong.zheng@shu.edu.cn,"Zheng, Xiaosong/AAN-7934-2021",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71602110],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research is funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (2016, Project No. 71602110).",,29,5,5,1,20,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

This has triggered a change in the set of skills that are required from workers, by putting stronger focus on problem-solving skills, creativity, socioemotional skills, functional literacy and technical skills related to the use of digital technologies. The effects of digitalization on the labor market and economic performances of a particular country in the future depend on the workforce adaptability, industrial and occupational structure, the skills mix, organization of work and current state of digitalization. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the degree of workforce skills adaptability in 30 European countries, using the OECD data on achievement in reading, math and science, as well as the data on digital competencies, inclusion in lifelong learning and subjective perception on ability to find a new job. Our results suggest positive relationship between adaptability and PISA results. Using the principal component analysis, cluster analysis and LCCA (latent class cluster analysis), we find that European countries can be grouped into three clusters, in terms of adaptability: high performing (North and Western Europe), medium performing (Central Europe and Baltics) and low performing (South and South-eastern Europe). For some countries, low levels of adaptability of the workforce can pose an important obstacle for future growth and development.","[Jandric, Maja; Randelovic, Sasa] Univ Belgrade, Fac Econ, Kamenicka 6, Belgrade 11000, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Jandric, M (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Fac Econ, Kamenicka 6, Belgrade 11000, Serbia.",maja@ekof.bg.ac.rs; randjelovic@ekof.bg.ac.rs,"Ranđelović, Saša/AAZ-6951-2020; Jandrić, Maja/E-2820-2019","Ranđelović, Saša/0000-0001-8445-9756; Jandric, Maja/0000-0002-7817-919X",,,,,26,11,14,4,32,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

The insolvency of the company is mostly evoked either by the internal reasons, including the influence of the strategic and/or operational business risks, or by the violation of the payment obligations by its business partners. The aim of this paper is to observe the impact of the specific factors, including firm's size and location, the age and the gender of the entrepreneur on the company's ability to manage the accounts payable and accounts receivable in a timely manner to avoid potential insolvency. A partial aim of the paper is focused on the identification to what extent the problems with the payment discipline of the customers influence the occurrence of insolvency of the company. The results are based on the survey carried out among 438 Slovak SMEs in 2016.

The main method for research is the generalization of the experience and benchmarking analysis of results. According to the study results, the majority of children, despite international requirements, are placed in these institutions because of poverty, difficult family circumstances and social insecurity of families. The institutions are isolated from the community, thus making it challenging to monitor the living conditions of children. Needs of an institution prevail over the needs of a child. The situation has been complicated by the fighting in eastern Ukraine: as a result, we can see a new socially vulnerable group emerging that includes crisis-affected and internally displaced children who are in need for the state care. However, the national decentralization reform considerably increases the chance of successful deinstitutionalization reform. Therefore, this subject needs more in-depth assessment.

MNE co-location in three Dutch science parks is examined in terms of the perceived importance of geographic, cognitive, social, organisational and institutional proximity dimensions. While all five proximity dimensions are found to play a role, organisational proximity emerged as the most important factor influencing MNE co-location in the Dutch science parks. This paper argues, in contrast to expectations for a high degree of relatedness and reinforcing effects between the five proximities, that an 'optimal' proximity constellation of low organisational proximity together with high social and cognitive proximity fosters MNE co-location in knowledge intensive clusters, such as science parks.","[le Duc, Niels] Buck Consultants Int, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [le Duc, Niels; Lindeque, Johan] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Business Sch, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Lindeque, Johan] Univ Appl Sci Northwestern Switzerland, FHNW Sch Business, Olten, Switzerland",University of Amsterdam; FHNW University of Applied Sciences & Arts Northwestern Switzerland,"Lindeque, J (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Business Sch, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Lindeque, J (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci Northwestern Switzerland, FHNW Sch Business, Olten, Switzerland.",johan.lindeque@fhnw.ch,"Lindeque, Johan P/G-5211-2013","Lindeque, Johan P/0000-0002-8303-2715; le Duc, Niels/0000-0001-7642-7447",,,,,98,9,9,1,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

However, the spatializing role of this and other legal regimes has not been explored in depth. Among the categories of goods whose production and circulation is shaped by information policy, geographic information is increasingly salient in the digital economy due to the strategic and economic value derived from its integration of location and context. This article explores the role of information policy regimes in spatially bounding, structuring, and regulating digital geographic information markets. This is conducted through a Polanyian economic geographic approach that contextualizes, integrates, and synthesizes two types of geographic information market formations, and focuses on the institutional dimension of information policy regimes. In developing this approach, the article argues that legal regimes (in this case information policy) are capable of spatializing markets by structuring, integrating, and delimiting the actions of states and other actors, such as private corporations and consumers, within particular jurisdictions. The empirical section of the article illustrates this argument by showing how three aspects of information policy-(1) intellectual property, (2) infrastructure, and (3) commercialization-shape specific configurations of digital geographic information markets within the various administrative scales in the European Union, a globally influential jurisdiction for information policy, and where a regional digital market is in the process of construction. The article concludes by arguing that a Polanyian economic geographic approach provides a solid basis with ample versatility to account for the necessary integration of a legal perspective into the analysis of new kinds of goods (such as digital geographic information) and the spatialities of their emerging market configurations.","[Leon, Luis F.

This market, following the polity transformations, was gradually changing into a private housing market, acting on the basis of free market economy. Households, which formed the demand party, were given the opportunity to accumulate the capital by purchasing real estate, while estate developers (the supply party) - in response to the existing demand - were able to satisfy their own expectations regarding the rates of return from invested capital. This mechanism enabled society to grow rich. The above-described development was disrupted because of the economic crisis. The global crisis of 2008 had a negative impact on the condition of the housing market which responded with a drop in prices and a decrease in estate developers' activity. The drop in the prices was caused by, among others, a more difficult access to financing purchases of real estates, whereas the developers' slack activity manifested itself in a smaller number of construction permits, a decrease in the value of building production or a lower number of the employed in construction industry. The present article aims to analyze the impact of the economic crisis on the housing market in European post-communist states and to measure the extent of it.

The purpose of this study is to determine the influence of messages in the media on the dynamics of the stock index and the formation, on the basis of the identified relations of methodological approaches to forecast price movements on the exchange. The basis of the study is the hypothesis of information markets, according to which a number of research hypotheses have been proposed to test the relation between media reports and the dynamics of the stock index (RTS, intraday timeframe, 1 minute). Criteria of the hypothesis are the correlation and ranges of its values, put in line with the level of information effectiveness. Correlation (according to K. Pearson) is determined between the sentiment of media reports and the index of the exchange (RTS). In addition, the correlation between the event index was assessed as an alternative, as an integral evaluation of the various characteristics of the multiplicative model and the exchange index (using the author's database of events, as a training sample for regression analysis in the formation of evaluation criteria for the target sample). As the results showed, the accuracy of determining the dependence of the dynamics of the exchange on messages in the media using the estimated signs of events is somewhat higher than the traditional one, which is explained by the universality of the lexicon used in assessing sentiment (Liu Hu and Vader methods). The use of the author's methodology made it possible to carry out estimates for the target sample in an automatic mode using the corresponding software product (Orange). The obtained results and the target sample, with appropriate modifications, can be used to solve an important scientific problem - improving the predictability of both the stock market and the financial market as a whole.","[Malyshenko, Kostyantyn Anatolievich; Malyshenko, Vadim Anatolievich; Anashkina, Marina Viktorovna] VI Vernadsky Crimean Fed Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Simferopol, Russia",VI Vernadsky Crimean Federal University,"Malyshenko, KA (通讯作者)，VI Vernadsky Crimean Fed Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Simferopol, Russia.",,"Kostyantyn, Malyshenko/I-3918-2016; Malyshenko, Vadim Anatoly/E-2114-2015","Kostyantyn, Malyshenko/0000-0002-3453-2836; Anashkina, Marina/0000-0003-1495-0632",,,,,18,1,1,1,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,1030,1044,,,,,,15,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553202008,0

The aim of this paper is to discuss and prioritize the key location determinants for successful selection of an optimal location for a business unit in the ICT industry. It emphasizes the importance of this concept in ICT sector today when the digitalization and big internet revolution occurs. The initial determinants were formed based on the literature review and evaluated through two rounds of the Delphi study among experts from ICT companies in Serbia. The second goal of the study was to reach a consensus about the relative importance of the agreed determinants. According to the obtained results using the AHP decision-making model, the priority in selecting a location for a business unit in the ICT industry is human resource availability, second is the political and economic environment, and the third is the competition. The paper finds that political and economic strategies start to play an important role in ICT market, as governments are getting more interested in this industry. The study confirmed that due to a shortage of labour supply and fierce competition in the ICT sector, the concept of location selection is an important success factor for sustainable growth and development of ICT organizations.","[Marinkovic, Sanja; Nikolic, Ilija; Rakicevic, Jovana] Univ Belgrade, Fac Org Sci, Jove Ilica 154, Belgrade 11000, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Marinkovic, S (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Fac Org Sci, Jove Ilica 154, Belgrade 11000, Serbia.",marinkovic.sanja@fon.bg.ac.rs; ilija89.n@gmail.com; jovana.rakicevic@fon.bg.ac.rs,"Marinkovic, Sanja/AAK-7295-2021; Rakicevic, Jovana/HGC-0105-2022","Marinkovic, Sanja/0000-0003-1359-033X; Rakicevic, Jovana/0000-0003-0477-193X",,,,,53,6,8,0,13,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

The purpose of this article is to describe the innovative technology for making managerial decisions based on the conflict-compromise methodology. The theoretical concepts of similarities and differences of the author's vision with the theory of Goldratt constraints are developed in the work, the emergence of contradictions and conflicts in the regional economic system as a consequence of the emergence of managerial dysfunctions is justified. As a method of leveling managerial dysfunctions, a local compromise between conflicting subjects is proposed as the only possible method for making quasi-optimal managerial decisions to achieve a balance of interests of stakeholders. The article is illustrated by two examples of the application of the methodology of conflict-compromise management. The first example is from the regional economy, namely: the causes of conflict and imbalance of economic interests at the micro, mezzo-and mega-levels are shown. The second example is from the insurance area where the contradictions that often lead to conflict arise between the insured and the insurer. In both cases, the conflict-compromise methodology demonstrates its effectiveness for making managerial decisions and smoothing negative situations.","[Masyuk, Natalya N.] Vladivostok State Univ Econ & Serv, Vladivostok, Russia; [Bushueva, Marina A.] Russian Univ Econ, Ivanovo Branch, Ivanovo, Russia; [Vasyukova, Lyudmila K.; Mosolova, Nina A.] Far Eastern Fed Univ, Vladivostok, Russia",Vladivostok State University of Economics & Services; Far Eastern Federal University,"Masyuk, NN (通讯作者)，Vladivostok State Univ Econ & Serv, Vladivostok, Russia.",masyukn@gmail.com; bush.mar@yandex.ru; vasyukova_ludmila@mail.ru; smirnova.na@dvfu.ru,"Masyuk, Natalya N/E-3887-2016; VASYUKOVA, LYUDMLA/AAA-4214-2022","Masuk, Natal'a/0000-0001-8055-8597",,,,,23,3,3,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,2839,2845,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553203088,0

Standardization is aimed at changing and supplementing national legislation, primarily constitutional, with the view of its unification. Regulatory force of international acts of such international organizations as the European Union, the CIS, the Eurasian Economic Union, etc. is embodied in acts that they adopt, but it depends on the founding states. When a state joins an international organization, it has to align its internal legislation with numerous international acts. This is particularly so if this organization has taken the path of reaching a closer union and interdependence of its members. Such process can result in quite significant intrusion into the sphere of internal competence. The author of this article analyses these standardization and transformation processes related to national constitutions and the EU law. The article illustrates ongoing tendencies in transformation processes in this sphere in Ireland, France, Germany and Russia. Standardization of national legislation by international intergovernmental organizations undoubtedly evidences gradual expansion of their powers. This process favorably impacts comprehensive development of the uniting states, facilitates formation of a strong society and civilization, improves legal regulation through the experience of other states and helps to fill in legal gaps and increase the quality of law enforcement. However, apart from positive qualities, integration has its negative sides. For example, legal dependence and enchainment of the states by the institutions and norms of intergovernmental associations are increased. Difficulties arise in the process of alignment of international and constitutional institutions. Problems of correlation of national and international legal acts, resolving differences, and smoother implementation of international norms within the framework of national legal systems, receive the first priority. It is for this reason that the author proposes an initiative to create model laws for member states of intergovernmental organizations aiming at implementation of acts of such organizations at the national level.","[Mokoseeva, Marina A.] Mari State Univ, Yoshkar Ola, Russia",Mari State University,"Mokoseeva, MA (通讯作者)，Mari State Univ, Yoshkar Ola, Russia.",pvl_mksv@mail.ru,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,7690,7695,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553208074,0

A crucial challenge for voluntary approaches is however to ensure private landowner involvement and get the ecosystem services delivered where they are most demanded by society. To promote participation and ensure an instrumental design of voluntary initiatives that is coherent with this, there is a need to understand the motivations of the landowners and determinants of their participation choice. We investigate landowners' willingness to participate in protecting oak scrub sites in Denmark. Combining contract data of the landowners' actual choices, GIS information on area specific characteristics and detailed individual level register data, we develop and implement a framework for analysing revealed choice of private landowners' in voluntary conservation programs. We find that both the physical characteristics of the property and the sociodemographic characteristics of landowner in question matter, along with the information flow provided from the regulator. Results provide impetus into the design of future conservation policies, in terms of how, to whom and where to target efforts.

Analysis of the scientific literature and research practice shows that at the moment the topic of corruption potential is not sufficiently developed, which leaves behind corruption of empirical research the manifestations of corruption important for effective anti-corruption struggle. In accordance with this, the goals are set - to define the essence, to examine the subjects and to clarify the methods of investigating the corruption potential as an independent phenomenon. The authors define the corruption potential as a set of hidden (unrealized) opportunities, using an interdisciplinary approach, to commit corruptive actions that exist at the subjective level and reflect the qualitative characteristics of the individual (social group) that can realize (can not realize) these opportunities in the presence and use of certain means and resources in appropriate conditions. A peculiarity of the developed approach to the definition of corruption potential is the disclosure of the duality of its existence, when, on the one hand, the previously accumulated potential is released through realized opportunities through participation in corruption relations. On the other hand, unrealized opportunities continue to latently exist, which, under appropriate conditions, can be embodied in actions. The concept of corruption potential contains references to certain carriers - its subjects, to which the individual, social group or society as a whole belong. The authors unite the subjects of corruption actions into a separate group with a real experience of participation in corruption relations, which reflects the realized corruption potential. The paper substantiates the need for a comprehensive study of the unrealized latent corruption potential with the help of sociological and psychological methods. It is proposed to analyze the data of official statistics and conduct additional sociological studies in the case of studying the realized potential. The authors develop integral and partial indices reflecting the level of corruption potential based on the index method. The practical importance of using index indicators in the fight against corruption is shown.","[Osipov, Gennadii; Karepova, Svetlana; Pinchuk, Antonina; Nekrassov, Sergey] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Sociopolit Res, Moscow, Russia; [Osipov, Gennadii] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Sociopolit Res, Philosophy, Moscow, Russia","Russian Academy of Sciences; Federal Center of Theoretical & Applied Sociology - FCTAS; Institute of Social & Political Studies, Russian Academy of Sciences (ISPR RAS); Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Sciences; Federal Center of Theoretical & Applied Sociology - FCTAS; Institute of Social & Political Studies, Russian Academy of Sciences (ISPR RAS)","Osipov, G (通讯作者)，Russian Acad Sci, Inst Sociopolit Res, Moscow, Russia.;Osipov, G (通讯作者)，Russian Acad Sci, Inst Sociopolit Res, Philosophy, Moscow, Russia.",,"Nekrassov, Sergey/E-5296-2017","Nekrassov, Sergey/0000-0002-9036-2675",,,,,28,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,1257,1266,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553202027,0

It is emphasized that these processes result in harmful effects of global character on the environment, climate change and society. This research paper will broadly focus on the link between globalization and climate change, and it will specifically focus on how globalization impacts climate change. This research is an attempt to bridge the gap between the two by linking them together and discussing topics such as how they are connected, and how this affects human beings , and what that means and entails for us and our planet. It will provide a variety of demonstrations, and examples regarding the topic, but, with that being said, this paper only covers the tip of the iceberg when it comes to this topic seeing as there are many schools of thought and studies surrounding it. Researchers also analyze certain problematic aspects related to climate change and integrated prevention and control of climate pollution which are regulated under the new integrated institute of environmental protection under the environmental protection law. The researchers argues that one of the main legal instruments for limiting and neutralizing the harmful effect of climate change on the environment and society is the globally integrated system of environmental legal regulation. It is suggested to improve the main law on environmental protection and adopt new laws on climate change as well as develop an integrated system of the global environmental law.","[Parveen, Rehana; Alajmi, Alanoud] Prince Sultan Univ, Coll Law, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",Prince Sultan University,"Parveen, R (通讯作者)，Prince Sultan Univ, Coll Law, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",,,,"Prince Sultan University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","Prince Sultan University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","This conference paper is ostensibly supported and funded by the Prince Sultan University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",,17,0,0,0,5,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,5500,5508,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553206054,0

This article describes the main features of the social care system for the elderly in the Czech Republic and its development since the adoption of the Social Services Act in 2007. It emphasizes the importance of introducing the concept of long-term care in the Czech Republic. The theme is enriched by the results of empirical research focused on the analysis of the demand for seniors for residential services. It was found that the majority of seniors considered the change of housing in a specialized facility as natural, but only at an advanced stage of inactivity. Attention was also paid to the financial possibilities of seniors. The research complements the current knowledge of seniors' needs and can be a useful guide in forming a social care for seniors.","[Prudka, Sarka] Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Prudká, S (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",prus01@vse.cz,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,3,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2238-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,373,382,,,,,,10,Demography; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BO2QE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000507522000035,0

In the contribution we are focusing on forecasting and analysis of employment in Slovakia in individual sectors. The forecast is up to 2020.

The level of concentration of the conflict in the political sphere far exceeds competition in other spheres, since the power is coveted prize for conflicting parties in politics. The functioning of a democratic state is not an exception. We suppose that the institutionalization of political conflicts, as a strategy for managing political conflicts, is a distinctive feature and one of the most important conditions for the democratization of a state.

The findings of the research indicate that the analysis of best practices is in line with the stages of development of cooperative organizations as part of member education.

However, with the further upgrading of the industrial structure, the structural dividend will become negative, i.e. there is a significant inverted U relationship between the industrial structure and economic growth.

Aim: The aim of the study was to establish how socio-economic values (income, economic development, employment or unemployment in the university students' direct environment) shape their entrepreneurial intentions. Setting and method: The study was built on Ajzen' psychological model on entrepreneurial intentions, and used a semi-structured questionnaire to collect data from 274 entrepreneurship university students. Cronbach's alpha was used to measure the reliability of the questionnaire, where six variables out of nine, had a coefficient alpha of more than 0.7, while the remaining three had a coefficient alpha of between 0.5 and 0.7. This instrument was assessed by both statisticians and academics who are experts in their fields to ensure its validity. Multivariate tests of statistical significance were conducted, where correlation and regression statistics were used to analyse the data. Results: Findings suggest that socio-economic factors have an impact in shaping entrepreneurial intentions of the university students. Conclusion: The study formulates the recommendations to the government, businesses, civil society organisations as well as the community within which students live.","[Kalitanyi, Vivence; Bbenkele, Edwin] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Business Management, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Johannesburg,"Kalitanyi, V (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Dept Business Management, Johannesburg, South Africa.",vkalitanyi@uj.ac.za,,"Kalitanyi, Vivence/0000-0002-0140-6649",,,,,48,3,3,0,7,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Through 18 qualitative interviews with suppliers and customers in the Finnish sawn timber value chain, sawmills customer orientation was analyzed. We find that the concept of customer orientation was realized rather narrowly at sawmills and customer orientation appeared as random actions instead of a systematic part of firms organization culture. Customers needs are more manifold and extend beyond product characteristics and process efficiency. The main challenge hindering the renewal of product-oriented business models toward service logic and customer orientation seems to be in attitudes and traditions.

The robustness of the proposed methodology is evaluated using different levels of optimism of the decision maker.,"[Oukil, Amar; Govindaluri, Srikrishna Madhumohan] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Dept Operat Management & Business Stat, POB 20, Muscat 123, Oman",Sultan Qaboos University,"Oukil, A (通讯作者)，Sultan Qaboos Univ, Dept Operat Management & Business Stat, POB 20, Muscat 123, Oman.",aoukil@squ.edu.om,"Oukil, Amar/N-8967-2016","Oukil, Amar/0000-0002-5330-6404",,,,,44,37,38,0,16,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,CHICHESTER,"THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0143-6570,1099-1468,,MANAG DECIS ECON,Manag.

Some circumstances, especially related to increasing marginal utility with decreasing availability per head of products, would justify use of a negative discount rate. For a logically complete suite of conditions, a means of identifying optimal rotation with such a rate is needed. Applying the usual formulation for land expectation value then produces a meaningless result. Two approaches seem to give a solution. One uses the first-order conditions for an optimum. Another uses inversion of time perspective to produce sensible-seeming results. However, for cases where the world, or the value of forest production, ends suddenly at an unpredictable time, the optimal rotation is, surprisingly, that of maximum forest rent. Where the cause of negative discount rates is of limited duration before stability or growing affluence is re-established, this provisional optimum can be modified responsively.

This challenging nature of project-to-project knowledge transfer led to the proliferation of a host of tools and instruments (so-called knowledge transfer mechanisms) in which little structure can be discovered making selection by (project) managers a difficult task. Aim: This article aims to deal with this unstructured proliferation of knowledge transfer mechanisms by empirically categorising these transfer mechanisms, thereby reducing the number of mechanisms to groups that share a common characteristic. Setting: The study takes stock of the wide range of knowledge transfer mechanisms available and analyses them in terms of specific characteristics (e.g. explicitness or reach). Methods: A multi-method approach is used in which a multi-level latent class analysis is applied on data collected via an expert panel. Results: Five categories of transfer mechanisms could be empirically established where these mechanisms showed common characteristics. Conclusion: The taxonomy developed will allow organisations and project managers to more efficiently select appropriate transfer mechanisms for use in project-to-project knowledge transfer.","[Van Waveren, Corro; Pretorius, Tinus] Univ Pretoria, Grad Sch Technol Management, Dept Engn & Technol Management, Pretoria, South Africa; [Oerlemans, Leon] Tilburg Univ, Dept Org Studies, Fac Social Sci, Tilburg, Netherlands",University of Pretoria; Tilburg University,"Oerlemans, L (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Dept Org Studies, Fac Social Sci, Tilburg, Netherlands.",l.a.g.oerlemans@uvt.nl,"Oerlemans, Leon/K-1732-2019","Oerlemans, Leon/0000-0002-7495-4515; Pretorius, Marthinuus/0000-0002-8214-4838",,,,,94,7,12,0,27,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Livelihood trajectories approaches attend more fully to these structural, contextual dynamics. A three-year study using quantitative and qualitative methods investigated livelihood trajectories over two decades in a village affected by deforestation in Northeast Cambodia, and sought to identify critical junctures structuring those trajectories. A timber rush, a land rush, a turn to agriculture and ongoing competition to shape post-forest reterritorialisation were identified as the critical junctures. These transformed the physical environment, and initiated waves of migration which in turn transformed the social and economic structure and everyday life of the village. This valuably disrupts narrative simplifications associated with community forestry. The junctures furthermore suggest an analytical framework for understanding deforestation-livelihoods dynamics in other contexts, thus demonstrating how livelihood trajectories research might contribute to middle-level theory building.","[Biddulph, Robin] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ & Soc, Human Geog Unit, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Amberntsson, Pelle] Jonkoping Univ, S-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden",University of Gothenburg; Jonkoping University,"Biddulph, R (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ & Soc, Human Geog Unit, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",robin.biddulph@geography.gu.se; pelle.amberntsson@ju.se,"Biddulph, Robin/AAN-6800-2021; Biddulph, Robin/AAV-2841-2020","Biddulph, Robin/0000-0003-2485-9867",,,,,58,6,6,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Using the Chicago metropolitan area as a case study, we classify six types of workplace locations to reflect the degree of employment centralization versus decentralization and the degree of employment clustering versus dispersion. Based on the 2008 Chicago Regional Household Travel Inventory, we found that low-income workers are more likely to work in centralized but dispersed workplaces, while high-income workers are more likely to work in employment clusters. The unequal distribution of workers in different workplaces, combined with distinctive commuting patterns to certain workplaces, partly explains commonly-observed commute differences, such as shorter-distance commutes and more public transit use by lower-income workers. Regression analysis shows that the association between income and commute mode varies by workplace, and, more importantly, commute mode has a greater association with workplace locations than with income. The results suggest considering workplace locations in empirical research on commuting inequalities and when establishing transportation and housing policies.","[Hu, Lingqian; Schneider, Robert J.] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, POB 413, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Hu, LQ (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, POB 413, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",hul@uwm.edu; rjschnei@uwm.edu,"Hu, Ivy/L-3119-2019","Hu, Ivy/0000-0002-5687-0764; Schneider, Robert/0000-0002-6225-3615",,,,,92,26,30,5,40,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

In this study, we explore the issue of carsharing and carpooling systems development potential among university students in Poland a fast growing economy with a pro-car mobility culture. In spring 2016, 452 surveys were collected from universities in nine cities in Poland. The study was aimed at university students, which means mostly people of 18-24 years of age. The study was conducted with the use of the CAWI method. The questionnaire was published on-line and disseminated among university students in selected major cities in Poland. The findings indicate that there is a place for shared mobility schemes in the Polish market, but presently, there is very scant awareness of such solutions. There are many barriers to carsharing and carpooling development, mainly due to the fact that the car is a symbol of freedom and independence, as well as a mark of social status worth spending money on, especially for young people such as university students. Previous studies have focused mainly on highly developed economies, with large, densely populated cities, where the shared mobility schemes have existed for many years and already are a part of transport policy. The results of this study may be used by the local and regional authorities in developing economies, so that the shared mobility schemes could become a part of urban transport systems.","[Kos-Labedowicz, Joanna] Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Int Econ Relat, 1 Maja 50 St, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland; [Urbanek, Anna] Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Transport, 1 Maja 50 St, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice; University of Economics in Katowice,"Urbanek, A (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Transport, 1 Maja 50 St, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland.",anna.urbanek@ue.katowice.pl,"Urbanek, Anna/T-1286-2017","Urbanek, Anna/0000-0003-4217-9064; Kos-Labedowicz, Joanna/0000-0002-9523-9609",,,,,52,2,2,0,33,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"VIA SANTA BIBBIANA 28, PISA, I-56127, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

An empirical study is performed to explore the contributions of different degrees of freedom in the modeling process to the forecast accuracy. First, a comparative analysis of alternative prediction methods provides evidence that random forest regression is particularly effective for resale price forecasting. It is also shown that the use of linear regression, the prevailing method in previous work, should be avoided. Second, the empirical results demonstrate the presence of heterogeneity in resale price forecasting and identify methods that can automatically overcome its detrimental effect on the forecast accuracy. Finally, the study confirms that the sellers of used cars possess informational advantages over market research agencies, which enable them to forecast resale prices more accurately. This implies that sellers have an incentive to invest in in-house forecasting solutions, instead of basing their pricing decisions on externally generated residual value estimates.

Despite the efforts made, reducing freight-related congestion and polluting emissions without penalising social and economic activities within cities is still a challenging issue. City logistics measures frequently fail mainly due to a lack of support and commitment from stakeholders. A participatory approach in freight transport planning represents a reasonable and valuable option. This paper describes the innovative governance model developed in the city of Turin in Italy that was based on a proactive and effective stakeholders' cooperation for achieving a resilient urban development. The added value of the paper also relates to the real-life assessment of the impacts the non-mandatory policy-mix implemented, based on a collaborative governance model, have on the environment and service delivery thus providing a realistic measure of the viability and effectiveness of the solution proposed. Its voluntary adoption, in fact, produces an increase in commercial vehicles' speed and a substantial reduction in CO2 emissions while also allowing logistic service providers to perform more deliveries.

We use unique data about food retailers in metropolitan Detroit to develop an array of food retailer access measures that account for distance to nearest retailer, density of retailers, commute times, mode of transit, and type of retailer. Across most measures, we find that many vulnerable population groups have greater or at least comparable spatial access to food resources as less vulnerable populations groups.

However, the relative importance of average travel time and reliability not only depends on the purpose of the trip, but also varies from one person to another. Users seek to minimize their travel costs leading to an equilibrium condition in which they choose routes in such a way that they cannot reduce the general cost of their own trip. In this paper, we adopt the concept of the efficient frontier to represent the equilibrium route choice of the heterogeneous users in a network under travel time variability. Then, we use the primary properties of the efficient frontier to propose a mathematical formulation for the route choice problem for a discrete or continuous distribution of sensitivity of users to variations in route travel times. An analytical-based algorithm is designed to assign the heterogeneous demand to the network. Efficiency of the proposed algorithm in solving the route choice problem is also compared in a numerical example with a classic iterative method with a smoothing factor.","[Amirgholy, Mahyar] Cornell Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Gonzales, Eric J.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",Cornell University; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Amirgholy, M (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",amirgholy@cornell.edu,,,United States Department of Transportation through the New England University Transportation Center [DTRT13-G-UTC31],United States Department of Transportation through the New England University Transportation Center,"The authors are grateful to Anna Nagurney, Thomas O.

We utilise Irish census data to measure the economic value of informal care in Ireland. Our results reveal the considerable value of informal care in Ireland ranging between (ss)2.1 and (ss)5.5 billion, depending on valuation approach. They also show a gendered distribution of informal care activities and the consequences of transposing market-based gender compensation asymmetries directly onto non-market activity. We discuss evidence of best practice in long-term care policy across Europe, which involves a combination of income supports for informal carers and substantial investment in formal home care provision. We also discuss apparent incongruences in current Government policy, which appears to prioritise a formal residential care model over more community-based care models, contradicting previously stated policy objectives and best practice in Europe.","[Hanly, Paul; Sheerin, Corina] Natl Coll Ireland, Galway, Ireland",National College of Ireland,"Hanly, P (通讯作者)，Natl Coll Ireland, Galway, Ireland.",Paul.Hanly@ncirl.ie,,"Hanly, Paul/0000-0002-5348-4825",,,,,74,14,14,0,2,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

The former focus on exchange, markets and efficiency, as can be seen in work on urban economies. We want the field to pay more attention to two processes crucial to the growth of cities often lying outside market exchange and agglomeration economies: how resources are managed across time and space and how the urban environment creates challenges demanding collective responses. We first make the case for the two processes using historical examples and then argue for the importance of similar processes today.

J,"Cooper, JC",,,,"Cooper, James C.",,,Information and settlement: Empirical evidence on Daubert rulings and settlement rates,INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF LAW AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Litigation; Daubert; Civil Procedure; Expert witness; Discovery; Duration analysis,EXPERT TESTIMONY; LITIGATION; ADMISSIBILITY; STANDARDS,"In 1993, the Supreme Court established a new standard for the admissibility of expert evidence with its decision in Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals. Although whether Daubert actually has increased the reliability of expert evidence remains an open question, empirical research generally suggests that Daubert has increased the judicial role in expert testimony as the number of challenges has increased. An unexplored topic to date is how Daubert outcomes impact litigation outcomes. This paper aims to fill that gap by examining how Daubert outcomes in federal district court affect the likelihood and timing of settlement. This paper also fits into the larger empirical literature that explores how information flows impact settlement. The sample of 2127 Daubert motions made in 1017 private cases from 91 federal district courts, spanning from 2003-2014, and involving 57 different causes of action provides the most comprehensive overview of Daubert practice in federal courts to date. The main empirical results suggest that defendant Daubert wins (plaintiff wins) are associated with a reduction (increase) in the likelihood of settlement. Results from duration analysis suggest that longer pendency time for Daubert motions are associated with lower settlement rates (a 4-7% reduction in the rate of settlement for every month that a Daubert motion goes undecided). Decomposition finds that the indirect effect of Daubert pendency (delay due to the reduction in communication between parties while Daubert motions pend before the court) accounts for the majority (70%) of the measured reduction in the settlement rate. One way that courts might reduce the cost of litigation if they were to adopt Lone Pine-type procedures that structure expert discovery and concomitant Daubert motions early, especially when expert testimony is required to prove certain elements of a claim.

Conversely, states with a larger natural gas industry are less likely to assume oversight. However, whether a state has assumed oversight has no significant effect on either state enforcement efforts or pipeline performance. The most effective state enforcement tool is monetary penalties, which significantly decrease incidents and property damage.","[Stafford, Sarah L.] Coll William & Mary, POB 8795, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA",William & Mary,"Stafford, SL (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, POB 8795, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA.",slstaf@wm.edu,,"Stafford, Sarah/0000-0003-2233-5728",,,,,14,4,4,0,0,UNIV BATH,BATH,"JRNL OF TRANSPORT ECON & POL CLAVERTON DOWN, BATH BA2 7AY, AVON, ENGLAND",0022-5258,1754-5951,,J TRANSP ECON POLICY,J.

This paper explores the market effects of debarment on public procurement. Debarmeht is found to make little difference in markets with high competition, while in markets with low competition it may deter corruption as long as firms value public procurement contracts in the future and there is a certain risk of being detected in corruption. On the other hand, debarment - when it works - has an anti-competitive effect, and this contributes to facilitate collusion between suppliers. If designed with an understanding of the market mechanisms at play, debarment can deter both collusion and corruption, thus improving the results of public procurement. If so, most current debarment regimes need modification. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Although such debate can advance understanding of the potential consequences of the OI 2015, much of it, albeit informed by economics, is of necessity speculative. It may be useful to see how experience up to OI 2015 might be informative. That experience is notably thin, with the FCC's citing two to four instances in ten years that would have violated OI 2015. After explaining why the OI 2015 order and its predecessor may be largely non-binding, we look at the four examples for lessons in what kinds of behavior OI 2015 might prevent.

This represents-to our knowledge-the first attempt to evaluate the impacts of courts' removal. Using panel data, our empirical strategy is based on probit estimations, counterfactuals, as well as 3SLS estimations. Our results show that the reform removed small and concentrated courts.

The teams' actions and expenses between 2000 and 2015 have been observed, and several hypotheses for the distribution of the shares of municipal expenditures on these brigades are discussed. Using spatial autocorrelation models, spatial autoregressive models, spatial Durbin models, and spatial error models, several original results have been achieved. A positive spatial autocorrelation in the shares of these municipal expenditures has been observed for the first time in the literature, revealing a mimetic approach among Portuguese municipalities that implies the need for re-arranging the current programs and regulations related to forest sappers' teams towards an enlarged space of action.

J,"Seo, JY",,,,"Seo, Ji-Yong",,,A Study of Effective Financial Support for SMEs to Improve Economic and Employment Conditions: Evidence from OECD Countries,MANAGERIAL AND DECISION ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,DIVIDEND POLICY; ENTERPRISES; BANKS,"Using a panel logit regression model, this study analyzes whether or not five categorized financial supports for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) from the governments of 11 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries facilitate economic and employment growth: (1) direct government loans to SMEs; (2) government-guaranteed loans to SMEs; (3) the reinforcement of relationship banking; (4) financial stability steps to ease pro-cyclicality; and (5) equity-linked financing. The academic contribution of this research is in identifying the optimal type of government financial support to SMEs given a country's level of financial crisis and market-rate level. The main empirical test results are as follows. First, the type of financial support that contributes most to economic and employment growth is the set of steps that governments take to ease pro-cyclicality. Second, the reinforcement of relationship banking can also contribute to improved economic and employment conditions. Third, in less capital-intensive countries, the results confirm that economic and employment improvement occurs more often if equity-linked financing is used. Fourth, the adoption of dynamic loan-loss provisions to prepare for periods of economic recession is necessary to reduce the pro-cyclicality of SME loans within the 11 OECD countries studied in this paper; it is also necessary to transition from a persistent monetary-easing policy stance to a flexible monetary stance within a country's fiscal policy in order to make commercial banks benefit from an incentive-like risk premium for SME loans despite the existence of economic recessions. Finally, the study finds that the need to apply equity-linked financing methods through the stock market is especially urgent in developing countries. As the managerial perspectives, it is confirmed that easing pro-cyclicality of SME loan and enhancing banking relationship can contribute to SMEs fund management.

So far, it has developed mostly in large urban areas and within the young population. It is still unknown whether CS might develop also in small to medium-size towns and among other age groups, such as the elderly. This paper illustrates a methodology to estimate the probability that a person would be a CS user on the basis of his/her generalized cost. Contrary to most of the applications found in the literature which focus on cities, the methodology is applied to a region: the Friuli Venezia Giulia (FVG) region, consisting of small to medium-size towns where CS is currently not offered. The methodology estimates the probability of becoming a CS user at individual level. About 3.7% of the population holding a driving license has a probability higher than 50% of becoming CS users. Such percentage is higher in Trieste (6.8%), the largest town in the region with about 200 thousand inhabitants but there is some demand also in the much smaller towns. Since in 2015 only 1% of the Italian population are CS members, we conclude that there is potential, unsatisfied CS demand in the small to medium-size towns. It is confirmed that age matters: the young to middle aged population have a higher propensity to use CS than the older population (5.7% vs. 0.7%). It is also found that the level of knowledge of CS is positively correlated with the propensity to become a user.","[Danielis, Romeo; Rotaris, Lucia] Univ Trieste, Dipartimento Sci Econ Aziendali Matemat & Stat, Trieste, Italy",University of Trieste,"Danielis, R (通讯作者)，Univ Trieste, Dipartimento Sci Econ Aziendali Matemat & Stat, Trieste, Italy.",danielis@units.it,,,FVG Region,FVG Region(Regione Friuli Venezia Giulia),"The financial support of the FVG Region is gratefully acknowledged withint the Legge Regionale n.14 dell' 11 agosto 2010 Concessione di contributi a sostegno della ricerca, dello sviluppo, dell'innovazione e del trasferimento tecnologico per lo sviluppo di sistemi per la mobilita individuale finalizzati alla riduzione di consumi e di emission.

The restriction prohibits sex offenders from living near places where children regularly congregate, such as schools and daycare centers. In this paper, I estimate the effect of the North Carolina residency restriction on recidivism patterns of affected sex offenders by exploiting a quasi-experimental variation in the timing of the release. I find that the restriction increases the likelihood of a new property crime conviction within two years of release by 2.5 percentage points. On the other hand, the effect of the North Carolina residency restriction on the risk of repeat sex offenses is mostly modest, although the restriction seems to decrease the number of repeat sex offenses among newly-released and young sex offenders.

Consumers can use the proceeds of income tax refunds for spending and saving, but tests of prior programs to encourage savings show low take-up rates. This field study shows that the majority of tax filers make no estimate of their refund amount in advance, but that consumers who are able to estimate their refund in advance of completing their tax returns tend to be reasonably accurate in their estimates. Moreover, taxpayers who estimate their refunds before filing their taxes are more likely to save their refunds than those who do not.

The rationing occurs mainly at the low end of the market and sometimes results in full rationing of the low end. Furthermore, the incidence of price discrimination under social influence is much lower than in the absence of it. Social influence lowers the profitability of price discrimination and incentivizes sellers to reduce product variety and to only target the high end of the market, a fact that is consistent with many empirical observations.

However, these capabilities have yet to be fully explored in public practice. In this paper we first discuss a general framework for performing transportation equity analysis using activity-based travel demand models, distributional comparisons, and incorporating equity standards. In addition, we demonstrate the advantages of distributional comparisons, relative to average measures. This demonstration uses the 2000 Bay Area Travel Survey and (activity-based) mode choice model. The findings show that distributional comparisons are capable of clearly revealing the winners and losers that result from transportation improvements, in comparison with average measures. The use of these results will likely result in different conclusions on transportation investments.","[Bills, Tierra S.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Walker, Joan L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Bills, TS (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",tbills@umich.edu; joanwalker@berkeley.edu,,,Dwight David Eisenhower Transportation Fellowship program [DTFH64-11-G-00002]; WTS Helene M.

This seems to contradict normative individualism, which provides the general orientation to our modern democracies. Soft or libertarian paternalism accepts the necessity of paternalism due to the existence of behavioural anomalies, but intends to apply only such measures that do not restrict the decision leeway of individuals. Nevertheless, the same objections that can be raised against its strong version can also be raised against soft paternalism. On the other hand, as soon as we accept that human beings are able to reflect not only about their actions but also about the preferences guiding their actions, there is no longer a necessary contradiction between paternalism and normative individualism. As far as we know today, the possibilities to successfully apply soft paternalistic measures are rather limited. On the other hand, while some criticisms are justified, others largely overshoot the mark and seem to be at least partly ideologically motivated.","[Kirchgassner, Gebhard] Univ St Gallen, Swiss Inst Int Econ & Appl Econ Res SIAW HSG, Leopoldina, Bodanstr 8, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland; [Kirchgassner, Gebhard] Univ St Gallen, CESifo, Bodanstr 8, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland",University of St Gallen; University of St Gallen,"Kirchgässner, G (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Swiss Inst Int Econ & Appl Econ Res SIAW HSG, Leopoldina, Bodanstr 8, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.;Kirchgässner, G (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, CESifo, Bodanstr 8, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",Gebhard.Kirchgaessner@unisg.ch,,,,,,,129,16,18,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Solutions suggested by politicians predominantly focus on: 1) ensuring that all effects that are covered in the CBA are scrutinized in an impartial way; 2) increasing the awareness and recognition of the elements of the political trade-off that are not covered by a CBA to diminish the probability that politicians will use CBA to kill a political debate.","[Mouter, Niek] Delft Univ Technol, NL-2600 AA Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology,"Mouter, N (通讯作者)，Jaffalaan 5, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands.",,,,,,,,38,10,11,1,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Using stochastic frontier analysis, we provide evidence that global sourcing improves firms' capabilities to combine and re-combine inputs in productive ways, thereby increasing technical efficiency. We find a robust relationship between technical efficiency and international out-sourcing. First, we find that firms that are deeply integrated into global sourcing networks are closer to their own production frontier. Second, firms that are engaged in international sourcing are also closer to the industry efficiency frontier. These findings are consistent with the argument that international sourcing stimulates firms' capabilities by enabling them to identify and adopt higher quality inputs or more efficient production and management practices. These findings also suggest that the variety and extent of firms' global sourcing networks constitute an important source of differences in efficiency levels among firms the ICT manufacturing industry.","[Andersson, Martin] Blekinge Inst Technol BTH, Ind Econ, Karlskrona, Sweden; [Andersson, Martin] Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Innovat Studies, Lund, Sweden; [Stone, Trudy-Ann] Blekinge Inst Technol BTH, Karlskrona, Sweden; [Stone, Trudy-Ann] Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Lund, Sweden",Blekinge Institute Technology; Lund University; Blekinge Institute Technology; Lund University,"Stone, TA (通讯作者)，Blekinge Inst Technol BTH, Karlskrona, Sweden.;Stone, TA (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Lund, Sweden.",martin.andersson@bth.se; tas@bth.se,"Andersson, Martin/AAB-5164-2021",,,,,,36,12,13,1,6,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Agricultural commodity market is characterized by volatile environment, shock or breaks. The aim of this paper is to investigate the dynamics of the main agricultural commodities - corn and wheat using stochastic Levy process. The selected commodities are the most tradeable among financial institution. The prices of agricultural commodities are influenced by different events or factors, i.e. changes in production, weather or processing. The concept of long memory deals with persistency of time series over 2011 - 2015 period. For analysis of commodities the rescaled range method is used. Results show that there is an existence of long memory among corn and wheat prices. The H statistics of Hurst exponent indicates the strong form of memory with values above 0.75 under Levy stochastic process distribution Findings support the persistent behavior among commodities. The implication is for agricultural producers using hedging techniques or financial practitioners using empirical evidence of long range dependence.","[Cermak, Michal] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Cermák, M (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500, Czech Republic.",cermak@pef.czu.cz,,,"Internal Grant Agency (IGA) of the Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague [20171031]","Internal Grant Agency (IGA) of the Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague","This research was financially supported by the Internal Grant Agency (IGA) of the Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague: (Grant NO. 20171031).",,20,0,0,0,1,SILESIAN UNIV,KARVINA,"SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION, KARVINA, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-265-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,31,37,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BQ3BQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000583813800003,0

Moreover, such heritage is often located in contexts characterized by the absence of public resources and the presence of weak markets. Their valorisation is linked to the possibilities of re-use. The identification of new locations is often treated in a minimalist manner: contrasting with public use to that of private individuals and contradicting the criteria identified by the economy to define the public or private nature of the assets. In many cases, the approach to re-use is critical and incomplete due to the lack of an in-depth analysis of the economic and financial feasibility of the interventions. This paper reviews the traditional approaches regarding the enhancement of public and private properties, taking into account the theories regarding the value and economic evaluation tools. From this point of view, the case study- Ivrea, the 20th century Industrial City, nominated in the UNESCO Tentative List-is emblematic. The authors intend to support the Public Administration of Ivrea in the concrete actions of valorisation of heritage, including the revision of the Management Plan already presented. Its valorization potential departs from the imbalance between supply and demand issues of spaces. In conclusion, this paper succeeds in reporting on the strategic importance of when cultural heritage, both immaterial and material, should be used, regardless of the state of its use and conservation. Attention is focused on IT capabilities with respect to their ability to reconnect the individual assets to systems and involve new audiences.","[Coscia, Cristina; Curto, Rocco] Politecn Torino, Dept Architecture & Design, Viale Mattioli 39, Turin, Italy",Polytechnic University of Turin,"Coscia, C (通讯作者)，Politecn Torino, Dept Architecture & Design, Viale Mattioli 39, Turin, Italy.",cristina.coscia@polito.it; rocco.curto@polito.it,"COSCIA, CRISTINA/F-9583-2013","COSCIA, CRISTINA/0000-0001-8789-2635",,,,,53,14,14,0,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1865-3529,,978-3-319-49676-4; 978-3-319-49675-7,GREEN ENERGY TECHNOL,,,2017,,,,,,,79,99,,10.1007/978-3-319-49676-4_7,0.0,,,21,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI6HB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413289600007,0

Longitudinal data from the Integrated Longitudinal Business Database (iLBD), Kauffman Firm Survey (KFS), and the Growing America through Entrepreneurship (GATE) experiment are used to provide some of the first evidence in the literature on the determinants of taking the leap from a nonemployer to employer firm among start-ups. Several interesting patterns emerge regarding the dynamics of nonemployer start-ups hiring their first employee. Hiring rates among the universe of nonemployer start-ups are very low, but increase when the population of nonemployers is focused on more growth-oriented businesses such as incorporated and employer identification number businesses. If nonemployer start-ups hire, the bulk of hiring occurs in the first few years of existence. After this point in time, relatively few nonemployer start-ups hire an employee. Focusing on more growth- and employment-oriented start-ups in the KFS, we find that Asian-owned and Hispanic-owned start-ups have higher rates of hiring their first employee than white-owned start-ups. Female-owned start-ups are roughly 10 percentage points less likely to hire their first employee by the first, second, and seventh years after start-up. The education level of the owner, however, is not found to be associated with the probability of hiring an employee. Among business characteristics, we find evidence that business assets and intellectual property are associated with hiring the first employee. Using data from the largest random experiment providing entrepreneurship training in the United States ever conducted, we do not find evidence that entrepreneurship training increases the likelihood that nonemployers hire their first employee.","[Fairlie, Robert W.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Econ, Engn 2 Bldg, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Miranda, Javier] US Bur Census, Ctr Econ Studies, 4600 Silver Hill Rd,5K137, Washington, DC 20233 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Fairlie, RW (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Econ, Engn 2 Bldg, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",rfairlie@ucsc.edu; javier.miranda@census.gov,,,Small Business Administration,Small Business Administration,"We thank Michael Roach, Nick Papageorge, and seminar participants at Cornell University, Harvard University, the London School of Economics, the University of Bristol, UC Berkeley, University of Arizona, Louisiana Tech, Tufts University, Northeastern University, and the Kauffman/IZA Conference on Entrepreneurship for comments and suggestions.

It has had particularly devastating effects on African-American women. Their fertility has been managed for hundreds of years, first as slaves forced to have children for owners, then as objects to be experimented on without anesthetics, and finally as mothers sterilized without their consent. The relatively high rates of infant and maternal mortality, along with limited access to safe and high-quality reproductive services, are continuing signs of such devastation. This article discusses the history and consequences of the medicalization of pregnancy, contraception, and abortion in America. Attention is drawn to the ways in which the profession of medicine took control away from midwives, the traditional birth attendants and pregnancy caregivers, and the particular consequences for African-American women. Ultimately, we posit that greater access to midwifery care could lower infant and maternal mortality rates and improve reproductive services. The reintroduction of spirituality through midwifery would also restore the important role of wise women in supporting women, babies, and communities.","[Goode, Keisha] SUNY Coll Old Westbury, Sociol, Old Westbury, NY 11568 USA; [Goode, Keisha] Natl Assoc Certified Profess Midwives, Keene, NH 03431 USA; [Rothman, Barbara Katz] CUNY, Sociol, New York, NY 10021 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Old Westbury; City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Goode, K (通讯作者)，SUNY Coll Old Westbury, Sociol, Old Westbury, NY 11568 USA.;Goode, K (通讯作者)，Natl Assoc Certified Profess Midwives, Keene, NH 03431 USA.",kgoode@gradcenter.cuny.edu; BKatzRothman@gc.cuny.edu,,"Goode, Keisha/0000-0002-7200-7506",,,,,52,13,20,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

The interest shown by society for education is extremely inconstant, as it culminates in final evaluation periods, followed by obtaining documents certifying the passing of a certain educational path, documents that theoretically offer higher chances of obtaining a place of well-paid work. Such an instrumentalist approach is acceptable (though not desirable) from the perspective of the beneficiaries, but not from the perspective of education providers who are defined as educators. Education is a vast, generous concept which, in most cases, is viewed by society, especially in terms of its concrete results. This attitude can be considered justified, since in all areas the major interest is manifested for the result rather than for the process. The study we propose is intended to be an interpretation from a predominantly humanistic but realistic perspective of a situation described synthetically and detached from statistical data to see to what extent the observance of the commitments assumed by Romania at the declarative level are found in the consciousness of the main actors in the field: students and teachers.","[Hapenciuc, Cristian-Valentin; Neamtu, Daniela; Bejinaru, Ruxandra] Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Suceava, Romania",Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava,"Hapenciuc, CV (通讯作者)，Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Suceava, Romania.",expresedinte@gmail.com; dana_neamtu99@yahoo.com; ruxandrabejinaru@yahoo.com,"Neamtu, Daniela Mihaela/IAQ-7440-2023; Bejinaru, Ruxandra/AAW-4372-2021; BEJINARU, RUXANDRA/CAF-3746-2022; Bejinaru, Ruxandra/Y-4648-2019","Neamtu, Daniela Mihaela/0000-0002-8488-0900; Bejinaru, Ruxandra/0000-0003-2331-155X; BEJINARU, RUXANDRA/0000-0003-2331-155X;",,,,,21,0,0,0,1,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",2286-1440,,,INT MANAGE CONF,,,2017,,,,,,,307,317,,,,,,11,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM6KT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000466917100032,0

The aim of the paper is to investigate whether or not as well as how the future restrictive monetary policy could affect the hotel's turnover in the Czech Republic. As the main estimation method it is used the GMM regression with pooled data of the hotels. It is obtained time series for the hotels' profit and loss statements from Bureau van Dijk's Amadeus international statistical database and exchange rates as well as the CNB foreign exchange trading from their online database. According to the CNB, which has decided to use the koruna exchange rate as an additional instrument for easing the monetary conditions in 2013, they will still not discontinue the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument before 2017 Q2. Therefore, suggestions for the hotels to hedge naturally have been made.

The findings will provide valuable strategic implications for Vietnamese supermarkets in designing effective customer retention programs. The results of this study are in line with previous researches that support the direct positive effect of perceived CSR on customer loyalty. Moreover, this study demonstrates the paths from perceived CSR on customer loyalty in Vietnam retailing context in which the mediating roles of customer trust and customer satisfaction are affirmed. The possible reason is that consumers associate good CSR with positive evaluation of the retailer's trustworthiness as well as its products and services that enhance relationship quality and loyalty.","[Hoang Phuong Dung] Banking Acad, Hanoi, Vietnam",,"Hoang, PD (通讯作者)，Banking Acad, Hanoi, Vietnam.",dunghp@hvnh.edu.vn,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,8,KODISA,SEONGNAM,"HANSHIN OFFICETEL STE 1030, 2463-4 SHINHEUNG-DONG SUJEONG-GU, SEONGNAM, GYEONGGI-DO 461-720, SOUTH KOREA",2287-478X,,,INT CONF KOREA DISTR,,,2017,,,,,,,187,190,,,,,,4,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ1UR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418104000049,0

There is no doubt about the importance of rural tourism service quality to the development of rural tourism. Government departments and rural tourism operators are seriously seeking ways to improve service quality. The government can guide and regulate the development of rural tourism by formulating relevant policies. The operators should conscientiously study and improve their own quality to meet the needs of the future development of rural tourism.

I test whether there is evidence that subsidiaries of the large parent firms in this industry act as a cohesive unit or if they focus on maximizing their own profit without taking into consideration the effect they have on sister firms (other firms owned by the same parent). I do so by analyzing how release date timing differs between labels that are owned by the same parent company and those that are not. Using data on release dates, song/artist characteristics, and label ownership for the top-10 Billboard Hot 100 hits from 1990 to 2013, I am able to compare the length of time between releases for songs released by co-owned labels and songs released by separately owned labels. I find that overall, there is not a systematic difference in the release of songs produced by the same major compared to songs produced by different majors. These results suggest that subsidiary labels may in fact be acting independentlynot internalizing the effect they have on sister firms.","[Konsor, Kellie] Saginaw Valley State Univ, Dept Econ, 7400 Bay Rd, University Ctr, MI 48710 USA",,"Konsor, K (通讯作者)，Saginaw Valley State Univ, Dept Econ, 7400 Bay Rd, University Ctr, MI 48710 USA.",kjkonsor@svsu.edu,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0899-7764,1532-7736,,J MEDIA ECON,J.

The novel contribution of this paper is that the factors of economic growth, energy consumption, energy taxes as well as R&D were tested in one expanded EKC model, including the data of three Baltic States. The regression coefficients referring to GDP, Energy consumption have a positive sign, while R&D and Energy taxes have a negative sign. The empirical analysis combines two steps of evaluation of panel models of different groups of countries. The results imply that the analysed factors (energy consumption, energy taxes as well as R&D) can be applied to adjust the EKC trend in the region and might be useful for the climate change policy adjustment.","[Lapinskiene, Giedre; Peleckis, Kestutis] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Business Technol & Entrepreneurship, Social Sci Econ, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Slavinskaite, Neringa] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Logist & Transport Management, Social Sci Econ, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Lapinskiene, G (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Business Technol & Entrepreneurship, Social Sci Econ, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",giedre.lapinskiene@vgtu.lt; kestutis.peleckis@vgtu.lt; neringa.slavinskaite@vgtu.lt,"Lapinskienė, Giedrė/HNR-0508-2023","Lapinskiene, Giedre/0000-0003-0179-794X",,,,,33,38,38,1,21,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

That is, accessibility is measured or modeled for current or future regional transportation and land-use scenarios for evaluation or broad policy guidance. Yet system-level scenarios cannot readily be applied to the project-by project decision-making that characterizes the majority of transportation and land-use planning decisions. Accessibility evaluation of individual transportation or land-development projects differs from system-level analysis in essential ways and thus requires specialized tools. This article proposes an elasticity-based metric of accessibility that can enable project-level evaluation of land-development projects as an accessibility-based alternative to traffic-impact analysis. The metric is demonstrated for three projects in Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA. The metric is shown to be sensitive to the location of development and capable of distinguishing among the analyzed projects in accessibility terms. Where mobility-based evaluation tends to rank peripheral development highly, the proposed accessibility metric appropriately rates central development as contributing the most to regional accessibility even after accounting for the traffic delay it engenders.","[Levine, Jonathan; Grengs, Joe] Univ Michigan, Taubman Coll Architecture & Urban Planning, Urban & Reg Planning Program, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Merlin, Louis] Florida Atlantic Univ, Sch Urban & Reg Planning, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University,"Levine, J (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Taubman Coll Architecture & Urban Planning, Urban & Reg Planning Program, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",jnthnlvn@umich.edu,,"Grengs, Joe/0000-0002-0858-5387; Merlin, Louis/0000-0002-9267-5712","NEXTRANS Center, Purdue University of the U.S. Department of Transportation, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology (OST-R), University Transportation Centers Program [DTRT12-G-UTC05]; Dow Postdoctoral Sustainability Fellowship","NEXTRANS Center, Purdue University of the U.S. Department of Transportation, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology (OST-R), University Transportation Centers Program; Dow Postdoctoral Sustainability Fellowship","Funding for this research was provided by the NEXTRANS Center, Purdue University under Grant No. DTRT12-G-UTC05 of the U.S. Department of Transportation, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology (OST-R), University Transportation Centers Program.

Research problem is the way of assessing whether excise duties are an effective measure in view of state goals. The aim of this paper is to design the model for effectiveness assessment of excise duties in view of state goals. The algorithm behind the theoretical research includes summarised and systematised criteria, indicators and methods for effectiveness assessment of excise duties in view of state goals. Information contained in the databases of Eurostat, OECD and the Lithuanian Department of Statistics has been used for the research. The designed model for effectiveness assessment of excise duties in view of state goals provides the possibility to generate the respective quantitative estimate. Nonetheless, the generated estimate would be difficult to interpret due to the absence of any criteria suggesting whether the indicator value should be viewed as positive vs. negative, good vs. bad. It would be reasonable to compare the resulting indicator of effectiveness assessment of excise duties with the effectiveness indicator of the excise tax in other countries. Accordingly, comparative assessment of the excise duties effectiveness indicator in Lithuania vs. equivalent indicator in Poland and Slovakia has been conducted. Not only the common final estimate, but also partial integrated indicators may be employed for the analysis and assessment of the effectiveness of excise duties in view of state goals. These indicators point to the quantitative estimate of the assessment criteria of a certain aspect. Variation of a certain criterion estimate over time (dynamics) and its effect on the complex integrated indicator could be analysed. Therefore, multicriteria model for effectiveness assessment of excise duties in view of state goals enables adopting reasonable and equitable decisions on improvement of excise taxes. The designed multicriteria assessment model can also be adjusted for varying conditions by adding additional indicators or removing certain indicators that have already been included.","[Miceikiene, Astrida; Ciuleviciene, Vida] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Inst Econ Accounting & Finance, Univ Str 10-323, LT-53361 Akademija, Kaunas District, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Miceikiene, A (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Inst Econ Accounting & Finance, Univ Str 10-323, LT-53361 Akademija, Kaunas District, Lithuania.",astrida.miceikiene@asu.lt; vida.ciztleviciene@asu.lt,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,4,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The proposed research model integrates service quality, customer satisfaction, switching costs and switching barriers as the main determinants of customer loyalty, further analysing their different effects (direct/mediating/moderating) on customer loyalty. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is used in order to assess the validity of the measurement model, and the developed structural model is tested with structural equation modelling (SEM). The reported results indicate that the proposed research model as a whole has a satisfactory level of adequacy and most of the hypothesized realtionships are confirmed. The results suggest that customer satisfaction partially mediates the relationship between service quality and customer loyalty and also service quality has a direct and positive effect on customer loyalty. The satisfaction-loyalty relationship is not mediated nor moderated by switching barriers, but switching barriers have a direct and positive effect on customer loyalty. The presented results would be of great importance for managers for the successful development of strategies for creating mobile service users' loyalty. The empirical evidence obtained in this study suggest that Macedonian mobile operators should have in mind alternative strategies in creating customer loyalty, emphasising the fact that customer satisfaction has a stronger positive influence in creating customer loyalty than switching barriers. The present research provides an integrated approach in examining customer loyalty and explores the different roles of switching barriers in the relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty. In order to further develop the integrated approach of customer loyalty modelling, some additional concepts should be incorporated and examined in the future.","[Palamidovska-Sterjadovska, Nikolina; Ciunova-Shuleska, Anita] Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ Skopje, Fac Econ Skopje, Dept Mkt, Skopje, North Macedonia",Saints Cyril & Methodius University of Skopje,"Palamidovska-Sterjadovska, N (通讯作者)，Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ Skopje, Fac Econ Skopje, Dept Mkt, Skopje, North Macedonia.",nikolina@eccf.ukim.edu.mk; anita@eccf.ukim.edu.mk,"Ciunova-Shuleska, Anita/ADG-7476-2022","Ciunova-Shuleska, Anita/0000-0001-6402-7630; Palamidovska-Sterjadovska, Nikolina/0000-0002-2926-5649",,,,,93,4,8,1,7,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The data set for this paper was obtained from the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS), which was conducted by the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) from 2012-2014. A binary logistic regression model with different specifications was employed to examine the effect of independent variables on the incidence of collateral. The results show that risky borrowers need to pledge collateral and the reduction of asymmetric information can lower the incidence of collateral for SMEs. Moreover, we find that female borrowers are more likely to pledge collateral than male borrowers are. The results also suggest that loans with a longer maturity are more likely to be collateralized than short-term loans. We find evidence that bank-borrower proximity can alleviate the incidence of collateral whereas bank concentration may increase collateral requirements. Policy makers may consider these results to implement policies that can promote bank competition and can lower collateral requirements for female borrowers. The paper contributes to the ongoing debate on the determinants of collateral.","[Rahman, Ashiqur; Belas, Jaroslav] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Dept Enterprise Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic; [Kliestik, Tomas] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia; [Tyll, Ladislav] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Business Adm, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin; University of Zilina; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Rahman, A (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Dept Enterprise Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic.",rahman@fame.utb.cz; belas111@gmail.com; tomas.kliestik@fpedas.uniza.sk; ladislav.tyll@vse.cz,"Kliestik, Tomas/O-8070-2015; Belas, Jaroslav/AGS-6813-2022","Belas, Jaroslav/0000-0002-5900-997X; Kliestik, Tomas/0000-0002-3815-5409; Rahman, Ashiqur/0000-0003-1286-0940",Internal Grant Agency of FaME TBU [IGA/FaME/2017/010],Internal Grant Agency of FaME TBU,"Ashiqur Rahman and Jaroslav Belas are thankful to the Internal Grant Agency of FaME TBU No. IGA/FaME/2017/010: Financial Constraints on Economic Activities, for financial support to carry out this research.",,75,50,60,0,24,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Although a number of macroeconomic indicators showed visible economic recovery in the last two years, consequences of the long-term inadequate model of economic development (imports consumption v production exports) are reflected in the low competitiveness of the Croatian economy and a relative immobility of Croatian competitiveness over the years compared to other countries. Namely, based on the analysis of the pillars/indicators of competitiveness, it seems that the Croatian economy is in the long-lasting state of relative immobility, i.e. not recording upward movements in the relative position compared to the rest of the world and the EU10 countries. Moreover, Croatia has lagged behind the average of the EU10 in almost all competitiveness indicators over a longer period of time. Therefore, it can be concluded that Croatia is in the state of prolonged stagnation of the competitiveness of the national economy compared to the EU10 countries. The goal of this analysis is to determine the dynamics of competitiveness in EP 'f3 it the EU10 and a relative immobility in the competitiveness of the Croatian w economy, which is a reflection of a slow and inefficient restructuring of the,_.

Exploring entrepreneurial intentions of individuals represents a challenge not only for scholars but also for university education and policy-making aiming to monitor, contribute, and support entrepreneurial behaviours. We decided to join the EI scientific conversation through a two-country analysis. Our theoretical choices draw upon the Theory of Planned Behaviour applied to entrepreneurship emergence, which assumes that personal attitude, perceived behavioural control, and social norm influence the way an entrepreneurial career is perceived to be a possible choice. In our model, we originally decided to test for the effects of scenario-based cultural orientations. We administrate a cross-national questionnaire to two samples of students of belonging respectively to an Italian and a Turkish university. Data are finally analysed through PLS-SEM techniques.

The research shows that the decoupling effect exists between the economic growth and carbon dioxide emissions in different provinces and cities of East China. The decoupling index is quite different from one region to another, among which Shanghai and Zhejiang perform best. The predictions suggest that during the 13th Five-Year, Shanghai and Zhejiang will maintain their strong decoupling state with their GDP's growing and carbon dioxide emissions' decreasing. The decoupling index of Fujian and Jiangsu is relatively lower, in the next five years, Fujian will turn into strong decoupling state with decreasing carbon dioxide emissions while carbon dioxide emissions in Jiangsu increases slightly with its average decoupling elasticity value as 0.028, and it's expected to achieve strong decoupling.

The first is direct cost saving. The second occurs if there are urbanisation economies. The third arises if there are city-task level economies of scale (localisation economies), and applies principally to inter-city improvements which enable cities to specialise in particular sectors or tasks. This paper develops an integrated framework which captures these mechanisms and derives multipliers to give their welfare impact. Gains from specialisation and scale economies may be large, although a transport improvement may be a necessary but not sufficient condition for the gains to be achieved.","[Venables, Anthony J.] Dept Econ, Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England",,"Venables, AJ (通讯作者)，Dept Econ, Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",tony.venables@economics.ox.ac.uk,"venables, anthony/JDW-7805-2023","venables, anthony/0000-0003-0251-7479",,,,,28,4,4,0,2,UNIV BATH,BATH,"JRNL OF TRANSPORT ECON & POL CLAVERTON DOWN, BATH BA2 7AY, AVON, ENGLAND",0022-5258,1754-5951,,J TRANSP ECON POLICY,J.

It suggests organisational and individual preventive measures to limit possible attack and can help the victims identify available assistance resources. In order to expand the scientific literature in this area, this study wishes to broaden the field of bullying and harassment research to include after-school teen-sports activities and potential professional athletes. Quantitative analysis method was selected using a developed questionnaire which distinguished bullying and harassment and evaluated prevention methods that were applied in practice. The developed questionnaire helped identify the following topics: bullying and harassment prevalence and characteristics in sports teams, formation of negative opinion and the nature of the sport tasks, physical well-being of team members and consequences. The paper provides empirical conclusions on how bullying and harassment affects youth basketball teams. It is argued that existing conflict management systems are not effectively exploited in the prevention of bullying and harassment. The article expands the literature on bullying and harassment at school age from 8th to grade and provides novel opportunities for problem solving in assessing after-school activities. Research limitations for this investigation, conclusions may lack depth. To address this issue, we proposed to conduct in-depth qualitative studies and evaluation of similar efforts in samples of different ethnic and cultural background. The originality of the study will produce novel results on bullying and harassment in junior relations, the situation in extra-curricular activities basketball teams, where future potential / professional players are developed, revealing the dynamics of relationship between team members, the role of coaches. This represents the lack of utilisation of proven methods in prevention of bullying and harassment for both teams as well as others. This investigation will address the lack of scientific research and create a more meaningful connection between teen sports, bullying and harassment issues.","[Vveinhardt, Jolita] Lithuanian Sports Univ, Inst Sport Sci & Innovat, Sporto Str 6, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Komskiene, Diana] Kaunas Univ Technol, Sch Business & Econ, K Donelaicio G 73, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Komskiene, Diana] Kaunas Univ Technol, Sport Ctr, K Donelaicio G 73, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Romero, Zasha] Univ Texas Pan Amer, Dept Hlth & Kinesiol, 1201 W Univ Dr, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA",Lithuanian Sports University; Kaunas University of Technology; Kaunas University of Technology; University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley,"Vveinhardt, J (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Sports Univ, Inst Sport Sci & Innovat, Sporto Str 6, Kaunas, Lithuania.",Jolita.Vveinhardt@gmail.com; diana.komskiene@ktu.lt; zromero@utpa.edu,"Vveinhardt, Jolita/AAB-6754-2020","Vveinhardt, Jolita/0000-0001-6231-9402",,,,,51,17,18,3,26,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

However, most studies regarded international branding as the advanced stage of enterprise internationalization and consider that in the process of internationalization enterprises continuously improve the capabilities of international marketing and operation to realize the international branding. This study argues that there is an essential difference between the international branding and enterprise internationalization which only considered the international operation of brands and neglected a series of liabilities of newness and liabilities of foreignness caused by the overseas institutional environment as well as adopted the strategic response in response to these systems. Based on the legitimacy perspective of institutional theory, this paper explored the international path of the three telecommunication companies, summarized the main problems and upgrading strategies for each stage of international branding, and hoped to provide theoretical supports for Chinese enterprises and offer practical advices for Chinese managers in the process of international branding.","[Wang, Hui; Wang, Tao] Wuhan Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Mkt, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Tao] Wuhan Univ, Res Ctr Org Mkt, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; Wuhan University,"Wang, T (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Mkt, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.;Wang, T (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Res Ctr Org Mkt, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.",wangtao@whu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71272226, 71532011]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The authors acknowledge the financial support provided by: National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Number: 71272226; 71532011).,,32,2,2,3,42,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Spare part demand is typically unpredictable due to varying service requests. Most companies set a fix period for maintenance and repair. This fixed period of repair model is a waste if the device is in a good condition. To improve the system, this study proposes a flexible return policy using failure rate to forecast the possible stock out time point. Once the specific point is found, the least repair turnaround time (TAT) is set for defective spare part shipment. By this mean, the repaired spare part will arrive at the warehouse to replenish the stock. Similar scenario also applies to the out of warranty period for the dropping service demand. For practical industrial application, this model also considers the last time buy and the defective spare part scrap rate practices.","[Wee, Hui Ming; Wu, Kuo Hsing; Daryanto, Yosef] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Taoyuan 32023, Taiwan; [Daryanto, Yosef] Univ Atma Jaya Yogyakarta, Dept Ind Engn, Yogyakarta 55281, Indonesia",Chung Yuan Christian University; Universitas Atma Jaya Yogyakarta,"Wee, HM (通讯作者)，Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Taoyuan 32023, Taiwan.",weehm@cycu.edu.tw; paul.kh.wu@gmail.com; daryanto@mail.uajy.ac.id,"Daryanto, Yosef/AAI-9076-2020; Wee, H/JXY-0919-2024","Daryanto, Yosef/0000-0001-5761-8600;",,,,,8,1,1,1,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-369-2,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,31,,,,,,154,158,,,,,,5,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK1KF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431849100035,0

In order to provide defensible estimates of unknowns in an analysis, the judgements of multiple experts can be elicited. Mathematical aggregation methods can then be used to combine these individual judgements into a single judgement for the decision maker. However, most mathematical aggregation methods assume that such judgements come from experts who are independent, which is unlikely to be the case in practice. This paper investigates dependence in expert judgement studies, both within and between experts. It provides the most comprehensive analysis to date by considering all studies in the TU Delft database. It then assesses the practical significance of the dependencies identified in the studies by comparing the performances of several mathematical aggregation methods with varying dependence assumptions. Between-expert correlations were more prevalent than within-expert correlations. For studies that contained between-expert correlations, models which include these produced better forecasts. The implications of this for the use of expert judgement in forecasting are discussed. (C) 2016 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Secondly, whether charity foundations' internal governance can effectively reduce agency costs. Our conclusions include: Firstly, the bigger size of the foundation Board of Director, the more beneficial to reduce agency costs. Secondly, it's not conducive to reducing agency costs when the board of director often holds meetings and when chairman and general secretary share the dual identity. Thirdly, charity foundations' Board of Supervisors had no significant effect on reducing agency costs. The current empirical discovery helps to explain the relationship between charity foundations' board of director and board of supervisor and agency cost.

This work deals with the possibility to find the patterns via text mining based on a machine-learning tool known as Instance-Based Learning (IBL). To reduce high computational demands of the basic algorithm IBL-1 (k-nearest neighbors), IBL-2 does not store sample candidates the function of which is successfully carried out by the already stored samples. The textual data are represented as bag-of-words with sparse vectors. Because the non-linearly increasing computational complexity depends on the number of samples as well as on their vocabulary, the potential candidates are firstly freed of common insignificant terms and then the vector sparsity is strongly decreased by removing words having a low frequency in relation to the number of samples. Then, IBL-2 rejects to store samples that duplicate the functionality of the already stored ones. As a result, the database contains only (or mainly) significant samples that represent characteristic patterns, which may be used for classification or another type of a following social network analysis.","[Zizka, Jan; Darena, Frantisek] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Informat, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Svoboda, Arnost] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Appl Math & Comp Sci, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Masaryk University Brno,"Zizka, J (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Informat, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",zizka@mendelu.cz; asvobod@gmail.com,"Dařena, František/E-4945-2018","Dařena, František/0000-0001-8892-4256",Czech Science Foundation [16-26353S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"The research of Jan Zizka and Frantisek Darena was funded by the Czech Science Foundation, grant No. 16-26353S Sentiment and Its Impact on Stock Markets.",,15,0,0,0,1,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-499-5,,,,2017,,,,,,,971,980,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ7IS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427306200100,0

We study the optimal precontractual arrangement offers of an upstream monopolist producing an essential input that may sell to two vertically differentiated downstream firms. These arrangements concern the exclusivity and the contingency of the contracts to be signed. Once the precontractual arrangements have been determined, the terms of the contracts are negotiated between the upstream supplier and the downstream firm(s). The distribution of bargaining power during the contract terms negotiations is the main driving force of the monopolist's choices. A powerful supplier always opts for an exclusive contract. By contrast, a weaker supplier offers nonexclusive contracts and makes each of them contingent or noncontingent such as to guarantee the most favorable outside option in its negotiations.","[Bacchiega, Emanuele] Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Sci Econ, Alma Mater Studiorum, Bologna, Italy; [Bonroy, Olivier] Univ Grenoble Alpes, INRA, UMR GAEL, Grenoble, France; [Petrakis, Emmanuel] Univ Crete, Dept Econ, Rethimnon, Greece",University of Bologna; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); INRAE; University of Crete,"Bacchiega, E (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Sci Econ, Alma Mater Studiorum, Bologna, Italy.",emanuele.bacchiega@unibo.it; olivier.bonroy@inra.fr; petrakis@uoc.gr,"petrakis, emmanuel/M-9330-2015","petrakis, emmanuel/0000-0003-1273-8099; BACCHIEGA, EMANUELE/0000-0002-7822-6486; Bonroy, Olivier/0000-0002-3589-1961",,,,,54,4,4,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

On the one hand, observable external CSR (e.g., a firm's involvement in a social project) can be used as a signal to unobservable product quality. On the other hand, internal CSR (e.g., human resources practices such as training and labor stability) can improve a firm's labor productivity, specially in firms supplying high quality. We show that CSR may serve as a tool for a firm's product differentiation strategy, finding that both internal and external CSR enhance a firm's product quality. Moreover, this implies the existence of complementarity between internal and external CSR (they mutually reinforce each other) through product quality. We test our theoretical results with data from the hotel industry where we show that hotel establishments with a higher product quality are indeed more likely to be socially responsible, both internally and externally, indicative of the existence of complementarity.","[Calveras, Aleix] Univ Illes Balears, Dept Business Econ, Cra Valldemossa Km 7, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain; [Ganuza, Juan-Jose] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Business, Barcelona, Spain",Universitat de les Illes Balears; Pompeu Fabra University,"Calveras, A (通讯作者)，Univ Illes Balears, Dept Business Econ, Cra Valldemossa Km 7, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain.",aleix.calveras@uib.es,"Calveras, Aleix/K-9313-2017","Calveras, Aleix/0000-0003-2338-5356",,,,,34,23,24,3,67,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

J,"Cortiel, J",,,,"Cortiel, Jeanne",,,Risk and Feminist Utopia: Radicalizing the Future,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Risk has taken over the world as the major way of conceptualizing the future as bleak, if one follows Ulrich Beck's claim in World at Risk (2007). However, there is also a distinctly utopian strand in American risk discourse, one that has, from the outset, been linked to feminist perspectives. Indeed, when risk entered American culture in the 19(th) century, immediately women's rights philosophy began to draw on futures shaped by risk, establishing self-ownership and agency in a context that denied such freedom to women and non-white men. This article explores connections between risk, futurity, agency, and selfhood as expressed in feminist thought, drawing a line between Margaret Fuller's political essay Woman in the Nineteenth Century (1845), Joanna Russ's science fiction novel The Female Man (1975), and Mary Daly's radical feminist manifesto Quintessence: Realizing the Archaic Future (1998). The aim is not to develop a narrative of development but to see how risk has become useful in shaping distinctly feminist visions of the future. More specifically, I would like to see how risk-taking has enabled feminist social dreaming. It is precisely this groundedness in risk that allows feminist utopian visions to remain productive in popular culture beyond feminist discourse. When, for example, the movie Alien (1979, dir. Ridley Scott) introduced a female protagonist to a science fiction/horror action plot, it drew on feminist utopian narrative patterns grounded in risk and risk-taking. Feminist utopian visions as well as their continuations in popular culture thus bring out the subversive potential of risk for feminist theory and practice.","[Cortiel, Jeanne] Univ Bayreuth, North Amer Studies, Bayreuth, Germany",University of Bayreuth,"Cortiel, J (通讯作者)，Univ Bayreuth, North Amer Studies, Bayreuth, Germany.",jeanne.cortiel@uni-bayreuth.de,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Specifically, the focus is on the perceptions and emotions of public towards the cruise company involved in a negative event and its corporate communication strategies via traditional and/or social media. We then investigate the impact and change in information diffusion, in presence/absence of social media among the communication tools. Drawing on the Social Mediated Crisis Communication Model (SMCC), a research design based on a questionnaire submitted online via blogs and other social media and on an Agent Based Simulation (ABS) model has been developed. The results show that accommodative messages seem to better reassure and comfort public, rather than defensive announcements and social media may support cruise companies to communicate in a more effective way in a crisis context. In the diffusion of information social media present, instead, a multiplier effect, combined with a flattening effect. This contribution presents some valuable research implications, useful for researchers and academics, but also professionals may benefit from this knowledge in the planning of crisis communication strategies.","[Penco, Lara] Univ Genoa, Strateg Management & Corp Strategy, Dept Econ & Business Studies, Genoa, Italy; [Penco, Lara] Italian Ctr Excellence Logist Transports & Infras, CIELI, Genoa, Italy; [Profumo, Giorgia] Univ Genoa, Mkt & Strateg Management, Dept Econ & Business Studies, Genoa, Italy; [Remondino, Marco] Univ Genoa, Business Management & Corp Finance, Dept Econ & Business Studies, Via Francesco Vivaldi 5, I-16126 Genoa, Italy",University of Genoa; University of Genoa; University of Genoa,"Remondino, M (通讯作者)，Univ Genoa, Business Management & Corp Finance, Dept Econ & Business Studies, Via Francesco Vivaldi 5, I-16126 Genoa, Italy.",marco.remondino@gmail.com,"Remondino, Marco/AAB-7988-2020; Profumo, Giorgia/J-7950-2019","Profumo, Giorgia/0000-0001-7110-9204; PENCO, LARA/0000-0001-7208-1936; REMONDINO, MARCO/0000-0002-1081-3537",,,,,72,2,2,2,24,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

Aim: The main aim with this analysis is to determine the advantages of adjustments to the thresholds and taxable income brackets in SA on revenue collected, tax efficiency, and progressivity as part of a broader tax reform effort. Setting: Currently such changes mainly consist of adjustments to tax brackets and thresholds to account for inflation, although since the 2017/2018 budget, such adjustments have been minimised as a result of the widening in the budget deficit. Methods: The tax brackets and thresholds for the 2005/2006 fiscal year are used as a base from which changes are implemented. Besides the base scenario, two other scenarios are simulated, based on that of South Africa's peers (lower levels). Simulations are done with the MS tax model. Results: The research shows that instead of only allowing for inflation adjustments, the alignment of income brackets and thresholds to levels closer to those of South Africa's peers could be beneficial with an improvement in the efficiency of the income tax regime. More individuals could be included into the tax net, albeit at (on average) lower tax scales resulting in a marginal loss in revenue. Although such an adjustment could be interpreted as being more regressive and, therefore, negative from a 'tax fairness' perspective, the Personal Income Tax (PIT) burden expressed as the PIT and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ratio would be slightly lower. Conclusion: The possible result would be an improvement in tax liability and economic growth which could in turn fuel personal income and, therefore, revenue collected from this important tax source. This would compensate for the initial loss in PIT.","[Jordaan, Yolande; Schoeman, Nicolaas J.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Jordaan, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa.",yolande.jordaan@live.co.za,,"Jordaan, Yolanda/0000-0001-7540-6070",,,,,32,1,1,1,4,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

We therefore propose a new approach that combines the bagging, exponential smoothing and clustering methods. The existing methods use bagging to generate and aggregate groups of forecasts in order to reduce the variance. However, none of them consider the effect of covariance among the group of forecasts, even though it could have a dramatic impact on the variance of the group, and therefore on the forecast accuracy. The proposed approach, referred to here as Bagged.Cluster.ETS, aims to reduce the covariance effect by using partitioning around medoids (PAM) to produce clusters of similar forecasts, then selecting several forecasts from each cluster to create a group with a reduced variance. This approach was tested on various different time series sets from the M3 and CIF 2016 competitions. The empirical results have shown a substantial reduction in the forecast error, considering sMAPE and MASE. (C) 2018 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In principle, property owners should be willing to pay (WTP) an amount equal to the perceived benefit, if this positive externality is internalized by them following some pricing mechanism. In this paper, we analyze the willingness of residents to financially support improvements in the resilience to extreme events of the transportation system in New York City. Choice microdata was collected for over 1500 residents of the metropolitan NYC area. Several logit-type models were estimated and the preferred model was a discrete-continuous heterogeneity mixture that allows for the derivation of flexible distributions of willingness to pay. Using hypothetical scenarios of recovery, the annual willingness to pay for individuals who missed work ands self identify as politically liberal ranges from $120 to $775, whereas for those individuals that were not directly affected the range is $15-$50.","[Wang, Chen; Sun, Jiayi; Russell, Roddy, Jr.; Daziano, Ricardo A.] Cornell Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Daziano, RA (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",daziano@cornell.edu,"Daziano, Ricardo A/N-4604-2014",,"UTRC/RF [49198-21-26]; Center for Transportation, Environment, and Community Health (CTECH)","UTRC/RF; Center for Transportation, Environment, and Community Health (CTECH)","This research was partly supported by UTRC/RF Grant No: 49198-21-26 (data collection and main analysis) as well as by the Center for Transportation, Environment, and Community Health (CTECH) (technical work to produce the postprocessed willingess to pay estimates).

Examples include tying merger approval to firm commitments to engage in conceptually unrelated build-outs and other projects of political importance. This linking of issues has several effects, the most prominent being (a) tying regulatory issues changes the outcomes obtained, plausibly in predictable ways; (b) tying in some circumstances allows regulators to extend their authority to issues for which they have little or no legal authority; and (c) tied regulatory bargaining fails to produce valid legal precedent for firm decision making.

To achieve other goals, such as a high service quality, ridership growth, or building trusting partnerships between public transport operators and public transport authorities (PTAs), however, more cooperative governance instruments may be suitable. One proposition is to use competitive tendering only occasionally but keep the threat to apply it whenever necessary; thereby, it is assumed that operators behave as if there were competition for the market. In addition, PTAs can overcome information asymmetries and establish effective benchmarking schemes. This paper empirically assesses this indirect effects of (the threat of) competition on cost efficiency using stochastic cost frontier analysis with a panel data set containing more than 850 concessionary regional bus lines in Switzerland from 2008 to 2017. Results show that inefficiency is indeed lower for bus lines where any indirect effect of competitive tendering can be assumed. Although preliminary, these findings indicate that a more flexible use of competitive tendering and its combination with other, rather cooperative governance instruments such as negotiations could support PTAs pursuing cost efficiency as well as additional goals and thereby maximise overall welfare.","[Wegelin, Philipp] Lucerne Univ Appl Sci & Arts Business, Inst Tourism, Competence Ctr Mobil, POB 2940, CH-6002 Luzern, Switzerland",,"Wegelin, P (通讯作者)，Lucerne Univ Appl Sci & Arts Business, Inst Tourism, Competence Ctr Mobil, POB 2940, CH-6002 Luzern, Switzerland.",philipp.wegelin@hslu.ch,,"Wegelin, Philipp/0000-0002-7231-0302",Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts - Business,Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts - Business,"The author is very grateful for data provision by the BAV and the valuable support by Mr. Thusheepan Thevarajah.

J,"Whelan, S; Hally, M",,,,"Whelan, Shane; Hally, Maeve",,,An Analysis of Taxation Supports for Private Pension Provision in Ireland,ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The size and distribution of the taxation supports for private pension provision has been a contentious issue. Research produced or commissioned by representative groups of the pensions industry in Ireland maintains that the tax supports are merely tax deferment, and the effective tax relief is lower than the 'headline' relief on pension contributions. Research by the OECD, on the other hand, suggests that pension savings are essentially tax free to the majority of pension savers. This paper estimates the value of the favourable tax treatment to private pensions provision, expressed as a percentage of the original amount invested, and analyses how it varies with income level, gender, saving period, and other factors. The net effective tax relief on pension savings on each Euro invested in a private pension is estimated by comparing the increase in the present value of pension savings over the lifetime of the individual when compared to other savings. We report that the net effective relief is considerably higher than estimated by the widely cited industry research, and depends on the value of the pension fund at retirement. We identify three distinct groups of individuals in the current regime of incentivising pension savings: those on low incomes who are offered no incentive, the standard rate tax-payers where the net effective tax relief is about 25-30 per cent, and the higher rate tax-payers where the net effective relief is about 31-51 per cent. We argue that current regressive taxation supports for pension savings should be reformed, and reformed before the proposed imminent introduction of an auto-enrolment retirement saving scheme.","[Whelan, Shane] Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [Hally, Maeve] Univ Coll Cork, Cork, Ireland",University College Dublin; University College Cork,"Whelan, S (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",shane.whelan@ucd.ie,,,,,,,57,1,1,0,4,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

N.; van Vuuren, Gary W.; Heymans, Andre",,,Exploring contingent convertible bond alternatives for African banks,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,DEBT,"Background: A variant of the contingent convertible bond, first proposed in 2011, is investigated: the Call Option Enhanced Reverse Convertible (COERC). Although issued as a bond, it converts to new shareholder's equity if a bank's market share of capital falls below a pre-specified trigger point. Aim: COERCs avoid the problems with market-based triggers (e.g. sell-offs and death spirals) due to panic and market manipulation. Banks that issue COERCs have less incentive to choose investments that may be subject to large losses and disincentive problems, associated with the replenishment of shareholder's equity after market declines (also known as debt overhang) are also avoided. Setting: Proposed amendments to the COERC structure are suggested for the African market. Methods: The data used were simulated, stylised values for a standard COERC. No market parameters are required, such as equity or debt levels or market volatility. Details of the stylised example are provided in Table 4 and Table 5 in the 'results and discussion' section. Results: Both examples of floating coupons for COERCS would aid in the objective of issuing a security that is countercyclical in nature, as banks would avoid having to pay coupons in times of distress. Conclusion: In addition to the recommendations of the Basel frameworks, CoCos have been considered and proposed as an additional measure to promote counter cyclicality in terms of capital composition in banks.","[Liebenberg, Francois J.

The harvested small-sized trees are commonly disposed of through pile burning on the site due to their low market values. We assessed the environmental and health benefits of using small diameter wood from the fuels-reduction treatments as a renewable energy source for electricity production to increase forest health and environmental quality. Our study area was located in northern Arizona within the Four Forest Restoration Initiative project area. We investigated eight air pollutants, projected stand conditions, calculated pollutant emissions from power generators and assessed damage costs from power production. We further used life cycle assessments to investigate emissions from feedstock production, transportation and power generation. Our life cycle assessment results indicate that the annual total damage costs of three treatment-energy scenarios, 1) no thin-coal, 2) thin & pile burning-coal, and 3) thin-bioenergy, are $978,157, $1,732,300 and $43,216, respectively. We determined that in comparison with the no-action (no thin-coal) scenario, the total environmental and health damage cost avoided by utilizing removed woody biomass for the yearly output of a 1 MW (megawatt) power plant was $934,941 annually.","[Huang, Ching-Hsun] No Arizona Univ, Sch Forestry, 200 East Pine Knoll Dr,POB 15018, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Bagdon, Benjamin A.] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Dept 1499, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Northern Arizona University; Colorado State University,"Huang, CH (通讯作者)，No Arizona Univ, Sch Forestry, 200 East Pine Knoll Dr,POB 15018, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",Ching.Huang@nau.edu; ben.bagdon@colostate.edu,,,"Biomass Research and Development Initiative of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2016-10008-25636]","Biomass Research and Development Initiative of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture","The authors thank Bob Yokelson with Department of Chemistry, University of Montana for his help in calculating emission factors from pile burning.

While their capacity for mobility is lower, low-income households in outer suburban areas are nonetheless mobile. Their capacities in this domain should not be underestimated or overlooked. They can command a set of alternative practices or expedients to deal with car-related economic stress by a set of resources derived essentially from spatial proximity. This article aims to present and analyse the diversity of these expedients for the case of outer suburban areas around Paris and Dijon. The analysis of mobility adjustments by low-income households is based on interviews of 45 households in 2011. Our results show that mobility expedients make it possible for low-income households to continue to reside in car dependent areas by reducing their trips and by using local resources and networks to lower the costs of their car dependency. The contribution of our work is to show the intensity of these practices, which create a structured and collectively or socially built alternative system to solo car use.","[Chevallier, Leslie Belton] IFSTTAR, AME DEST, 14-20 Blvd Newton, F-77447 Champs Sur Marne 2, Marne La Vallee, France; [Motte-Baumvol, Benjamin] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, UMR TheMA 6049, CNRS, 4 Blvd Gabriel, F-21000 Dijon, France; [Fol, Sylvie] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, CNRS, UMR Geog Cites 8504, Inst Geog, 191 Rue St Jacques, F-75005 Paris, France; [Jouffe, Yves] Univ Paris Est, LAB URBA, 14-20 Blvd Newton, F-77447 Champs Sur Marne 2, Marne La Vallee, France",Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Bourgogne; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Universite Gustave-Eiffel,"Chevallier, LB (通讯作者)，IFSTTAR, AME DEST, 14-20 Blvd Newton, F-77447 Champs Sur Marne 2, Marne La Vallee, France.",leslie.belton-chevallier@ifsttar.fr; benjamin.motte@u-bourgogne.fr; sylvie.fol@univ-paris1.fr; yves.jouffe@gmail.com,,"Belton Chevallier, Leslie/0000-0003-3752-9410; Motte-Baumvol, Benjamin/0000-0003-4047-4852","Plan Urbanisme Construction et Architecture (PUCA) of the French Ministry of the Environment, Energy and the Sea","Plan Urbanisme Construction et Architecture (PUCA) of the French Ministry of the Environment, Energy and the Sea","This research was financed from 2010 to 2012 under the Plan Urbanisme Construction et Architecture (PUCA) of the French Ministry of the Environment, Energy and the Sea.

While crowding is found to influence residential quality and visitor experience and crowding perception models show some agreement on influential determinants, research is typically limited to a single setting, therefore minimising generalisability. To account for contextual effects, this paper tested a crowding perception model in two study areas: Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and Antwerp, Belgium. The results confirm that while most variables from earlier studies are significant, their effect on crowding perception depends largely on environmental context, with elements such as street layout, primary functionality of the area, and local culture affecting strength and direction of the relationship. The study reveals the importance of a case based approach to crowding perception, while demonstrating the overall applicability of the methodology and the possibilities of comparative analyses to suggest policy recommendations for specific areas.","[Neuts, Bart] Auckland Univ Technol, Sch Hospitality & Tourism, Private Bag 92006, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Vanneste, Dominique] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Celestijnenlaan 200e Bus 2409, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium",Auckland University of Technology; KU Leuven,"Neuts, B (通讯作者)，Auckland Univ Technol, Sch Hospitality & Tourism, Private Bag 92006, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.",bneuts@aut.ac.nz; dominique.vanneste@ees.kuleuven.be,"Neuts, Bart/E-4668-2017","Neuts, Bart/0000-0002-6518-650X",,,,,77,12,12,5,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

The results show that the level of municipal transparency influences budget forecast deviations in tax revenues and current expenditures. On the one hand, less transparent municipalities overestimate their revenues, allowing them to provide more public services without an immediate increase in taxes. On the other, these local governments, which are aware of the overestimation of their revenues, may spend less than they budgeted. More transparent municipalities, meanwhile, seem to be more prudent in their revenue estimations, since they underestimate their revenues, meaning they can spend more than projected.

The asymmetric pricing is marked in periods of decreasing capacity when the increases of fuel price are passed at a higher degree than fuel cost savings. In contrast, when capacity increases the asymmetry is lowered. Moreover, we show that highly competitive markets are characterized by a lower price asymmetry compared to low competition markets.

This paper reviews, based on a broad range of academic milestone publications, how German scholars have moved forward research frontiers in the field of knowledge, innovation and technology geographies. Which marks did this country's economic geographers leave on the advancement of conceptual ideas, yet which topics were neglected? And how have they engaged in producing convincing empirical evidence for conceptualized developments? In which ways have German researchers ventured towards informing and supporting effective policies of innovation oriented regional or national development? Conclusively, which qualities can be discerned that specifically mark a 'German' approach towards economic geography research on knowledge, innovation and new technologies, telling about strengths and weaknesses with respect to being noticed internationally? Exploring these questions, the paper offers a structured review of exemplary works published in German or English language and points out some distinctive nation-specific features and topical achievements of economic geography research.","[Fromhold-Eisebith, Martina] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Chair Econ Geog, Templergraben 55, D-52056 Aachen, Germany",RWTH Aachen University,"Fromhold-Eisebith, M (通讯作者)，Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Chair Econ Geog, Templergraben 55, D-52056 Aachen, Germany.",m.fromhold-eisebith@geo.rwth-aachen.de,"CORREA, RENATA/AAA-2417-2022",,,,,,130,2,2,2,21,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

Economic theory suggests that such laws will lead to changes in providers' behaviors. We use data on licensed specialty SUD treatment providers in the United States between 1997 and 2010 in a differences-in-differences analysis. During this period, 12 states implemented laws that require equality in coverage for SUD treatment. Following the passage of a state parity law, we find that providers are less likely to participate in public markets, are less likely to offer price discounts to patients, and increase the quantity of health care provided. Further, we find evidence of decreases in treatment intensity following passage of a parity law and of heterogeneity in effects across ownership status.","[Maclean, Johanna Catherine; Stern, Elisheva R.] Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Popovici, Ioana] Nova Southeastern Univ, Ft Lauderdale, FL 33314 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; Nova Southeastern University,"Maclean, JC (通讯作者)，Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",,,,,,,,78,11,11,0,6,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

While this statement has been contested, its validity is clear from an encompassing framework that considers the history of racially motivated laws and practices and moral panics among whites who have blamed drug-related social problems and crime on marginalized racial groups. We develop a holistic and reproductive approach to understanding racial oppression by analyzing racial meanings and structural racism related to the War on Drugs. To uncover structural racism, we propose a framework that captures the relationship between drug policies and enforcement practices, racialized mass incarceration, the distribution of resources, and the reproduction of racial oppression in the United States. To examine racial meanings, we present findings from an in-depth content analysis of newspaper articles and digital media discussing the War on Drugs. Based on over 30 years of news content394 op-eds, letters to the editor, and news articles and 3,145 comments drawn from the comments sections of online news articleswe argue that criminal justice practices and the distribution of racial meanings through the media act as racialized structuring mechanisms. We demonstrate how those mechanisms work in tandem to strengthen and naturalize the connection between racial groups and unequal social positions. We uncover how dominant racial meanings act as symbolic resources that maintain forms of structural racism such as the War on Drugs. Finally, we discuss the benefits of our approach and suggest relevant and necessary future research and practices.","[Rosino, Michael L.; Hughey, Matthew W.] Univ Connecticut, Sociol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Hughey, Matthew W.] Nelson Mandela Univ, Crit Studies Higher Educ Transformat, Port Elizabeth, South Africa; [Hughey, Matthew W.] Univ Warwick, Inst Adv Study, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Hughey, Matthew W.] Univ Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa; [Hughey, Matthew W.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [Hughey, Matthew W.] Columbia Univ, Ctr Study Ethn & Race, New York, NY 10027 USA",University of Connecticut; Nelson Mandela University; University of Warwick; University of the Free State; Trinity College Dublin; Columbia University,"Rosino, ML (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Sociol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",michael.rosino@uconn.edu; matthew.hughey@uconn.edu,,"Hughey, Matthew/0000-0002-6456-5663",,,,,162,29,45,0,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

An information shock is defined in this paper as a random variable that contains the set of information made available between two consecutive forecasting exercises and that has been incorporated into a revised forecast for a fixed point event. Studying the moments of these information shocks can be useful in understanding how the Bank has changed its assessment of risks surrounding inflation in the light of new information, and how it has modified its forecasts accordingly. The variance of the information shock is interpreted in this paper as a new measure of ex ante inflation uncertainty that measures the uncertainty that the Bank anticipates information perceived in a particular quarter will pose on inflation. A measure of information absorption that indicates the approximate proportion of the information content in a revised forecast that is attributable to information made available since the last forecast release is also proposed.","[Diaz, Carlos] Univ Leicester, Sch Business, Astley Clarke Bldg,Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",University of Leicester,"Díaz, C (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Sch Business, Astley Clarke Bldg,Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",cdv7@leicester.ac.uk,,,,,,,42,0,0,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

The forest-based sector companies operate in international markets and their products feed into a wide range of industrial activities. Increasing role of services as change in the operating environment of these companies can be expected to influence also on the upstream of the forest-based value chains, and better understanding of such developments is needed. This study analyses documents of the EU industrial policy and economic cooperation at international level from the year 2000 onwards, and asks: 1) how the increasing role of services is assessed as part of industrial development, 2) which trends and drivers are identified, and 3) whether and how the issues related to the natural resources base are addressed with regard to this phenomenon. The study concludes that instead of thinking of the increasing role of services as a trend in the external environment of the forest-based sector, it can also be assessed as a symptom of more profound changes underway in the industrial production. The recent industrial policy documents emphasize the new technology-enabled production modes that revolutionize how production, distribution and value capture can be organized. By assessing the developments only with accustomed metrics, such as number and volume of services, important opportunities and challenges may remain unrecognized for the forest-based sector. The paper concludes questions for future research to address this issue. (C) 2017 Department of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Umea. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

This paper utilizes Engel-Granger procedure, Johansen-Juselius cointegration methodology and granger causality test to analyze this relationship. Our empirical results show no long run co-integration relationship between both but short run unidirectional causality running from air passenger traffic to GDP This study also provides reasonable evidence to support aviation-led growth hypothesis for Singapore.

The strength or the degree of the network externality has serious implications on the overall value or quality of the digital product. We focus on a situation where the degree of network externality of the product is a strategic choice of a digital firm that faces a commercial pirate that produces a lower quality of that product. We characterize the strategic response of the original firm to the pirate. We find the profit-maximizing degree of network externality chosen by the original firm under any cost environment and relative quality difference between the original and pirated good. Market structure and market coverage are endogenously determined in the model, which has implications with respect to piracy. We show that the relationship between profit-maximizing degree of network externality and the relative quality difference between the products can be monotonic or non-monotonic.

Nash equilibria of the game in which both the network externality and the low quality are chosen simultaneously are also derived.","[Lu, Yuanzhu] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Econ & Management Acad, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Poddar, Sougata] Univ Redlands, Sch Business, Redlands, CA 92373 USA",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Poddar, S (通讯作者)，Univ Redlands, Sch Business, Redlands, CA 92373 USA.",yuanzhulu@cufe.edu.cn; sougata_poddar@redlands.edu,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71202127]; Program for Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics,"We are extremely grateful for the detailed comments and thoughtful suggestions from the editor of the journal and two anonymous referees on earlier versions that helped us to significantly improve the paper.

It means that replication of individual knowledge and skills are more important than replication of routines. Restaurateurs who came from other related industries did not bring something special from their former jobs in their restaurants. In addition, new restaurants benefit differently from extra-firm relations (with respect to attracting capital, monitoring other restaurants, finding chefs and cooks, relations with suppliers and media) during their start-up process and thereafter.

The main objective of this study is to examine the extent to which domestic investment has contributed to the growth of the industrial output in Nigeria from the period of 1985 till 2016. Secondary data were collected from the CBN Statistical Bulletin and National Bureau of Statistics. Data of this study were conducted using Phillip Perron (PP) test at levels and at first difference. Variables such as gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), Lending rate (LR), gross domestic savings (GDS) and distribution of loans and advances to the industrial sector (IDCL). Hypothesis was formulated and tested using augmented Toda Yamamoto estimate. Evidence from the result shows that there exists an inverse relationship between GFCF and IGDP; LR estimates show a direct positive relationship with IGDP but not significant in the long run. Detailed analysis of GDS reveals a significant direct relationship with IGDP at 1% level significance and finally, IDCL indicates a significant direct relationship between IGDP. The study further carried out some diagnostic test such as co-integration test with bound testing approach, and Autogressive Toda Yamamoto (ATY) Joint Statistic with the modified Wald test.

The findings support the contention that the benefits to FRQ of an independent and competent internal audit function are not realized when there is CEO involvement in the appointment of the CAE, since management is able to override IA controls. Indeed, high FRQ is only evident when the CEO is not involved in the appointment. The results are found to be robust after using two different methods of estimation, and carry the implication regulators concerned with FRQ and quality of internal audit function that the CEO should not be party to the appointment of the CAE since this will depress FRQ.","[Alzeban, Abdulaziz] King Abdulaziz Univ, Community Coll, Business Dept, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",King Abdulaziz University,"Alzeban, A (通讯作者)，King Abdulaziz Univ, Community Coll, Business Dept, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.",aalthebyan@kau.edu.sa,,,,,,,39,6,6,0,13,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Accordingly, nowadays business life necessitates a more positive approach in handling issues regarding leadership and management. This change in focus has contributed to the fame of spiritual leadership which is a holistic leadership approach that can integrate the minds and souls of people and integrates the four main components of human existence: body, mind, heart, and spirit. Spiritual leadership draws from an inner life nourished by spiritual practices that contribute to the development of values, attitudes, and behaviors that are necessary to intrinsically motivate one's self and result in a sense of spiritual well-being. Spiritual leadership creates the sense that life is purposeful and meaningful; thus, under spiritual leaders, followers feel themselves to be more capable and they show continuous growth and self-realization. In our study, we proposed that spiritual leadership would have a positive effect on the psychological capital of followers, which is a human capacity focusing on the strengths of humans rather than weaknesses; i.e., positivity rather than negativity. Also, we supported the idea that spiritual leadership has a positive effect on performance due to its positive effects on cognitive capabilities of leaders' followers and due to the meaningful and alluring vision that entices followers to perform at their best. We expected that the psychological capacity of followers may have a mediator effect in this relationship. We conducted face-to-face and online surveys with 736 white-collar workers in Turkey and we analyzed our data using SEM. Results of the study confirmed our expectations.","[Baykal, Elif] Istanbul Medipol Univ, Medipol Business Sch, Business Adm, Istanbul, Turkey; [Zehir, Cemal] Istanbul Yildiz Tech Univ, Business Management, Managerial & Adm Sci, Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Medipol University,"Baykal, E (通讯作者)，Istanbul Medipol Univ, Medipol Business Sch, Business Adm, Istanbul, Turkey.",enarcikara@medipol.edu.tr; cemalzehir@gmail.com,"zehir, cemal/AAA-5401-2021; Zehir, Cemal/G-3119-2013",,,,,,70,10,13,2,37,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

One of the popular ways to reduce income inequality is through the implementation of Value Added Tax (VAT) despite of many criticisms on its regressive nature. Hence, using a wide data range from 1984 to 2014, we study the impact of VAT on income inequality in both developed and developing countries. Besides, this is the first study that seeks to focus on the moderating role of country governance in enhancing the effect of VAT on income inequality. We use the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) to overcome the endogeneity, autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity issues. The results suggest that the VAT reduces income inequality but the positive effect is contingent upon the existence of a set of good country governance. Countries that have higher quality of bureaucracy, greater democratic accountability, high government stability, effective law and order, low political risk and favourable socioeconomic conditions stand to benefit more from the VAT system in terms of narrowing the income inequality. Therefore, we conclude that better institutions improve the tax collection and public service delivery, which is a crucial element in achieving the economic objective of narrowing the income gap between the wealthy and the poor. This is particularly true in developing countries. Further, the governments in developing countries need to effectively manage the degree of socioeconomic pressure that could distract them from implementing social and economic policies to eradicate poverty and raise the income level of the poor segment of society.","[Chan, Sok-Gee] Univ Malaya, Fac Business & Accountancy, Dept Finance & Banking, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Ramly, Zulkufly] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Kulliyah Econ & Management Sci, Dept Finance, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya; International Islamic University Malaysia,"Chan, SG (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Fac Business & Accountancy, Dept Finance & Banking, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",sokgee@um.edu.my; zul_ramly@iium.edu.my,"Ramly, Zulkufly/AAA-6380-2019; Chan, Sok-Gee/B-8349-2010","Ramly, Zulkufly/0000-0002-5409-5960; Chan, Sok-Gee/0000-0003-0244-4900",Ministry of Education Malaysia [FP034-2014B],"Ministry of Education Malaysia(Ministry of Education, Malaysia)",This work was supported by the Fundamental Research Grant FP034-2014B from the Ministry of Education Malaysia.,,48,2,2,3,19,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Therefore, there seems to be ample room to examine a leadership phenomenon, especially in terms of the leader-employee relationship realm. Consequently, the aim of the paper is to initially validate a research model developed as well as preliminarily verify the following hypotheses: (H1) The quality of the leader-employee relationship is negatively correlated with the employee's turnover intention; (H2) The employee's assessment of the managerial skills has significant positive impact on the leader-employee relationship - this hypothesis means that leader-employee relationship is a mediator variable between the manager's skills and turnover intention; (H3) The quality of the leader-employee relationship is a significant predictor of the employee's turnover intention. The aim has been realized by conducting preliminary studies on the associations between a leader-employee relationship and employees' turnover intention in a private financial sector in Poland (130 employees were surveyed). The multiple linear regression model with lmx7 as predicted variable was used to verify the assumptions made in the research model. The main findings are as follows: the quality of the manager-employee relationship can be a good predictor of the employee's turnover intention, the managerial technical skills are the strongest factor influencing the assessment of the leader-member relationship with regard to elements analyzed, and the quality of the leader-employee relationship is a significant predictor of the employee's turnover intention only for the group of specialists.","[Czesak-Woytala, Katarzyna; Piorkowska, Katarzyna] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Czesak-Woytala, K (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland.",katarzyna.czesak@gmail.com; katarzyna.piorkowska@ue.wroc.pl,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,9,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,713,723,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553201019,0

The proposed system for evaluation of the consolidation of the activities of the regulatory institutions while implementing solutions of e-government allows complete assessment of the factors and criteria, identification of drawbacks of the process and also enables to create decisions for solutions of the problems.","[Davidaviciene, Vida; Raudeliuniene, Jurgita; Vengriene, Elena; Jakubavicius, Arturas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Business Technol & Entrepreneurship, Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Raudeliuniene, J (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Business Technol & Entrepreneurship, Vilnius, Lithuania.",jurgita.raudeliuniene@vgtu.lt,"Jakubavicius, Arturas/AAS-8918-2021; Raudeliuniene, Jurgita/E-7844-2017; Davidaviciene, Vida/L-5303-2018","Jakubavicius, Arturas/0000-0001-7936-5931; Raudeliuniene, Jurgita/0000-0003-4003-0856; Davidaviciene, Vida/0000-0002-0931-0967",,,,,47,5,5,1,10,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The data was collected from entrepreneurs and top executives in high-tech new ventures through an interview survey instrument implemented in China. Factor analysis and multivariate linear regressions were run to test the hypotheses. The Baron and Kenny (1986) mediation model assessment procedure was used to analyze the data. The empirical analysis results of 176 Chinese high-tech new ventures indicate that both effectuation and causation have positive effects on opportunity exploitation and that entrepreneurial capability plays a fully mediating role in the relationship between strategic decision logic and opportunity exploitation. It is also found that in the context of China's transition economy, the interaction effect between effectuation and causation on opportunity exploitation and entrepreneurial capability is insignificant. The research furthers the development of effectuation theory and enriches current literature on entrepreneurial capability by linking strategic decision-making logics to entrepreneurial capability and opportunity exploitation systematically. Moreover, the research has significant managerial implications for high-tech entrepreneurial practices, particularly in transition economies.","[Guo, Runping] Jilin Univ, Sch Management, Dept Technol Econ & Management, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China",Jilin University,"Guo, RP (通讯作者)，Jilin Univ, Sch Management, Dept Technol Econ & Management, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China.",grp0925@163.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71602068, 71620107001]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2017T100215, 2016M601388]",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grant [number 71602068, number 71620107001] and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation under Grant [number 2017T100215, number 2016M601388].",,45,9,15,4,43,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Macroeconomic theories are incomplete, incorrect and changeable: location shifts invalidate the law of iterated expectations and 'rational expectations' are then systematically biased. Empirical macro-econometric models are non constant and mis-specified in numerous ways, so economic policy often has unexpected effects, and macroeconomic forecasts go awry. In place of using just one of the four main methods of deciding between alternative models, theory, empirical evidence, policy relevance and forecasting, we propose nesting 'theory-driven' and 'data-driven' approaches, where theory-models' parameter estimates are unaffected by selection despite searching over rival candidate variables, longer lags, functional forms, and breaks. Thus, theory is retained, but not imposed, so can be simultaneously evaluated against a wide range of alternatives, and a better model discovered when the theory is incomplete.

As follows from the research, in practice every country pursues a different cluster policy, although some common elements and tools can be identified. The form of the cluster policy ensues from variety of the overlapping factors and resources of the individual national economies. The group of the countries under this study shows many similarities in the conduct of the cluster policy, which a mainly stems from the fact that they take the cluster policy of the European Union as the role model. From the data presented in this article, it has been concluded that similarly to the fact that no two identical clusters can be created in different locations, it is also not possible to create one model of the cluster policy that will be always effective.","[Jankowiak, Anna H.] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Int Econ Relat, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Jankowiak, AH (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Int Econ Relat, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",anna.jankowiak@ue.wroc.pl,"Jankowiak, Anna H./I-7901-2016","Jankowiak, Anna H./0000-0001-6208-9387",,,,,26,7,7,0,4,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

We run differences-in-differences specifications in which locations that experience a closure are matched to locations with similar pre-treatment employment levels and trends. The results show that when a plant closes, for each job directly lost in the plant closure, only between 0.6 and 0.7 jobs are actually lost in the local affected industry. These effects are driven by employment expansions in local incumbent firms and, to a lesser extent, by the creation of new firms in the local industry.","[Jofre-Monseny, Jordi] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Jofre-Monseny, Jordi] Univ Barcelona, Inst Econ Barcelona, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Sanchez-Vidal, Maria] Ctr Econ Performance LSE, London WC2A 3PH, England; [Sanchez-Vidal, Maria] Inst Econ Barcelona, London WC2A 3PH, England; [Viladecans-Marsal, Elisabet] Inst Econ Barcelona, Dept Econ, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Viladecans-Marsal, Elisabet] Univ Barcelona, CEPR, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona,"Sánchez-Vidal, M (通讯作者)，Ctr Econ Performance LSE, London WC2A 3PH, England.;Sánchez-Vidal, M (通讯作者)，Inst Econ Barcelona, London WC2A 3PH, England.",M.Sanchez-Vidal@lse.ac.uk,"Jofre-Monseny, Jordi/F-1182-2016","Viladecans-Marsal, Elisabet/0000-0003-3722-2371","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2013-41310, ECO2016-75941-R]; Generalitat de Catalunya [2014SGR420]; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We gratefully acknowledge helpful comments from the Editor, two anonymous referees, Henry Overman, Olmo Silva, Giulia Faggio, Rosa Sanchis-Guarner, and participants at the SERC work in progress seminar, IEB PhD seminar, 2014 SERC Annual Conference, INFER Workshop (Reus), UEA Meeting (Washington, DC), and the 2015 SAE Meeting (Girona).

There is an increasing number of employees believing family responsibilities and work commitments important to balance. Both employers and employees have begun to consider the problem of creating work-life balance and solution possibilities of this problem increasingly important with the presently increasing quality of life. This is an additional reason why companies regularly use family-oriented and family-friendly fringe benefits as motivational tools for their employees. The authors conducted an empirical study in 2018 seeking to answer the question how Hungarian organizations handled this issue. They have examined the misellaneous methods used and the approaches of the topic to study how those could then help employees tackle the occuring problems themselves.

The research was conducted in the form of an on-line questionnaire survey and it was distributed via e-mail. Managers of South Bohemian companies from various branches were targeted and constitute the research set. We had sent out 130 questionnaires and received 27 answers. The data was processed via descriptive statistics and statistic testing of correlations. 37% stated that as of right now they employ Romani; in all cases they constituted 5% of their employees. Reasons why companies do not employ Romani touched on several issues. The main reason was perceived as the unwillingness of Romani workers to be employed in the company (59% answered that it is a very common reason) or be legally employed in general (37%), insufficient education (59%), and wrong qualifications (37%). On the other hand, employers do not think explicitly that they would prefer non-Romani employees or that Romani would not fit into the team. The working characteristics of Romani, such as being on time, being reliable, or communicating, were also not rated negatively. Companies would primarily hire Romani based on good qualifications (70%) and good references (56%). On the other hand the offered system benefits, such as tax advantages, were not perceived positively. Experiences with Romani employees were rated as slightly negative, primarily when it came to work attendance, performance, and behavior. The semantic differential aimed at evaluating the characteristics of Romani also presented a majority of slightly negative evaluations when it came to reliability, diligence, activity, education, and character. A surprising finding was that Romani were not attributed to misusing the system since this stereotype can often be found in the general public discourse in the Czech Republic. Statistical analyses uncovered a significant relationship between experience with hiring Romani and some characteristics, as well as between the experience items.","[Kajanova, Alena; Kmecova, Iveta] Inst Technol & Business, Dept Humanities, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic","Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice","Kajanová, A (通讯作者)，Inst Technol & Business, Dept Humanities, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",kajanova@mail.vstecb.cz; kmecova@mail.vstecb.cz,"Kmecova, Iveta/GYU-7650-2022; Kajanová, doc.

The evaluation of tender results in many cases lacks rigorous methodology and often involves an inherent element of subjectivity. The mathematical models, used to assign weighs to the bid evaluation criteria, may not accurately reflect the outcomes of the valuation prepared as part of the capital budgeting process, which as a consequence, may impair the credibility and objectivity of the company's procurement policy. The problem is further complicated by the difficulties related to operationalisation of the qualitative evaluation criteria. The paper elaborates on the idea that tender bids should be evaluated based on a unique objective function, i.e., the company value. The algorithm presented in the paper supplemented with an elaborated numerical example, gives a step-by-step guidance in the process of the tender results evaluation and presentation, thereby allowing to minimise possible errors and biases. The model may be of considerable interest to the practicing financial managers, as it accords perfectly with the process and concepts of value-based management, and assures the transparency of the tender procedures.","[Mielcarz, Pawel; Osiichuk, Dmytro] Kozminski Univ, Warsaw, Poland",Kozminski University,"Mielcarz, P (通讯作者)，Kozminski Univ, Warsaw, Poland.",pmielcarz@kozminski.edu.pl; dosiichuk@kozminski.edu.pl,"Mielcarz, Pawel/G-4844-2019","Mielcarz, Pawel/0000-0002-3986-1858",,,,,17,0,0,1,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-68285-3; 978-3-319-68284-6,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,133,144,,10.1007/978-3-319-68285-3_11,0.0,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1XS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448589400011,0

Thesis objective: developing recommendations to improve the control function in the Russian companies introducing the lean management system. For this purpose, key changes in managed items and in the composition of control arrangement within the lean management system were studied; the key factors resulting in changes at different management levels were detected. The research methodology is structured so that the distinctive features of lean management and changes in the position and role of control are studied in the beginning in comparison with traditional management. Afterwards, the control function is studied in the companies having successfully introduced the lean management system (Toyota and KAMAZ). In the course of the study, it was found that the role of self-management and self-monitoring of workers is growing in the lean management system on the basis of positive corporate culture coordinated with the company's strategy. At the operational level, the control is based upon an elementary model - comparison with standards. It serves as the basis for implementation of a number of specific instruments of the concept - visual control and integrated quality. For efficient introduction and functioning of lean management, it is necessary to create leadership-based culture targeted at continuous improvement; and the existing systems, technologies and management methods are to be changed (adapted) on this basis. At the same time, the traditional objectives of control are to be transformed depending on the internal structural medium to harmoniously regulate the personnel relationships. To efficiently achieve the objective, the management system should contain both a managerial control system and a cultural instrumentality based on social impact.","[Mullakhmetov, Khanif Sharifzyanovich; Sadriev, Ruslan Duferovich; Krotkova, Ekaterina Vladislavovna; Gabaidullina, Liliia Aleksandrovna] KFU, Naberezhnye Chelny Inst, Naberezhnye Chelny, Russia; [Akhmetshin, Elvir Munirovich] KFU, Elabuga Inst, Yelabuga, Russia",Kazan Federal University; Kazan Federal University,"Mullakhmetov, KS (通讯作者)，KFU, Naberezhnye Chelny Inst, Naberezhnye Chelny, Russia.",mkhsh007@gmail.com; ruslansadr@yandex.ru; nek_m@rambler.ru; liliya142@yandex.ru; elvir@mail.ru,"Akhmetshin, Elvir Munirovich/L-9482-2015","Akhmetshin, Elvir Munirovich/0000-0002-2576-503X; Sadriev, Ruslan/0000-0003-3683-9548",,,,,19,0,0,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,1717,1723,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553202081,0

Even so, the reality of the last years has pointed out numerous discrepancies in terms of cultural background, economic, social or political aspects. Youth employment, as phenomenon able to detract from the normal path of sustainable growth and social cohesion, and the measures undertaken by national governments in order to address school to work transition illustrate important issues to be addressed, given the EU internal heterogeneity and the prominent problem of ageing population. Consequently, the aim of the present study is to analyse the amplitude of youth unemployment among EU economies, including the United Kingdom, as resultant of national policies implemented by the state. Employing a panel data analysis based on a dataset composed by macroeconomic factors, we attempt to investigate the manner in which labour market expenditure policies (highly linked to the educational system model), the minimum wage or real GDP per capita are responsible for the current unemployment rate among European young generation. As results highlight, those countries paying higher attention to education and training, apprenticeship, incentives for youth employment, rehabilitation are the most effective in reducing youth unemployment. Consequently, their real GDP per capita is increasing. Concerning the arbitrary minimum wage established by the state, this illustrates an additional pressure that is worsening unemployment rate, especially when it is closer to the average net wage established upon market principles.","[Mursa, Gabriel Claudiu; Iacobuta, Andreea-Oana; Socoliuc, Oana-Ramona; Clipa, Raluca-Irina] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Bvd Carol I 22, Iasi 700505, Romania; [Butiseaca, Alexandru] Romanian Amer Univ, Sch Domest & Business Banking & Finance, 1B Expozitiei Blvd,Sect 1, Bucharest 012101, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Mursa, GC (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Bvd Carol I 22, Iasi 700505, Romania.",mursa@uaic.ro; andreea_iacobuta@yahoo.com; oanasocoliuc@gmail.com; riclipa@gmail.com; butiseaca.alexandru@profesor.rau.ro,"Socoliuc (Guriță), Oana-Ramona/GOJ-7802-2022; Iacobuta-Mihaita, Andreea-Oana/GJB-6392-2022; Clipa, Raluca/N-1996-2016","Socoliuc (Guriță), Oana-Ramona/0000-0001-5538-6789;",,,,,32,5,5,2,17,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The paper contributes to recent debates on relations between TISs and context, with a focus on how industries located in one country relate to the international TIS. Based on a survey of 102 firms in the offshore wind industry in Norway and semi-structured interviews, we find that even though Norwegian firms link up with international TISs, the lack of a domestic market represents a barrier. However, firms with activities in related industries and large firms are less exposed to this barrier. This poses a challenge as the offshore wind industry in Norway mainly consists of smaller firms. We therefore suggest that policies should aim to stimulate interaction between smaller suppliers and larger firms that potentially can act as intermediaries and provide access to international markets.","[Normann, Hakon Endresen; Hanson, Jens] Univ Oslo, TIK Ctr Technol Innovat & Culture, Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Normann, HE (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, TIK Ctr Technol Innovat & Culture, Oslo, Norway.",h.e.normann@tik.uio.no,,"Normann, Hakon Endresen/0000-0002-1390-0521",Centre for Sustainable Energy Studies (CenSES) from the Research Council of Norway [209697/E20],Centre for Sustainable Energy Studies (CenSES) from the Research Council of Norway,"Research for this paper has been funded by Centre for Sustainable Energy Studies (CenSES), grant 209697/E20 from the Research Council of Norway.",,67,12,12,1,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Customer loyalty is a key prerequisite for a company's success in today's globalised world. Companies now use Facebook extensively to communicate with existing and potential customers. The aim of this article is to determine whether Facebook can be used to build customer loyalty to fan pages and whether this loyalty has an impact on loyalty to promoted brands. The research focused on the Facebook fan pages of high street fashion brands (e.g. H&M, C&A and Orsay) and their fans. Research of the literature was used to posit a theoretical model of fan loyalty to Facebook fan pages in connection with loyalty to clothing brands. This model was tested with the statistical method known as structural equations modelling (SEM). The research involved 292 respondents over the age of 18 who have liked at least one high street fashion fan page on Facebook. The results confirmed the validity of the proposed model. It was found that loyalty to the fan page is built through trust and satisfaction with the fan page. It was also demonstrated that loyalty to the fan page has a positive impact on loyalty to clothing brands. Both loyalties in this model were measured using the second-order method, which includes both behavioural and attitudinal loyalty. It can therefore be said that communication from companies builds a positive relationship with the fan page / clothing brands and also increases the future frequency of page visits and purchases of branded clothes. Hence, Facebook can be deemed an effective tool for building loyalty.","[Novotova, Jitka] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt & Trade, Liberec, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Novotová, J (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt & Trade, Liberec, Czech Republic.",jitka.novotova1@tul.cz,"Burešová, Jitka/HKV-1864-2023","Burešová, Jitka/0000-0002-4055-5102",EF TUL,EF TUL,"This article was created as part of a project to support excellent research teams at the Faculty of Economics of the Technical University of Liberec (EF TUL), which is funded by institutional support for the long-term conceptual development of EF TUL.",,86,11,11,0,33,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Also, Cost Management in NPD is presented here with three important extensions: [1] a vertical internal extension (within the company and across multiple departments); [2] a product life-cycle extension (from Target Costing to Kaizen Costing or vice versa); [3] extension of TC or KC to the downstream and upstream of the company (external cost management, which occurs mainly with suppliers but also with clients).

Street names reflect the cumulative commemorative decisions of municipalities and, as such, can be used as proxies for their social and cultural characteristics, which is particularly useful given the scarcity of cultural data at the local level. The utility of street names as a data source is illustrated through the study of religiosity and local economic development. The street-name indicator of religiosity is shown to be strongly correlated with the cultural factor it is supposed to capture, and appears to be negatively related to economic development at the local level.

Based on archival research and interviews with bankers, regulators and legislators, we demonstrate how the EU convergence narrative was central in forming optimistic expectations. Fusing the underspecified convergence process with an orientalist geographical imaginary, this narrative and its associated measures translated growing indebtedness as catching up' with Europe, de-emphasized exchange rate risk through a belief in European convergence and precluded crisis scenarios originating in the European Union. Our findings contribute to theories of how economic expectations are formed, stabilized and maintained by developing the concept of spatializing the future', denoting practices that handle uncertainty by charting the future as movement in concrete geographical or abstract space, along externally verifiable pathways.","[Pellandini-Simanyi, Lena] Univ Svizzera Italiana, Inst Management & Org, Via Buffi 6, CH-6904 Lugano, Switzerland; [Pellandini-Simanyi, Lena] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Budapest, Hungary; [Vargha, Zsuzsanna] ESCP Europe Business Sch, Management Control Dept, 79 Ave Republ, F-75543 Paris 11, France; [Vargha, Zsuzsanna] Univ Leicester, Leicester, Leics, England",Universita della Svizzera Italiana; Eotvos Lorand University; heSam Universite; ESCP Business School; University of Leicester,"Pellandini-Simányi, L (通讯作者)，Univ Svizzera Italiana, Inst Management & Org, Via Buffi 6, CH-6904 Lugano, Switzerland.;Pellandini-Simányi, L (通讯作者)，Eotvos Lorand Univ, Budapest, Hungary.",pellal@usi.ch; zvargha@escpeurope.eu,"Vargha, Zsuzsanna/ABH-2955-2021","Vargha, Zsuzsanna/0000-0002-1578-6531; Pellandini-Simanyi, Lena/0000-0002-5426-4103",Hungarian Scientific Research Funds [101261]; Bolyai Research grant [BO/00653/15]; Swiss National Science Foundation [171351],Hungarian Scientific Research Funds(Orszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok (OTKA)); Bolyai Research grant(Hungarian Academy of Sciences); Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"This work was supported by the Hungarian Scientific Research Funds under Grant [101261], by the Bolyai Research grant [BO/00653/15] and by the Swiss National Science Foundation [171351].",,91,9,9,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Nevertheless, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) often fail to incorporate such tools, since they attribute a low value to risk management tools and because implementation is complex and costly. Most of the existing risk management tools are or at least seem therefore impractical for SME's. Recent literature copes with the different approaches SMEs and large companies choose regarding project management as well as the management of associated risks. However, this stream of research fails to address how SMEs can successfully carry out risk management as an integral part of project management. The overarching project PRiMa-Q, related to this study, therefore aims to develop a framework and implement a pre-competitive tool to quantitatively manage project related risks in SMEs by identifying risks, quantifying them as well as anticipating the resulting consequences. This paper presents the results of the first milestone of this project, namely a survey on the current state of risk management in relation to the size of the respondents companies. The survey's design is based on extensive literature research, gathered insights in project meetings as well as the generated feedback in the survey's pretest phase (N=110). The final survey was targeted at firms located in Germany and Belgium and was therefore available in English, French and German. The results of the survey show that SMEs indeed need separate tools for risk management, because their routine business as well as their resources are not compatible with current software solutions, which are predominantly aimed at large companies. This study establishes the bases for the subsequent development of a pre-competitive tool to manage project related risks in SMEs.","Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Cybernet Lab, Inst Informat Management Mech Engn IMA, Aachen, Germany; Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Assoc Inst Management Cybernet IfU, Aachen, Germany",RWTH Aachen University; RWTH Aachen University,"Plumanns, L (通讯作者)，Cybernet Lab IMA, Dennewartstr 27, D-52068 Aachen, Germany.;Plumanns, L (通讯作者)，IfU, Dennewartstr 27, D-52068 Aachen, Germany.",lana.plumanns@ima-ifu.rwth-aachen.de,,,PRiMa-Q research project (ERA-NET CORNET) [EN183]; German Federation of Industrial Research Associations (AiF) based on an enactment of the German Bundestag,PRiMa-Q research project (ERA-NET CORNET); German Federation of Industrial Research Associations (AiF) based on an enactment of the German Bundestag,"This research was conducted as part of the PRiMa-Q research project (ERA-NET CORNET, Grant Nr.

In the latter period, the analysis focused mainly on what were then termed the Third World Countries, and the question of sustainable development was largely questioned about the vicious circles of poverty and economic backwardness that seemed to be offer suboptimal performance to many regions in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Research on third world countries has shown that they have advanced in the 1970s and 1980s, development theorists have begun to recognize that at least some of these areas have been sensitive to significant industrialization and have appropriately added the notion of new industrialized countries to include them in the theoretical repertoire. More recently, the issue of development has shifted in ways that reinforce the most advanced economies in its scope. This trend is particularly emphasized in the writings of new growth theorists, with emphasis on positive externalities as a major source of economic development and this is the path through which this research article carries on. Some authors discuss globalization in terms of benefits and acceptance or non-acceptance (Burlacu, S., Gutu, C., & Matei, F. O., 2018). The purpose of this article is to illustrate the pressure of development on globalization as it emerges from economics theory. The main research method was the investigation of the specialized literature as well as the secondary documentary analysis.","[Radulescu, Carmen Valentina] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Radulescu, CV (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",cv_radulescu@yahoo.com,"Radulescu, Carmen Valentina/P-6654-2015","Radulescu, Carmen Valentina/0000-0002-9971-9618",,,,,17,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,1496,1502,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553202053,0

Instrumental variables related to neighbouring countries' populations are used to address the endogeneity between posting and labour market features. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that an intensification of posting inflows is not likely to displace domestic workers, at any educational levels. Instead, an increase in posting from abroad may raise domestic labour costs. No significant effects are found on sending country labour market variables. Results point towards the development of possible synergies between domestic and posted workers, so that posting can actually improve labour efficiency and put upward pressure on labour costs.","[Dalla Pellegrina, Lucia] Univ Milano Bicocca, DEMS, Piazza Ateneo Nuovo 1,Ed U6, I-20126 Milan, Italy; [Dalla Pellegrina, Lucia] Univ Bocconi, Paolo Baffi Ctr, Piazza Ateneo Nuovo 1,Ed U6, I-20126 Milan, Italy; [Saraceno, Margherita] Univ Milano Bicocca, DEMS, Piazza Ateneo Nuovo 1,Ed U6, I-20126 Milan, Italy; [Saraceno, Margherita] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Ctr Law & Econ, Piazza Ateneo Nuovo 1,Ed U6, I-20126 Milan, Italy",University of Milano-Bicocca; University of Milano-Bicocca; Bocconi University; University of Milano-Bicocca; University of Milano-Bicocca,"Dalla Pellegrina, L (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, DEMS, Piazza Ateneo Nuovo 1,Ed U6, I-20126 Milan, Italy.;Dalla Pellegrina, L (通讯作者)，Univ Bocconi, Paolo Baffi Ctr, Piazza Ateneo Nuovo 1,Ed U6, I-20126 Milan, Italy.",lucia.dallapellegrina@unimib.it; margherita.saraceno@unimib.it,,"SARACENO, MARGHERITA/0000-0003-3461-4863","European Community; Paolo Baffi Center, Universita Bocconi","European Community; Paolo Baffi Center, Universita Bocconi","This research was supported by a Marie Curie Intra European Fellowship within the 7th European Community Framework Programme and by Paolo Baffi Center, Universita Bocconi.

Accountability is called for but the 'accounting systems' that validate the right choices in service delivery are not yet thoroughly established. As a response, an impact evaluation via a real-world case study of a multi-modal transport safety agency is presented.

An interesting but unanswered question is: how does air travel delay at various airports along a given itinerary affect consumer choice behavior? Using a methodology that enables us to match airline on-time performance data to passenger itinerary and estimating a discrete choice demand model, this paper finds that increases in flight delay negatively impact the likelihood of choosing a product and that welfare costs of delay to consumers may be substantial. These results are robust across different measures of on-time performance and irrespective of market hauls. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent studies have shown that regional economies tend to diversify into sectors that are related to those already present in the region. However, no study yet has investigated the impact of regional institutions. The objective of the article is to analyze how formal and informal institutions influence regional diversification. Studying 118 European regions in the period 2004-2012, we find evidence that institutions, and especially bridging social capital, matter for regions to diversify into new industries. Our results suggest that regional institutions relevant for diversification in regions are predominantly informal in character rather than formal, and bridging rather than bonding.","[Cortinovis, Nicola; van Oort, Frank G.] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Xiao, Jing] CIRCLE, Solvegatan 16, S-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Boschma, Ron] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Sect Econ Geog, POB 80-115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Boschma, Ron] Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Innovat Studies, Lund, Sweden; [van Oort, Frank G.] Erasmus Univ, Inst Housing & Urban Dev Studies IHS, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Utrecht University; Lund University; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Cortinovis, N (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",cortinovis@ese.eur.nl,"Van Oort, Frank/ABA-9504-2020; Cortinovis, Nicola/P-1474-2018; Cortinovis, Nicola/AAG-9104-2021; Cortinovis, Nicola/ABD-8126-2021","Van Oort, Frank/0000-0003-0614-768X; Cortinovis, Nicola/0000-0003-3985-7530",JPI Urban Europe project 'Resilient Cities: Industrial Network and Institutional perspectives on Economic Growth and Well-Being' [438-13-406],JPI Urban Europe project 'Resilient Cities: Industrial Network and Institutional perspectives on Economic Growth and Well-Being',"Funding support by JPI Urban Europe project 'Resilient Cities: Industrial Network and Institutional perspectives on Economic Growth and Well-Being (grant 438-13-406)' is acknowledged by Ron Boschma, Frank van Oort and Jing Xiao.",,85,83,90,5,59,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

The reason is that in previous studies much emphasis has been placed on creating and testing new theories, and not on providing practical generalities. Aim: The aim of this study was to determine how the variable satisfaction is positioned in relation to trust and commitment, and how satisfaction relates to the variables coordination, cooperation and continuity in a South African B2B environment. Setting: This study replicates a similar study conducted in 2013 in a B2B environment in South Africa and hopes to validate the outcome of that study by determining the relationship between the constructs postulated in the current study. The relationships between the different constructs in the proposed model will, therefore, provide a longitudinal perspective which is unique in terms of B2B research in South Africa. Methods: Both the original and replication studies followed a quantitative approach and targeted large companies in South Africa. In the original study, data were collected from 500 large South African companies, while in the replication study data were collected from 250 large companies. Structural equation modelling was used to analyse the data. Results: The findings specifically point to the need for organisations to direct resources towards the establishment of relationships that are founded on trust and commitment. Doing so will help ensure increased satisfaction, which, in turn, will result in greater coordination and cooperation in B2B relationships as well as long-term continuation of the relationship. Conclusion: The foundation for strong B2B relationships is to secure customer satisfaction. Business managers ought to understand that when business customers are dissatisfied, it can result in the discontinuation of the business relationship.","[Roberts-Lombard, Mornay; Mpinganjira, Mercy; Svensson, Goran] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Mkt Management, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Svensson, Goran] Kristiania Univ Coll, Dept Mkt, Oslo, Norway",University of Johannesburg; Kristiania University College,"Roberts-Lombard, M (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Dept Mkt Management, Johannesburg, South Africa.",mornayrl@uj.ac.za,"Mpinganjira, Mercy/S-2174-2018","Mpinganjira, Mercy/0000-0002-8637-0613",Faculty of Management at the University of Johannesburg,Faculty of Management at the University of Johannesburg,The Faculty of Management at the University of Johannesburg is acknowledged for the provision of funding for data collection.,,149,9,13,0,10,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

It is highly probable that EVA motivates managers to manipulate earnings. Aim: The main contribution of this study is the analysis of the association between earnings management and EVA. This study provides shareholders, lenders and creditors (or other categories of investors) with a method for analysing the value of enterprises. Setting: We analyse the association between earnings management through real earnings management (REM) or discretionary accrual (DA) activities and the EVA by African and the Group of Twenty (G20) nations. Methods: The sample for this study was obtained from the COMPUSTAT database between 2009 and 2013. This study also adopted the ordinary least squares (OLS) method. Results: The results indicate that a significantly positive relationship exists between earnings management through DA items and EVA in African nations. In addition, a significantly negative relationship exists between earnings management through DA items or REM activities and EVA in G20 nations. Conclusion: Our results provide critical implications for managers, researchers, investors and regulators of various nations; for example, managers may determine whether to increase the EVA through earnings management, researchers may analyse varying degrees of REM activities and DAs existing in the same nation groups or regulators may determine how to establish laws or rules to prevent earnings management because it is likely that differences in national development, culture or politics exist in these nations.","[Liu, Zhen-Jia; Wang, Yi-Shu] Changzhou Univ, Sch Business, Dept Accounting, Changzhou, Peoples R China",Changzhou University,"Wang, YS (通讯作者)，Changzhou Univ, Sch Business, Dept Accounting, Changzhou, Peoples R China.",wys124@163.com,"liu, zhenjia/N-4673-2014",,,,,,49,7,8,4,25,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

On average over our full sample, forecasters overestimate GDP growth. However, this result masks considerable differences across business cycle states. Growth forecasts for recessions are subject to large negative systematic errors, while forecasts for recoveries are subject to small positive systematic errors. In contrast, forecasts for expansions do not exhibit systematic errors. Thus, there is evidence that forecasters try to issue forecasts which are unbiased conditional on being in an expansion, rather than forecasts which are unbiased overall. We also show that forecasters adjust their forecasts slowly around business cycle turning points. Furthermore, we show that cross-country differences in systematic forecast errors during expansions cannot be explained by changes in trend growth rates.

This article uses three consecutive surveys on household transportation carried out in the Lyon urban area in France in 1995, 2006 and 2015. We propose a technique to extract consistent data on household expenses from the three surveys. Changes are then analysed, taking care to distinguish between changes in prices, population structure and mobility behaviour. The results reveal trends that diverge widely during the two periods between the surveys. In addition, significant differences appear in the changes in expenditure levels and structure depending on the location of households. Finally, a transition to reduced car use has become very clear, however significant generational effects produce contrasting results in young and retired households.","[Nicolas, Jean-Pierre; Pele, Nicolas] Econ Lab, Transport, Urban Planning, Lyon, France",,"Nicolas, JP (通讯作者)，Econ Lab, Transport, Urban Planning, Lyon, France.",nicolas@entpe.fr,,,,,,,51,5,5,0,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Based on a review of the related debate this paper identifies two analytical dimensions required in order to understand the current dynamics of urban agglomerations in a global perspective: their embedding in the worldwide circulation of capital and resources, and the complimentary nexus of local economic, political and social trajectories. Furthermore the interplay between 'city' and 'region' is interpreted as an effect of strategies of (re-) territorialisaion, which do not only address political and economic concerns, but aspects of infrastructure and location of resources as well. Conceptually, the World and Global City debate and the Global Value Chain argument already offer a range of research questions on global cities in Africa. However, without acknowledging the local path-dependencies any understanding of the profile which characterizes specific urban formations) will remain incomplete. Therefore, and based on Gauteng as a reference, we propose a synthesis of the two analytical dimensions, arguing that this two-pronged reflection enables to unravel the mutual dependency between regional/urban structures and the material and financial flows on the global scale.","[Ossenbruegge, Juergen] Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, CEN, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Haferburg, Christoph] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Geog, Wetterkreuz 15, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany; [Haferburg, Christoph] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Geog Wissensch, Malteserstr 74-100, D-12249 Berlin, Germany",University of Hamburg; University of Erlangen Nuremberg; Free University of Berlin,"Ossenbrügge, J (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, CEN, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",juergen.ossenbruegge@uni-hamburg.de,"Ossenbruegge, Juergen/AAN-2994-2021",,,,,,59,2,2,0,22,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

We study the consequences of having more foreign students in one of the world's biggest receivers of international students, the UK's higher educational system. To do so, we estimate the impact of growing numbers of international students on the number of domestic students. Using rich administrative data, we find no evidence of crowd out of domestic undergraduates whose enrolment numbers are regulated by maximum quotas. For domestic postgraduates, who do not face such quotas, there is evidence of crowd in. We establish causality of this relationship by employing two empirical strategies to predict exogenous international student growth. The first uses shift-share instruments based on historical patterns of student enrolment from countries attending specific university departments. The second is based on the fast growth in enrolment of Chinese students which was facilitated by changes in visa regulations in combination with distinct subject of study preferences.","[Machin, Stephen] London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Machin, Stephen; Murphy, Richard] London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Murphy, Richard] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Machin, S (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.;Machin, S (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",s.j.machin@lse.ac.uk,,,Sutton Trust; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Sutton Trust; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors would like to thank Bill Kerr and two referees, together with participants at the RES, EALE, MECSC and PEGGED conferences, Mark Duggan and Gill Wyness for a number of helpful comments.

This conclusion presupposes that market conduct is the same whether incentives are aggressive or accommodating. We study delegation and incentives under evolutionarily stable conjectures and show how performance pay co-determines market conduct.

Manipulation of managerial incentives produces less competition and therefore benefits firms' owners even in symmetric homogenous oligopoly.

This article seeks to offer useful insights into how more effective theory development in this area could be enabled. Aim: This article suggests different streams of literature for inclusion into a theoretical framework for an emerging stream of research, termed 'probabilistic innovation', which seeks to develop a system of real-time research capability. The objective of this research is therefore to provide a synthesis of a range of diverse literatures, and to provide useful insights into how research enabled by crowdsourced research and development can potentially be used to address serious knowledge problems in real time. Setting: This research suggests that knowledge management theory can provide an anchor for a new stream of research contributing to the development of real-time knowledge problem solving. Methods: This conceptual article seeks to re-conceptualise the problem of real-time research and locate this knowledge problem in relation to a host of rapidly developing streams of literature. In doing so, a novel perspective of societal problem-solving is enabled. Results: An analysis of theory and literature suggests that certain rapidly developing streams of literature might more effectively contribute to societally important real-time research problem solving if these steams are united under a theoretical framework with this goal as its explicit focus. Conclusion: Although the goal of real-time research is as yet not attainable, research that contributes to its attainment may ultimately make an important contribution to society.","[Callaghan, Chris W.] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, Dept Management & Human Resources Management, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Callaghan, CW (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, Dept Management & Human Resources Management, Johannesburg, South Africa.",chris.callaghan@wits.ac.za,"Callaghan, Chris/T-2476-2017","Callaghan, Chris/0000-0002-6554-8363",,,,,46,0,0,1,2,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The approaches considered vary from statistical to economics-driven models, using financial and macroeconomic data and adopting either parametric or nonparametric distributions. We employ a range of statistical tools from different strands of the literature to identify which models work in practice, in terms of forecasting accuracies across different data frequencies and forecasting horizons. We propose a novel full-density/local analysis approach for collecting the many test results, and deploy a simple risk-based decision rule for ranking models. An empirical exercise with Brazilian daily and monthly data reveals that macro fundamentals are important when modeling the risk of exchange rate appreciation, whereas models that use survey information or financial data are the best way to account for the depreciation risk. These findings are relevant for econometricians, risk managers or policymakers who are interested in evaluating the accuracy of competing exchange rate models.

Despite the importance of all four components, only safety and air quality are typically considered during institutionalized transportation planning processes. This paper assesses how health impacts are considered in transportation planning by focusing on the long-range transportation plans that US metropolitan planning organizations develop. We analyzed the content of current plans from 25 large regions, reviewing how policy guidance statements and supporting performance measures addressed health. Goals and objectives exhibited an incomplete perspective of transportation's effects on health, focusing on safety, accessibility, and air quality, neglecting physical activity. Regional policies reflected national goals and planning requirements, which are rarely framed from a health perspective. Performance measures generally followed policy guidance, although measures of health and physical activity were lacking. Increased attention to the development of health-related performance measures and the data and analysis tools to support them is needed. By assessing the state of the practice and discussing potential approaches, this review informs a stronger and more comprehensive consideration of health within the institutionalized structure of US metropolitan transportation planning.","[Singleton, Patrick A.; Clifton, Kelly J.] Portland State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, POB 751 CEE, Portland, OR 97207 USA",Portland State University,"Singleton, PA (通讯作者)，Portland State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, POB 751 CEE, Portland, OR 97207 USA.",patrick.singleton@pdx.edu; kclifton@pdx.edu,,"Singleton, Patrick/0000-0002-9319-2333; Clifton, Kelly/0000-0002-7669-4833",Dwight David Eisenhower Transportation Fellowship Program [DTFH64-13-G-00011],Dwight David Eisenhower Transportation Fellowship Program,"This work was made possible in part by a graduate fellowship from the Dwight David Eisenhower Transportation Fellowship Program, Grant DTFH64-13-G-00011.

This centrality continues today. Yet, numerous foundational questions about this concept persist. In this paper, we chronicle how the definition of competition has evolved in economics and has been applied in the communications arena. The academic literature on competition hits an important inflection point in the mid-20th century with the development of workable competition: a term that is equated to effective competition. We find that while the concept of effective competition is central to policy formation at the FCC, the Commission's own applications of effective competition are inconsistent. Given the centrality of this concept, and its inconsistent applications to date, we draw upon the seminal contributions to the development of the notion of effective competition to offer a modern definition suitable for application in 21st century communications markets.","[Delp, Amanda B.] Georgetown Univ, Georgetown Ctr Business & Publ Policy, 37th & O St NW, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Mayo, John W.] Georgetown Univ, McDonough Sch Business, 37th & O St NW, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Georgetown University; Georgetown University,"Mayo, JW (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, McDonough Sch Business, 37th & O St NW, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",abd35@georgetown.edu; mayoj@georgetown.edu,,"Delp, Amanda/0000-0002-7606-5949",,,,,36,7,11,1,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

Antitrust economists and authorities have developed a set of theories of harm and have constantly refined them. Yet these theories often do not explain when certain price-effects or other implications of a merger have reached an intensity that is significant in the meaning of Article 2 EU Merger Regulation (EUMR).(1) This renders the notion of significance a known unknown in legal terms. It is argued here that this legal uncertainty as to the relevant definition of significant has led to an increase in discretion in the handling of merger cases, a bias toward the detrimental effects of mergers, and a deflation of potential efficiency considerations. The article purports that, as a consequence, mergers are often treated similarly to cartels in concentrating on the elimination of competition and regarding efficiencies as a rare exemption for which the parties carry the burden of proof. Against this background, it shall be attempted to construe a unitary concept of significance that integrates efficiency analysis and includes a differentiated allocation of the burdens of proof for procompetitive and anticompetitive effects of mergers.","[Thomas, Stefan] Eberhard Karls Univ Tubingen, Law, Tubingen, Germany; [Thomas, Stefan] Eberhard Karls Univ Tubingen, Private Law Business Law Competit & Insurance Law, Tubingen, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Thomas, S (通讯作者)，Eberhard Karls Univ Tubingen, Law, Tubingen, Germany.;Thomas, S (通讯作者)，Eberhard Karls Univ Tubingen, Private Law Business Law Competit & Insurance Law, Tubingen, Germany.",thomas@uni-tuebingen.de,,,,,,,133,7,7,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

J,"Charman, A",,,,"Charman, Andrew",,,Micro-enterprise predicament in township economic development: Evidence from Ivory Park and Tembisa,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,INFORMAL ECONOMY; SPAZA SECTOR; SOUTH; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; FOREIGN; DELFT,"Background: In South Africa, the idea that the township economy needs to be 'revitalised' has begun to gain significant political traction. The Gauteng provincial government has responded to this challenge by setting out a strategy that promises to channel resources and create opportunities for micro-enterprises. The paper responds to development interventions such as this through interrogating the nature of the challenges facing micro-enterprises that need to be overcome in South African townships. Aim: In response to the developmental need to stimulate micro-enterprise growth in South African townships, the paper poses the question: what approaches are most likely to have a positive impact on township businesses, given current micro-enterprise dynamics? Setting: Primary research was undertaken in two neighbouring townships in Gauteng province, in Ivory Park and Tembisa. Methods: The data comprises a geospatial census of enterprise activities, a survey of select firms and qualitative interviews with business owners. The research utilised a small-area census approach to obtain data on business activities within an area of approximately 2km(2) in each site. The census enumerated 2509 micro-enterprises in Ivory Park and 1722 micro-enterprises in Tembisa. Firm interviews were conducted with business owners in four sectors: grocery retail, liquor retail, hair care and early childhood development centres. Results: The business census identifies a strong similarity in the structure of the townships' informal micro-entrepreneurship despite the considerable differences in the socio-economic status of the respective case sites. The enterprise survey highlights the resource constraints of township businesses and thinness of local markets. Interviews with entrepreneurs reveal four main pathways through which individuals enter into self-employment with the most dynamic enterprises established by inward investing entrepreneurs. Spatial considerations exert an influence on the position of enterprise sectors, whilst access to land and business infrastructure are notable constraints. Conclusion: Reflecting on the evidence, the paper concludes with making a call for a more low-geared development approach, focusing on lessening the legal, institutional and regulatory obstacles to enterprise growth as a first step. Municipalities have an important role in liberalising the spaces and places where township informal enterprises can and should be permitted to trade as well as creating a more favourable business environment. The challenges of crime and finance demand more purposeful action from the national government.","[Charman, Andrew] Sustainable Livelihoods Fdn, Cape Town, South Africa",,"Charman, A (通讯作者)，Sustainable Livelihoods Fdn, Cape Town, South Africa.",andrew.charman@livelihoods.org.za,,,,,,,40,4,8,1,7,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The retail industry is not, however, a homogeneous business sector. Differences exist between retail sectors, retail formats and governance modes in how retail business models evolve and how a retail business operates in a market. These differing characteristics alongside the coercive, mimetic and agency pressures arising from interactions among institutions, consumer market cultures and firms determine the emphasis placed upon different embeddedness types and how embeddedness occurs. Consideration of these factors allows us to 'dissect' the generic embeddedness concept and gain a more nuanced understanding of the processes involved.

By exploiting the quasi-experimental variation in whether counties were affected by this project, my analysis suggests that the affected counties on the upgraded railway lines experienced reductions in GDP and GDP per capita following the upgrade, which was largely driven by the concurrent drop in fixed asset investments. This article provides the first empirical evidence on how transportation costs of people affect urban peripheral patterns.","[Qin, Yu] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, 4 Architecture Dr, Singapore 117566, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Qin, Y (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, 4 Architecture Dr, Singapore 117566, Singapore.",rstqyu@nus.edu.sg,"Qin, Yu/T-8719-2019",,,,,,33,248,279,20,224,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

But a minimum of material equality is not a sufficient condition for democracy. Citizens need training in skills beyond those that will enable them to earn a living. Widespread availability of liberal education is an essential component of any society that seeks to sustain democratic institutions. The United States has been fortunate to have had leaders for two centuries who understood the need for liberal education as a cornerstone of democracy. However, the growing demand that universities operate according to the same principles as a business has been undermining the consensus about the need for liberal education.","[Rowe, Stephen C.] Grand Valley State Univ, Philosophy, Allendale, MI 49401 USA",Grand Valley State University,"Rowe, SC (通讯作者)，Grand Valley State Univ, Philosophy, Allendale, MI 49401 USA.",,,,,,,,31,2,6,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Research found this relationship to be significantly positive. The external effects that spending on public capital has on the production function of private firms stimulates economic growth overall. This implies that public capital inputs should be incorporated into the production function. Aim: The way provincial or regional growth depends on infrastructure is investigated in this article and it is applied to data from KwaZulu-Natal province, as an illustration. Setting: This study investigates the extent to which infrastructure in KwaZulu-Natal province in South Africa leads towards economic growth of the province. Methods: From a theoretical framework, this article develops an endogenous growth model, which investigates the association between provincial public capital stock expenditure and economic growth. Data series for public capital formation are first developed to apply in this study and others to follow. Econometric techniques are then employed, using quarterly data between 2001 and 2015, to assess the set hypothesis that growth in expenditure on public capital leads to national economic growth. Results: The empirical results support the argument of a positive relationship between provincial capital stock and economic growth in the long-term. The findings also suggests that the long-term causality or effect fades over time, albeit slowly. Conclusion: The nature and statistical significance of the long-term equilibrium relationship seems to be ambiguous at best. Some evidence of an equilibrium relationship in the short-term was, however, also observed. In conclusion, there also seems to be some causality between provincial capital stock and provincial gross domestic product in the short-run.","[Coetzee, Clive E.; Kleynhans, Ewert P.

The current paper analyzes potential biases in different U.S. government agencies' one-year-ahead forecasts of U.S. gross federal debt over 1984-2012. Standard tests typically fail to detect biases in these forecasts. However, impulse indicator saturation (IIS) detects economically large and highly significant time-varying biases, particularly at turning points in the business cycle. These biases do not appear to be politically related. IIS defines a generic procedure for examining forecast properties; it explains why standard tests fail to detect bias; and it provides a mechanism for potentially improving forecasts.

We propose to employ a system of seemingly unrelated regressions to model and forecast a realized covariance matrix to capture this information. We find that the newly proposed generalized heterogeneous autoregressive (GHAR) model outperforms competing approaches in terms of economic gains, providing better mean-variance trade-off, while, in terms of statistical precision, GHAR is not substantially dominated by any other model. Our results provide a comprehensive comparison of the performance when realized covariance, subsampled realized covariance and multivariate realized kernel estimators are used. We study the contribution of the estimators across different sampling frequencies, and show that the multivariate realized kernel and subsampled realized covariance estimators deliver further gains compared to realized covariance estimated on a 5-minute frequency. In order to show economic and statistical gains, a portfolio of various sizes is used.

Empirical investigations of the role of malaria for economic development at the country level deliver mixed findings, however. We study the role of longterm malaria exposure on development today using disaggregate within-country variation for the whole of Africa with 1x1 degree cells as units of observation. Local development is measured by light density at night. Based on insights from epidemiology, which documents that genetic and acquired immunities reduce Malaria risk for adults in holoendemic areas, the effect is hypothesized to be nonlinear, with a peak for intermediate rather than high exposure to the pathogen. The empirical findings support this hypothesis. The results also suggest the existence of a significant moderating effect of genetic immunities measured by the prevalence of the sickle cell trait in the population.","[Cervellati, Matteo] Univ Bologna, IZA, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Cervellati, Matteo] CESIfo, Munich, Germany; [Esposito, Elena] DEEP HEC, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Sunde, Uwe] IZA, CESIfo, LMU, Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna; Ifo Institut,"Cervellati, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-240136 Bologna, Italy.",m.cervellati@unibo.it,"Esposito, Elena/IXD-3753-2023","esposito, elena/0000-0001-5331-4992",,,,,47,7,8,0,3,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",2054-0892,2054-0906,,J DEMOGR ECON,J.Demogr.

By determining the appropriate parameters for the incentives with scenario analysis, balanced profit distribution between buyers and a supplier in VMI is established. Simulation outputs of the traditional model, VMI only and VMI with incentives models are compared based on profits with paired comparisons. In VMI with incentives, both buyers, and the supplier experience higher benefits than the traditional system.

A survey is administered to firms across several industries and data is analysed employing structural equation modelling. Recognising that replications and extensions of IC studies are vital to knowledge development, comparisons with international studies are made. The results provide support for the hypotheses where relationships between the IC components and performance are evident. These findings suggest that it is crucial for an organisation to optimise the utilisation of its human capital for the sake of optimising its structural capital, which leads to higher performance.

This study especially contributes to literature of personality by uncovering the unexplored affective states in the context of knowledge sharing behavior. Sample was drawn by using simple random sampling without replacement technique. To test the hypotheses, correlation, regression and bootstrap mediation procedures were applied to the sample data. Testing a sample of 274 university teachers, significant associations were found between big five traits, proactive personality, creative self-efficacy, and knowledge sharing behavior. Openness to experience, conscientiousness, agreeableness, extraversion, proactive personality and creative self-efficacy were positively related to knowledge sharing behavior, whereas, neuroticism was negatively related to knowledge sharing behavior in workplace. The relationship between extraversion, agreeableness and creative self-efficacy was partially mediated by positive affect and the relationship between neuroticism and knowledge sharing behavior was partially mediated by negative affect. In conclusion, members of organizations, at all levels, should be trained to manage their emotions and affective reactions intelligently to share knowledge effectively and gain maximum benefits from knowledge based assets. In addition, organizational tasks must be assigned to employees with suitable narrow or broad personality traits to maximize the performance level. All the sophisticated, scientific and technical works requiring high level of knowledge sharing should not be assigned to neurotic workers. However, agreeable, extrovert, conscientious and open individuals may handle all knowledge sharing activities effectively. It is also suggested that the works requiring scientific innovation and creativity could better be performed by people high in creative self-efficacy, whereas, knowledge works requiring manual dexterity like technology transfer, industry academia linkages and knowledge based networking can best be done by proactive people.","[Anwar, Ch.

When groups of investors have different tax preferences, this can lead to conflicting pressures on firms to either retain earnings or pay dividends. The findings of this study will be of interest to researchers of taxation and corporate governance alike, as they highlight the role that corporate shareholders play in the decisions of the firm. Investors and regulators will also be interested in the findings as they reveal more about the interaction between shareholders with conflicting interests. Lastly, changes in behaviour as a result of changes in tax legislation are of interest to those with fiscal responsibility. Setting: A 2012 dividend tax change in South Africa, which simultaneously altered the tax preferences of individual and corporate investors, provides a unique opportunity to investigate firms' reaction to their investors' tax preferences. Aim: This article seeks to determine whether firms respond to changes in their investors' tax preferences in their decisions to either retain earnings or pay dividends. Method: The article investigates the responses of firms to the 2012 dividend tax change using multivariate regressions. Results: Findings show that firms consider changes in the tax preferences of their investors in setting dividend policies. In addition, it appears that corporates have greater success in lobbying for beneficial dividend changes than individuals. Conclusion: Changes in investors' tax preferences impact on firms' dividend policy decisions. These decisions ultimately affect the value of the firm to its investors.","[Badenhorst, Wessel M.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Accounting, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Badenhorst, WM (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Accounting, Pretoria, South Africa.",wesselmbadenhorst@gmail.com,"Badenhorst, Wessel/AAL-9034-2021","Badenhorst, Wessel/0000-0001-6159-9158",,,,,21,4,6,3,9,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

It derives explanatory factors specific to the region from experts. A bivariate correlation analysis identifies relations between (in)dependent export performance (EP) measurements. Stepwise multiple regression equations for firms' overall EP and overall export profitability in the last three years highlight factors with the most significant correlations. As evaluated in previous research and as mentioned by experts, it applies a multidimensional approach, investigating variables according to the resource-based view and the contingency paradigm. This study indicates that SSA has specific requirements for successful exports which differ from other regions. Knowledge about these particular characteristics of the market will enable managers and policymakers to improve trade relations. By focusing on the EP of German SMEs in SSA, this study fills a research gap since no previous study has concentrated on this specific aspect.","[Bockmann, Johannes O.] Int Sch Management Hamburg, Dept Econ & Logist, Hamburg, Germany",,"Bockmann, JO (通讯作者)，Int Sch Management Hamburg, Dept Econ & Logist, Hamburg, Germany.",johannesbockmann@gmail.com,,,,,,,78,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",2367-1033,,978-981-10-4451-9; 978-981-10-4450-2,FRONT AFR BUS RES,,,2017,,,,,,,207,235,,10.1007/978-981-10-4451-9_10,0.0,,,29,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK1SG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432206900010,0

Risk assessment is analogous to anticipating the future, in that models need to be developed and applied to data. Since objective data are often scanty, expert knowledge elicitation (EKE) techniques have been developed for risk assessment that allow models to be developed and parametrized using expert judgment with minimal cognitive and social biases. Here, we conceptualize how EKE can be developed and applied to support anticipation of the future. Accordingly, we begin by defining EKE as a complete process, which involves considering experts as a source of data, and comprises various methods for ensuring the quality of this data, including selecting the best experts, training experts in the normative aspects of anticipation, and combining judgments from several experts, as well as eliciting unbiased estimates and constructs from experts. We detail various aspects of the papers that constitute this special issue and analyse them in terms of the stages of the EKE future-anticipation process that they address. We also identify the remaining gaps in our knowledge. Our conceptualization of EKE with the aim of supporting anticipation of the future is compared and contrasted with the extant research on judgmental forecasting.","[Bolger, Fergus] Minerva Consulting, 62 Packman Dr, Nottingham NG11 6GE, England; [Wright, George] Univ Strathclyde, Strathclyde Business Sch, 199 Cathedral St, Glasgow G4 0QU, Lanark, Scotland",University of Strathclyde,"Bolger, F (通讯作者)，Minerva Consulting, 62 Packman Dr, Nottingham NG11 6GE, England.",fbolger42@gmail.com; george.wright@strath.ac.uk,,"Bolger, Fergus/0000-0001-8812-2157",,,,,72,30,30,1,31,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0169-2070,1872-8200,,INT J FORECASTING,Int.

Due to inflation and improved fuel efficiency, these taxes are increasingly inadequate to maintain the transportation system. In most states and at the federal level, the real fuel tax rates decrease because they are fixed at a cents-per-gallon amount rather than indexed to inflation. In this paper, we provide a forecast on state and federal tax revenue based on different fuel taxation policies such as indexing to inflation, imposing a sales tax on gasoline and diesel, or using a mileage fee on vehicles. We compare how those taxation policies perform compared to the policies states use currently under different macroeconomic conditions relating to the price of oil, economic growth, and vehicle miles traveled. The baselines projections indicate that between 2015 and 2040, fuel tax revenue will decrease 42.9-50.5% in states that do neither index taxes to inflation nor impose a sales tax. Revenue will decrease 10.3-33.4% that currently impose a sales tax but do not index to inflation. The decrease for states that index to inflation is 3.4-16%. For all states, the median increase in revenue in 2040 compared to 2015 is 62% from switching to a mileage fee. Indexing fuel taxes to inflation in addition to imposing a states' sales tax increases revenue significantly but suffers from a continuous decline in the long-run due to increased fuel efficiency. Our results indicate that although a mileage fee is politically and technologically difficult to achieve, it avoids a declining tax revenue in the long-run. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Arrival and consumption of domestic and foreign tourists generate numerous direct and indirect effects on the Croatian economy; however, at the same time there are large unused capacities and potentials of nautical tourism. Developing and attracting new guests and encouraging the return of existing guests must be on the priority list of every port of nautical tourism, At the same time ports must strive to long term development, which largely depend on the quality and expertise of human resources, primarily management and its proper administration. The purpose of this scientific paper is analysis of management of nautical tourism and determining their general characteristics and competences. The research results point to the fact that most young managers are prone to more frequent job changes; therefore, working in particular company, ie. port of nautical tourism see as temporary workplace for improvement and development of their own careers, On the other side, senior managers are more loyal to their company which is evident by the number of companies they changed during their career. Economic and technical education is most common form of education of the management of nautical tourism, and there is also noted the lack of qualifications of maritime interests, Results of this scientific paper aim to analyze the main characteristics o 'the management of nautical tourism in order to draw conclusions about the management's functioning and their competences.","[Jugovic, Alen; Stumpf, Gorana] Univ Rijeka, Fac Maritime Studies Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia; [Schiozzi, Donald] Port Author Rovinj, Rovinj, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Jugovic, A (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Maritime Studies Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia.",ajugovic@pfri.hr; stumpf@pfri.hr; donald@port-rovinj.hr,"Mudronja, Gorana/AAY-9492-2020; Mudronja, Gorana/ABD-1173-2021; Jugovic, Alen/ABC-6855-2021","Mudronja, Gorana/0000-0002-4625-3623; Jugovic, Alen/0000-0001-5031-4655",,,,,5,1,1,0,1,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2017,13,,,,,,287,296,,,,,,10,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM4RS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000463854000018,0

In high schools, especially grammar schools oriented towards academic achievement and cognitive development of personality, the educational element is neglected, and high school students (as future intellectuals), can be seen as bearers of the progress of society. For this reason, ecological education (if we look at the ecology in a broader sense), would provide an opportunity for a systematic development of knowledge, but also social skills, and it would mean a return to basic human values that are essential for the progress of society. Viewed from a pedagogical, but also a broader view, research on the environmental education in our scientific literature is limited. There is a question that justifiably arises, concerning the amount of attention that Croatia, in comparison with more developed countries, gives to these dimensions of development. The aim of this study, was to examine the attitudes and opinions of students and teachers on the implementation of environmental education at schools, and in the classroom. The study included a total of 591 student and 190 teachers from all high schools of Osijek- Baranja County. Research results showed that neither teachers nor students are satisfied with the implementation of environmental education at school. Estimates showed that teachers did not encourage students sufficiently towards behaving ecologically, that schools did not organize enough environmental activities, that those activities were not connected with the activities in the local community, that the majority of subjects poorly covered the environmental issues, which is also poorly represented in the school curriculum. Curricular approach to environmental education in Croatia mainly comes to it being implemented in isolated descriptions of teaching areas, subjects and educational achievement, based solely on the educational impact of the class (and only in science classes), leaving its didactic-socializing structure systematically neglected.","[Jukic, Renata] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Humanities & Social Sci Osijek, Osijek, Croatia; [Dubovicki, Snjezana] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fak Odgojne & Obrazovne Znanosti, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek; University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Jukic, R (通讯作者)，JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Humanities & Social Sci Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.",rjukic@ffos.hr; sdubovicki@foozos.hr,"Dubovicki, Snjezana/ABE-9526-2020",,,,,,21,0,0,0,1,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2017,13,,,,,,841,855,,,,,,15,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM4RS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000463854000055,0

Accordingly, this study examined the effects of organizational slack resources on firm performance of Korean pharmaceutical companies. Specifically, we classified slack resources into available slack, recoverable slack, and potential slack and verified the relationship between each slack and firm performance. For the empirical analysis, we used the six-year panel data of 53 listed pharmaceutical companies in Korea from 2010 to 2015 and used the feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) regression model considering the issues of heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation in the panel data. The results indicated that recoverable slack had a negative effect on firm performance.

The trade balance of Iran will be affected negatively and strongly. Also, oil and other services production decreased. In the production sectors' market, the demand for labor, natural resources, and investment decreased dramatically, and the demand for land increased. Using equivalent variation (EV), changes in Iran's welfare is high negative. Finally, deflation, reduction in value and quantity of GDP and changes in consumption combination from public to private sector are the other economic impacts of reduction in oil price on Iran's economic.

This paper is focused on an analysis of website data dedicated to Pillar 3 disclosures of commercial banks and on studying the behaviour of stakeholders in relation to the timing of serious market turbulence. The examined data consists of log files that were pre-processed using web mining techniques and from which were extracted frequent itemsets by quarters and evaluated in terms of quantity. The authors have proposed a methodology to evaluate frequent itemsets of web parts over a dedicated time period. The results show that stakeholders' interest in disclosures is lower after turbulent times in 2009, higher in the first quarter, also higher together with annual reports (lower for Pillar 3 solo information). The paper's results suggest that further changes in commercial banks' information disclosure are inevitable in order to achieve an effective market discipline mechanism and meaningful disclosures according to the regulator's expectations.","[Munk, Michal] Constantine Philosopher Univ Nitra, Fac Nat Sci, Dept Informat, Tr A Hlinku 1, SK-94974 Nitra, Slovakia; [Pilkova, Anna; Blazekova, Petra] Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Dept Strategy & Entrepreneurship, Odbojarov 10, SK-82005 Bratislava, Slovakia; [Benko, Lubomir] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Inst Syst Engn & Informat, Studentska 95, CZ-53210 Pardubice, Czech Republic",Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra; Comenius University Bratislava; University of Pardubice,"Benko, L (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Inst Syst Engn & Informat, Studentska 95, CZ-53210 Pardubice, Czech Republic.",lubomir.benko@gmail.com,"Munk, Michal/N-1724-2017; Benko, Lubomir/C-7713-2019; Pilková, Anna/AAD-9645-2019; Munk, Michal/AAE-7199-2020","Munk, Michal/0000-0002-9913-3596; Benko, Lubomir/0000-0002-1657-395X;",[VEGA 1/0776/18],,This work was supported by the project VEGA 1/0776/18 Optimizing the content and structure of the disclosures under Pillar 3 by modelling their use by stakeholders of commercial bank.,,47,6,6,0,7,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

This statement is in a conflict with the widespread point of view about rent character of the Russian economy. At the same time, according to the results of research, payment for human resources is at a low level that significantly reduces possibility of their effective usage. It is established that there is no one-to-one association between success of enterprises and payment for labor.

The intraday analyses show that the weather effect on the returns and volatilities is more statistically significant at the beginning of the working day or the lunch break, indicating the intraday weather effects on the financial market.","[Shim, Hyein] Korea Publ Finance Informat Serv, Metrotower,10 Toegye Ro, Seoul 04637, South Korea; [Kim, Maria H.] Univ Wollongong, Finance, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Ryu, Doojin] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Coll Econ, 25-2 Sungkyunkwan Ro, Seoul 03063, South Korea",University of Wollongong; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Ryu, D (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Coll Econ, 25-2 Sungkyunkwan Ro, Seoul 03063, South Korea.",hyein@kpfis.kr; mhykim@uow.edu.au; sharpjin@skku.edu,"Ryu, Doojin/AAZ-3318-2020; Kim, Maria Heui-Yeong/HTN-4755-2023","Ryu, Doojin/0000-0002-0059-4887; Kim, Maria Heui-Yeong/0000-0002-6279-5836",Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2017S1A5A2A01025583],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2017S1A5A2A01025583].,,60,13,13,2,12,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

Accordingly, accessibility instruments have been recognised as valuable support tools for land-use and transport planning. However, despite the relatively large number of instruments available in the literature, they are not widely used in planning practice. This paper aims to explore why accessibility instruments are not widely used in planning practice. To this end we focus our research on perceived user-friendliness and usefulness of accessibility instruments. First, we surveyed a number of instrument developers, providing an overview on the characteristics of accessibility instruments available and on developers' perceptions of their user-friendliness in planning practice. Second, we brought together developers and planning practitioners in a number of local workshops across Europe and Australia, where participants were asked to use insights provided by accessibility instruments for the development of planning strategies. We found that most practitioners are convinced of the usefulness of accessibility instruments in planning practice, as they generate new and relevant insights for planners. Findings suggest that not only user friendliness problems, but mainly organizational barriers and lack of institutionalization of accessibility instruments, are the main causes of the implementation gap. Thus user-friendliness improvement may provide limited contributions to the successful implementation of accessibility concepts in planning practice. In fact, there seems to be more to gain from active and continued engagement of instrument developers with planning practitioners and from the institutionalization of accessibility planning.","[Silva, Cecilia] Univ Porto, Fac Engn, Res Ctr Terr Planning & Transports CITTA, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal; [Bertolini, Luca; te Brommelstroet, Marco] Univ Amsterdam, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Milakis, Dimitris] Delft Univ Technol, NL-2600 AA Delft, Netherlands; [Papa, Enrica] Univ Westminster, London W1R 8AL, England",Universidade do Porto; University of Amsterdam; Delft University of Technology; University of Westminster,"Silva, C (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Fac Engn, Res Ctr Terr Planning & Transports CITTA, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal.",ccsilva@fe.up.pt; l.bertolini@uva.nl; brommelstroet@uva.nl; d.milakis@tudelft.nl; E.Papa@westminster.ac.uk,"Silva, Cecília/AAD-6928-2020; Papa, Enrica/C-8871-2015; Silva, Cecilia/HKF-3577-2023; Milakis, Dimitris/V-4895-2019","Silva, Cecília/0000-0003-2868-1840; Papa, Enrica/0000-0003-2922-2443; Silva, Cecilia/0000-0003-2868-1840; Milakis, Dimitris/0000-0001-5220-4206; , Luca/0000-0002-4476-0648",COST Office [TU1002],COST Office,"The authors would like to acknowledge the valuable contribution of all the members of the COST Action TU1002 to the work presented in this paper, as well as the COST Office for funding Action TU1002.",,68,80,83,0,22,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

A COMPARISON OF INNOVATION SUPPORT IN THE CZECH AND SLOVAK REPUBLIC,E & M EKONOMIE A MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Spatially blind policy; structural funds; cohesion policy; innovation support; place based policy,,"With the ongoing changes in development of the European Union, also conditions for financial support are changing. For Central Europe, most financial aid comes from Cohesion policies. The same applies for the support of innovations, which are considered to be a driving force of development. One of the main debates concerning cohesion policy is the issue of placed based versus spatially blind policies. Their role mainly differs within the area of economic growth. This paper deals with the evaluation of innovation support as a driving force for economic growth from structural funds in two neighbouring EU member states - in Slovakia and the Czech Republic. This article provides a picture of what kinds of policies are implemented and how consequently the resources of the European Union are territorially distributed to support innovation. We especially dealt with the question of the support criteria for projects and their role in the implementation of support. Based on this, the paper tries to identify where assistance is concentrated and how the criteria influence the geographical distribution of this support. As a result, we found that, despite very similar spatially blind policies in both countries and very similar systems of providing support, they still have very different regional effects. In the Czech Republic, support was allocated to developed regions and high tech sectors to a greater extent. In the Slovak Republic, support was concentrated more on disadvantaged regions and in traditional sectors with lower added value. It shows the need to pay much more attention not only to policy set up, but also to policy implementation.","[Sipikal, Miroslav; Szitasiova, Valeria] Univ Econ, Fac Natl Econ, Dept Publ Adm & Reg Dev, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Pisar, Peter] Matej Bel Univ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Fac Econ, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia; [Uramova, Maria] Matej Bel Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Econ, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava; Matej Bel University; Matej Bel University,"Sipikal, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Natl Econ, Dept Publ Adm & Reg Dev, Bratislava, Slovakia.",miroslav.sipikal@euba.sk; valeria.szitasiova@euba.sk; peter.pisar@umb.sk; maria.uramova@umb.sk,"Šipikal, Miroslav/HJY-0623-2023; Pisar, Peter/ABE-4019-2020","Šipikal, Miroslav/0000-0002-7205-3385; Pisar, Peter/0000-0003-4898-2739; Uramova, Maria/0000-0001-7968-975X; Nemethova, Valeria/0000-0003-2180-9696","Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, science, research and sport of the Slovak Republic [VEGA-1/0098/15]; Slovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-14-0512]","Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, science, research and sport of the Slovak Republic; Slovak Research and Development Agency(Slovak Research and Development Agency)","This work was supported by the Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, science, research and sport of the Slovak Republic, Grant No. VEGA-1/0098/15 and by the Slovak Research and Development Agency under the contract No. APVV-14-0512.",,24,6,6,0,12,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

SWFs are among the most important financial institutions in global financial markets, and constitute a solid element in the architecture of the international financial safety net. Similarly to other institutional investors, Sovereign Wealth Funds possess huge amounts of capital. What distinguishes them the most from other financial institutions is the fact that they are owned, managed and controlled by sovereign states, have limited liquidity needs, a lower-than-market-average-level of redemption risk, a long-term, intergenerational investment horizon and relatively high risk tolerance. The question of whether investment from Sovereign Wealth Funds determines changes in corporate financial performance of a targeted firm is still unanswered question in the literature. This study tests empirically the impact of Sovereign Wealth Funds' ownership on the financial performance of targeted companies. Using the data of companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, we employ regression to analyze the relationship between the funds' investment and accounting, as well as the market outcomes of the firm. The empirical findings of this research suggest that Sovereign Wealth Funds' ownership has a positive influence on the price to book value of the firm. This article contributes to ongoing research in the field of studies related to financial aspects of SWF's investment behavior. The empirical findings of this research can also serve as a useful reference for companies and academics concerning themselves with investment decision making in emerging markets, as well as the role of institutional investors.","[Urban, Dariusz] Univ Lodz, Fac Management, Dept Finance & Strateg Management, Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Urban, D (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Fac Management, Dept Finance & Strateg Management, Lodz, Poland.",durban@uni.lodz.pl,,"Urban, Dariusz/0000-0003-0500-1830",,,,,47,1,1,0,11,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

This article aims to create a model of the quality of business environment, define the key determinants of this model, and quantify the correlations among the individual determinants in the area of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the Czech Republic. Partial results of a survey carried out at the Tomas Bata University in Zlin in 2015 were used for the analysis. On the basis of previous surveys, four determinants were set that influence the quality of business environment (State, Public perception, Financial markets and banks, Business risks). From these four areas, questions were selected and asked to business owners in the Czech Republic in the abovementioned survey. Links were identified among selected questions asked to the owners. These links led to adjusting the business environment to four determinants: State and public perception, Banks and their approach to business, Knowledge of rules and principles, and financial risks and their increase in post-crisis time. Subsequently, correlations were identified among these determinants. It was ascertained that the knowledge of the conditions of the financial system leads to a positive perception of the banks' approach in terms of external finance. Moreover, a positive influence of the banking sector on how the business owners perceive financial risks was identified. Another important result of the survey is the fact that business owners who have the necessary knowledge of the financial market perceive financial risks as less intense compared to those lacking such knowledge of the financial market.","[Virglerova, Zuzana] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Econ & Management, Ctr Appl Econ Res, Zlin, Czech Republic; [Homolka, Lubor] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Stat & Quantitat Methods, Zlin, Czech Republic; [Smrcka, Lubos] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Business Adm, Dept Strategy, Prague, Czech Republic; [Lazanyi, Kornelia] Obuda Univ, Fac Business & Management, Inst Management & Org, Budapest, Hungary; [Kliestik, Tomas] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ, Transport & Commun, Zilina, Slovakia",Tomas Bata University Zlin; Tomas Bata University Zlin; Prague University of Economics & Business; Obuda University; University of Zilina,"Virglerová, Z (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Econ & Management, Ctr Appl Econ Res, Zlin, Czech Republic.",virglerova@fame.utb.cz; homolka@fame.utb.cz; smrckal@vse.cz; lazanyi.kornelia@kgk.uni-obuda.hu; tomas.kliestik@pedas.uniza.sk,"Smrcka, Lubos/AFV-1635-2022; Homolka, Lubor/P-7714-2019; Lazányi, Kornélia/HGB-3450-2022; Kliestik, Tomas/O-8070-2015; Virglerová, Zuzana/J-9044-2019","Smrcka, Lubos/0000-0003-4966-2171; Homolka, Lubor/0000-0002-6628-8241; Virglerová, Zuzana/0000-0002-7957-9216; Kliestik, Tomas/0000-0002-3815-5409",Project RO FaME,Project RO FaME,This paper was supported by Project RO FaME/2016: The business environment of small and medium enterprises.,,74,28,29,4,65,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.
