Given the typical leading indicator behavior of financial variables, understanding and characterizing the properties of these indices may help shed light on the behavior of the tourism sector and of its resilience to crises. For the purpose of analysis, our sample is split into three subsamples according to the World tourism cycle: (i) from January 1996 to December 2002; (ii) from January 2003 to August 2007; and (iii) from September 2007 to July 2014. Results suggest the existence of long-memory dynamics driving series volatility, and that shocks to volatility tend to be more persistent during periods of turmoil and affect regions differently.","[Andraz, Jorge M.

The analysis demonstrates the importance of pragmatic alliances of progressive local politicians, unions and employers in ensuring that socially responsible procurement moves beyond rhetoric, along with supportive national and sectoral employment regimes.

Among these economic instruments, the use of access fees can have positive effects on enhancing environmental sustainability by reducing the number of visitors. Access fees are also a source of financing the management costs of a protected area. Among the negative impacts of tourism, users of beaches perceive congestion as a factor in reducing the final value of the touristic experience. This article analyses the perception of locals of an access fee to enter the small Canary island of Lobos, a protected natural area with high quality beaches, whose quietness is endangered by an increasing number of visitors, clearly exceeding the current carrying capacity. We approached the problem using different tools: firstly, we looked at visitors' opinions on the website TripAdvisor to identify whether congestion is perceived as a problem; secondly, we carried out an opinion survey using Likert-type scale questions to capture opinions about crowding and pricing; and finally, we used a discrete choice experiment to estimate the willingness to pay (WTP) for accessing the island and reducing congestion. The results reveal a high degree of perception of congestion and the potential of an entrance fee as an effective tool in reducing that congestion and thus generating resources to cover the maintenance costs of the protected area.","[Lopez-del-Pino, Francisco; Grisolia, Jose M.] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Spain; [Lopez-del-Pino, Francisco; Grisolia, Jose M.] Univ Inst Tourism & Sustainable Econ Dev, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain; [Grisolia, Jose M.] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham Univ Business Sch China, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria; University of Nottingham Ningbo China,"López-del-Pino, F (通讯作者)，Univ Inst Tourism & Sustainable Econ Dev, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain.;López-del-Pino, F (通讯作者)，Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Dept Appl Econ Anal, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain.",francisco.lopez@ulpgc.es,,"Lopez-del-Pino, Francisco/0000-0003-0466-5600",,,,,54,11,13,0,34,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

We construct a pseudo-panel of Colombian manufacturing firms for the years of 2000-2009 to study the effects of transportation infrastructure on firm performance in a developing country and find elasticities of output with respect to road infrastructure ranging from 0.13 to 0.15 per cent. This confirms that roads are important for private output growth and, as our results are larger than those reported in the literature for developed countries, that transportation infrastructure is relatively more important for the economy of developing countries. We also identify a one-year time lag with which firms' outputs react to road stock changes. This could be indicative of firms requiring time to adjust their production to road changes. We furthermore identify that the effect of road infrastructure is particularly large for heavy manufacturing industries. Moreover, we investigate the regional heterogeneity of the role of transportation infrastructure for firms' output growth. Our results are robust to different econometric concerns. We additionally provide Monte Carlo simulations to support the validity of pseudo-panels in the context of firm-level data.","[Barzin, Samira; Graham, Daniel J.] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Transport Studies, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England; [D'Costa, Sabine] Univ Westminster, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, London NW1 5LS, England",Imperial College London; University of London; University College London; University of Westminster,"Barzin, S (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll London, Ctr Transport Studies, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England.",s.barzin12@imperial.ac.uk,"Graham, Daniel/AAA-6157-2021","Graham, Daniel/0000-0002-6971-8737","Railway and Transport Strategy Centre (RTSC) at The Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine","Railway and Transport Strategy Centre (RTSC) at The Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine","This work was conducted as part of Ms. Samira Barzin's doctoral studies and was not supported by a project specific grant.

Much work has been done in the residential sector on demand for clean energy and on investment in energy efficiency, but to our knowledge there is no specific study that investigates the relationship between the two. This paper fills a gap in the literature, and first shows theoretically that there are relationships of substitution or complementarity between the two decisions depending on the threshold of the cross effect related to the environmental motivation of the consumer. Second, the paper empirically shows that the two decisions are positively interrelated due to unobserved characteristics that determine both decisions. Third, the paper provides differential impact of energy poverty, split incentive problem, dwelling characteristics, commitment and trust on the two decisions. Finally, the paper investigates household characteristics that significantly affect the joint adoption of energy efficient and renewable energy technologies.

The MENA region panel is divided into three subgroups of countries: GCC panel (containing the Gulf Cooperation Council countries), N-GCC panel (containing countries that are not members of the Gulf Cooperation Council), and North African countries (called MATE Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt). Using the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), we find that transport energy consumption significantly adds to economic growth in MENA, N-GCC and MATE regions. Transport infrastructure positively contributes to economic growth in all regions. The Dumitrescu-Hurlin panel causality analysis shows the feedback effect of transport energy consumption and transport infrastructure with economic growth. The empirical results add a new dimension to the importance of investing in modem infrastructure that facilitates the use of more energy-efficient modes and alternative technologies that positively affect the economy with minimizing negative externalities.","[Saidi, Samir] Univ Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia; [Shahbaz, Muhammad] Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier, France; [Akhtar, Pervaiz] Univ Hull, Fac Business Law & Polit, Management Syst & Logist, Kingston Upon Hull, N Humberside, England; [Akhtar, Pervaiz] IESEG Sch Management, Lille, France",Universite de Sfax; Montpellier Business School; University of Hull; IESEG School of Management,"Saidi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia.",samir.saidi@fsegs.rnu.tn; muhdshahbaz77@gmail.com; Pervaiz.Akhtar@hull.ac.uk,"Shahbaz, Muhammad/AAS-6190-2021","Shahbaz, Muhammad/0000-0003-2391-6997",,,,,110,95,97,5,56,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

This paper formalizes a theory of polarization where changes in the income distribution do not affect citizens' policy preferences, but instead change their patterns of political participation: aggregate voting decreases relative to aggregate giving, reducing the electoral penalty for partisan policies. By endogenizing party composition the model captures both the ideological and compositional dimensions of polarization, and addresses less-discussed polarization features, such as intra-party homogeneity and the increase in safe seats. According to the model, observed polarization patterns imply that parties have diverged more than candidates, and that the gap between party and candidate divergence has increased with income inequality.","[Vlaicu, Razvan] Interamer Dev Bank, Res Dept, 1300 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20577 USA",Inter-American Development Bank,"Vlaicu, R (通讯作者)，Interamer Dev Bank, Res Dept, 1300 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20577 USA.",vlaicu@iadb.org,,,,,,,46,5,7,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,APR,2018,50.0,4,,,,,597,624,,10.1007/s00355-017-1098-9,0.0,,,28,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GA8QH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428604300002,0

The results show that job satisfaction is considerably correlated with job performance of seafarers. In addition, the amount of stress associated with working onboard a ship and attractiveness of rewards are key determinants of job satisfaction. The dispositions of seafarers and appeal of the job design also have considerable impacts on job satisfaction.

The elliptical utility function provides Inada conditions at both the upper-bound and lower-bound constraints on labor supply, which is not the case for the two most common alternative functions. The presence of these two Inada conditions in the elliptical utility of leisure specification speeds up the computation by a factor between three and six times. We further show that the elliptical utility of leisure function is a close approximation to the constant relative risk aversion and constant Frisch elasticity functions in terms of marginal utilities, microeconomic outcomes in a life cycle model, and macroeconomic outcomes in a simple real business cycle model.","[Evans, Richard W.] Univ Chicago, Becker Friedman Inst, Saieh Hall,Room 250,5757 S Univ Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Phillips, Kerk L.] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Econ, 166 FOB, Provo, UT 84602 USA",University of Chicago; Brigham Young University,"Phillips, KL (通讯作者)，Brigham Young Univ, Dept Econ, 166 FOB, Provo, UT 84602 USA.",rwevans@uchicago.edu; kerk_phillips@byu.edu,"Phillips, Kerk/H-2732-2012","Phillips, Kerk/0000-0002-4895-4167",,,,,18,1,1,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

The general results of this paper show that introducing the possibility of a time-varying degree of model mistrust produces different emission taxes, abatement and welfare compared to the traditional assumption of a time-fixed model mistrust. This result holds even if the probability that the model mistrust may change in the future is small. If the environmental authority expects that the model uncertainty may decrease in the future then current emissions taxes should also decrease. Conversely, if the model mistrust may increase in the future then an active approach compatible with the Precautionary Principle is optimal and current emissions taxes should also increase.","[Gonzalez, Fidel] Sam Houston State Univ, Dept Econ & Int Business, Huntsville, TX 77341 USA",Texas State University System; Sam Houston State University,"Gonzalez, F (通讯作者)，Sam Houston State Univ, Dept Econ & Int Business, Huntsville, TX 77341 USA.",fxg001@shsu.edu,,,,,,,22,2,2,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

We further identify two systematic cross-sectional differences between those REITs that reduced capital structure risks prior to the financial crisis and those that did not: the exposure to capital structure risks and the strength of corporate governance.

A robustness analysis of stated choice experimental designs,THEORY AND DECISION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Stated choice experiments; Robustness; Mode choice model; Value-of-time; Experimental design; D-efficient,DEPARTURE TIME,"This paper is motivated by the increasing popularity of efficient designs for stated choice experiments. The objective in efficient designs is to create a stated choice experiment that minimizes the standard errors of the estimated parameters. In order to do so, such designs require specifying prior values for the parameters to be estimated. While there is significant literature demonstrating the efficiency improvements (and cost savings) of employing efficient designs, the bulk of the literature tests conditions where the priors used to generate the efficient design are assumed to be accurate. However, there is substantially less literature that compares how different design types perform under varying degree of error of the prior. The literature that does exist assumes small fractions are used (e.g., under 20 unique choice tasks generated), which is in contrast to computer-aided surveys that readily allow for large fractions. Further, the results in the literature are abstract in that there is no reference point (i.e., meaningful units) to provide clear insight on the magnitude of any issue. Our objective is to analyze the robustness of different designs within a typical stated choice experiment context of a trade-off between price and quality. We use as an example transportation mode choice, where the key parameter to estimate is the value of time (VOT). Within this context, we test many designs to examine how robust efficient designs are against a misspecification of the prior parameters. The simple mode choice setting allows for insightful visualizations of the designs themselves and also an interpretable reference point (VOT) for the range in which each design is robust. Not surprisingly, the D-efficient design is most efficient in the region where the true population VOT is near the prior used to generate the design: the prior is $20/h and the efficient range is $10-$30/h. However, the D-efficient design quickly becomes the most inefficient outside of this range (under $5/h and above $40/h), and the estimation significantly degrades above $50/h. The orthogonal and random designs are robust for a much larger range of VOT. The robustness of Bayesian efficient designs varies depending on the variance that the prior assumes. Implementing two-stage designs that first use a small sample to estimate priors are also not robust relative to uninformative designs. Arguably, the random design (which is the easiest to generate) performs as well as any design, and it (as well as any design) will perform even better if data cleaning is done to remove choice tasks where one alternative dominates the other.","[Walker, Joan L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Ctr Global Metropolitan Studies, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 111 McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wang, Yanqiao] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 116 McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Thorhauge, Mikkel] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Engn Management, Bygningstorvet 116B, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Ben-Akiva, Moshe] MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Room 1-181,77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Technical University of Denmark; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Walker, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Ctr Global Metropolitan Studies, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 111 McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",joanwalker@berkeley.edu; yanqiaowang@berkeley.edu; mtho@dtu.dk; mba@mit.edu,"Thorhauge, Mikkel/L-5711-2016","Thorhauge, Mikkel/0000-0002-1887-7527; Ben-Akiva, Moshe/0000-0002-9635-9987",,,,,48,68,75,2,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,MAR,2018,84.0,2,,,SI,,215,238,,10.1007/s11238-017-9647-3,0.0,,,24,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,FW8XW,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000425621300005,0

This article finds that, regardless of their voluntary activity, unemployed people have higher levels of well-being and mental health in countries with more generous unemployment benefits. Unexpectedly, the results also suggest that regular volunteering can actually be detrimental for mental health in countries with less generous unemployment benefits.

Hence, any variation in height among monozygotic twins, who share genetic predispositions, is bound to reflect differences in their environmental exposure. Therefore, a height premium in earnings among monozygotic twins also reflects such exposure. In this study, we analyze the height premium over the life cycle among Swedish twins, 10,000 of whom are monozygotic. The premium is relatively constant over the life cycle, amounting to 5-6% higher earnings per decimeter for men and less for women, suggesting that environmental conditions in childhood and youth affect earnings over most of the adult life course. The premium is larger below median height for men and above median height for young women. The estimates are similar for monozygotic and dizygotic twins, indicating that environmentally and genetically induced height differences are similarly associated with earnings.

Due to the difference of terms between two types of trade credits in Korea, Account Receivable Financing and Supplier Loan, a non-trivial directed network of banks and firms can be formulated. With respect to this trade credit network (TCN), we propose a measure for systemic risk on liquidity channels by calculating the monthly potential risk of liquidity shortage in the worst-case scenarios and show some comparisons with the basic network characteristics. Results claim that the PageRank centralities of individual banks have significant positive impact on the level of systemic risk. More on, degrees of nodes in TCN follows power-law distributions and the network heterogeneity of given month also has significant positive impact on the risk level: that is, the high degree of imbalance in the liquidity channel implies the severe systemic shortage of the liquidity in the worst-case.","[Lee, Jisang; Lee, Duk Hee] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Coll Business, Sch Business & Technol Management, Bldg N22,Gwahak Ro 335, Taejon 305701, South Korea; [Yun, Sung-Guan] Bank Korea, Payment & Settlement Syst Dept, 39 Namdaemun Ro, Seoul 100794, South Korea",Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST); Bank of Korea,"Lee, DH (通讯作者)，Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Coll Business, Sch Business & Technol Management, Bldg N22,Gwahak Ro 335, Taejon 305701, South Korea.",osirisjs@gmail.com; dukheelee@kaist.ac.kr; davidheart@gmail.com,,"Lee, Jisang/0000-0003-0174-678X",National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [2014S1A3A2044459],National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government(2014S1A3A2044459).

This family of rules, called generalized Rawlsianism, provides a unified approach for dealing with different informational constraints on ordinal interpersonal comparisons. Rank noncomparability, which states that individual utilities under the same social ranking should always be interpersonally noncomparable, is then proposed as a new basic invariance axiom. We show that a social welfare ordering with super domain is a generalized rank hierarchy if and only if it satisfies anonymity, nonnullity, full rank noncomparability, and the Pareto monotonicity principle; together with the Pigou-Dalton principle, generalized Rawlsianism can then be fully characterized. Our characterizations depend heavily on the result that a social welfare ordering with super domain is a generalized hierarchy if and only if it satisfies nonnullity, interpersonal noncomparability, and the Pareto monotonicity principle.","[Ou-Yang, Kui] Northwest Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Northwest University Xi'an,"Ou-Yang, K (通讯作者)，Northwest Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",byloyk@gmail.com,,,Science Foundation of Education Department of Shaanxi [2013JK139]; Key Research Foundation of Humanities and Social Sciences of the Ministry of Education of China [16JJD790046],"Science Foundation of Education Department of Shaanxi; Key Research Foundation of Humanities and Social Sciences of the Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China)",I am very grateful for helpful suggestions received from the editors and the anonymous referees.

The research methods used in this study are interview and literature analysis. The conclusions of this study are as follows: The main manifestations of this ethics anomie are that, faculties' pursuit of independent character and academic freedom is faced with severe challenges, the recognition degree of social responsibility is declining, and their position is swinging between justice and benefit. There are many reasons for those problems, such as, the role of faculty is located incorrectly which causes identity crisis, the power distribution within the university system weakens the organizational supporting capacity to the ethics, and the imbalanced social control mechanisms aggravates possibilities of ethics anomie. There are some measures could be taken to solve those problems, such as, facing up to the limitation of universities' social service ability which can eliminate the ethics deviation of role identity, coordinating the relationship between social and self-expectations which can increase the recognition degree of ethics, expanding universities' autonomy space and enhancing the capacity towards it which can improve faculties' moral consciousness and ability, reducing the external uneven regulatory mechanism which can set up a platform to enhance the ability of ethical practice.

Its main aim is to determine the relationship between company performance and supervisory board meeting flequency. Company performance is measured by both the accounting measure of performance (ROA) and market measure of performance (Tobin's Q). The sample consists of 356 companies and 1,611 observations of Polish companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange between 2008 and 2015. Data was hand collected from annual reports and reports of the supervisory boards. These were analysed by Poisson regression. The results showed that supervisory board frequency increases as a result of deteriorating company performance when measured by ROA. In contrast, there was no significant relationship between company performance measured by Tobin's Q and supervisory board meeting frequency. The results suggest that in the Polish system of corporate governance, supervisory boards of publicly listed companies pay more attention to accounting measures of companies and, due to the features of this system, accounting measures seem to be better for the assessment of companies and their management boards.","[Bohdanowicz, Leszek] Univ Lodz, Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Bohdanowicz, L (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Lodz, Poland.",,,"Bohdanowicz, Leszek/0000-0002-4456-070X",,,,,47,0,0,1,9,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-344-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,54,66,,,,,,13,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP0MG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000535358500005,0

This paper analyzes the use of photovoltaic (PV) technology in Europe, discusses what this technology is, and the rate of its development. Also, a list of advanced countries that are actively using solar energy is given. The biggest part in renewable energy is occupied by biofuels and renewable waste. Our analysis confirmed the highest increase in the share of electricity from renewable sources in gross electricity consumption in the years 2004-2015 in Estonia (2,416.7%), Belgium (805.9%) and the United Kingdom (540%). The conducted analysis showed that Malta (1181.1%), the United Kingdom (685.8%) and Luxembourg (283.3%) achieved the highest increases in the share of renewable energy sources in heating and cooling in the years 2004-2015. In the same period Portugal (2.8%), Latvia (21.9%) and Croatia (31.3%) achieved the lowest increases in the share of renewable energy sources in heating and cooling.

According to several studies, chicken farming is seen as one of the most controversial forms of livestock farming due to e.g. the common practice of culling day-old chicks. In 2016, an administrative court in Germany decided that the killing of the male chicks does not violate animal welfare legislation and is permitted for economic reasons. Within the society, this ruling was broadly discussed and largely rejected for ethical reasons. One alternative to the culling of day-old chicks are dual-purpose chicken breeds. These breeds can do both: the hens lay eggs and the cockerels put on meat. But the hens lay fewer and smaller eggs and the cockerels need more time and feed to grow. The ethical evaluation of the topic for this paper has been conducted in six focus groups. In addition, important stakeholders have been identified through a comprehensive literature study. The ethical matrix according to Mepham is a tool of applied ethics for the interpretation of the interests of stakeholders with regard to ethical principles. The matrix is based on the three ethical principles of well-being, autonomy and justice. The aim is to present a well-balanced consideration from different angles and thus to reduce the complexity of the topic. Usually, an innovation is compared with the status quo. In this case: the keeping of dual-purpose chickens with the current practice (culling of day-old chicks). We applied the matrix to five interest groups: dual-purpose chickens, consumers, egg industry, farmers and environment. The results show that the topic dual-purpose chickens as alternative to the killing of day-old chicks is very complex and therefore requires a differentiated consideration of ethical aspects.","[Bruemmer, N.; Christoph-Schulz, I; Rovers, A.] Thunen Inst Market Anal, Bundesallee 63, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany",Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute,"Brümmer, N (通讯作者)，Thunen Inst Market Anal, Bundesallee 63, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany.",nanke.bruemmer@thuenen.de,,,,,,,18,0,0,1,11,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,141,145,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_20,0.0,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000020,0

The results show that 91.9% of the respondents were willing to pay (WTP) a certain amount of money for the perpetual existence of the old campus, and the average WTP was 184.9 RMB per month. WTP was correlated with the interviewees' expected monthly incomes and region, WTP was significantly difference on household registration, the expected income, the level of education and the region where these colleges and universities located in. WTP was different among each college and university, HNU, XAPU and XAUAT had significantly higher WTP than the other five colleges and universities. The total existence value of the old campus in the central and western China was about 49.7x108 RMB per year. The results showed that existence value of the old campus was very large, so they should be given a priority on protection and development.

In this paper we analyze to what extent state spending on primary education affected participation at general elections and votes for pro nationalist parties. We combine census data on the composition of school funding with federal election data at the level of 199 constituencies in five-year intervals from 1886 to 1911. Panel estimates of models with constituency and time-fixed effects show that an increase in the share of central spending is positively related to the vote share for pro-nationalist parties. Results on voter turnout are weaker and less clear cut. Estimates of models with lagged state spending by category of expenditure are consistent with the role of indoctrination of public primary education. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In Georgia as in the whole world there is a tendency of reducing the number of employed people and growing self-employed. As much as the demand for labor is derived from the demand for goods and services, which are created from this labor, it is recommended to determine the economic sector / industries, which are growing at a rapid tendency to stand out and who, therefore, can contribute to the employment problem. Because of this, we focused on the relatively new and one of the fastest growing sectors of the economy - the Tourism Industry. Based on the experience and statistical data in the country, using the method of extrapolation, we carried out research on evaluation of the influence development of tourism industry on the important economic indicators (forecast) for 2020. By 2020 the effectiveness of tourism industry will increase at least 8,6% on employment. The direct share of the tourism industry in Georgia's gross domestic product it is expected that this indicator will increase and reach 9,7% by 2020. Therefore, we consider it necessary to promote development of the sector and take more intensive steps in this direction.

This paper discusses the benefits of the Sharing economy and how problems induced by it can be solved. The aim of the research is to discover drivers and obstacles in developing the Sharing economy and suggest solutions. We use literature study, observations and consumer survey as the research methods. The findings of this research suggest that the main drivers to engage in the Sharing economy are the opportunities to save or earn money. The main obstacles are worries about personal safety and mistreatment by platform members. We suggest building trust between sharing platform members, providing a system of credible reviews about service providers and users, as well as providing more comprehensive information about sharing platforms to enable further development of the Sharing economy. Clear rules should exist for participants in a collaborative economy to separate sharing activities from illegal entrepreneurship and set a fair tax system. The results of the study can help to develop better sharing platforms and for policy makers to work out suitable regulation of the Sharing economy.","[Dimante, Dzineta] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia; [Tambovceva, Tatjana] Riga Tech Univ, Riga, Latvia; [Atstaja, Dzintra] BA Sch Business & Finance, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia; Riga Technical University,"Dimante, D (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,"ATSTAJA, Dzintra/A-6576-2010; Tambovceva, Tatjana/G-2828-2010","ATSTAJA, Dzintra/0000-0002-9411-7212; Tambovceva, Tatjana/0000-0002-9516-1530",,,,,23,1,1,0,6,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-344-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,123,133,,,,,,11,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP0MG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000535358500012,0

Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to the diagnosis of financial health of businesses and to identify early signs of their future problems. In relation to this need, a number of diagnostic models based on the application of financial indicators have been developed. The most used methods of today include discriminant analysis, logistic regression, decision trees as well as neural networks. However, these methods have limited processing capabilities in terms of the number of the data and database size. Therefore, new approaches arise. These methods eliminate the shortcomings of traditional approaches. Recently, an unusual method of addressing this issue has come into the forefront. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a non-parametric method that has a number of advantages compared to conventional methods of assessing financial health. The aim of the paper was to evaluate and predict the financial health of selected sample of Slovak businesses. To fulfil this aim we used DEA CCR model, which is based on solving a system of linear programming problems. We formulated dual linear programming model. With the use of this model we identified businesses which are financially healthy. We calculated also goal values of financial indicators for those businesses which did not reach the required financial health frontier. Achievement of these goal values is a precondition for ensuring competitiveness of analysed sample of businesses.","[Horvathova, Jarmila; Mokrisova, Martina] Univ Presov, Fac Management, Presov, Slovakia",University of Presov,"Horvathova, J (通讯作者)，Univ Presov, Fac Management, Presov, Slovakia.",jarmila.horvathova@unipo.sk; martina.mokrisova@unipo.sk,"Mokrišová, Martina/D-2350-2018; Horváthová, Jarmila/D-2360-2018","Mokrišová, Martina/0000-0001-9473-2429; Horváthová, Jarmila/0000-0003-3388-8635",grant scheme VEGA - Increasing the competitiveness of Slovakia within the EU by improving efficiency and performance of production systems [1/0887/17],grant scheme VEGA - Increasing the competitiveness of Slovakia within the EU by improving efficiency and performance of production systems,This paper was prepared within the grant scheme VEGA no. 1/0887/17 - Increasing the competitiveness of Slovakia within the EU by improving efficiency and performance of production systems.,,16,1,1,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,435,444,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540720300042,0

The study was based on a questionnaire method for the data collection and statistic measures for its analysation. The strategic information concerns strategic decisions which shape existence and functioning of the organisation in the long term and determine all important tasks and activities in the short term. The gaps in strategic information are defined as perceived by the decision makers lack of this information. The information barrier is an obstacle hindering or precluding the use of information or its dissemination. Therefore, information barriers are the cause of the information gaps during decision-making. The most important gaps for farmers of external strategic information are gaps characterising the demand for agricultural products, as well as the agricultural policy of the government and the EU. Among internal information, the farmers reported the lack of information about the financial position of the farm. As the main information barriers, farmers pointed out the problems with obtaining and processing information. In this regard, the internal barriers (lack of time and / or employees) or externally (inadequate policy information based on the public institution) were equally important. Another important barrier is inadequate preparation of the farmers to use the information accordingly (low intelligibility of information and belief that they are not needed during decision making). The most important limitations of the research and its conclusions are: the limited scope of the study only to Poland and the limited list of the gaps and barriers used in the survey.","[Jaworski, Jacek] WSB Univ Gdansk, Finance Dept, Gdansk, Poland; [Sokolowska, Katarzyna] WSB Univ Gdansk, Econ Dept, Gdansk, Poland; [Kondraszuk, Tomasz] Life Sci Univ Warsaw, Country Dept Econ & Org Enterprise, Org, Warsaw, Poland",,"Jaworski, J (通讯作者)，WSB Univ Gdansk, Finance Dept, Gdansk, Poland.",jjaworski@wsb.gda.pl; sokkat@wp.pl; tomasz_kondraszuk@sggw.pl,"Jaworski, Jacek/AFS-4868-2022; Jaworski, Jacek/AAK-7010-2021","Jaworski, Jacek/0000-0002-6629-3497;",,,,,21,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,67,75,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540720300008,0

The employer is obliged by labour law, collective law agreements or employment contacts to accumulate those provisions and to apply indicators like a discount rate, an expected inflation rate and an employee turnover rate. On the other hand, an employer stays encouraged to not retire until the required seniority is achieved to receive the employee benefits such as retirement benefits, pension benefits as well as jubilee bonuses. The article presents an innovative probabilistic (randomised) approach to the valuation of a provision for employee benefits. The main goal of the article is to create a probabilistic model of provision for an employee. To achieve the goal, actuarial methods were used to estimate the provision for an employee in accordance with current legal standards in Poland (ie the Accountancy Act, labor law, international accounting standards). The adoption of actuarial assumptions about the random structure of model parameters has a significant impact on its value, and thus on the financial result of the business entity, as well as on the faithful and reliable picture of the business unit.","[Krzykowski, Grzegorz; Spigarska, Ewa; Poblocka, Agnieszka] Univ Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; University of Gdansk,"Krzykowski, G (通讯作者)，Univ Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.",,,"Poblocka, Agnieszka/0000-0001-8618-9921",,,,,16,0,0,1,1,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-344-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,367,377,,,,,,11,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP0MG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000535358500034,0

It shows that the neoliberal economic development model embraced by Lithuania since regaining independence in 1991 produced significant economic growth. However, this growth was based on suppressing wages, keeping taxes on capital low and exporting cheap labour to the core EU countries. This resulted in high inequalities in income and wealth that have contributed to a deep socio-demographic crisis in the country. It is argued that in order to make Lithuanian capitalism socially sustainable, the neoliberal model of development needs to be reconsidered and modified.","[Lazutka, Romas] Vilnius Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Sauletekio Str 9, LT-01513 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Juska, Arunas] East Carolina Univ, Dept Sociol, 418-A Brewster,10th St, Greenville, NC 27858 USA; [Navicke, Jekaterina] Vilnius Univ, Dept Social Policy, Fac Philosophy, Univ Str 9-1, LT-01513 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius University; University of North Carolina; East Carolina University; Vilnius University,"Lazutka, R (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Sauletekio Str 9, LT-01513 Vilnius, Lithuania.",lazutka@ktl.mii.lt; juskaa@ecu.edu; j.navicke@gmail.com,,"Lazutka, Romas/0000-0003-0480-8894",Research Council of Lithuania [GER-007/2015],Research Council of Lithuania(Research Council of Lithuania (LMTLT)),We are grateful to Professor Charles Woolfson for his valuable comments and suggestions.

The results showed that Indonesia does not have a standard regulation of tobacco trading system. The Farmers Protection Act does not significantly affect the prosperity of tobacco farmers. The law becomes meaningless, as there is a provision that foreign investors are prohibited from purchasing tobacco directly from farmers.

Could it be that the track record of livestock development interventions is so meagre because of the influence of a reductionistic worldview? The Cartesian worldview has been extremely influential in Western culture and broader. Central in this worldview is a thinking in terms of traditional versus modern and subject (ive) versus object(ive). It has been argued that in development cooperation this has given rise to projectivistic thinking and acting where reality, including the realities of farmers and others, is only meaningless material, to be freely given shape based on a rational design. This is accompanied by an attitude in which our by and large individualistic Western society with its (presumed) institutional mechanicism - such as the market mechanism - is seen to be the model for other societies as well. Finally, we can note a marginalisation of religion and worldview in the public debate. The aim of this contribution is thereforeto analyse in a qualitative way whether such traces of the Cartesian worldview can be linked to development programmes' successes or failures in achieving impact. To this end, a set of eight impact evaluations of dairy development interventions in Kenya are considered, spanning the period 2007-2014. We (1) analyse what positive and negative effects - as emerging from the evaluation documents - have resulted from these interventions; (2) normatively reflect on what the evaluation documents posit as positive and negative effects; (3) analyse whether we can speak of a significant influence of the Cartesian worldview in such interventions; and (3) establish whether there is a relationship between the degree to which projects and programs embody a Cartesian worldview and their respective success or failure. Even though results are not available yet, and the relationship between the influence of a Cartesian worldview and a project or program's success is hypothetical, we at least expect to provide a typology of positive and negative effects of Kenyan dairy development interventions, and be able to show to which degree projects and programs are influenced by the Cartesian worldview.","[Rademaker, C.

Thus, the institutional frameworks of countries comparable to Croatia can be used/consulted in the case of remodelling or adjusting the national institutional framework. Namely, national systems, which enable a smooth management and an efficient implementation of EU Cohesion Policy funds, are crucial for a successful use of the EU Cohesion Policy in different countries. However, various institutional frameworks for the EU Cohesion Policy exist in practice. Therefore, the experiences of countries differ due to a number of factors, such as the intensity and the type of EU financing, the coherence of priorities for EU financing, the relative strength of national and regional administrations, national economic and regional traditions. Due to that, implementation systems can vary significantly between countries and the institutional framework existing in one country does not have to be fully applicable to another country. Thus, the gathering and processing of information related to the national implementation systems across the EU is troublesome. In order to have a clear overview of the implementation systems in the selected countries, within the scope of this paper the same approach has been used for each selected country. Namely, the same elements of the implementation and management systems have been analysed: the number of programmes and EU funds allocation, the architecture of the programme, the funds allocated to the operational programmes, the overview of the operational programmes, management authorities and intermediate bodies. Such a structured approach makes comparison between countries much more transparent. For the analysis of the institutional frameworks (systems) of the EU Cohesion Policy implementation, several countries have been chosen: Slovenia, Slovakia and Hungary, due to their relative similarities with Croatia: size, the level of development, the number of regions, economic strength and the allocation of EU funds.","[Savic, Zvonimir] Croatian Chamber Econ, Zagreb, Croatia",,"Savic, Z (通讯作者)，Croatian Chamber Econ, Zagreb, Croatia.",zsavic@hgk.hr,,"Savic, Zvonimir/0000-0001-6163-9201",,,,,9,0,0,0,1,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,636,661,,,,,,26,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300036,0

The financialization reflects the growing asymmetry between production and exchange processes, in particular regarding the financial component of the exchange process. This asymmetry was revealed along with gradual changes in the financial behavior of non-financial enterprises, banks and households. The indication of this transformation process has been increasing the profit generated through financial transactions instead of operating activities. The main goal of this article was to answer the question about the coefficient between the level of financialization and the operating performance of companies from Poland. The research sample consists of the listed non-financial companies and the research period covers 2011-2017. The authors used calculated on their own synthetic indicators of company financialization reflecting their financial as well as investment performance and financial indicators measuring operating activity performance. In order to achieve the research goal, a standard statistical analysis of results was performed and correlation coefficients were used to measure the strength and the direction of association that exists between the level of financialization and the operating performance of companies. The empirical findings suggest the existence of differences in terms of operating activity performance (e.g. EBITDA Margin, EBITDA/Total Assets, Assets Turnover, Revenue/Working Capital) among companies with different level of financialization. It also suggests that financialization reflecting investment performance interact with operating activity performance differently to financialization reflecting financial performance.","[Socha, Blazej; Urban, Dariusz] Univ Lodz, Fac Management, Dept Finance & Strateg Management, Matejki St 22-26, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Socha, B (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Fac Management, Dept Finance & Strateg Management, Matejki St 22-26, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland.",blazej.socha@uni.lodz.pl; dariusz.urban@uni.lodz.pl,"Socha, Blazej/N-6962-2018",,,,,,11,0,0,1,7,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8980-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,646,652,,,,,,7,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BM4AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000462948800083,0

Every organization is a society in microcosm. Each lives their own culture and are tempted to focus on solutions and resolution of the conflicted issues ,when a solution of the conflict where either be suggested or imposed from the authorities in the organisation. Often there is no time to think that maybe will be more helpful, instead, to think in terms of a process that will enable those involved in the conflict to arrive at their own solution or find ways of living with the differences within the organizational culture. In addition, it is not possible to imagine organizational communication without conflict. Conflicts are something inevitable in any organization because people have different opinions between them. At first, where believed that conflicts were something that might destroy, manager's authority but studies in the 1970s showed that conflicts could have a positive, as well as a negative side (Spaho, at all, 2013). There is a common agreement that it is very dangerous for an organization to have both too many conflicts, as well as not to have any conflicts at all. Therefore, it is the prime responsibility of education and curriculum in the formal school system to educate students how to put in place appropriate strategies on how to minimize conflicts, focused on the process rather than product and develop necessaries social and communication skills.","[Spanja, Sanja; Pejakovic, Sara] Univ JJ Strossmayer, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Dept Pedag, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Spanja, S (通讯作者)，Univ JJ Strossmayer, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Dept Pedag, Osijek, Croatia.",sspanja@ffos.hr; skakuk@ffos.hr,"Kakuk, Sara/AAX-7028-2020",,,,,,23,0,0,0,2,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,953,967,,,,,,15,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300053,0

However, marketing carried out by consumers remains outside the scope of such studies. The application of new technologies over the past decade and the over-supply of products have made the consumer stronger in doing their own marketing. Products resulting from mass production are not among the most desirable for consumers with income above average. These major changes, along with the increasing public interest in formal and non-formal education and mobility have contributed to the formation of individuals who are able to develop and execute their own marketing in their relationships with companies. The purpose of this paper is to present the prerequisites for the emergence of consumer made marketing, its specific applications and potential partnerships, and the benefits to all parties. Due to the specificity of the scope of the study, methods based on secondary sources of information, quantitative and qualitative methods for collecting primary data were used. An online consumer survey was conducted, using the convenience sample method, which identified important outcomes related to the application of marketing on the part of consumers. The focus group interview, comprising active and innovative consumers, highlighted key aspects of the potential of C2B partnership and possible consumer impact on company marketing. The role of the consumer in carrying out marketing and the positive aspects thereof are presented herein. The potential opportunities for consumer engagement in B2C marketing and its benefits for consumers and companies are being discussed.

We scrutinise the ways in which denial arguments presented in the media are tied to the changing Russian political and economic context, especially the increasingly authoritarian turn in governance during President Vladimir Putin's third term in office (Putin 2.0). We conclude that the Russian discourse on climate change emphasises Russia's Great Power status, identifying its sovereignty and fossil energy as the basis of this status. This discourse refers to key categories, including Russia's national identity and the spatial-material characteristics of the Russian state.","[Tynkkynen, Veli-Pekka] Univ Helsinki, Russian Environm Studies, Aleksanteri Inst, POB 42, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Tynkkynen, Nina] Univ Turku, Fac Humanities, Balt Sea Reg Studies, Turku 20014, Finland",University of Helsinki; University of Turku,"Tynkkynen, VP (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Russian Environm Studies, Aleksanteri Inst, POB 42, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",veli-pekka.tynkkynen@helsinki.fi; nina.tynkkynen@utu.fi,,"Tynkkynen, Veli-Pekka/0000-0001-9006-753X",,,,,53,39,42,2,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2018,70.0,7,,,,,1103,1120,,10.1080/09668136.2018.1472218,0.0,,,18,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,GW0TJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000446581900005,0

In this largely conceptual discussion, the actual mechanism whereby non-human animals' interests could be taken into account in political decision-making has received little attention. Thus, the purpose of the present paper is to consider the practical procedures related to the composition and operation of an advocacy committee where non-human animals would be represented by human proxies. We propose a model in which various scientific and lay experts elect the members of a 'committee for non-human animals' that not only produces statements on bills that coercively affect sentient non-human animals, but also initiates political discussion on critical issues. We also provide an illustrative example of how such a committee could deal with issues related to a proposed sustainability transition from animal-derived to plant-based foodstuffs.","[Vinnari, M.; Vinnari, E.] Univ Tampere, Fac Management, Kanslerinrinne 1, Tampere 33014, Finland",Tampere University,"Vinnari, M (通讯作者)，Univ Tampere, Fac Management, Kanslerinrinne 1, Tampere 33014, Finland.",markus.vinnari@uta.fi,,,,,,,19,0,0,1,1,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,104,109,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_14,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000014,0

Company managers try to adopt such a strategy that will lead to an optimization of the level of costs. This is a difficult task as in many cases the costs that theoretically could be avoided are the result of a conservative liquidity management policy. And this policy is to guarantee the financial security of an individual, which is the basis for effective management. Customer lending is also a cost that could be theoretically avoided but an aggressive policy in this area could have a negative impact on the sales volume. The business environment is also influenced by the company's cost management policy. These are various types of external phenomena that managers do not have influence on, for example, changes in raw material prices, state policy, and various types of conflicts. Therefore, managers need to focus their activities on their own cost management policy. In general, the basic and the simplest solution in the field of cost management is the reduction of wages. In many companies, in the short term it is effective, but there are industries such as air transport where cost reduction and seeking savings in this area is unacceptable. The aim of the article is to analyze cost management in an air transport company and present solutions that can lead to an optimization of non-cost expenditure in such units.","[Zimon, Grzegorz] Rzeszow Univ Technol, Rzeszow, Poland",Rzeszow University of Technology,"Zimon, G (通讯作者)，Rzeszow Univ Technol, Rzeszow, Poland.",gzimon@prz.edu.pl,"Zimon, Grzegorz/V-5509-2018","Zimon, Grzegorz/0000-0002-2040-4438",,,,,17,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,354,360,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540723300041,0

International and Southern African Development Community tourists account for approximately 25% and 2% of the total number of visitors to South African national parks, with domestic visitors making up the remaining portion. Although small, the South African international tourism market is mature and accounts for a disproportionately large share (around 42%) of net revenue. To estimate visitation demand at the KTP and three other national parks, random effects Tobit Model was used. Using the estimated elasticities, the revenue-maximizing daily conservation fee was computed to be R1 131.94 (US$144.20) for KTP, which can be compared with the R180 (US$22.93) currently charged. Furthermore, the study also demonstrated that there is a possibility of raising fees at the other three parks. Sharing conservation revenue with communities surrounding parks could demonstrate the link between ecotourism and local communities' economic development and promote a positive view of land restitution involving national parks.","[Dikgang, Johane] Univ Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Muchapondwa, Edwin] Univ Cape Town, Rondebosch, South Africa; [Muchapondwa, Edwin; Stage, Jesper] Lulea Univ Technol, Lulea, Sweden",University of Johannesburg; University of Cape Town; Lulea University of Technology,"Dikgang, J (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Publ & Environm Econ Res Ctr, Dept Econ & Econometr, Johannesburg, South Africa.",jdikgang@uj.ac.za,"Stage, Jesper/B-6718-2009; Dikgang, Johane/ABB-7214-2021","Dikgang, Johane/0000-0002-8076-4443; Stage, Jesper/0000-0001-7206-6568",ERSA (Economic Research Southern Africa); FORMAS through its COMMONS programme; Sida (Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency) through its Environment for Development programme,ERSA (Economic Research Southern Africa); FORMAS through its COMMONS programme(Swedish Research Council Formas); Sida (Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency) through its Environment for Development programme,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work received funds from ERSA (Economic Research Southern Africa), FORMAS through its COMMONS programme and Sida (Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency) through its Environment for Development programme.",,29,7,10,0,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Declines also differ across countries and trade partners: they are larger for fast-growing countries, for nearby trade partners, and among partners that adopt regional trade agreements.

Further, there is no publicly available brand equity data of restaurant firms thus far.

We show that leadership is a critical intervening variable in this enhanced Europeanization, as well as pointing to the salience of the explanatory mechanisms of social and instrumental learning. The contribution of the article is twofold. It offers an empirical account of contemporary Cypriot foreign policy and contributes to the discussion of the impact of the Eurozone crisis on national foreign policy. Both, we contend, remain relatively neglected topics in the literature.","[Christou, George; Kyris, George] Univ Warwick, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Kyris, George] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick; University of Birmingham,"Kyris, G (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Polit Sci & Int Studies, Int & European Polit, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",g.kyris@bham.ac.uk,"Kyris, George/ABD-6142-2021; Christou, George/A-3072-2014","Kyris, George/0000-0003-4396-8532;",,,,,49,2,2,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

This study examines how the implementation and removal of home purchase restrictions has affected housing price changes in major cities. Based on the dataset of 70 large-and medium-sized cities between 2014 and 2015, the price evolution trends were evaluated by the distribution dynamic analysis based on the method of Mobility Probability Plot (MPP). This newly developed method allows for better exploring housing price dynamics under home purchase restriction policy. There are four major findings: First, home purchase restriction has a salient effect on curbing speculative investment demand in terms of lowering large sized housing price growth; second, home purchase restriction has long -running effects on bringing down housing prices if the current price increase does not exceed 5% on a month -to -month basis; third, small-or large -sized housing may face more downward pressure of housing prices than medium-sized housing under the home purchase restriction; fourth, removal of the home purchase restriction may saliently increase the housing price levels that have been contained.","[Li, Victor Jing] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog & Resource Management, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Andy Wui Wing; Cheong, Tsun Se] Hang Seng Management Coll, Sch Business, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong; Hang Seng University of Hong Kong,"Cheong, TS (通讯作者)，Hang Seng Management Coll, Sch Business, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jamescheong@hsmc.edu.hk,"Li, Jing/AFS-0355-2022","Li, Jing/0000-0001-9137-9877",,,,,46,39,42,10,112,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

Paradoxically, flexible units are currently being mothballed or retired in Europe due to financial losses. We investigate an energy-only market design, referred to as operating reserve demand curves, that rewards flexibility by adjusting the real-time energy price to a level that reflects the value of capacity under conditions of scarcity. We test the performance of the mechanism by developing a model of the Belgian electricity market, which is validated against the historical outcomes of the market over a study period of 21 months. We verify that (i) based on the observed market outcomes of our study period, none of the existing combined cycle gas turbines of the Belgian market can cover their investment costs, and (ii) the introduction of price adders that reflect the true value of scarce flexible capacity restores economic viability for most combined cycle gas turbines in the Belgian market.","[Papavasiliou, Anthony; Smeers, Yves] Catholic Univ Louvain, Ctr Operat Res & Econometr, Off B-114,Voie Roman Pays 34, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain,"Papavasiliou, A (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, Ctr Operat Res & Econometr, Off B-114,Voie Roman Pays 34, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",anthony.papavasiliou@uclouvain.be,,,ENGIE Chair on Energy Economics and Energy Risk Management; Belgian Regulatory Commission for Electricity and Gas (CREG),ENGIE Chair on Energy Economics and Energy Risk Management; Belgian Regulatory Commission for Electricity and Gas (CREG),"The authors benefited from discussions with William Hogan, Shmuel Oren, Alain Marien, Jacques Gheury, and Resmi Surendran.

To achieve this, we use a univariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model to capture the volatility characteristics of freight derivative returns and apply time-varying copula models to describe the nonlinear dependence between returns of spot and freight derivatives. Using quotes of spot freight rate and forward freight agreement (FFA) in the tanker market from January 3, 2006 to December 23, 2011, we derive the minimum VaR hedge ratios. Our main findings are as follows: First, we found significant evidence for the presence of volatility persistence in freight rate returns. Second, for dependence, we suggested that a time-varying t-copula performs best in describing how returns of spot freight rates relate to 1-month FFA returns, whereas a time-varying Gumbel copula performs much better for the description of nonlinear dependence between returns of spot freight rates and 2 and 3-month FFA returns. Third, the derived hedge ratios are associated with shipowners' risk preferences and freight rate dynamics, which have important implications for shipowners in determining the optimal number of FFA contracts. The results provide some insights into the modeling of freight derivatives for risk management.","[Shi, Wenming; Yang, Zhongzhi; Wang, Ganggang] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Li, Kevin X.] Chung Ang Univ, Dept Int Logist, 221 Heuk Seok Dong, Seoul, South Korea",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Chung Ang University,"Wang, GG (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",swm8503@sjtu.edu.cn; kxli@cau.ac.kr; zzyang@sjtu.edu.cn; fypzlfypzlfypzl@sjtu.edu.cn,,"Shi, Wenming/0000-0001-6551-0499; Li, Kevin X/0000-0002-7712-3020",,,,,55,17,17,0,20,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Using survey data, we find more program inefficiencies and leakages in village councils reserved for women heads: political and administrative inexperience make such councils more vulnerable to bureaucratic capture. This is at odds with claims of unconditional gains from women assuming political office. A panel of official audit reports enables us to explore (a) whether newly elected women leaders in reserved seats initially perform worse; (b) whether they partly catch up, fully catch up, or eventually outperform (male) leaders in unreserved seats; and (c) the time it takes for such catch-up to occur. We find that women leaders in reserved seats initially underperform but rapidly learn and quickly and fully catch up with male politicians in unreserved seats. Over the duration of their elected tenure, we find no evidence of overtake. Our findings suggest short-term costs of affirmative action policies but also that once initial disadvantages recede, women leaders are neither more nor less effective local politicians than men.","[Afridi, Farzana] Indian Stat Inst, Delhi, India; [Iversen, Vegard] Indian Inst Management, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India; [Sharan, M.

Most TSC studies, to date, assumed the market demand to be influenced only by tour price under price competitive environment, not considering the effect of advertising investment. In order to address this problem, two models are established considering decentralized channels: tour operator Stackelberg (TS) and local operator Stackelberg (LS). We analytically show TS model to provide better results than LS model and advertising to strongly influence the channel members' pricing strategies and profit. Then we generalized the solution considering multiple operators under price competition. We studied two coordination mechanisms, cooperative advertising and two-part tariff, and found the two-part tariff provides better mechanism for improving the profit in LS model compared to cooperative advertisement.","[Jena, Sarat Kumar; Jog, Deepti] Goa Inst Management, Poriem 403505, Sanquelim, India",Goa Institute of Management,"Jena, SK (通讯作者)，Goa Inst Management, Poriem 403505, Sanquelim, India.",saratjena@gim.ac.in,"Jog, Deepti/AAU-6396-2020; Jena, Sarat Kumar/AAM-3903-2021; Jena, Sarat Kumar/AAQ-6189-2020; Jena, Sarat Kumar/N-4806-2014","Jog, Deepti/0000-0001-7551-0871; Jena, Sarat Kumar/0000-0002-6033-5959; Jena, Sarat Kumar/0000-0002-6033-5959",,,,,34,26,26,4,77,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

As a result their returns are likely to reflect not only the overall dynamics of the asset class but also the way these interact with the unique features of the property. Yet the way that property characteristics influence price dynamics is not well measured or understood. We propose a Mixed Repeat Sales (MRS) model which allows for the nature of the asset to influence price dynamics. This is illustrated empirically using a large data set for the state of New South Wales in Australia (of which Sydney city is the capital) from 2000-2014. The MRS approach enables us to estimate returns at a disaggregated level based upon property characteristics. We find significant dispersion in appreciation rates across locations and that returns were higher for separate houses compared with both apartments and attached houses. However, the size of the dwelling, reflected in the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and the land area play a lesser role in price developments.","[Melser, Daniel] Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Wellington Rd, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Monash University,"Melser, D (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Wellington Rd, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",daniel.melser@monash.edu,,"Melser, Daniel/0000-0003-0452-818X",,,,,41,9,9,0,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

The purpose of this study is to determine what factors lead to listing price changes and the effect of listing price changes on the net selling price received by sellers. This study uses a sample of 13,461 single-family home sales in which 4308 had a selling price reduction during the listing period. The average original listing price for properties with one or more listing price changes is 18 % larger compared to properties where the listing price is unchanged; this difference narrows to 9.7 % when comparing final listing prices. The results indicate that the probability of a listing price reduction and the percent reduction are positively associated with house size, vacant property status, and a weak economy. A sample selection bias appears to exist for list price reduction properties, and while overpricing of properties often leads to a listing price reduction, the effect of a listing price change on the net selling price is estimated to be two to three times the given reduction in the listing price.","[Gordon, Bruce L.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, UAB Collat Sch Business, BEC 306D,1720 2nd Ave S, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Winkler, Daniel T.] Univ North Carolina Greensboro, Joseph M Bryan Sch Business & Econ, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Greensboro,"Winkler, DT (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Greensboro, Joseph M Bryan Sch Business & Econ, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA.",brucegordon@uab.edu; dt_winkler@uncg.edu,,,,,,,33,5,5,1,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Theoretical studies stress that the price differential between curbside and garage parking fees is critical in addressing this inefficiency; yet, the interactions between the two have received little attention to date in the literature. By drawing on a new self-constructed database for all the garages in the city of Barcelona, we empirically explore the determinants of garage prices. Our results indicate that prices are mainly influenced by fixed and variable cost drivers, the dominance position of the garage in its surrounding market and the garage's interaction with curbside parking. We also find that prices react to the scarcity of parking spaces in the street and to the curbside price fixed by the public authority. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

I find the own-price and income elasticity of demand for residential, commercial, and industrial customers that are generally consistent with the published economics literature. While static models work well for residential demand, dynamic models are more appropriate for the larger customer classes who require more time to adjust. Conditioning on the regressors, I find that residential and commercial electricity demand has been increasing slowly while industrial electricity demand and deflated electricity prices have been decreasing. In all price models I find that total factor productivity is consistently the most significant explanatory factor with a 1% increase in total factor productivity resulting in a reduction in deflated electricity prices ranging between 0.05% and 0.30%, depending on the model. Lastly, I find that retail electricity competition is associated with lower deflated electricity prices with the mean total impact being -4.3%, -8.2% and -11.1% for residential, commercial and industrial customers, respectively and with the impact diminishing over the sample period for residential customers, remaining relatively constant for commercial customers and increasing for industrial customers.","[Ros, Agustin J.] NERA Econ Consulting, 200 Clarendon St, Boston, MA 02116 USA; [Ros, Agustin J.] Paseo Reforma 505, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",,"Ros, AJ (通讯作者)，NERA Econ Consulting, 200 Clarendon St, Boston, MA 02116 USA.;Ros, AJ (通讯作者)，Paseo Reforma 505, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",Agustin.ros@nera.com,,,Alberta Public Utilities Commission,Alberta Public Utilities Commission,"I benefitted from discussions with Jeff Makholm, Phil O'Connor, Wayne P.

Differently from most of the literature in the field, measures of conformity are included as attributes inside a stated choice (SC) experiment, allowing a direct comparison of their effects with typical effects such as purchase price, range and fuel/electricity price. To measure informational conformity we set up an experiment where the same individual answers the choice tasks before and after he/she has received social information on three specific EV features: range, parking spaces reserved for EV and the need to change activity schedule if using an EV. Normative conformity was measured in terms of social adoption, social-signalling and injunctive norms. Social adoption and a pair of eyes to detect social signalling were included as attributes in the stated choice experiment, while injunctive norms were measured using psychometric indicators. The SC experiment was also aimed at testing the effect of parking policy on the choice of EV. Hybrid choice models were estimated and a resampling technique was used to test the model sensitivity to the sample gathered. All social conformity effects tested are highly significant and their impact in the overall utility can be high enough to compensate also quite low driving range for EV (e.g. around 130 km) or significant differences in purchase price (for example 1/3 higher for EV than ICV). We also found that parking price and the number of slots reserved for EV can be effective in boosting the demand for EV, but a combination of parking policies is needed because each measure alone does not have a sufficient impact to compensate major differences in the characteristics between EV and ICV.

We find evidence that output tariff reduction interacts differently with plants' R&D and investment behaviours, respectively, to affect wage skill premium. More specifically, output tariff reduction increases wage skill premium mostly in R&D-performing plants while reducing it mostly in plants making positive facility investments. While there is weak evidence that input tariff reduction increases wage skill premium, no such interactive effects are found. One story behind our results is that, although both R&D and facility investments may respond to changes in profit opportunities due to output tariff reductions, R&D raises the relative demand for the skilled workers while facility investment, an activity of increasing production capacity, raises the relative demand for the unskilled workers.","[Hahn, Chin Hee] Gachon Univ, Dept Econ, Seongnam Si, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Choi, Yong-Seok] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Gachon University; Kyung Hee University,"Hahn, CH (通讯作者)，Gachon Univ, Dept Econ, Seongnam Si, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",,"Choi, Yong-Seok/AAH-9264-2020","Choi, Yong-Seok/0000-0002-9689-2335",Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia,Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia,This research was financially supported by Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia under the project entitled 'Impact of Globalization on Labor Market'.

Virtual water content was also estimated for the same crops in different bioclimatic areas. Our calculations show that Tunisia is a net virtual water importer. We also surprisingly show that, even though olive production is mostly rain fed, olive oil production is still identified as the most water-demanding commodity (7 m(3)/kg) in Tunisia due to the need of blue water for its processing. By exporting 145.9 thousand tons of olive oil and 97.8 thousand tons of date in 2013, Tunisia has respectively lost 1079.6 and 283.6 Million m(3) of virtual water.

We show that a height gap relative to a richer population such as whites in England also exists, although substantially reduced, among adult immigrants of Indian ethnicity in England. This is despite positive height selection into migration, demonstrated by ethnic Indian adults in England being on average 6-7 cm taller than in India. However, the difference between natives and ethnic Indians in England disappears among their younger sons and daughters, although it re-appears among adolescents. We estimate that, conditional on age, gender and parental height, ethnic Indian children of age 2-4 in England are 6-8% taller than in India.

We use a panel dataset comprising 22 manufacturing sectors across 23 OECD countries. In our econometric model, the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on sectoral employment is mediated by the degree of openness and by a measure of labour market rigidity: the OECD's employment protection legislation (EPL) index. Our results suggest that greater labour market rigidity reduces the impact of exchange rate shocks on employment. This effect is statistically significant for low-technology sectors.","[Alexandre, Fernando; Cerejeira, Joao; Portela, Miguel] Univ Minho, Braga, Portugal; [Alexandre, Fernando; Cerejeira, Joao; Portela, Miguel] NIPE, Braga, Portugal; [Bacao, Pedro] Univ Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal; [Bacao, Pedro] GEMF, Coimbra, Portugal; [Portela, Miguel] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Universidade do Minho; Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Alexandre, F (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, Braga, Portugal.;Alexandre, F (通讯作者)，NIPE, Braga, Portugal.",,"Portela, Miguel/C-4509-2008; Alexandre, Fernando/B-5330-2009; Bacao, Pedro/B-8491-2009; Cerejeira, Joao/E-5106-2010","Portela, Miguel/0000-0002-4721-2081; Alexandre, Fernando/0000-0001-7933-7885; Bacao, Pedro/0000-0002-3340-1068; Cerejeira, Joao/0000-0001-6544-6116",,,,,37,5,6,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2017,40.0,5,,,,,993,1011,,10.1111/twec.12376,0.0,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,ET9RB,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000400644200009,0

There is growing acknowledgement that the strategy of implementing transit benefits may boost transit ridership and reduce personal vehicle use. This research contributes to the understanding of this issue by examining the relationship between commuter benefits and mode choice for commuting trips in the states of New York and New Jersey (US). Based on individual data from the Regional Household Travel Survey conducted by the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council and North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority, we adopted a multinomial logit model to identify the extent to which transport benefits to employees - including public transport-related, private transport-related and benefits for walking and cycling - promote changes in commuters' modal split. The analysis shows that commuter benefits play a significant role in explaining observed travel patterns. Benefit programs that pay for auto expenses (e.g. toll payments, mileage reimbursement, free parking) are negatively correlated with transit, biking, and walking, while employer-funded benefit programs for transit passes and bike reimbursements increase their respective mode shares. This result confirms that promoting these types of measures is an effective policy to encourage the use of public transport modes, thus increasing efficiency and sustainability in daily mobility patterns.

Production decomposition analysis (PDA) is a theoretical tool widely used to investigate the factors influencing changes in CO2 emissions. Instead of the standard constant returns to scale assumption, the study proposes a new generalized PDA method that considers the influence of changes in scale efficiency. The study used a panel data set for China's airlines during the period of 2007-2013 to conduct an empirical analysis and generate meaningful results. First, it was found that changes in Revenue Ton Kilometers is the largest factor contributing to increased civil aviation CO2 emissions. Second, changes in potential energy intensity play a dominant role in decreasing CO2 emissions for most airlines. Third, changes in production technology effects exert a relatively small influence on CO2 emissions, and the effect of scale efficiency change positively contributes to curbing CO2 emissions.

Model results indicate that the relationship between arts businesses and walkability is sensitive to the size or scale of the business considered, as well as to the definition of the arts used. Larger-scale businesses are somewhat more likely to locate in walkable neighborhoods than are small-scale arts-related businesses, which are less likely to locate in walkable neighborhoods. This difference is likely due to the higher cost of property in these neighborhoods. In this regard, community-level economic development and planning entities need to take proactive measures to ameliorate the cost externalities associated with modifications to urban environments to make them more walkable.","[Mack, Elizabeth A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog Environm & Spatial Sci, 673 Auditorium Rd, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Talen, Emily] Univ Chicago, Urbanism, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Koschinsky, Julia] Univ Chicago, Ctr Spatial Data Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Michigan State University; University of Chicago; University of Chicago,"Mack, EA (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog Environm & Spatial Sci, 673 Auditorium Rd, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",emack@msu.edu,,,,,,,86,2,2,0,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Respondents are assigned to segments through a chi-squared automatic interaction detector method according to their willingness to pay for recreational improvements. This method identifies the main socio-economic and behavioural variables that differentiate the segments. The results show that the segment with the largest willingness to pay is formed by visitors who contribute to environmental protection and rate their recreational experience in the forest as very good. Besides these environmentally friendly' visitors, two other segments show willingness to pay above average: graduates' and forest neighbours'. The study shows how the rich set of data provided by contingent valuation studies can be used to segment visitors, and therefore to support the planning and management of recreational facilities.","[Oliveira, Fernanda] Polytech Inst Leiria, Sch Tourism & Maritime Technol, Leiria, Portugal; [Oliveira, Fernanda] Polytech Inst Leiria, Tourism Res Grp, Leiria, Portugal; [Pintassilgo, Pedro; Pinto, Patricia; Silva, Joao Albino] Univ Algarve, Fac Econ, Campus Gambelas, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal; [Pintassilgo, Pedro; Pinto, Patricia; Silva, Joao Albino] Univ Algarve, Res Ctr Spatial & Org Dynam, Campus Gambelas, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal; [Mendes, Isabel] Univ Lisbon, ISEG Sch Econ & Management, Lisbon, Portugal; [Mendes, Isabel] Univ Lisbon, CGS Res Social Sci & Management, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade do Algarve; Universidade do Algarve; Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa,"Pintassilgo, P (通讯作者)，Univ Algarve, Fac Econ, Campus Gambelas, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal.;Pintassilgo, P (通讯作者)，Univ Algarve, Res Ctr Spatial & Org Dynam, Campus Gambelas, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal.",ppintas@ualg.pt,"Pintassilgo, Pedro Miguel/H-5848-2019; Pinto, Patrícia/C-3197-2018; Mendes, Isabel/N-5497-2016","Pintassilgo, Pedro Miguel/0000-0001-9115-4301; Pinto, Patrícia/0000-0002-3153-2830; Mendes, Isabel/0000-0002-2230-1870; Oliveira, Fernanda Maria/0000-0001-6936-6770; Silva, joao/0000-0002-0860-2992","Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) [UID/SOC/04020/2013, UID/SOC/04521/2013]",Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Financial support from the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) is acknowledged, through projects UID/SOC/04020/2013 and UID/SOC/04521/2013.",,37,3,3,0,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

We focus on the directional component of the market returns because, for investment purposes, forecasting the direction of return correctly is presumably more relevant than the accuracy of point forecasts. Our findings suggest that only a small number of industries have predictive power for market returns, meaning that we find little evidence of stock markets reacting with a delay to information contained in industry returns. We also find that the binary response models outperform conventional predictive regressions in forecasting the direction of the market return. Finally, we test trading strategies and find that some of the industry portfolios do contain information that can be used to improve investment returns.","[Ponka, Harri] Univ Helsinki, Dept Polit & Econ Studies, POB 17, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Pönkä, H (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Dept Polit & Econ Studies, POB 17, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",harri.ponka@helsinki.fi,,,Yrjo Jahnsson Foundation; Foundation for the Advancement of Finnish Security Markets; Research Funds of the University of Helsinki,Yrjo Jahnsson Foundation; Foundation for the Advancement of Finnish Security Markets; Research Funds of the University of Helsinki,"The author would like to thank Heikki Kauppi, Helina Laakkonen, Markku Lanne, Matthijs Lof, Henri Nyberg, participants of FDPE Econometrics Workshops I&II 2013 (Helsinki, May and Dec 2013), the GSF and FDPE Winter Research Workshop in Finance (Turku, Nov 2013), and FindEcon' 2014 (Lodz, May 2014), the editors, and two anonymous referees for useful comments on the paper.

There is a growing interest from transport researchers, policy makers, marketing and retail businesses in understanding the implications of this change. However, existing tools and techniques developed for analysing behaviour in traditional retail environments do not adequately represent emerging complexities resulting from digital innovation. In this paper, we advance existing destination and mode choice models by incorporating online channels in a unified framework. This is a critical extension to existing transport literature on destination choice which largely ignores online activity. Specifically, we develop discrete choice models using elemental store (including both online and in-store) alternatives for joint choice of channel, store, and travel mode. We demonstrate the use of a widely-accepted consumer panel dataset with minor modifications, for the first time in transport research, together with API based data mining tools that offer great potential for enrichment. The analysis focuses on grocery shopping and uses consumer data collected from two selected boroughs in London; results from multinomial logit and nested logit estimations are reported. The extension presented here provides the tools to quantify the effects of increased online shopping on traditional store formats and travel patterns. Our results showed virtual alternatives currently offer an attractive substitute among early adopters for large basket shopping mostly for high income groups. This might suggest a significant reduction in shopping trips to hypermarkets often associated with large basket shopping potentially leading to store closures. Online deliveries mostly draw from driving trips and less so from walking and public transport trips. The present study also confirmed previous findings related to smaller stores and longer travel distances being associated with declining utilities, agglomeration and competition significantly influencing store choice.

Classic approaches to this problem usually require 'event-wise independence': the collective probability for each event should depend only on the individuals' probabilities for that event. In practice, however, some events may be 'basic' and others 'derivative', so that it makes sense first to aggregate the probabilities for the former and then to let these constrain the probabilities for the latter.

We find temporary occupations of land were rare and not correlated with either organized reaction to land reform or the existence of a large pool of beneficiaries. Potential beneficiaries of reform struck more often in the period of land reform deployment, especially in towns with a legacy of domination by a noble family and no previous experience of reform. There is some evidence that actual land reform implementation reduced strikes, most prominently in towns that had not been affected by land reform until the 1930s. We argue both sets of evidence suggest that faster re-distribution would have reduced conflict and that the effects of incomplete land reform were stronger in towns with no previous history of land reform.","[Domenech, Jordi] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Social Sci, Getafe, Madrid, Spain; [Domenech, Jordi] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Inst Figuerola Hist & Ciencias Sociales, Getafe, Madrid, Spain; [Herreros, Francisco] CSIC, Inst Polit & Bienes Publ, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Politicas y Bienes Publicos (IPP),"Domenech, J (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Social Sci, Calle Madrid 126, Getafe Madrid 28903, Spain.",jdomenec@clio.uc3m.es,"Domenech, Jordi/L-1581-2014; Herreros, Francisco/I-5482-2014","Domenech, Jordi/0000-0001-7937-9444;","Fundacion Ramon Areces; Spain's Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [CSO2015-65969-P, ECO2015-66196-P]",Fundacion Ramon Areces; Spain's Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government),"The authors would like to express their gratitude to Hans-Joachim Voth and two anonymous referees for really helpful and constructive suggestions, critiques, and ideas, as well as to seminar audiences at Universidad Publica de Navarra, the conference Markets and States organized at the University of Warwick and the Economic History Seminar at the London School of Economics.

Previous research found that public prices were lower in a sample of large, urban markets. Based on new data covering over 15,000 markets and nearly all electricity generated for residential consumption, we find that the difference between public and private prices was small in 1935 and negligible in 1940 for typical levels of monthly consumption. These findings are consistent with a market for ownership that helped to discipline electricity prices during this period. That is, private rents were mitigated by the threat that municipalities would use public ownership to respond to constituent complaints and public rents were limited by electoral competition and the growth of private provision.","[Kitchens, Carl T.] Florida State Univ, Dept Econ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Jaworski, Taylor] Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON, Canada",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; Queens University - Canada,"Jaworski, T (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON, Canada.",ckitchens@fsu.edu; tjaworski@gmail.com,,,,,,,43,4,6,0,1,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0014-4983,1090-2457,,EXPLOR ECON HIST,Explor.

Relying on changes in the critical bandwidth for unimodality, the indicator is a dynamic extension of concepts from often-used multimodality tests. Its evolution suggests the new empirical result of a millennium peak' in club convergence in the worldwide GDP per capita distribution. The club convergence movements of the 1980s and 1990s, when groups of poor and rich countries converged to two separate points, was followed by a de-clubbing movement after the turn of the millennium.

We provide a very general upper bound result for domain restrictions that can be defined by certain forbidden configurations. This upper bound implies that many domain restrictions (including the single-peaked restriction) are very unlikely to appear in a random election chosen according to the Impartial Culture assumption. For single-peaked elections, this upper bound can be refined and complemented by a lower bound that is asymptotically tight. In addition, we provide exact results for elections with few voters or candidates. Moreover, we consider the Plya urn model and the Mallows model and obtain lower bounds showing that single-peakedness is considerably more likely to appear for certain parameterizations.","[Lackner, Marie-Louise] TU Wien, Inst Discrete Math & Geometry, Vienna, Austria; [Lackner, Martin] Univ Oxford, Dept Comp Sci, Oxford, England",Technische Universitat Wien; University of Oxford,"Lackner, ML (通讯作者)，TU Wien, Inst Discrete Math & Geometry, Vienna, Austria.",marie-louise.lackner@tuwien.ac.at; martin.lackner@cs.ox.ac.uk,,"Lackner, Martin/0000-0003-2170-0770","Austrian Science Foundation FWF [P25337-N23]; FWF [P25518-N23, Y698]; European Research Council (ERC) [639945]",Austrian Science Foundation FWF(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); FWF(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"The first author was supported by the Austrian Science Foundation FWF, Grant P25337-N23, the second author by the FWF, Grant P25518-N23 and Y698 and by the European Research Council (ERC) under Grant Number 639945 (ACCORD).",,59,21,23,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,APR,2017,48.0,4,,,,,717,745,,10.1007/s00355-017-1033-0,0.0,,,29,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,ES8TQ,28479646.0,"Green Published, Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000399830200003,0

We first confirm that in the absence of time lags, the monotone convergence to the unique equilibrium is observed. Next, we demonstrate that, in the Keynesian IS-LM system, in the existence of the investment decision lag and the gestation lag, oscillatory fluctuations are generated around the equilibrium if the gestation lag is relatively long, while in the existence of the consumption lag and the gestation lag, oscillatory behaviors may not occur. We then conclude that the existence of time lags may be one of the major causes of oscillatory fluctuations.","[Murakami, Hiroki] Japan Soc Promot Sci, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Murakami, Hiroki] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Econ, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; University of Tokyo,"Murakami, H (通讯作者)，Japan Soc Promot Sci, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.;Murakami, H (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Econ, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",leafedclover@gmail.com,,"Murakami, Hiroki/0000-0002-3074-9528",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [14J03350]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [14J03350] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The author would like to thank Hideyuki Adachi, Kosuke Aoki, Toichiro Asada, Cars Hommes, Akio Matsumoto, Takeshi Nakatani, Yasutaka Niisato, Kenshiro Ninomiya, Takashi Ohno, Hiroshi Osaka, Masahiro Ouchi, Neri Salvadori, Hiroaki Sasaki, Peter Skott, Kazuo Ueda, Hiroyuki Yoshida, Hiroshi Yoshikawa (alphabetical order) and the anonymous referee for their valuable comments on an earlier version of this paper.

However, the fast development of China's high-speed rail (HSR) is challenging the airline industry's growth. Using quarterly route level panel data of air passenger demand from 2010 to 2013, this paper analyzes the effects of HSR on China's Big Three airlines. We find that the entry of HSR has a strong negative impact on the air transport demand, and the air demand becomes much more elastic after the introduction of parallel HSR service. Moreover, we find that while the impact of HSR on airlines is severe in thin markets, it is insignificant in thick markets. We also find that the price difference between airfare and HSR fare plays an important role when passengers choose between HSR and air transport. In terms of service levels, HSR travel time has much stronger effect on the air transport demand than HSR service frequency. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Agents overwhelmingly recommend unsuitable, strictly dominated products that provide high commissions to the agent. Agents cater to the beliefs of uninformed consumers, even when those beliefs are wrong. We also find that agents appear to focus on maximizing the amount of premiums (and therefore their commissions) that customers pay, as opposed to focusing on how much insurance coverage customers need. A natural experiment requiring disclosure of commissions for a specific product results in agents recommending alternative products with high commissions but no disclosure requirement. A follow-up agent survey sheds light on the extent to which poor advice reflects both the commission incentives and agents' limited product knowledge.","[Anagol, Santosh] Wharton, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Cole, Shawn] Harvard Sch Business, Boston, MA USA; [Cole, Shawn] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Sarkar, Shayak] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University,"Anagol, S (通讯作者)，Wharton, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",,,,Harvard Lab for Economic and Policy Applications; Division for Faculty Development and Research at Harvard Business School; Wharton Global Initiatives; Wharton Dean's Research Fund; Wharton Risk Management and Decision Processes Center; Penn Lauder CIBER Fund,Harvard Lab for Economic and Policy Applications; Division for Faculty Development and Research at Harvard Business School; Wharton Global Initiatives; Wharton Dean's Research Fund; Wharton Risk Management and Decision Processes Center; Penn Lauder CIBER Fund,"iTrust provided valuable context on the Indian insurance market for this project.

We find that the psychometric test can lower the risk of the loan portfolio when used as a secondary screening mechanism for already banked entrepreneurs-that is, those with a credit history.

Rather than focusing on welfare regime typology or shares of transfers in total income as most studies do, we partition total transfer income into separate transfer components and account for countries heterogeneity in their provision. The results show that an increase in the amount of unemployment transfers received by individuals is associated with higher probabilities of exiting poverty when these transfers are combined with well-developed active labor market policies. Old-age transfers become an important instrument for the reduction in time spent below the poverty line if they are generous in size and not progressively distributed along the total income distribution. Finally, an increase in the amount of family benefits received is associated with lower probabilities of poverty entry in the countries which spend larger shares of gross domestic product on child care facilities.","[Kyzyma, Iryna] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Res Grp Int Distribut & Redistribut, L 7 1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany; [Kyzyma, Iryna; Williams, Donald R.] Maison Sci Humaines, Luxembourg Inst Socioecon Res, 11 Porte Sci, L-4366 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg; [Kyzyma, Iryna] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Williams, Donald R.] Kent State Univ, Dept Econ, Kent, OH 44242 USA",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); IZA Institute Labor Economics; University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Kent; Kent State University Salem,"Kyzyma, I (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Res Grp Int Distribut & Redistribut, L 7 1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany.;Kyzyma, I (通讯作者)，Maison Sci Humaines, Luxembourg Inst Socioecon Res, 11 Porte Sci, L-4366 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg.;Kyzyma, I (通讯作者)，Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany.",kyzyma@zew.de; dwilliam@kent.edu,"Williams, Donald R./AAA-8466-2019","Williams, Donald/0000-0002-1071-9284",Luxembourg Institute of Socio-Economic Research (LISER); Fonds national de la Recherche in Luxembourg (AFR PhD Grant) [2011-1],Luxembourg Institute of Socio-Economic Research (LISER); Fonds national de la Recherche in Luxembourg (AFR PhD Grant)(Luxembourg National Research Fund),"We are indebted to Luxembourg Institute of Socio-Economic Research (LISER, formerly CEPS/INSTEAD) for providing support of this research.

Discovered at several occasions independently, the RCVS is arguably the natural extension of the Condorcet method to cases where a deterministic Condorcet winner does not exists. Indeed, it selects the always-existing and essentially unique Condorcet winner of lotteries over alternatives. Our main result is that, in a certain class of voting systems based on pairwise comparisons of alternatives, the RCVS is the only one to be Condorcet-proof. By Condorcet-proof, we mean that, when a Condorcet winner exists, it must be selected and no voter has incentives to misreport his preferences. We also prove two theorems about group-strategy-proofness. On one hand, we prove that there is no group-strategy-proof voting system that always selects existing Condorcet winners. On the other hand, we prove that, when preferences have a one-dimensional structure, the RCVS is group-strategy-proof.","[Le Nguyen Hoang] MIT, EECS, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Hoang, LN (通讯作者)，MIT, EECS, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",lenhoang@mit.edu,,,,,,,44,6,6,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,MAR,2017,48.0,3,,,,,679,701,,10.1007/s00355-017-1031-2,0.0,,,23,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,EQ4ZE,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000398089400009,0

Using the newly available, individual-level microdata for Turkey in 2004 and 2008, we find out that union membership does have a positive wage differential and this differential is higher at lower quantiles. Furthermore, it seems that the unions systematically reduce the variance of wages for the relevant period, though the magnitudes of the effects are smaller when we control for the work force characteristics.","[San, Sayin] Sakarya Univ, Adapazari, Turkey",Sakarya University,"San, S (通讯作者)，Sakarya Univ, Adapazari, Turkey.",enyilmaz@yildiz.edu.tr; saimsan@yahoo.com,"San, Sayın/AAG-6787-2019","San, Sayın/0000-0003-2679-071X",,,,,38,1,1,0,9,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

In this paper, we offer a comprehensive investigation on the relative efficiency and effectiveness of various crackdown policies using a lab-in-the-field experiment with real passengers of a public transport service. We introduce a novel game, the daily public transportation game, where subjects have to decide, over many periods, whether to buy or not a ticket knowing that there might be a control. Our results show that (a) concentrated crackdowns are less effective and efficient than random controls; (b) prolonged crackdowns reduce fare-dodging during the period of intense monitoring but induce a burst of fraud as soon as they are withdrawn; (c) pre-announced controls induce more fraud in the periods without control. Overall, we also observe that real fare-dodgers fraud more in the experiment than non-fare-dodgers.","[Dai, Zhixin] Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Dai, Zhixin; Galeotti, Fabio; Villeval, Marie Claire] Univ Lyon, CNRS, GATE, F-69130 Lyon, France; [Villeval, Marie Claire] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Villeval, Marie Claire] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Publ Finance, Innsbruck, Austria",Renmin University of China; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Innsbruck,"Dai, ZX (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.;Dai, ZX (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon, CNRS, GATE, F-69130 Lyon, France.",dzxruc@ruc.edu.cn,"Villeval, Marie Claire/H-7773-2017; Galeotti, Fabio/G-8535-2017","Villeval, Marie Claire/0000-0001-8578-5449; Galeotti, Fabio/0000-0003-0221-5470","ASFEE; Keolis, a grant of the French National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-14-CE28-0010-01]; European Commission (Marie Sklodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship) [661645-IDEA-MSCA-IF-EF-ST]; Universite de Lyon [ANR-11-LABX-0042, ANR-11-IDEX-007]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-14-CE28-0010] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)","ASFEE; Keolis, a grant of the French National Research Agency (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); European Commission (Marie Sklodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship); Universite de Lyon; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR))","We are extremely grateful to P.

Using panel data methodology and considering a sample of 43 Portuguese hotels, the authors study the capital structure determinants between 2004 and 2013. The study examines the indebtedness level in light of the two main theories - the Trade-off theory and the Pecking Order theory. The hospitality sector was chosen because of its importance in the Portuguese economy and because this particular sector has hardly been studied. In addition to total indebtedness, the authors extend the literature by analysing the differences between short-term and long-term indebtedness. The results obtained suggest that profitability, assets tangibility, firm dimension, total liquidity and risk are key factors affecting the capital structure of hospitality sector SMEs, while growth, other tax benefits and age were not deemed relevant. These results allow us to conclude that Trade-off and Pecking Order theories should not be considered in isolation to explain the capital structure of hospitality sector SMEs.","[Pacheco, Luis; Tavares, Fernando] Portucalense Univ, Oporto, Portugal",Universidade Portucalense Infante D.

Moreover, the share of their assets in the GDP is increasing against a readjustment and some tightening in the traditional banking sector. There is strong evidence that this sector has grown in size and complexity in the last decade, either due to migration of some banking activities into the 'shadows' or the establishment of new non-bank operations (fostered by a low interest rate macroeconomic environment). Romania is not an exception from the EU and the global trend although, in its case, as the paper highlights, the shadow banking sector is small and simple.

Such method of aggregation implicitly assumes that components of a monetary aggregate are perfect substitutes. Although all monetary assets could relatively easily, and at low cost, be converted into currency, there are significant differences in the opportunity cost of their holding. Empirical research suggests that economic agents often hold in their portfolios different monetary assets, with different opportunity costs, not only assets with the lowest opportunity costs. This suggests that economic agents do not see monetary assets as perfect substitutes. Therefore, a valid method of aggregation of monetary assets must preserve information on the elasticity of substitution. Weighted monetary aggregates have strong foundations in the aggregation theory and they are consistent with assumptions of microeconomic optimization. The best known weighted monetary aggregates based on index numbers are Divisia index and Currency equivalent (CE) index. The aim of this paper is to calculate Divisia and CE index for Croatia, and to investigate if Croatian weighted monetary aggregates contain additional information on price and real economic activity movements, and make them, for this reason. better monetary aggregates than simple-sum aggregates. for use in economic analysis and monetary policy making.","[Belullo, Alen; Ivancic, Moris] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkov, Pula, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Belullo, A (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkov, Pula, Croatia.",abelul@unipu.hr,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

The principle of decentralisation guarantees the effective performance of public tasks, which means that various legal entities which are independent of government administration authorities become involved in the exercise of administration activitie(2). The constitutional regulations do not specify the level of decentralisation, leaving a significant degree of flexibility to the ordinary legislator(3). Within the Polish system, a significant role among entities exercising decentralised administration is played by local government units which, pursuant to Article 16(2) of the Constitution, participate in the exercise of public power by performing 'a substantial part of public tasks'. The legislator has equipped local government with a general competence clause by stating in Article 163 of the Constitution that local government shall perform public tasks that are not reserved under the Constitution or statutory laws to the bodies of other public authorities. Therefore, local government units should be recognised as the most important entities of decentralised administration, but they are not the only ones. After almost 20 years for which the Constitution has been in force, the legislator has satisfied the subsidiarity principle by providing legal grounds for establishing entities that carry out public tasks within specific metropolitan areas. The subject of this paper is a detailed analysis of legal regulations concerning metropolitan areas in Poland, which takes into account the legal construct and scope of functioning of metropolitan unions.","[Borowka, Katarzyna; Szlachetko, Jakub] Univ Gdansk, Fac Law & Adm, Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; University of Gdansk,"Borowka, K (通讯作者)，Univ Gdansk, Fac Law & Adm, Gdansk, Poland.",k.borowka@prawo.ug.edu.pl; jakub.szlachetko@gmail.com,,"Szlachetko, Katarzyna/0000-0003-4667-3756; Szlachetko, Jakub/0000-0002-4152-5394",,,,,9,1,1,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,20,27,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8CX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427987300003,0

In 1941, Ingvar Svennilson, a member of the so-called Stockholm school of economists, became the head of the Industrial Institute of Economic and Social Research, founded by Swedish industry. During the following years he wrote extensively on the issue of economic planning. Although this issue was ideologically explosive, he managed to strike a balance which earned him respect in most camps. His focus gradually shifted from central planning during the war, toward framework planning and indicative planning after the war, when he designed the first Swedish long-term survey.","[Carlson, Benny] Lund Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Econ Hist, Lund, Sweden; [Lundahl, Mats] Stockholm Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Lundahl, Mats] Stockholm Univ, Inst Latin Amer Studies, Stockholm, Sweden",Lund University; Stockholm School of Economics; Stockholm University,"Carlson, B (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Econ Hist, Lund, Sweden.;Lundahl, M (通讯作者)，Stockholm Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Stockholm, Sweden.;Lundahl, M (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Inst Latin Amer Studies, Stockholm, Sweden.",benny.carlson@ekh.lu.se; mats.lundahl@hhs.se,,,Daniel Klein foundation; Tom Hedelius foundation; Tore Browaldh foundation,Daniel Klein foundation; Tom Hedelius foundation; Tore Browaldh foundation,"This article is partly based upon the chapters on Svennilson in a volume on the Industrial Institute for Economic and Social Research (Industriens Utredningsinstitut) from its foundation up to 1950 (Carlson and Lundahl 2014).

This paper aims to empirically investigate how well the GM system works from an industrial competition perspective, which will indirectly indicate whether carriers are able to manipulate spot rates following GM announcements. Taking the Far East-North Europe trade between 2009 and 2013 as an example, the paper first reveals the gradual increase of GRI frequency and size, which reflects carriers' attempts to restore profitability against overcapacity. However, out of all the GM events only 28.6% were observed to be successful. Since these GRI successes must be the results of either price collusion (if any) and/or normal rate change by carriers in response to fundamental market developments, the effective collusion, if it exists, is actually lower than 28.6%. Next, we identify eight factors influencing GM successes. To further assess their impact, we applied an ordered logit regression analysis, which, based on four of the factors involved, yields good predictability for GRI success. The four factors, in sequence of explanation power, are the total capacity of GM carriers, the idling fleet size, the spot rate level, and the average ship-loading factor. Clearly the latter three factors are market fundamentals, which are unlikely to be influenced by an individual carrier in the short term. In actual fact, the conclusion reached is that there is little evidence that carriers can manipulate and distort spot rates through GRIs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The well-known classifications were not constructed with the use of formal statistical tools except for the classification developed by Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenegger (2005). Following their approach, this paper employs several techniques of cluster analysis but with certain important differences including the separate treatment of financially open and financially closed economies. To classify the former group, the trimmed k means method is used, whereas the latter group is classified with the k-nearest neighbour method. Moreover, foreign exchange reserves and exchange rate are treated symmetrically, standardization of main variables captures changes in the international context, and the classification is a two-way classification and is more up-to-date. The comparison of our classification with three most common classifications reveals that there are differences between them stemming from the differences in methodology and period coverage. The simple measure of overall consistency for the most similar classification is well below 80% but above 60% for the least similar classification.","[Dabrowski, Marek A.] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Macroecon, Ul Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland; [Papiez, Monika; Smiech, Slawomir] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Stat, Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics; Cracow University of Economics,"Dabrowski, MA (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Macroecon, Ul Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",marek.dabrowski@uek.krakow.pl; papiezm@uek.krakow.pl; smiechs@uek.krakow.pl,"Śmiech, Sławomir/I-3253-2018; Dąbrowski, Marek A./V-2257-2018; Papież, Monika/I-3257-2018","Papież, Monika/0000-0003-3597-2080; Dabrowski, Marek A./0000-0003-3079-1811",National Science Centre in Poland [DEC-2015/17/B/HS4/02681],"National Science Centre in Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)",The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the National Science Centre in Poland (grant no.

The subsequent varying transmission of shocks into prices questions the convenience of the dominant position of the Czech currency for all regions. Instead, community currencies respect regional heterogeneity as well as endorse social values national currency is weak of targeting. Individuals, companies but also municipalities in other countries seem to realize these benefits of community currencies. Over four-thousands of community currencies operate worldwide. Spain belongs among one of the most recent member of such local-currency movement. High unemployment rate in Spain has motivated local activists to launch several time-banking schemes. These schemes multiplied into more than four hundred. Greece copied such effort to provide unemployed and impoverished individuals with additional means of exchange along with independence on scarce euro currency. Local currencies could help Czech Republic to respect regional discrepancies and allow local communities to be more flexible to transmission shocks and varying economic conditions. This study analyzes the benefits of such potential scenario with local currencies in the Czech Economy. The applied method represents an enhancement of the DSGE model as designed by the Ministry of Finance in the Czech Republic for local-currency variables.

First, our paper is the first to employ methods to correct for sample selection bias, using both switching regression and propensity score matching of cash vs. non-cash transactions. We use selection models to produce price counterfactuals for cash and noncash buyers. We also include both average treatment effect and a propensity score weighted selection models. From the selection models, we find that previous studies likely overstate the cash discount. Results from counterfactual tests examining cash discounts suggest amplified cash discounts in areas with close proximity to an environmental hazard; and also a pricing differential based on CBG level income, with purchasers in high income areas more likely to pay a cash premium compared to market participants in areas with comparably lower income, where a cash discount is detected. These results provide useful insights for market participants including real estate appraisers, brokers, and buyers and sellers of real estate.","[Jauregui, Andres; Tidwell, Alan] Columbus State Univ, Turner Coll Business, Dept Accounting & Finance, 4225 Univ Ave, Columbus, GA 31907 USA; [Hite, Diane] Auburn Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Coll Agr, 209B Comer Hall, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",University System of Georgia; Columbus State University; Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Hite, D (通讯作者)，Auburn Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Coll Agr, 209B Comer Hall, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",jauregui_andres@columbusstate.edu; atidwell@columbusstate.edu; hitedia@auburn.edu,,,,,,,32,14,14,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

This paper focuses upon the strategic political mobilisation of financial actors in order to provide a better understanding of their influence within regulatory battles in the post crisis era. It does so through a case study investigation of the European Union Financial Transaction Tax. Despite garnering support from leading member states, the European Commission and Parliament, and a majority of the European population, the policy has failed to materialise as a result of several postponements and unresolved negotiations at the Council of the European Union. Policy-makers have also gradually backed away from the aggressive proposal designed by the Commission, committing to a range of exemptions that threaten to render the policy ineffective at raising significant revenue and at preventing industry avoidance of the charge. The case provides evidence of a cohesive political strategy conducted primarily by transnational financial associations and demonstrates the unique capacity of financial actors to secure favourable regulatory outcomes. Specifically, this influence is exercised through the recruitment of non-financial sector allies and by exploiting the structural dependency fears of policy-makers.","[Kalaitzake, Manolis] Univ Coll Dublin, Equal Studies Ctr, Room L535, Dublin 4, Ireland",University College Dublin,"Kalaitzake, M (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Equal Studies Ctr, Room L535, Dublin 4, Ireland.",manolis.kalaitzake@ucd.ie,,"Kalaitzake, Manolis/0000-0002-3616-2373",UCD College of Human Sciences Research Fund,UCD College of Human Sciences Research Fund,"The author wishes to acknowledge the financial support from the UCD College of Human Sciences Research Fund, which assisted in promoting this research.",,87,19,19,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The authors determined the following main problems in the sphere of development of transport infrastructure in modern Russia: main attention is paid to the development of only material and technical infrastructure, with determination of general directions only-interested parties are not involved, with participation of just the state and investors. As a result of the research, the authors come to the conclusion that one of the main reasons for ineffectiveness of efforts in the sphere of development of domestic transport system is their fragmentarity, caused by lack of orientation at transport humanization. Perspectives of increase of projects' effectiveness in the sphere of development of transport infrastructure and increase of international competitiveness of Russian transport system are viewed.

Payment flows into a country push the real exchange rate up, payment outflows push it down. This article uses a model of optimal consumption and portfolio choice to determine the factors that drive international payment flows during boom-and-bust cycles. It shows that during such episodes, capital inflows first exceed the deficit on current account, strengthening the currency. Later on, when the return on domestic capital reverts to its normal level, the current account recovers, yet the overall decline of the net foreign asset position provokes a fall of the real exchange rate even below its initial level.

Successful brokers can maximize their profits by buying energy at low prices in the wholesale market and selling them at high prices to the consumers. However, this requires that the brokers have accurate predictions of the energy consumption of consumers so that they do not end up having excess energy or insufficient energy in the marketplace. In this paper, we conduct a preliminary investigation that uses standard off-the-shelf machine learning techniques to cluster and predict the consumption of a restricted set of consumers. Our results show that a combination of the popular k-means, k-medoids, and DBSCAN clustering algorithm together with an autoregressive lag model can predict, reasonably accurately, the consumption of consumers.","[Natividad, Francisco; Folk, Russell Y.; Yeoh, William; Cao, Huiping] New Mexico State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA",New Mexico State University,"Yeoh, W (通讯作者)，New Mexico State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA.",fnativid@cs.nmsu.edu; rfolk@cs.nmsu.edu; wyeoh@cs.nmsu.edu; hcao@cs.nmsu.edu,"Yeoh, William/ABD-6399-2020; Cao, Huiping/M-2596-2018","Yeoh, William/0000-0002-2964-4518; Yeoh, William/0000-0002-2617-870X","NSF [1345232, 1337884]; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division Of Computer and Network Systems [1337884] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division Of Computer and Network Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),"This research is partially supported by NSF grants 1345232 and 1337884.

We argue that the mission with time became a key diplomatic instrument and enabled EU power projection by giving momentum to the promotion of the EU's approach towards Ukraine, which was already wavering due to the deadlock over the Association Agreement between Kyiv and Brussels and then due to President Yanukovych's refusal to sign the agreement.","[Nitoiu, Cristian] London Sch Econ, LSE IDEAS, London, England; [Sus, Monika] Hertie Sch Governance, Friedrichstr 180, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Hertie School,"Sus, M (通讯作者)，Hertie Sch Governance, Friedrichstr 180, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",sus@hertie-school.org,"Nitoiu, Cristian/GZH-0964-2022; Sus, Monika/AAQ-3157-2020","Nitoiu, Cristian/0000-0001-7260-7248; Sus, Monika/0000-0002-5916-3555",National Research Council [DEC-2013/09/B/HS5/01356]; Dahrendorf Forum; HertieSchool of Governance; LSE; Stiftung Mercator,National Research Council; Dahrendorf Forum; HertieSchool of Governance; LSE; Stiftung Mercator,"The authors would like to thank the anonymous referees for their comments and wish to acknowledge the financial support of the National Research Council for this publication (along the project decision: DEC-2013/09/B/HS5/01356).

The impact of the corporate governance mechanisms on social responsibility is a research area with increasing importance. Although there is evidence of a link between ownership structure, as a corporate governance mechanism, and CSR, there is not much knowledge about the impact of foreign ownership, as ownership type, on corporate social responsibility. The aim of this paper is to find out whether there are differences in the level of CSR in companies with a different share of foreign ownership, in the Republic of Serbia. For that purpose, we used the results of a survey conducted by the authors in 2016 on a sample of 24 corporations in Serbia. The analysis included five areas of social responsibility, namely: internal CSR, responsibility to customers, community responsibility, environmental protection and CSR disclosure. The empirical results confirm that there is higher level of CSR in companies with majority foreign ownership, which reaffirms the assumption of greater transparency of the operations of foreign corporations. However, we did not find statistically significant differences in other CSR areas.

According to this literature, wage setting institutions mediated how the ECB's monetary policy re-distributed resources between the traded and non-traded sectors in these varieties of capitalism. By examining three separate transmission channels of the ECB's monetary policies (wage and price setting in labor and product markets; nominal exchange rate of the euro; funding costs and bank credit), this paper goes beyond the traditional emphasis on wage setting institutions and draws attention to those institutions that underpin the non-price competitiveness of traded sectors. Overall, the paper explains how the institutional infrastructure of the CMEs bolstered the adaptability of their traded sectors to the ECB's single monetary policy and its three transmission mechanisms - both during the pre-crisis era of widening imbalances and the period of asymmetrical trade rebalancing since the outbreak of the euro crisis.","[Vermeiren, Mattias] Univ Ghent, Ghent Inst Int Studies, Dept Polit Sci, Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Vermeiren, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Ghent Inst Int Studies, Dept Polit Sci, Ghent, Belgium.",Mattias.Vermeiren@UGent.be,,,,,,,74,12,13,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Apart from differences in liquidity, transaction costs, and management skills, the DRE market is also less complete than the IRE marketwhen negative shocks arrive, one can only short IRE (e.g., real estate stocks or REITs), but not DRE. This study investigates if short sales in the IRE market convey any information to the DRE market. Based on high-frequency (weekly) property price data in Hong Kong from 2000 to 2012, we find that short sales in the IRE market led DRE returns, even after controlling for the lagged IRE returns in a VAR model. This supports an information spillover mechanism in which the DRE market learns private information that is not reflected in IRE returns. The spillover effect, however, weakened after the recent global financial crisis because the increased uncertainty over the credibility of individual firms made short sales more reflective of firm-specific information than real estate market fundamentals.","[Wong, Siu Kei; Deng, Kuang Kuang] Univ Hong Kong, HKUrbanLab, Dept Real Estate & Construct, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lai, Thomas C.

To do this, we first develop a theoretical model to compute each household's welfare change under alternative pricing systems.

Based on its feature, autonomous vehicle is expected to improve traffic flow, reduce accidents, reduce social exclusion and improve the utility of time on travel. It is increasingly accepted that the next step to the evolution of human transportation is the replacement of human as the driver by the Artificial-intelligence-capable machine. Regardless, the challenges remain especially in convincing the consumers to switch to autonomous cars despite the apparent benefits. In the past, papers highlighted individual trust toward machine as the key point to encourage acceptance of autonomous cars. This paper seeks to highlight the ethical implications of the autonomous technology and how it is related to the user acceptance of the technology. This paper reviewed recent studies on the ethical implications of the autonomous vehicle and the user acceptance of the technology. A systematic review of papers from the literature was done using Scopus, ISI and Web of Science. The results of the review have shown that the level of trust, which may vary on the sociodemographic profile of the users, has been studied as one of the factors for user acceptance. Many researchers also highlight ethical implication as an important aspect of autonomous technology that needs to be tended to. The researcher proposes that ethical implication can be an important element of user trust toward autonomous technology. Hence, there is a need to embed ethical implication as a construct for user trust leading to user acceptance model in future studies. In the line of this research review researcher was addressed the following comprehensive groups: examination of autonomous vehicle topographies and flexibility prototypes, consequences for street traffic and connectivity to substructure (specifically in the urban areas with the medium and low density), communal attitudes and apprehensions, transportable behaviour and plea, possible business models, and strategy implications.

The literature that addresses this topic is quite limited because of the difficulty of separating market-oriented R&D expenditure from knowledge-sourcing R&D expenditure in the data. We argue that determining the relationship between local sales and R&D expenditure is a better way to identify whether MNEs are investing market-oriented R&D than is separating the two types of R&D. For connecting firm-specific characteristics, local-market sales, and R&D expenditure together, we adapt two-stage regressions. By employing data from Taiwanese multinationals from 2003 to 2006, we found that if an MNE moves its technology toward capital-intensive products, it increases its R&D expenditure to promote its sales in the local markets in the host country.","[Hsu, Kuang-Chung] Univ Cent Oklahoma, Edmond, OK 73034 USA; [Weng, Yungho] Natl Chengchi Univ, Taipei, Taiwan",University of Central Oklahoma; National Chengchi University,"Hsu, KC (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Oklahoma, Edmond, OK 73034 USA.",khsu1@uco.edu,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,6,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Among them, vehicle restriction is considered the most straightforward way to reduce travel demands. The effects of this policy, however, are still inconclusive. Using the massive license plate recognition (LPR) data in Langfang, China, this study investigates the differences of two typical license-plate-number-based vehicle restriction strategies, i.e., One-Day-Per-Week (ODPW) and Odd-And-Even (OAE). This study compares ODPW and OAE from two perspectives: travel demand and traffic condition over the road network. In addition to the change of traffic volume, the analysis of travel demand also includes the investigations of illegal travel, which denotes the road use of restricted vehicles, and travel intensity, which represents the travel frequency of certain vehicles in a time period. The changes of traffic condition are assessed by travel speed. Findings confirm that traffic volume declines as ODPW shifts to OAE, but not as significantly as expected. This less-than-full adjustment can be explained by the increase of illegal travel and travel intensity. The policy shift from ODPW to OAE significantly improves the travel speed in most of the road segments, whether in peak hours or off-peak hours. The conclusions in this study provide in-depth insights into the influence of vehicle restriction policies and contribute to the effective design of travel demand management strategies.","[Liu, Zhiyong; Li, Ruimin; Shang, Pan] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaokun (Cara)] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Troy, NY USA",Tsinghua University; Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,"Li, RM (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Room 304,Heshanheng Bldg, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",lrmin@tsinghua.edu.cn,"Li, Ruimin/JVE-0540-2024; WANG, XIAOKUN/GQR-1904-2022; Li, Ruimin/AAZ-3891-2021","Li, Ruimin/0000-0002-3405-1143; Shang, Pan/0000-0003-1715-456X; Wang, Xiaokun/0000-0001-5819-0212",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71361130015]; Bureau of Traffic Management of Langfang,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Bureau of Traffic Management of Langfang,This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71361130015).

In particular, we deal with the case where the main and reliever airports are connected by high-speed rail (HSR), and we discuss a desirable and effective support policy for regaining passenger flow from/to the affected area. First, we analyze the market behavior under the usual condition as the base case by adopting the bi-level model, which is a supply-demand interaction model. Second, under the supposition of a catastrophe, we set up some scenarios of management policies, i.e. (i) no special policy and (ii) providing support to HSR passengers to induce them to the reliever gateways. Through such scenario analyses, we show that (i) HSR fare restriction is required to regain sufficient passenger flow and (ii) providing fare support to HSR passengers is an effective way to regain passenger flow using reliever gateways, which can contribute toward building a robust air transport network.","[Takebayashi, Mikio] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Maritime Sci, 5-1-1 Fukae Minami, Kobe, Hyogo 6580022, Japan; [Onishi, Masamitsu] Kyoto Univ, Disaster Prevent Res Inst, Uji, Kyoto 6110011, Japan",Kobe University; Kyoto University,"Takebayashi, M (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Maritime Sci, 5-1-1 Fukae Minami, Kobe, Hyogo 6580022, Japan.",takebaya@kobe-u.ac.jp; onishi.masamitsu.7e@kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Onishi, Masamitsu/GRY-0931-2022",,JSPS KAKENHI [15H04058]; Kobe University's special project grant (Future City Project); Waterfront Vitalization and Environment Research Foundation (WAVE); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H04058] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Kobe University's special project grant (Future City Project); Waterfront Vitalization and Environment Research Foundation (WAVE); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This research was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 15H04058.

Analysis based on cash-futures pairs reveals that cointegration holds for 52 cash markets and failures tend to happen farther away from futures delivery locations. Cash generally are as important as futures prices as information sources in the long run and cash to futures information flow is most likely in the short run. Contributions to price discovery also are measured quantitatively for cointegrated cases. Analysis based on state-level cash prices indicates bidirectional information flow between cash and futures prices under a bivariate model, and futures to cash information flow under the octavariate model with all cash and the futures series. Comparisons of the two models show that including local cash markets in a price relationship model highlights cointegration and the futures' price discovery role and could benefit cash price forecasting.

It has helped both to illuminate the extraordinary capacity, reach, and impact of the modern state vis-a-vis its pre-industrial predecessor, and to cast light on why some modern states appear more able than others to execute their decisions and pursue their ambitions. Although sometimes mischaracterized as a 'weak' state, the capacity of the state centered on Washington to penetrate social space and implement its decisions, both at home and abroad, has long been recognized. But under what conditions might its infrastructural power diminish? Arguably, US economic power is now stronger than ever, ostensibly bolstered by being home to the world's most globalized and most profitable companies. However, while globalized production has strengthened US corporations - especially those rich in intellectual property - its contradictory consequences for the state's infrastructural power deserve close examination. This paper takes a first step in that direction by appraising the extent to which the state's domestic capacities have been weakened by Washington's internationalization of intellectual property rights. It also offers a reconceptualization of US power.","[Weiss, Linda] Univ Sydney, Govt & Int Relat, Camperdown & Darlington Campus, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Thurbon, Elizabeth] UNSW, Sch Social Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Weiss, L (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Govt & Int Relat, Camperdown & Darlington Campus, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",linda.weiss@sydney.edu.au,"Thurbon, Elizabeth/S-7997-2019",,,,,,81,12,13,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The estimated long-run income elasticity of healthcare expenditure suggests that health care is a luxury good in these states. By contrast, the short-run elasticity obtained from the regressions in first differences is in the range (0, 1) for most US states, which suggests that health care is a necessity good instead.

This paper aims to understand the attitude of relevant stakeholders towards the performance of the Traditional Sea-Land Line (TSLL) alongside the two emerging container routes under the B&R initiative. To achieve this objective, we first of all built a performance evaluation system to understand the relative performance of these trade routes. A questionnaire survey was carried out to reveal the differing views on route performance, and Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) was then used to examine and interpret the survey data. Secondly, by dividing the interviewees into two groups, we examined whether the government's development priorities are at variance with the preferences of industry practitioners. Thirdly, we explored the reasons for the variance by conducting an intensive interview with ten key stakeholders and then explain the findings from the perspective of institutional theories. Finally, we addressed the uncertainty and dynamics of route development under three different scenarios. Several managerial implications are proposed on the basis of our findings.","[Yang, Dong] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Logist & Maritime Studies, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Liping] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Operat Management, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Ng, Adolf K.

Due to their high frequency, the indices reveal that steady growth was far from universal even in the second half of the 1920s. Monetary and financial instability, agricultural crises, and labor conflict continued to plague economies around the globe. The high frequency of the data also facilitates a global comparison of the severity of the Great Depression along two dimensions: the cumulative loss and duration. The variation along these two dimensions across and within countries indicates a rising importance of the trade channel at the later stages of the crisis.

The main hypothesis is that an increase in the minimum wage has a negative effect on total factor productivity (TFP) due to the existence of labor adjustment costs. Using data from Chilean manufacturing plants for the period 1992-2005 and a difference-in-differences methodology, we find that an increase in minimum wage had a negative effect on TFP. Our estimates indicate that a real increase of about 22% in the minimum wage during the period 1998-2000 reduced TFP by 5.8% in low unskilled-intensive industries and 9.7% in high unskilled-intensive industries.

Evidence from the Firm Level,WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Africa; China; FDI; Outward Direct Investment,FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; KNOWLEDGE-CAPITAL MODEL; FDI; LOCATION,"China's increased trade with, and investment in, Africa have boosted the continent's economic growth but have also generated considerable controversy. The aggregate data on China's overseas direct investment (ODI) in African countries reveal that China's share of the stock of foreign investment is small, though growing rapidly. China's attraction to resource- rich countries is no different from Western investment. China's overall ODI is uncorrelated with a measure of rule of law, whereas Western investment favors the better governance environments. As a result, Chinese investment in strong and weak governance environments is about the same, but its share of foreign investment is higher in the weak governance states. Micro data from MOFCOM's database on registered Chinese firms investing in Africa between 1998 and 2012 provide a different perspective. Key words in project descriptions are used to code the investments into 25 sectors. This database captures the small and medium private firms investing in Africa. Contrary to common perceptions, there are few projects in natural resource sectors. Most projects are in services, with a significant number in manufacturing as well. Country-sector-level regressions based on firms' transaction-level data find that Chinese ODI, both horizontal and vertical, is profit-driven, like investment from other countries. In particular, regressions show that Chinese ODI is relatively more concentrated in skill-intensive sectors in skill-abundant countries but in capital-intensive sectors in capital-scarce countries. These patterns are mostly observed in politically unstable countries, suggesting stronger incentives to seek profits in tougher environments.","[Chen, Wenjie] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC USA; [Dollar, David] Brookings Inst, John L Thornton China Ctr, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Tang, Heiwai] Johns Hopkins Univ, Paul H Nitze Sch Adv Int Studies, Washington, DC USA",George Washington University; Brookings Institution; Johns Hopkins University,"Dollar, D (通讯作者)，Brookings Inst, John L Thornton China Ctr, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",chenw@gwu.edu; DDollar@brookings.edu; hwtang@jhu.edu,,"Chen, Wenjie/0000-0001-5030-5927",,,,,50,80,86,5,57,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

We employ new statistical methods to convert the three pertinent National Sample Survey rounds into synthetic panels, which help reveal original findings on important aspects of income mobility between 2004-5 and 2011-12. In particular, we document a strong pattern of upward mobility out of poverty, with a noticeable acceleration between 2009-10 and 2011-12. We examine some of the key household characteristics of those who have managed to escape poverty and contrast these with those who have fallen into an undesirable welfare status during these periods. We further undertake a careful investigation into the comparability of the survey rounds, prompted by the observation that fairly significant modifications had been made to survey questionnaires.

While these programs may be effective in temporarily reducing vehicle use, psychological research suggests that such externally motivated behaviors are not likely to endure once the incentive program ends. This article proposes that use of alternative travel modes might be more durable if participants become internally motivated to maintain the behaviors. The study tests the hypothesis that participants who psychologically transform their commute modes into intrinsically interesting trips are more likely to report they intend to continue using their alternative modes. In a month-long Challenge to reduce single occupant vehicle (SOV) use, participants (N = 197) were randomly assigned to three different instruction groups: cognitive elaboration, cognitive dissonance, or community-based social marketing. Data were collected at 4 different times, including a final questionnaire 2 months after the Challenge ended. For all three groups, analyses supported the hypothesis and showed that the relationship from initial commitment to final attitude was mediated by intrinsic interest, specifically, by their reports that they had made their alternative travel modes interesting/fun or productive. The results encourage additional research asking how people can find ways to make transit use more attractive than driving alone.","[de Grey, Robert G.

Interestingly, even if there are important gender issues raised by participants, they have assumed these issues as being part of their daily life, modifying their transport patterns accordingly.

We investigate a set of airline strategies regarding possible practices of slot hoarding and slot concentration through mergers aiming at erecting airport barriers to entry. We develop an econometric model of flight disruptions by allowing an integrated management of flight delays, cancellations, aircraft size, price and passengers per flight. We consider the case of the domestic airline industry in Brazil. We find evidence of the internalization of congestion externalities by dominant carriers. We also have some evidence of schedule padding, a strategic trade-off between delays and cancelations, and slot hoarding following a merger. Our results suggest that carriers intensify the internalization of congestion externalities when slot flight concentration increases.","[Miranda, Victor A. P.; Oliveira, Alessandro V.

The study utilizes a sample of 15,392 households and grounds the psychographic orientation of potential EV adopters on an extended version of the Theory of Planned Behaviour. Specifically, the study measures the impact of five latent constructs; environmental concerns, attitude, subjective norm, personal moral norm, and perceived behavioural control on the intention to adopt EVs along with socio-economic-demographic (SED) variables. The results highlight that both attitude and perceived behaviour control are the strongest factors influencing individual intention to adopt EVs. However, the multi-group invariance analysis indicates that the psychographic orientation and the SED traits of potential adopters of different EV body types are significantly different, with particular standouts in the luxury and pickup truck classes. We follow this up with an analysis of mindshare towards EVs over the seven vehicle types. Insights derived from the analysis can help define potential submarkets for EVs and accelerate their adoption.","[Mohamed, Moataz] McMaster Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada; [Higgins, Christopher D.] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Higgins, Christopher D.] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Ferguson, Mark] McMaster Univ, McMaster Inst Transportat & Logist, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Requia, Weeberb J.] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth, Boston, MA USA",McMaster University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; McMaster University; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

Despite long-term efforts to prevent engagement in mobile phone tasks, drivers continue to use their phones while driving. To develop better policy and prevention practices, gaining an understanding of the predictors and strategies utilised by drivers who use their mobile phone for distracting tasks is necessary. Visually intensive tasks are the main interest of this investigation, e.g., texting and browsing. In an online questionnaire in Queensland (Australia), of the 484 drivers who participated, a 33.5% (n = 162) of respondents reported using a mobile phone for texting and browsing while driving on a typical day. Answers from these participants were analysed for this study. Negative binomial regression was used to model the effect of the independent variables (personal characteristics, perceived crash risk, beliefs, workload management strategies, and police avoidance strategies) over the rate of texting/browsing events per hour driving. The final statistical model confirmed that drivers who reported previous collisions; who believed that the effects of doing the texting/browsing task would last after it was finished; and who reported keeping their phone low to avoid police had an increased texting/browsing incidence rate. Comparably, drivers who held a valid driving license for longer; who perceived larger crash risk regarding texting/browsing behaviour; who avoided mobile phone use in demanding driving conditions; and who used workload management strategies such as reduced speed when engaged in mobile phone use had a reduced texting/browsing incidence rate. The results provide insights into the limitations of actual enforcement control and potential opportunities for countermeasures.","[Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar] Queensland Univ Technol, Ctr Accid Res & Rd Safety Queensland, Inst Hlth & Biomed Innovat, Fac Hlth, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, Fac Sci & Engn, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar] Univ Norte, Dept Ind Engn, Div Engn, Barranquilla, Colombia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Universidad del Norte Colombia,"Oviedo-Trespalacios, O (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Ctr Accid Res & Rd Safety Queensland, Brisbane, Qld 4059, Australia.",oscar.oviedotrespalacios@qut.edu.au,"Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar/K-2462-2012; Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar/IUQ-1875-2023","Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar/0000-0001-5916-3996; Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar/0000-0001-5916-3996",,,,,60,49,52,1,30,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Evidence from China is of particular importance due to China being the world's largest emerging and transition economy. We find that the benefit of political connections is manifested in firms obtaining loans from state-controlled banks in the first instance, but that political influence diminishes over subsequent loan extensions. The performance based requirement prevents banks providing systemic favourable treatment to the connected real estate firms, especially after the Chinese banking system reform in 2006. The results provide fresh insight on the risks and benefits of political connections in the Chinese real estate market as it transitions from a centrally planned to a market based economy under on-going market oriented banking and political reforms.","[Yang, Zan; Fan, Ying] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Construct Management, Inst Real Estate Studies, Hang Lung Ctr Real Estate, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Shi, Song] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Built Environm, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Liao, Jing] Massey Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Palmerston North, New Zealand",Tsinghua University; University of Technology Sydney; Massey University,"Yang, Z (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Dept Construct Management, Inst Real Estate Studies, Hang Lung Ctr Real Estate, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zanyang@tsinghua.edu.cn; fanying13@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; Song.Shi@uts.edu.au; J.Liao@massey.ac.nz,"Shi, Song/ABE-1679-2021; Yang, Zan/G-7619-2015","Shi, Song/0000-0003-4188-5151; Liao, Jing/0000-0003-1968-5794; FAN, Ying/0000-0003-0189-9524",,,,,47,11,11,1,52,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

To perform robustness checks, we suggest other four global risk factors of momentum, leverage, bid-ask spread, and liquidity. We find a significant negative relation between stock portfolio returns and the global moments, and the cross section of stock returns reflects a significant negative price of risk for global idiosyncratic skewness (-0.13%) and idiosyncratic volatility (-1.85%) and a positive and significant price of risk for global idiosyncratic kurtosis.

The CD-test of Pesaran (2015a), the exponent alpha-test of Bailey et al. (2015), the cross-sectionally augmented panel unit root test of Pesaran et al. (2013), and the spatial stability test of Yu et al. (2012) are used to show that both global common factors and local spatial dependence are important drivers of the propagation of cigarette demand over this period and to determine the point at which the hypothesis of stationarity no longer needs to be rejected in favor of a unit root. The direct and indirect effects derived from the coefficient estimates of the model show that cigarettes were a normal good with an income elasticity of 0.4 and a price elasticity -0.4 in the long term. This price elasticity of -0.4 consists of a direct effect of -0.54 in the own region and a spillover effect to other regions of 0.15. This positive spillover effect is in line with previous spatial econometric studies which investigated cigarette demand in the U.S. states over a more recent period.","[Ciccarelli, Carlo] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Econ & Finance, Via Columbia 2, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Elhorst, J.

By using the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) data from Indiana, we find that, after controlling for observables, mainly homes owned by institutional clients are sold cheaper and faster than agent-owned homes, and the differences are mainly driven by less and moderately experienced agents. Besides information asymmetry, we also find evidence of motivation heterogeneityinstitutions themselves are very motivated to sell, and therefore are willing to sell cheaper in order to sell faster.","[Xie, Jia] Ryerson Univ, Ted Rogers Sch Management, Dept Real Estate Management, Toronto, ON, Canada",Toronto Metropolitan University,"Xie, J (通讯作者)，Ryerson Univ, Ted Rogers Sch Management, Dept Real Estate Management, Toronto, ON, Canada.",jia.xie@ryerson.ca,,,,,,,19,21,21,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,FAL,2018,46.0,3,,,,,527,558,,10.1111/1540-6229.12196,0.0,,,32,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,GQ6UG,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000441860800001,0

In this study, we explore this question by examining the effect of housing wealth on one particular consumption of high elastic, tourism expenditure, in China. By using data from China Family Panel Studies in 2010 and 2012, we find that the change in house prices has a positive and significant effect on tourism expenditure. Particularly, by controlling the income effect, we find that for every 1% increase in house prices, tourism expenditure grew by 0.4%. Moreover, we investigate the crowding out effect of mortgage payments and find that the change in the wealth of households with mortgages has a positive but not significant effect on tourism expenditure. We also note that tourism expenditure does not affect the expenditure on necessities or durable goods, but indeed crowds out expenditure on educational training and other high elastic goods.","[Zhang, Chuanyong] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Int & Publ Affairs, 1954 Huashan Rd, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Chuanyong] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, China Inst Urban Governance, 1954 Huashan Rd, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Feng, Guoliang] China Investment Corp, Beijing, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Zhang, CY (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Int & Publ Affairs, 1954 Huashan Rd, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China.;Zhang, CY (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, China Inst Urban Governance, 1954 Huashan Rd, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China.",zcy021@gmail.com,,"Zhang, Chuanyong/0000-0001-6522-7378","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71774057, 71403059]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2017ECNU-HWFW031]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This paper supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (71774057,71403059) and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2017ECNU-HWFW031).",,39,12,12,9,70,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The proposed method is developed as an analytic network process (ANP) that contains grey numbers and multiple assessment criteria. The grey ANP is unique in bikeability literature and overcomes the disadvantages of existing assessment methods in the following ways. (1) The ANP framework can manage the interdependences among criteria and zones, (2) the multiple assessment criteria can consider comprehensive perspectives of bikeability, and (3) the grey numbers measure possible ranges of criteria performances and are good at handling various performances within a zone. The application of the method to the bikeability assessment of zones in Daan District, Taipei City, Taiwan not only verifies the effectiveness of the method but also provides action directions to the local administration in developing bike-friendly environments.","[Lin, Jen-Jia; Wei, Yi-Hsuan] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geog, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Lin, JJ (通讯作者)，1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.",jenjia@ntu.edu.tw,,,Ministry of Science and Technology [MOST 103-2410-H-002-160-SS2]; NTU Research Center for Future Earth [NTU-107L901004],Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government); NTU Research Center for Future Earth,This research is financially supported by Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST 103-2410-H-002-160-SS2) and NTU Research Center for Future Earth (NTU-107L901004).,,32,26,26,8,36,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,1879-2375,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Bayesian model selection and inference pooling techniques are adopted in a stochastic frontier analysis to mitigate the problem of model uncertainty. Adequacy of a given specification is judged by its posterior probability, which makes the benchmarking process not only more transparent but also much more objective. The proposed methodology is applied to one of Polish Distribution System Operators.

Specifically, Using the 2014 Transit Rider Survey in the Twin Cities, we examine how the performance of service attributes rewards and penalizes riders' overall satisfaction with express and local buses, and classify these attributes into three factors based on their respective contributions to overall satisfaction. We then integrate the factor structure with their average performances to identify improvement priorities. We found that both the importance of service attributes to the overall satisfaction and the improvement priorities differ between express and local buses. Among the tested attributes, vehicles are comfortable, total travel time is reasonable, and reliability should be addressed first for both local and express buses.","[Wu, Xinyi; Cao, Jason] Univ Minnesota, Humphrey Sch Publ Affairs, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Huting, Joel] Metro Transit, Minneapolis, MN USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Cao, J (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Humphrey Sch Publ Affairs, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",wuxx1088@umn.edu; cao@umn.edu; joel.huting@metrotransit.org,"Cao, Jason/AAE-4374-2020","Cao, Xinyu/0000-0002-4403-9762; Huting, Joel/0000-0003-3731-804X","Div Of Chem, Bioeng, Env, & Transp Sys; Directorate For Engineering [1444745] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Div Of Chem, Bioeng, Env, & Transp Sys; Directorate For Engineering(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))",,,34,35,39,3,39,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

To this end, a choice experiment (CE) was adopted; a CE is a systematic method used to determine individual preferences with regard to goods and services. A well-known advantage of CEs is their ability to capture a pecuniary value for target attributes in the form of marginal willingness to pay (MWTP). By comparing the sizes of MWTPs, we can recognize the order of preference among attributes. Amazon Mechanical Turk was used to collect the study data. We examined the magnitudes of the degree of preferences for additional services provided, accessibility, and price.

In this paper we compare quasi-Monte Carlo and randomized quasi-Monte Carlo techniques for simulating time series. We use randomized quasi-Monte Carlo to compute value-at-risk and expected shortfall measures for a stock portfolio whose returns follow a highly nonlinear Markov switching stochastic volatility model which does not admit analytical solutions for the returns distribution. Quasi-Monte Carlo methods are more accurate but do not allow the computation of reliable confidence intervals about risk measures. We find that randomized quasi-Monte Carlo methods maintain many of the advantages of quasi-Monte Carlo while also providing the ability to produce reliable confidence intervals of the simulated risk measures. However, the advantages in speed of convergence of randomized quasi-Monte Carlo diminish as the forecast horizon increases.","[Tzeng, Yu-Ying; Okten, Giray] Florida State Univ, Dept Math, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Beaumont, Paul M.] Florida State Univ, Dept Econ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Beaumont, PM (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Dept Econ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",ytzeng@math.fsu.edu; beaumont@fsu.edu; okten@math.fsu.edu,,"Beaumont, Paul/0000-0001-8065-3260",,,,,46,2,3,3,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

The findings suggest that much of the impact of the top income share on the debt ratio comes from changes in the profit share. Earlier research claims that the rich, via the banks, have lent their savings to the poor as a substitute for wage gains, but this description seems ill-suited for Sweden. An alternative explanation is that banks consider profits to be an indicator of the safety of a loan.

Historians are unanimous that the Victualling Board was an immediate and continuous improvement, daily feeding tens of thousands across the globe. On the other hand, to the modern eye, many aspects of the Victualling Board appear odd and costly-excessive inventories, unpassed accounts, charge and discharge accounting, in-house production, mutual surveillance, and excessive punishments. Here these two observations are reconciled. I argue that the Board's organization was a clever response to pre-modern transaction cost problems; that is, the Board was designed to create compatible incentives subject to the measurement constraints of the time.","[Allen, Douglas W.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, Burnaby, BC, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Allen, DW (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, Burnaby, BC, Canada.",allen@sfu.ca,,,,,,,59,3,3,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

We investigate the impacts of foreclosures on local government tax revenues, using a reduced form estimation approach that relates changes in foreclosures to changes in local government tax revenues. Unlike most previous work, we focus mainly on the nationwide revenue impacts of new foreclosures, using data across all local governments in the entire United States during the worst years of the Great Recession. We also use an instrumental variable approach that controls for possible endogeneity of foreclosures and housing prices. Overall, we find evidence that the new foreclosures had a direct, negative, but small effect on total tax revenues at the local level, although there is only weak evidence that this impact can be attributed to declines in local property taxes. However, we also find that foreclosures had an indirect and negative impact on local governments via declines in state government funding. We suggest that foreclosures may have affected the real economy, thereby reducing the state government revenues dependent on real economic activity that were used to finance transfers to local governments.","[Alm, James; Leguizamon, J.

They would not allow public authorities to adapt them to evolving context and circumstances. This paper aims at challenging this view and, more particularly, the view that contractual rigidity for transport concessions is exogenous. Using a transaction cost framework, we disentangle between three main determinants of contractual rigidity: traffic uncertainty; connivance between contracting parties; quality of the institutional environment. Using an original and unique database of mostly French toll road concession contracts, we observe a great variety of provisions for toll adjustment. While our results point out a positive impact of future traffic uncertainty on the propensity to resort to flexible contracts, they also highlight that higher trust between the contracting parties and more reliable institutional environments foster contractual flexibility. These results and the associated policy implications can be helpful in implementing the conditions under which the public and private partners are able to cope with the intrinsic incompleteness of these contracts.","[Athias, Laure] Univ Lausanne, IDHEAP, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Saussier, Stephane] Sorbonne Grad Business Sch, Paris, France",University of Lausanne,"Athias, L (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, IDHEAP, Quartier UNIL Mouline, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",laure.athias@unil.ch,,"Athias, Laure/0000-0002-1636-1770",,,,,40,19,19,0,23,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

However, little evidence exists about the scale of the net benefits. By developing a new method for identifying the demand curve, this paper estimates the consumer surplus associated with heating, transport and lighting over more than two hundred years and identifies the gains from key energy transitions. For certain energy transitions, the increase was dramatic, reflecting the transformations in society and lifestyles that mobility and illumination provided in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Yet, the net benefits related to heating technologies only rose modestly. Finally, due to saturation effects of the demand for energy services, future technological developments and energy transitions may benefit consumers ( though not necessarily society as a whole) less than those in the past.","[Fouquet, Roger] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environment, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Fouquet, R (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environment, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",r.fouquet@lse.ac.uk,,"Fouquet, Roger/0000-0003-4732-0821",ESRC; Grantham Foundation,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Grantham Foundation,"I would like to thank Elizabeth Baldwin, Eric Beinhocker, Alex Bowen, Rafael Calel, Mona Chitnis, Antoine Dechezlepretre, Simon Dietz, Dave Donaldson, Doyne Farmer, Eli Fenichel, Meredith Fowlie, Tim Foxon, Ken Gillingham, Michael Greenstone, Jim Hammitt, David Hendry, Cameron Hepburn, Jonathan Hersh, Daniel Heyen, Matt Kotchen, Ralf Martin, Kyle Meng, Tanya OGarra, Peter Pearson, Carlota Perez, Robert Pindyck, Neil Rickman, Lutz Sager, Gregor Semieniuk, Steve Sorrell, Richard Tol, Frederick van der Ploeg, Dirk Jan van de Ven, Catherine Wolfram and Dimitri Zenghelis for their comments and discussions.

Their evolution is far from linear: approximately 40% of newlywed couples signed a prenuptial agreement in 1855, but this share dropped to less than 10% after the reform of marital property regimes in 1965. It experienced an upturn after the introduction of no-fault divorce in 1975, and roughly 18% of newlywed couples signed a prenuptial agreement in 2010. We show how these changes are related to the gradual disappearance of traditional matrimonial property regimes in the late nineteenth century and to the rise in the prevalence of separate assets property regime in the late twentieth century. We conclude that before the recent decrease in marriage rates, the financial characteristics of marriage changed significantly over the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The health of rail infrastructure, however, needs to be monitored, measured and maintained, which falls within the remit of asset managers who are often charged with balancing costs, opportunities and risks against the desired performance of the assets and their respective systems at varying levels. Having appropriate and reliable information about an asset is pivotal for enabling asset management to support decision-making, planning and execution of activities and tasks of assets, particularly during operations and maintenance. But, having access to the right information at the right time, has been and remains a pervasive problem, hinders an asset owner's ability to ensure their rail infrastructure performance is being optimized. A new approach to facilitate the acquisition and integration of information to support digital asset management (DAM) for rail infrastructure is presented. The research uses a case study to empirically assess the quality of 'as-built' documentation for electrical systems of Bayswater railway station that forms an integral part of the Forrestfield Airport Linkage project, in Perth Western Australia. Errors, omissions and information redundancy contained within the existing 'as-built' documentation is quantified. Then, a case for the adoption of a Systems Information Model is put forward as the rail industry moves toward a digital future and seeks to future-proof their assets and networks.","[Love, Peter E.

This optimal commodity tax problem with a consumption target brings about taxation rules that are mainly at variance with the standard results of commodity taxation. In our main theorem, we derive a general, though quite simple, rule of optimal commodity taxation under a target on total consumption: in particular, we establish that higher consumer prices should be charged for commodities with (1) high price elasticities of total demand and (2) low consumption shares in total demand. From this theorem we deduce three important corollaries: an anti-inverse elasticity result, an anti-Corlett-Hague result and a uniform-pricing result.

This global slack hypothesis is tested using different theoretical specifications, which also relate domestic output elasticity and foreign output elasticity to the degree of trade openness of an individual economy. The results reject this hypothesis. The global resource capacity does not drive domestic inflation. The impact of globalization has not increased in the inflation process, and the results yield important policy implications for monetary policy formulation.

We estimate these effects using employer-induced changes in home-to-work distances. We find that a 1% increase in the husband's commuting distance reduces his wife's employment probability by 0.016 percentage points and has a slight positive effect on his own working hours.

While some agreements have remained intact after their initial conclusion, others are amended, updated, or replaced. Why are some international agreements renegotiated while others remain stable? This paper offers a systematic analysis of treaty renegotiation by presenting theoretical propositions and testing them in the context of bilateral investment treaties (BITs). We argue that states renegotiate when they learn new information about the legal and political consequences of their treaty commitments, and that such learning is most likely to take place when states are involved in investor-state dispute settlement cases. Employing an original data set on renegotiated BITs, we find robust empirical support for the learning argument. We conclude by discussing implications for the study of institutional change and the evolving investment regime.","[Haftel, Yoram Z.] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Int Relat, Jerusalem, Israel; [Thompson, Alexander] Ohio State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Thompson, A (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",Yoram.haftel@gmail.com; Thompson.1191@osu.edu,,,European Union [333374],European Union(European Union (EU)),"The authors are listed in alphabetical order.

This agent-based artificial market is designed to simulate characteristics of immature stock markets (high risk and low efficiency) by reproducing their stylized facts related mainly to information asymmetry and herd behavior. These two properties are modeled by combining social network and multi-agent simulations.

Different assortative topologies are proposed and linked to different degrees of information asymmetry and market maturities.

Building on a wealth of new data and advanced simulation methods, conventional research into urban systems seeks to embrace this complexity, measuring and modelling cities with increasingly greater detail and reliability. The practice of transportation modelling, despite recent developments, lags behind these advances. This paper addresses the implications resulting from variations in model design, with a focus on the behaviour and cognition of drivers, demonstrating how different models of choice and experience significantly influence the distribution of traffic. It is demonstrated how conventional models of urban traffic have not fully incorporated many of the important findings from the cognitive science domain, instead often describing actions in terms of individual optimisation. We introduce exploratory agent-based modelling that incorporates representations of behaviour from a more cognitively rich perspective. Specifically, through these simulations, we identify how spatial cognition in respect to route selection and the inclusion of heterogeneity in spatial knowledge significantly impact the spatial extent and volume of traffic flow within a real-world setting. These initial results indicate that individual-level models of spatial cognition can potentially play an important role in predicting urban traffic flow, and that greater heed should be paid to these approaches going forward. The findings from this work hold important lessons in the development of models of transport systems and hold potential implications for policy.","[Manley, Ed] UCL, Bartlett Ctr Adv Spatial Anal CASA, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Cheng, Tao] UCL, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London,"Manley, E (通讯作者)，UCL, Bartlett Ctr Adv Spatial Anal CASA, 90 Tottenham Court Rd, London W1T 4TJ, England.",Ed.Manley@ucl.ac.uk,,"Cheng, Tao/0000-0002-5503-9813; Manley, Ed/0000-0002-8904-0513","UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/G023212/1]; Transport for London; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/G023212/1, EP/J004197/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/J004197/1, EP/G023212/1] Funding Source: UKRI",UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Transport for London; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This work was supported by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EP/G023212/1) and Transport for London.,,60,15,17,0,29,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,1879-2375,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

This paper looks at policy options for Australian cities to deliver faster emissions reductions than the national commitment level. The main focus is on an accelerated reduction in emissions from urban road transport, through technological improvements and behaviour changes. Targets arc proposed for improved emissions intensities, to bring Australia much closer to US and EU performance expectations. A range of behaviour change measures is then tested on Melbourne and Sydney, the Sydney analysis using MetroScan-TI, an integrated evaluation framework, to explore how behaviour changes might enhance emissions outcomes. The potential contribution of public transport is a particular focus. The paper concludes that, with sufficient political will, Australia could reduce its 2030 road transport emissions to 40% below 2005 levels. This is a much larger reduction than the current 26-28% Australian target but is more consistent with longer term pathways to acceptable carbon budgets.","[Stanley, John; Ellison, Richard; Hensher, David] Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Loader, Chris] Monash Univ, Publ Transport Res Grp, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",University of Sydney; Monash University,"Stanley, J (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",john.stanley@sydney.edu.au; richard.ellison@sydney.edu.au; chris@cloader.net; david.hensher@sydney.edu.au,,"Hensher, David/0000-0003-0058-2242",,,,,29,16,16,0,14,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

This paper empirically investigates the main drivers of capital flows into the fast-growing BRICS countries, in the backdrop of their growing inward capital flows. Employing a fully balanced panel for the period 1995-2015, we focus on, among others, the hitherto commonly untested variables: sovereign credit ratings, economic freedom and ease of doing business ranking of these countries. In searching for the relevant interaction and causality among the drivers of capital flows, we employ the panel Granger causality test to arrive at the policy implications. The results suggest that market size is a significant driver of capital flows. In addition to infrastructure, economic freedom in the host countries, ease of doing business ranking and sovereign credit ratings are the main drivers in the long-run growth of capital flows.","[Swamy, Vighneswara; Narayanamurthy, Vijayakumar] IFHE Univ, IBS Hyderabad, Finance, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India",The ICFAI Foundation for Higher Education (IFHE); ICFAI Business School (IBS),"Swamy, V (通讯作者)，IFHE Univ, IBS Hyderabad, Finance, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India.",,"Swamy, Vighneswara/AAA-9415-2020","Swamy, Vighneswara/0000-0001-7287-4637; NARAYANAMURTHY, VIJAYAKUMAR/0000-0001-9596-0183",,,,,78,12,13,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,FEB,2018,41.0,2,,,,,519,549,,10.1111/twec.12606,0.0,,,31,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FV9WU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424941800007,0

Yet, evidence of its economic impact is sparse. This paper uses primary data to examine the short term impact of a food assistance program on labor supply as measured by the hours worked, labor market participation rates and transitions to employment within HIV/AIDS affected households in Zambia. We find that food assistance is generally a labor supply disincentive to HIV-infected patients receiving treatment as it reduced their hours worked by up to 54%, transitions to employment by up to 70% and also reduced the labor market participation rates of male patients by 72%. Among non-infected adult family members, there were no significant effects on labor market participation. However, propensity score estimates show that food assistance generally increased the intensity of work by males regardless of the length of AIDS treatment, but for females there was a disincentive effect that disappeared when the patient had spent a longer time on AIDS treatment and was therefore healthier and less likely to be cared for. These findings suggest that food assistance can inadvertently reduce the labor supply of HIV-infected individuals, but this is compensated for by the increased labor supply among other family members.

A crucial element for successful implementation of WBL approaches is the existence of competent WBL trainers in VET institutions and companies. This is still a challenge requiring also focused research to support policy developments. The aim of the paper here is two-folded; it aims to analyse the background of wider socio-economic and educationalemployment aspects behind the challenges of WBL, and secondly, to present research challenges within an ongoing European Union Erasmus+ KA 3 programme project called TTT4WBL. This project is focusing on development of training of WBL trainers through an innovative 'tandem training' methodology piloted in the Baltic context and considered as a potentially contributing factor to increase competitiveness of the developed labour force. The purpose of the experimentation implemented in TTT4WVBL project within 2017-2020 is to develop and test a professional development model in which tutors from VET schools and enterprises are trained together. The research related to the experimentation is investigating how the WBL tutors participating in joint training develop their competences related to WBL. The research is still in progress. In this paper, we present the pilot phase results, focusing on how WBL tutors assessed their expertise related to WBL prior to their training. The results are being seen as relevant for subsequent studies in later stages of the project implementation.

Large quantities of both liquid and solid wastes are produced annually by the food processing industry. The current food wastage in EU27 is 179 kg per capita (89 milion ton per annum). In the context of food waste, paradoxical the food hunger is a growing problem based on a growing population issue, forecasted to 10 billion people by 2050. Therefore, the re-use and valorization of agro-food by-products is a real solution for food waste and hunger. This waste is rich in bioactive compounds and can thus be improved and incorporated into food supplements or used as individual nutrient powders rich in calories and bioactive compounds (European Commission Final Report, 2010). These waste materials contain principally biodegradable organic matter and their disposal creates serious environmental problems (Shyamala and Jamuna, 2010). A variety of processes is being developed towards this direction, aiming at converting the waste materials into bio-fuels, food ingredients and other added-value bio-products. However, in many instances, there is a rather significant lack of appropriate feasibility studies on the exploitation of such wastes, and as a result, their utilization is still in its infancy. For that, the present work proposes an agro-food waste powder formulation and incorporation into food products in order to reduce the waste disposal problem and food hunger by offering a sustainable and cost-effective solution. Is this approach a step forward in the functional food industry by offering an applicative direction to be explored together with a novel route for environmental protection? Does it provide sustainable outcomes for food waste by increasing the economic value of by-products?","[Calinoiu, L.

Even if a financial auditor's financial statements were audited by a financial auditor, however, the audit report drawn up in connection with them does not replace the auditor's report on a project financed by European funds that the entity benefited from and which be drawn up in accordance with a particular reference. Of course, all of these aspects looked at the projects to be funded from the 2014-2020 Programs. But, in the context of the current regulations on the implementation of the 2014-2020 operational programs, the independent financial audit of European funded projects is no longer a mandatory activity. As a result, the Collaboration Protocol has become obsolete and has therefore been terminated (in May 2017) by a number of specialists disputed. Given the conditions, the audit of the projects remains under the responsibility of the Audit Authority within the Court of Accounts of Romania. This study aims at identifying the most frequent irregularities with financial impact of the beneficiaries of European projects found during the 2007-2013 period, given that the last report of the Court of Accounts on these aspects signals that the Audit Authority has detected irregularities in fish _ 50 million in expenditure declared for settlement by the European Commission in 2013 by Romanian entities benefiting from a Grant from Structural and Cohesion Funds. Starting from the results of the study, it is intended to identify the most risky systems that are considered the most risky, encountered at the level of the beneficiaries of funds by the Audit Authority in the period 2007-2013, precisely in order to draw an alarm signal in this regard for the audit of the projects launched from 2014 onwards. In addition, it is also envisaged to support the reintroduction of the obligation for independent audit of projects funded by European funds.","[Grosu, Maria; Maha, Liviu-George; Robu, Ioan-Bogdan] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Grosu, M (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania.",maria_lia24@yahoo.com; mlg@uaic.ro; bogdan.robu@feaa.uaic.ro,"Maha, Liviu-George/F-6014-2016; ROBU, Ioan-Bogdan/E-4230-2016","ROBU, Ioan-Bogdan/0000-0002-4067-7433",,,,,22,1,1,0,3,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-492-5,,,,2018,,,,,,,285,299,,,,,,15,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL8FU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000456271700021,0

The research was based on FADN farm data. As a result, it was proved that subsidies from CAP contributed the most to increasing the sustainability in the environmental dimension of farms specialising in animal husbandry using grazing, and the smallest - of farms specialising in field crops and granivores. It has been proved that in agriculture in Poland there is a positive effect of single area payments for balancing agriculture in its economic dimension, regardless of the production types of farms existing in a given area.

I argue that Moscow was following a strategy of differentiated retaliation when selecting which imports to embargo. The countersanctions were not designed to mete out equal punishment on all members of the sanctioning coalition. Rather, Russia purposefully crafted the policy to inflict greater economic damage on some states than others. Utilizing an original data-set on all agricultural and food products that Russia imports, I demonstrate that, ceteris paribus, imports of sizeable commercial value to countries the Kremlin has long viewed as the mainstays of anti-Russian policies were far more likely to have been banned. In contrast, the evidence shows that Moscow stayed its hand in dealing with Europe's major powers. This analysis both illuminates the policy objectives being pursued by a leading actor in world politics, as well as lays the groundwork for theoretically understanding the geostrategic, political, and economic drivers of countersanctions.","[Hedberg, Masha] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Adv Int Studies SAIS Europe, Bologna, Italy; [Hedberg, Masha] European Univ Inst, Robert Schuman Ctr Adv Studies, Fiesole, Italy",Johns Hopkins University; European University Institute,"Hedberg, M (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Adv Int Studies SAIS Europe, Bologna, Italy.;Hedberg, M (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Robert Schuman Ctr Adv Studies, Fiesole, Italy.",mhedberg@jhu.edu,,,,,,,74,25,27,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

The arrangement of a horizontal screen under an existing building will require a large area of production, the implementation of labor-intensive soil development or the use of expensive horizontal directional drilling.

Drilling of inclined guide holes is carried out under the existing building at an angle, which ensures further coupling of the anti-filtration elements of the screen. Screw equipment is usually used for the arrangement of vertical wells and the auger is directed along the well being developed. In the developed technology the auger is located perpendicular to the guiding wells and is used for the development, transportation and mixing of soil with solutions. Anti-filtration screens, made with auger equipment, are formed due to intersecting elements, in the form of panels, which are formed by mixing the soil with cement mortar. A technological plan for the production of works to protect against flooding of existing buildings according to the developed technology is developed. The main technological processes, materials and equipment for the production of works are presented.","[Meneyliuk, Alexander; Petrovsky, Anatoly; Borisov, Alexander; Kyryliuk, Stanislav] Odessa State Acad Civil Engn & Architecture, Odessa, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Odessa State Academy of Civil Engineering and Architecture,"Kyryliuk, S (通讯作者)，Odessa State Acad Civil Engn & Architecture, Odessa, Ukraine.",kirilstani@ukr.net,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,288,293,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540723300034,0

Countries within the EU offer different routes to becoming a qualified professional accountant, and the regulations and standards sometimes differ. Contrary to the situation in Malta, where accountants are required to follow a standard content (syllabus) of formal education with approved education bodies and need to have about three years' experience in accountancy, usually with approved accountancy firms, in Latvia an accountant is able to practice without a mandatory accountancy qualification and it is enough for him/her to have only an economic-related academic or professional certificate, diploma or degree or experience or an accountant leading to a certificate of competency. This study aims to compare requirements and routes to becoming an Accountant in Latvia and Malta and through such comparison and using the historical institutionalism approach as the theoretical framework for the development of the accountancy profession in Malta, to determine whether there is a need for improvements and reform to the requirements for practising as a professional accountant in Latvia. The case of Malta was chosen for comparison purposively since although bigger, in the EU Latvia is still a small state like Malta. To address this objective, the authors used the comparative approach, which involved a comparative study of the models, qualifications, regulations, standards and methods in each country. The theoretical and methodological grounds of the paper are the normative acts, works produced by scientists and Internet sources. The study shows that the accountancy profession in Malta is mature and very well developed and established within the EU and therefore, Latvia may build its accountancy profession by reference to the Maltese Model. The article looks at both theory and practice, and attempts to determine and understand problematic issues about the regulatory and professional requirements, in a drive to provide recommendations for improvement.","[Millere, Inta; Faitusa, Ivita] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia; [Grima, Simon; Baldacchino, Peter J.] Univ Malta, Msida, Malta",University of Latvia; University of Malta,"Millere, I (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,"Faitusa, Ivita/AAC-4905-2020; Grima, Simon/O-5299-2015","Grima, Simon/0000-0003-1523-5120",,,,,7,3,3,1,3,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-344-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,463,473,,,,,,11,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP0MG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000535358500043,0

However, culture not only keeps looking back, but also turns to the future. Culture can be projected as an emerging possibility. Thus, the movements of power (political, economic and social) generated around the culture, find a different sense if they are not encouraged by the same conventional force, from the same customs. Politicians or capitalism are often pointed out as the cause of most of the unfairness associated like for example malnutrition. However, they are treated as inseparable institutional pieces, which go hand in hand, instead of understanding that capitalism is at its core a cultural rather than a political process. In this second it finds its support but its origin is sustained by the ethos of people, by our lifestyle which is difficult for us to give up deliberately. Because of habit and custom we have been anchored to the comforts afforded by the capital of the welfare society, saving the cognitive effort involved in exercising empathy. Often, acting with justice implies to act according to the moral code that displays hegemony in the society of our time. But if we expand our view and assume that globalization has allowed our sense of responsibility not to be marginalized at a local level, then the discourses of justice must be harmonized with a multicultural recognition. Moral pluralism finds its heterogeneity in several past customs, but a common fair culture can be built if it aims for ex-ante responsibility. In that case, is reasonable to promote solidarity as a political movement to protect the health of our neighbours and next generations while part of our identity is rejected? In the ethical theory proposed here, identity and solidarity rather than meeting in an exclusive dilemma are integrated to deal with food inequalities which raises one of the greatest injustices that we live nowadays and our descendants will inherit.","[Moyano Fernandez, C.] Autonomous Univ Barcelona UAB, Dept Philosophy, Barcelona 08193, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Fernández, CM (通讯作者)，Autonomous Univ Barcelona UAB, Dept Philosophy, Barcelona 08193, Spain.",cristian.moyano@uab.cat,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,0,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,196,201,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_30,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000030,0

Job discontent is defined as a motivator which is necessary to make progress in a professional career. Discontent employees can leave their organizations or to stay with them accomplishing additional tasks aimed at raising qualification or enhancing promotion, or job crafting, or they can choose a neglect option. Therefore, a model used in the paper is called Exit-Rush-Craft-Neglect, or the ERCN model. The research is aimed to determine how important the particular aspects of job are in explaining the responses of discontent employees. The analysis includes age groups. A source of data is a questionnaire survey carried out in Poland in November of 2016. Considering the intercorrelations among the job aspects and a large number of aspects the relative weight analysis is applied to establish the contribution of a particular job aspect to explaining a given response of job discontent. The findings reveal that employability is the most powerful motivator when employees respond to job discontent. The problem of overqualification induces the older to exit. Job crafting is chosen mostly by employees in the middle age when they perceive themselves independent and responsible. The age groups of employees are motivated to the neglect response by different job aspects - the young by unfairness at their work places, while older by the possibility to work at home. The results confirm the hypothesis that there are age differences in explaining the effects of the job aspects on the job discontent responses.","[Piotrowska, Maria] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Piotrowska, M (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland.",maria.piotrowska@ue.wroc.pl,,,Polish National Science Centre [2015/17/B/HS4/02713],Polish National Science Centre,We would like to acknowledge the financial support of Polish National Science Centre (Grant No. 2015/17/B/HS4/02713).,,14,0,0,0,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,104,113,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540720300013,0

There has also been a large fall in support for a close political and economic relationship with Russia and some increase in support for joining the European Union.

The empirical study uses panel data of 160 Chinese cities and a time span over 2000-2015. To capture the characteristics of the panel models, including the individual effects, variable intercepts, and coefficient values, different regression functions are adopted for the relevant analysis. As for these regression functions, seven explanatory variables are selected. These variables are: the length of operated bus transit routes (LR), the total number of annual passengers trips (PT), the land area for urban roads (LA), the density of urban road networks (ND), the resident population (POP), the gross domestic production (GDP), and the value-added tax (TAX). On the other hand, the explained variable in these regression models is the AIP of each city. According to model results, it is found that AIP is positively related to LR and GDP, and negatively to PT, LA, and TAX. However, the effects of ND and POP are negative on the increase of AIPs of mega-cities and medium-size cities. It could also be found that the increase in bus infrastructure investment caused by the expansion of land area for urban roads is not negligible, especially in small cities. When the LR changes greatly, LA should be considered as a more stable factor to predict the AlP in mega-cities. Based on the findings, related implications for the policy p-making on annual budget allocations for different tiers of cities are listed.","[Qiu, Guo] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, State Key Lab Rail Traff Control & Safety, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Xu, Wangtu (Ato)] Xiamen Univ, Dept Urban Planning, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Li, Ling] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Informat Technol & Decis Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA",Beijing Jiaotong University; Xiamen University; Old Dominion University,"Xu, WT (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Dept Urban Planning, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.",ato1981@163.com,,"Xu, Ato/0000-0002-0790-821X",Humanity and Social Science Youth foundation of the Ministry of Education of China [12YJCZH237],Humanity and Social Science Youth foundation of the Ministry of Education of China,This research has been supported in part by Humanity and Social Science Youth foundation of the Ministry of Education of China (under Grant No. 12YJCZH237).,,35,12,12,5,57,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,1879-2375,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

The study was conducted in Java Island, focusing on Malang Raya as the production area, and three other towns as the marketing area. The data includes the volume and production cost, traded volume, price, and marketing cost from the farmers and traders of Indonesian apple. We used concentration ratio, pricing description, and marketing profit to analyze the market structure, conduct, and performance, respectively. The result shows that the market structure of Indonesian apple is oligopoly at all levels of marketing channel, where the wholesalers have the highest concentration ratio. Consistent with the market structure, the wholesalers also have the strongest bargaining position in pricing, so that they become the price maker. In the market performance, the wholesalers also earn the highest profit. The research finding implies effort to increase the marketing profit and efficiency. The farmers need shorten the marketing channel towards the supermarkets. The wholesalers need to reduce the marketing cost by minimizing the fruits damage in transportation. Finally, the agents and retailers need to reduce the unsold apple.","[Relawati, Rahayu] Univ Muhammadiyah Malang, Dept Agribusiness, Fac Agr & Anim Husb, Malang, Indonesia; [Mulyo, Jangkung Handoyo] Univ Gadjah Mada, Favulty Agr, Dept Socioecon, Yogyakerta, Indonesia; [Masyhuri; Waluyati, Lestari Rahayu] Univ Gadjah Mada, Dept Sosioecon, Fac Agr, Yogyakarta, Indonesia",Universitas Muhammadiyah Malang; Gadjah Mada University; Gadjah Mada University,"Relawati, R (通讯作者)，Univ Muhammadiyah Malang, Dept Agribusiness, Fac Agr & Anim Husb, Malang, Indonesia.",rahayurelawati@umm.ac.id; JHandoyoM@ugm.ac.id; masyhuri@ugm.ac.id; lestarirahayu_wlyt@ugm.ac.id,"Waluyati, Lestari Rahayu/GOV-4567-2022",,,,,,13,1,1,0,3,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5401,,978-94-6252-619-8,AER ADV ENG RES,,,2018,172.0,,,,,,239,244,,,,,,6,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BP7HZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000562072800049,0

Previous empirical literature has shown that FDI promote economic growth via complementary effects on domestic investments, increases in productivity and overall economic efficiency, giving rise to an increasing interest in understanding the key determinants of FDI. Apart from traditional FDI determinants, favourable tax policy has been considered important factor influencing MNCs' locational decisions. In particular, FDI-related policy measures seem important rivalry tool, especially in the context of economies characterised by similar economic structures and patterns of economic transformation such as is the case of South-East European (SEE) transition countries. In view these similarities there is increasing interest among policy makers in creating favourable business environment and use available policy stances in promoting FDI in these countries. The increasing awareness on the importance of FDI among government officials has resulted in the development of FDI-specific policies and institutional setting depicted in OECD FDI institutional framework indices. Essentially, tax policy measures have been used as complementary tool in creating favourable environment for foreign investors. In recent years SEE countries have reduced corporate income tax and integrated a number of tax policy incentives. In an attempt to promote differentiated and attractive FDI environment SEE countries have put their tax related revenues and local firms at odds in view of the expected long term economic benefits associated with FDI related positive externalities. In view of this, the critical question becomes the one of the effectiveness of these tax policy measures in attracting FDI. The purpose of this paper is to examine the relevance of tax policy in promoting FDI in SEE. Specifically we investigate the impact of corporate income tax on FDI in SEE. Lower income tax is by and large found to be important determinant of FDI in countries at the lower level of technological development and industrial diversification as is the case of SEE countries. We rely on gravity econometric framework and examine the impact of tax policy on FDI using bilateral FDI flows between home and host countries in the period 2000-2015. The seven SEE host countries included in the sample are considered of similar economic structures and institutional transformation which seems important in analysing tax policy effectiveness and minimising biases associated with econometric modelling of FDI determinants. Finally, we study this relationship in an integrated framework considering traditional gravity forces as well as a number of additional FDI determinants including institutional factors. We show that although tax policy seems important determinant of FDI, its effect seems to be conditional on the level of technological development.","[Silajdzic, Sabina; Obradovic, Maida; Mehic, Eldin] Univ Sarajevo, Sch Econ & Business, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Sarajevo,"Silajdzic, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sarajevo, Sch Econ & Business, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg.",,"Mehic, Eldin/GLV-3455-2022","Mehic, Eldin/0000-0001-5825-6701",,,,,24,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,451,463,,,,,,13,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540720300044,0

The regeneration of brownfields is a challenging task due to their complexity. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the economic structure of Hungary has been changed and the regeneration of brownfields have become an important challenge for many urban areas.

But there are several obstacles for successful developments in which the market size and threshold issues play important role. The aim of the research is to demonstrate an inventory of criteria for long-term viable redevelopments. In-depth analysis, site visits and interviews will be applied. The cases will be collected from absolutely different urban areas representing the complexity of regeneration (a regional centre from the Hungarian Great Plain and a settlement near the Hungarian-Austrian borderline) which indicates the importance of threshold question. The research would contribute not just to the brownfield regeneration scientific field but also to the regional science since it links the development to market size and threshold issues.

However, more animals are involved. All over the world, unspecified, but large numbers of wild living rats, mice and other animals are killed because they are perceived as pests. If labelled as a pest animal, discussions on moral status and welfare seem to disappear from the public debate. This seems rather strange, if we take into account that these rats and mice do not differ in their capabilities to suffer compared to rats and mice in other contexts. In this paper, we present the first results of a study on this topic by the Centre for Sustainable Animal Stewardship. It includes the current status of the treatment of rodents perceived as pests, an overview of stakeholder attitudes and first reflections on its moral dimensions. Participating stakeholders feel the need to improve the treatment of mice and rats perceives as pests in terms of animal welfare, humanness and effectiveness of control. They urge for a better application of preventive measures by all people involved in pest control, including private persons. More attention should be paid to the humanness of control measures. National coordination and monitoring under the responsibility of the government is necessary for better implementation of IPM and more responsible rodent control. The outcomes of the study seem promising for the start of a dialogue about the treatment of rodents perceived as pests and improvements to make. Furthermore, they may be an inspiration for and start of a broader dialogue about ways to achieve a responsible and sustainable human-animal relationship.","[van Gerwen, M. A. A. M.; Meijboom, F. L.

The methodology is applied to micro-data on house transactions and asking rents in Sydney, Australia, between 2004 and 2014.

The level of interest of farmers in implementing the Warehouse Receipt System in Bantul Regency is in the highest category. There is a close relationship between the characteristics of farmers and the level of interest of farmers in implementing the Warehouse Receipt System. Rice production, land area, farming experience, and rice warehouse distance are positively correlated with farmers' interest in applying the warehouse receipt system.

Nonetheless, we estimate that WTO accession will increase welfare by 9.9% of consumption in Belarus. We show that inclusion of: (i) foreign direct investment; (ii) reduction in non-discriminatory barriers against services providers; and (iii) our model with imperfect competition and endogenous productivity effects together produce estimated gains eleven times larger than a model of perfect competition with only cross-border trade in services. Our analysis is enabled by our production of a data set on both discriminatory and non-discriminatory barriers in services and their ad valorem equivalents. Based on a new data set on labour productivity by sector and type of ownership, in our central model, we estimate that privatisation will increase welfare by 35.8% of consumption.

Our methodology closely follows that of Dollar and Kraay (Journal of Economic Growth, 2002, 7, 195), but instead of looking at the bottom of the distribution, we focus on the top. We use panel data from the World Top Incomes database, which collects top income data from several countries using tax returns as the raw source. We define the rich as earners in the top 10%, 1%, 0.1% and 0.01% of the income distribution. Using data since 1980, we find that economic growth is good for the rich in the sense that the mean income of the top decile of the distribution grows in the same proportion as that of the whole population. However, we also find that the income of earners in the top percentile of the distribution and above grows faster than average income: therefore, economic growth is really good for the really rich. We also find that during economic downturns the average income of top earners responds proportionally less to changes in mean income than during economic expansions. Our results are consistent with the increase in inequality that has been recently observed at the top part of the distribution in many countries, and they are robust to different specifications, country samples and time observations.","[Campos-Vazquez, Raymundo M.; Esquivel, Gerardo] El Colegio Mexico, Dept Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Chavez, Emmanuel] Paris Sch Econ EHESS, Paris, France",Colegio de Mexico; Paris School of Economics,"Campos-Vazquez, RM (通讯作者)，El Colegio Mexico, Dept Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",,,"Esquivel, Gerardo/0000-0001-8517-1498",,,,,43,4,6,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2017,40.0,12,,,,,2639,2675,,10.1111/twec.12494,0.0,,,37,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FO8JB,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417130900006,0

However, we argue that the process of getting elected to the UNSC leads to the election of states that are not likely to represent their regions. Using UN General Assembly voting patterns as a proxy for preferences, two sets of analyses test 1) whether, in general, states within the same region have higher levels of General Assembly voting similarity, and 2) if UNSC members possess similar voting patterns with states in their region. The results show that while regional groupings do tend to have higher patterns of vote similarity, this effect is not present when comparing the states voted onto the UNSC with states in their region.","[Lai, Brian] Univ Iowa, Dept Polit Sci, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Lefler, Vanessa A.] Middle Tennessee State Univ, Peck Hall Room 209,MTSU POB 29, Murfreesboro, TN 37132 USA",University of Iowa; Middle Tennessee State University,"Lai, B (通讯作者)，Univ Iowa, Dept Polit Sci, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",Brian-lai@uiowa.edu,,,,,,,39,8,9,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

A hybrid choice model (HCM) was developed to simultaneously model the effect of socioeconomic, infrastructure and land use variables, life events and non-random attrition on trip rates, whereby the latent variable (LV) model is composed of panel attrition and survey completeness. The discrete choice model (DCM) includes four trip rate categories, including zero trips. The probability of each trip rate category was estimated for both the HCM and the DCM models; with and without the LV model. The first main conclusion from this paper is that the largest bias due to panel attrition occurs in the probability of reporting no trips per day, and 1-2 trips per day. Also, the HCM models show a correlation between the probability of reporting no trips per day and the tendency to drop out altogether. The second main conclusion is that the results show that the latent variables (attrition and completeness) are statistically significant in estimating mobility. Also, socioeconomic variables (gender, driving license, household type and size), mode preferences, spatial infrastructure and life events determine mobility rates and remain significant after adding attrition/completeness variables. Thirdly, the results proved that attrition effects significantly vary across waves.","[Puello, Lissy La Paix; Geurs, Karst T.] Univ Twente, Fac Engn Technol, Ctr Transport Studies, Drienerlolaan 5, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Olde-Kalter, Marie-Jose] Goudappel Coffeng, Snipperlingsdijk 4, NL-7417 BJ Deventer, Netherlands",University of Twente,"Puello, LL (通讯作者)，Univ Twente, Fac Engn Technol, Ctr Transport Studies, Drienerlolaan 5, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.",l.c.lapaixpuello@utwente.nl; MOIdeKalter@goudappel.nl; k.t.geurs@utwente.nl,"La Paix, Lissy/AAF-1753-2021","La Paix, Lissy/0000-0001-8377-4471; Geurs, Karst/0000-0003-0918-8903",,,,,54,10,11,1,13,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

It examined the existence of hysteresis in the unemployment rates of four Nordic countries, namely Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, for the period of 2000-2014. The study applied four alternative methods to analyse the data. The best estimation procedure was chosen in a simple and consistent way. As the findings indicated, the ADF test and FADF test failed to reject the null hypothesis of unemployment hysteresis in all four countries. The ADF-SB test produced mixed results: it rejected the null hypothesis of hysteresis for Denmark and Norway, but failed to reject the null hypothesis for Finland and Sweden. The FADF-SB test yielded more consistent findings: it rejected the null hypothesis for all four countries. Furthermore, findings from the F-tests clearly indicated that the FADF-SB test was the best method among the four proposed alternatives. Despite some discrepancies the findings of this study suggest that unemployment in the four Nordic countries had a mean reversion tendency.","[Furuoka, Fumitaka] Univ Malaya, Asia Europe Inst, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Furuoka, F (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Asia Europe Inst, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",fumitaka@um.edu.my,"Furuoka, Fumitaka/C-4197-2012","Furuoka, Fumitaka/0000-0003-1863-387X",,,,,36,37,37,2,14,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Using a unique nation-wide British survey, we explore the influence of consumers' attitudes and perceptions on switching behaviors and assess the differences in switching propensity across different groups. Support for simplifying energy tariffs, professed less difficulty in under standing energy bills, expected difficulty in changing suppliers and lack of attention to the issue of energy prices are associated with lower switching activity. At a time of high saliency, political party voting intention was strongly related to switching. Unlike the bivariate analyses conducted by the regulator and the competition authority, our multivariate analysis show few' demographic factors affect the likelihood of switching except for educational attainment and tariff payment patterns. Remedies aiming to encourage switching cannot be targeted correctly unless the supporting analysis is robust to alternative model specifications.","[He, Xiaoping] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, China Ctr Energy Econ Res, Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Reiner, David] Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Energy Policy Res Grp, Cambridge, England",Xiamen University; University of Cambridge,"He, XP (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, China Ctr Energy Econ Res, Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China.",xphe@xmu.edu.cn; dmr40@cam.ac.uk,"Reiner, David/AAR-7816-2021","Reiner, David/0000-0003-2004-8696","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [20720151028, 20720151039]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71203187, 71573217]",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Xiaoping He gratefully acknowledges supports from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.71203187; No. 71573217) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 20720151028; No. 20720151039).,,50,32,33,1,21,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,NOV,2017,38.0,6,,,,,25,53,,10.5547/01956574.38.6.hxia,0.0,,,29,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FL5IC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000414266800003,0

In addition, we conducted a regression analysis to investigate the effect of Korea's trade growth on inclusive growth during its industrialisation period covering the period of 1976-2011. We found that the recent reform policies reported in the WTO's Trade policy review for Korea in 2016 have attempted to achieve more balanced distribution of gains from trade but not enough to lead the Korean economy to a well-balanced welfare state. More specifically, we found the positive effects of international trade on inclusive growth driven by strong output growth effect, not by the effect on income distribution. Even though income distribution measured by Gini indices has been worsened after the East Asian financial crisis, we could not find significant evidence that Korea's rapid international trade growth has been responsible for the deteriorating income inequality.","[Kang, Moonsung; Park, Innwon; Rhee, Dong-Eun] Korea Univ, Div Int Studies, Seoul, South Korea",Korea University,"Kang, M (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Div Int Studies, Seoul, South Korea.",,"Park, Innwon/I-6310-2019","Park, Innwon/0000-0001-8567-7907; Rhee, Dong-Eun/0000-0003-1177-6368",,,,,31,7,7,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2017,40.0,11,,,SI,,2475,2490,,10.1111/twec.12556,0.0,,,16,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FM3UR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000414935100007,0

In this paper, we explore another plausible supply-side explanation for the growth of the industry, namely economies of diversification. We focus on the fact that credit unions differ among themselves in the range of financial services they offer to their members. Since larger credit unions tend to offer a more diversified financial service menu than credit unions of a smaller size, the incentive to grow in size may be fueled not only by present scale economies but also by economies of diversification. This paper provides the first robust estimates of such economies of diversification for the credit union sector. We estimate a flexible semiparametric smooth coefficient quantile panel data model with correlated effects that is capable of accommodating a four-way heterogeneity among credit unions. Our results indicate the presence of non-negligible economies of diversification in the industry. We find that as many as 27-91% (depending on the type and the cost quantile) of diversified credit unions enjoy substantial economies of diversification; the cost of most remaining credit unions is invariant to the scope of services. We also find overwhelming evidence of increasing returns to scale in the industry.","[Malikov, Emir] Auburn Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Zhao, Shunan; Kumbhakar, Subal C.] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, Lib Tower 909, Binghamton, NY 13901 USA; [Zhao, Shunan] Ctr Coll Danville, Dept Econ, Danville, KY USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton,"Kumbhakar, SC (通讯作者)，SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, Lib Tower 909, Binghamton, NY 13901 USA.",kkar@binghamton.edu,,"Zhao, Shunan/0000-0002-4700-9403",,,,,54,8,10,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0883-7252,1099-1255,,J APPL ECONOMET,J.

TIF areas are designated with the intent of spurring economic development characterized primarily by growth in assessed value and in employment within the TIF area. We examined property-level data from 2004 to 2013 and found that the average property in a TIF area may display higher assessed values than the average property in a similarly situated non-TIF area. While both TIF and non-TIF properties tended to grow over time, the average property in a TIF area may grow by slightly more than its non-TIF counterpart. We also found that TIF does not statistically significantly affect employment or employment growth over time. While there does not appear to be a multiplicative effect of the presence of enterprise zones and TIF on employment, TIF works with property tax abatements in incentivizing job creation. Our analysis of the effect of TIF on economic development outcomes informs policy makers of the likelihood that a given area will adopt TIF in the context of the but-for question.","[Yadavalli, Anita] Natl League Cities, City Fiscal Policy, 660 North Capitol St NW, Washington, DC 20001 USA; [Landers, Jim] Indiana Legislat Serv Agcy, Off Fiscal & Management Anal, Indianapolis, IN USA",,"Yadavalli, A (通讯作者)，Natl League Cities, 660 North Capitol St NW, Washington, DC 20001 USA.",yadavalli@nlc.org,"Landers, James R./AAM-5601-2021",,,,,,41,14,19,1,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

I then exploit the data and provide quantitative evidence on the existence of a causal impact of negative emotions on outstanding creativity, an association hypothesized across several disciplines since the antiquity that has not yet been convincingly established.","[Borowiecki, Karol Jan] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, Odense, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark,"Borowiecki, KJ (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, Odense, Denmark.",,"Borowiecki, Karol J./ABE-1387-2021","Borowiecki, Karol J./0000-0003-4959-181X","John O'Hagan at the Department of Economics, Trinity College Dublin","John O'Hagan at the Department of Economics, Trinity College Dublin","I thank Stephen Broadberry, Christian Danne, Meltem Daysal, Martin Dribe, Georgios Kavetsos, Mark McGovern, John O'Hagan, Andrew Oswald, James Pennebaker, Albrecht Ritschl, Max Schulze, Paul Sharp, Patrick Svensson, Patrick Theiner, Mircea Trandafir, Tamas Vonyo, Nikolaus Wolf, and participants at invited talks at Oxford University, London School of Economics, Lund University, University of Gothenburg, Humboldt University of Berlin, and Copenhagen Business School, and at the Sound Economic History Workshop (Copenhagen) and Workshop on Labor Markets in History (Odense) for helpful consultations and insightful comments.

In 1996, the Chilean government approved the extension of the school day from half-to full-day school. This article exploits the quasi-experimental nature of the reform's implementation by time, municipality, and age targeting of the program in order to examine how the maternal labor supply is affected by the childcare subsidy implicit in the lengthening of the school day. Using data from the Chilean socioeconomic household survey and administrative data from the Ministry of Education for 1990-2011, we estimate that, on average, there is a 5 percent increase in labor participation and employment rates of single mothers with eligible children (between 8 and 13 years old) with no younger children, who are the group that would be mainly affected by the policy. No significant labor supply responses are detected among others mothers with eligible children.","[Contreras, Dante] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Sepulveda, Paulina] MINEDUC, Kigali,, Rwanda; [Sepulveda, Paulina] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile; Universidad de Chile,"Contreras, D (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile.",dcontrer@fen.uchile.cl; pausepulv@gmail.com,,,Center for Advanced Research on Education; Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies [CONICYT/FONDAP/15130009],Center for Advanced Research on Education; Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies,"The authors acknowledge the funding provided by Center for Advanced Research on Education and the grant by Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies (CONICYT/FONDAP/15130009).

If initially low sanctions are increased but do not prevent a certain overall level of doping, then the payoff for all athletes is reduced, which, in turn, reduces their willingness to participate in the competition.","[Hirschmann, David] Univ Vienna, Oskar Morgenstern Pl1, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Hirschmann, D (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, Oskar Morgenstern Pl1, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",david.hirschmann@univie.ac.at,,,,,,,21,7,7,2,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1971) influential social contract approach to distributive justice, the fair income distribution is the one that an individual would choose behind a veil of ignorance. Harsanyi (J Polit Econ 61:434-435, 1953, J Polit Econ 63:309-332, 1955, Am Polit Sci Rev 69:594-606, 1975) treated this situation as a decision under risk and arrived at utilitarianism using expected utility theory. This paper investigates the implications of applying cumulative prospect theory instead, which better describes behavior under risk. I find that the specific type of inequality in bottom-heavy right-skewed income distributions, which includes the log-normal income distribution, could be perceived as desirable.

Overall, the response from the stock market is neutral. However, detailed analysis reveals that the market reacts differently to property subsidiary sell-off announcements by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and non-SOEs. Consistent with findings from extant literature, we find statistically positive market returns associated with non-SOE sell-off announcements. However, we find statistically negative market returns associated with SOE sell-off announcements. We suggest that this divergent market reaction is influenced by the institutional feature of the Chinese market and is consistent with the high agency costs associated with state ownership.","[Xu, Ruoran] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Secur & Futures, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Chow, Yuen Leng; Ooi, Joseph T.

The decisive attributes considered are average travel time, travel time reliability, cost and in-vehicle crowding. Five model specifications are defined for the parameter estimations. Significant interaction effects between in-vehicle crowding and travel time are found. Time multipliers are defined to represent the effects of in-vehicle crowding. In contrast, no-evidence could be established for the interaction between in-vehicle crowding and travel time reliability. Results of the mode-specific valuations of travel time reliability and in vehicle crowding, vary remarkably across the four different transport modes. In the mode specific models, the range of time multipliers is estimated to be [1.44, 2.00]. Besides, demand estimates would be biased when the mode-specific willingness to pay (WTP) is ignored. For instance, the mode share of metro will be underestimated when its reliability level is high, and vice versa. This suggests that mode-specific WTP of travel time reliability and in-vehicle crowding should be considered in the demand estimations and in the earlier stage of public transport project appraisal.

A survey was conducted in Nanjing in order to assess the characteristics and attitudes of electric bicycle users and other mode users (e.g. pedestrians; car drivers). Based on over 1000 responses a Logit Model was used to analyse current and future mode choice. The results show that electric bicycles are not necessarily displacing cars on a substantial scale, but are rather displacing the 'benign' modes of walking, traditional bicycling, and using the bus. We conclude that electric bicycles are helping to enable mobility-dependent lifestyles that may in the future be supported by cars, rather than offering a true departure from carbon-centred, motorized forms of transport.

In this context, we revisit the question of expenditure convergence across the American states to provide more nuanced evidence than found by a small number of previous studies. We employ a methodology due to Smeekes (Bootstrap sequential tests to determine the stationary units in a panel, 2011) that sequentially tests for unit roots in pairwise (real per capita) expenditure gaps based on user specified fractions. In a panel of 48 combined state-local government units (1957-2008), we found that expenditures on highways, sanitation, utility, and education were far more convergent than expenditures on health and hospitals, police and fire protection, and public welfare. There was little evidence of club convergence based on the proportion of intraregional convergent pairs. Several historically high-grant receiving states showed relatively strong evidence of convergence. Our results bode well for future output convergence and opportunities for Tiebout-type migration across jurisdictions. They also imply a diminished role for public infrastructure and education spending in business location choices over time and a mixed role for federal grants in inducing convergence.","[Mahdavi, Saeid] Univ Texas San Antonio, One UTSA Circle, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA; [Westerlund, Joakim] Lund Univ, POB 7082, S-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Westerlund, Joakim] Deakin Univ, Deakin Business Sch, Ctr Financial Econometr, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia",University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA); Lund University; Deakin University,"Westerlund, J (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, POB 7082, S-22007 Lund, Sweden.;Westerlund, J (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Deakin Business Sch, Ctr Financial Econometr, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",joakim.westerlund@nek.lu.se,,,,,,,66,3,4,0,5,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

These scares, together with environmental and ethical concerns, caused consumers to reflect upon the quality of the beef they eat. The aim of this paper is to identify which quality characteristics influence the incidence of local beef consumption on the total consumption of beef. It is assumed in this study that such choice is a response to a process of quality evaluation, which occurs combining specific quality attributes and socially constructed food quality criteria strictly linked to a socially fair dimension of local productions. Consumers who habitually purchase local beef at the butcher shops were the focus of our empirical strategy. Data were collected by administering a face-to-face questionnaire to 160 consumers in Sicily (Southern Italy), right after their purchases at the butcher shops. The results of this study suggest some implications in defining locally produced beef quality, making more accurate strategies possible when supporting the spread of production and consumption of beef at the local level.","[Migliore, Giuseppina; Borsellino, Valeria; Schifani, Giorgio; Di Gesaro, Mariarosa; Schimmenti, Emanuele] Univ Palermo, Dept Agr Food & Forest Sci, Palermo, Italy",University of Palermo,"Migliore, G (通讯作者)，Univ Palermo, Dept Agr Food & Forest Sci, Palermo, Italy.",giuseppina.migliore@unipa.it,"Borsellino, Valeria/M-1482-2015; Schifani, Giorgio/AIF-4239-2022; Migliore, Giuseppina/H-6334-2019; Schimmenti, Emanuele/L-8917-2015","Borsellino, Valeria/0000-0002-6570-2156; Schifani, Giorgio/0000-0003-1055-929X; Migliore, Giuseppina/0000-0002-1889-0625; Schimmenti, Emanuele/0000-0001-7376-7606",,,,,41,6,6,0,5,Bologna Univ Press,Bologna,"Via Saragozza 10, Bologna, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,SEP,2017,16.0,3,,,,,39,46,,,,,,8,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,FN8SR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416296300005,0

Although the concept of reputation has received extensive treatment in international relations, NGO reputation has received less attention. Yet reputations are critical to the construction of NGO authority and to patterns of collaboration. We develop a framework for studying NGO reputation. We then provide empirical evidence on the construction of a particular dimension of NGO reputation, that of organizational effectiveness from the perspective of NGO peers. Based on a mixed-method, in-depth interview study of transnational NGO leaders, we identify specific factors associated with NGOs' effectiveness reputations among their peers. Larger, older, more highly visible organizations, organizations adopting hybrid strategies, and organizations headquartered outside of Washington, DC enjoy higher reputations for organizational effectiveness. Our analysis provides context for understanding the influence of transnational NGOs in world affairs and offers insight into the role of reputation in global politics more generally.","[Mitchell, George E.] CUNY, Colin Powell Sch, 130 Convent Ave,NAC 4-135, New York, NY 10031 USA; [Stroup, Sarah S.] Middlebury Coll, Munroe Hall 213, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Mitchell, GE (通讯作者)，CUNY, Colin Powell Sch, 130 Convent Ave,NAC 4-135, New York, NY 10031 USA.",gmitchell@ccny.cuny.edu; sstroup@middlebury.edu,"Mitchell, George/AFK-8198-2022","Mitchell, George/0000-0001-9420-6138",Middlebury College; National Science Foundation [SES-0527679]; Transnational NGO Initiative at the Moynihan Institute of Global Affairs at Syracuse University,Middlebury College; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Transnational NGO Initiative at the Moynihan Institute of Global Affairs at Syracuse University,"This research was supported by Middlebury College, the National Science Foundation Grant No. SES-0527679 (Agents of Change: Transnational NGOs as Agents of Change: Toward Understanding Their Governance, Leadership, and Effectiveness), and the Transnational NGO Initiative at the Moynihan Institute of Global Affairs at Syracuse University.",,95,18,23,2,48,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

Investors have a significant role in establishing services and supporting continuance in local tourism networks. As important as investors are, many of them overlook relationships they may find abundant but not meaningful. Many investors shift relationships when meaningful ideas or other outcomes no longer feed into the relationship. Relationships could thus be seen as gradual processes in which meaningful exchanges cement the relationships together. At the entry stage, investors select partners they trust or focus on identifying a specific style characterized by partner-related criteria. These expectations typically depend on the motives or reasons investors enter relationships. We suggest that investors' relationships develop from motives toward defined selection criteria as the basis for a continued exchange defined by their reciprocal orientation. Thus, a theoretical model is presented with constructs such as hard and soft motives, trust and network awareness, partner selection criteria, and reciprocal orientations. We hope these findings may illustrate how policymakers in Tanzania can support investor relationships and nurture them toward a long-term exchange.","[Mlozi, Shogo] Open Univ Tanzania, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Pesamaa, Ossi] Lulea Univ Technol, Lulea, Sweden",Lulea University of Technology,"Mlozi, S (通讯作者)，Open Univ Tanzania, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Dept Tourism & Hospitality Management, POB 23409, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania.",shogo.mlozi@out.ac.tz,,,,,,,55,1,1,0,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

This long cycle length, however, often causes excessive delay at some minor intersections where the traffic volume is low on cross streets. This paper describes optimization models developed to enable uneven double cycling (UDC) in arterial signal coordination to address this issue. The control scheme adopts UDC at some of the minor intersections where a background cycle has two sub cycles of different lengths. Two multi-objective UDC models are developed. The basic UDC model maximizes constant two-way bandwidths and minimizes average delay of through traffic on cross streets at UDC intersections. This model is then improved by maximizing variable bandwidth and considering pedestrian needs. The resultant models are a mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem. Results of numerical experiments and case study simulations indicate that the UDC control scheme can greatly reduce delay at UDC intersections without affecting progression quality of arterial through traffic. Preliminary guidelines are also provided for UDC implementation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, historical performance-based combination approaches do not select forecasters that improve upon the simple average going forward. This paper shows that this is due to the high correlation among forecasters, which only by chance causes some individuals to have lower root-mean-squared error (RMSE) than the simple average. We introduce a new nonparametric approach to eliminate forecasters who perform well based on chance as well as poor performers. This leaves a subset of forecasters with better performance in subsequent periods. The average of this group improves upon the simple average in the SPF particularly for bond yields where some forecasters may be more likely to have superior forecasting ability.","[Burgi, Constantin; Sinclair, Tara M.] George Washington Univ, 2115 G St NW,340, Washington, DC 20052 USA",George Washington University,"Sinclair, TM (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, 2115 G St NW,340, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",cburgi@gwu.edu; tsinc@gwu.edu,"Sinclair, Tara M/I-2772-2019; Bürgi, Constantin/ABC-3857-2020","Sinclair, Tara M/0000-0002-1990-3264; Burgi, Constantin Rudolf Salomo/0000-0003-0323-4286",,,,,26,8,9,0,1,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Using a dynamic vector error correction model, and catering for dynamism, the results show that tourism FDI has indeed contributed to fostering economic growth; albeit the magnitude of the coefficient being relatively smaller than FDI in the non-tourism sector. A plausible explanation for such a finding may reside in the fact that the bulk of FDI flows in the non-tourism sectors while domestic investment predominates in the tourism sector in Mauritius. The findings also demonstrate a positive relationship between tourism development and economic growth, thus supporting the tourism-led growth hypothesis.","[Fauzel, Sheereen; Seetanah, Boopen; Sannassee, R.

Financial traders coordinate on similar behavior, but have heterogeneous price expectations and are influenced by friends. According to a popular belief, they are prone to herding. However, in laboratory experiments subjects use contrarian strategies. Theoretical literature on learning in networks is scarce and cannot explain this conundrum (Panchenko et al. in J Econ Dyn Control 37(12):2623-2642, 2013). The paper follows Anufriev et al. (CeNDEF Working paper 15-07, 2015) and investigates an agent-based model, in which agents forecast price with a simple general heuristic: adaptive and trend extrapolation expectations, with an additional term of (dis-)trust towards their friends' mood. Agents independently use Genetic Algorithms to optimize the parameters of the heuristic. The paper considers friendship networks of symmetric (regular lattice, fully connected) and asymmetric architecture (random, rewired, star). The main finding is that the agents learn contrarian strategies, which amplifies market turn-overs and hence price oscillations. Nevertheless, agents learn similar behavior and their forecasts remain well coordinated. The model therefore offers a natural interpretation for the difference between the experimental stylized facts and market surveys.","[Makarewicz, Tomasz] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Makarewicz, T (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",T.A.Makarewicz@uva.nl,,,NWO (Dutch Science Foundation) [40611142]; EUFP7 Project Integrated Macro-Financial Modeling for Robust Policy Design (MACFINROBODS) [612796],NWO (Dutch Science Foundation)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); EUFP7 Project Integrated Macro-Financial Modeling for Robust Policy Design (MACFINROBODS),"The author is indebted for a stimulating discussion to participants of conference on Computing in Economics and Finance 2014, Oslo.

Furthermore, it can differentiate between upside and downside uncertainty, which could be relevant for addressing a variety of economic questions. The index is particularly useful since it can be constructed for any country/variable for which point forecasts and realizations are available.

We find evidence that the three types of commonality in liquidity represent significant risk factors for REIT returns but only during bad market conditions. We also find that using a linear approach, rather than a conditional, would have underestimated the role of commonality in liquidity risk. This could explain (at least partly) the small impact of commonality on asset prices documented in the extant literature.

Incorporating them reconciles the optimal-tax and the regulatory-pricing views on Ramsey tax/pricing rules.","[Cremer, Helmuth] Univ Toulouse Capitole, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Gahvari, Firouz] Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Cremer, H (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse Capitole, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.",helmuth.cremer@tse-fr.eu,,,,,,,32,1,1,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUN,2017,49.0,1,,,,,11,35,,10.1007/s00355-017-1046-8,0.0,,,25,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,EW4GU,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402460800002,0

The mediating effects from car ownership and travel distance, as an important piece, are not sufficiently investigated. To fill this gap, in this study the relationships among travel mode choice, car ownership and travel distance were described using a framework of integrated structural equation model (SEM) and discrete choice model (DCM). Drawing on a rich dataset of National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) and numerous built environment measurements in Baltimore metropolitan area, this research applied the integrated SEM and DCM approach to investigate how the built environment affects travel mode choice through influencing car ownership and travel distance. Therefore, the direct and indirect effects of built environment on travel mode choice were revealed. This study hopes to give transportation planners a better understanding on how the built environment influences travel mode choice, and consequently develop effective and targeted countermeasures to reduce car use.

However, relatively little is known about the income sensitivity of demand for credit in this market. This paper provides a causal estimate of the effect of tax rebates on the demand for small-dollar credit, using a unique proprietary loan-level dataset. Identification relies on variation in state Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) generosity for areas within the same commuting zones that span state borders. The results show that a $100 increase in EITC benefits leads to an 8.3% reduction in the number of loan applications and a 6.6% reduction in the number of borrowers. This could translate into sizable reductions in loan volume and savings in financial charges. More broadly, the results suggest that public programs with income benefits could help recipients with consumption smoothing in the presence of credit market frictions.","[Cui, Can] 2225 Speedway,Stop C3100, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,"Cui, C (通讯作者)，2225 Speedway,Stop C3100, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",cuican@utexas.edu,,,,,,,29,2,3,0,5,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Based on two unique loan-level data sets with borrower credit profiles, this study reports novel empirical evidence on how homeowners manage their credit before and after receiving modifications. The paper has several main findings. First, loan modifications improve borrowers' overall credit standing and access to credit. Modifications that provide principal reduction, rate reduction, or greater payment relief, as well as those received by borrowers not in financial catastrophe, lead to a larger improvement in borrowers' credit rating than others. Second, loan modifications lead to a slight increase in borrowers' debts, primarily on home equity line of credit accounts and auto loans. Third, borrowers' performance on nonmortgage accounts, however, has not been negatively impacted by modifications. This study demonstrates that interventions designed to improve household balance sheets could have a direct and sizeable impact on borrower financial outcomes.","[Ding, Lei] Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Ten Independence Mall, Philadelphia, PA 19106 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Philadelphia,"Ding, L (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Ten Independence Mall, Philadelphia, PA 19106 USA.",lei.ding@phil.frb.org,,,,,,,26,2,3,1,9,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The algorithms analyzed include Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb and Shanno (BFGS), Gauss-Jordan, Simplex, Genetic, sequential quadratic programming and extensive grid-search. The simulation results indicate that the derivative free methods, such as Genetic and Simplex, have advantages over hill climbing methods, such as BFGS and Gauss-Jordan, in obtaining accurate critical values for the Leybourne et al. (J Time Ser Anal 19:83-97, 1998) (LNV) and Sollis (J Time Ser Anal 25:409-417, 2004) unit root tests. Besides, we extend our analysis by including exponential smooth transition type of trend function in to unit root testing which is not used in the previous literature. The same result also holds true for our newly proposed unit root test with exponential smooth transition function type of trend model. Furthermore, we realize that there is a gap in the unit root studies that the newly proposed tests are not analyzed between each other's data generating process (DGP). Hence, we investigate the power comparison of different nonlinear unit root test under various DGP including nonlinear unit root tests and find interesting results such as LNV type unit root test can manage to capture state dependent nonlinearity when the transition speed is high. Finally, we have used the Australian real interest rate parity hypothesis to empirically verify the results that we have obtained in the simulation studies.","[Omay, Tolga] Turk Hava Kurumu Univ THK, Dept Management, Ankara, Turkey; [Emirmahmutoglu, Furkan] Gazi Univ, Dept Econometr, TR-06500 Ankara, Turkey",Turkish Aeronautical Association; Gazi University,"Omay, T (通讯作者)，Turk Hava Kurumu Univ THK, Dept Management, Ankara, Turkey.",tomay@thk.edu.tr; furkan@gazi.edu.tr,"Emirmahmutoglu, Furkan/B-2267-2019","Emirmahmutoglu, Furkan/0000-0001-7358-3567",,,,,28,16,16,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Key findings are that services trade costs as reflected in the services trade restrictiveness index and bilateral investment treaty membership are the most important policy drivers of the activity of German-owned multinational firms in both goods and services. An increase in services trade restrictions raises goods activity at the expense of services activity.

However, neither of these claims appears to reflect current car buying behaviour in the UK. We hypothesised this may be due to the nature of the questions typically used in earlier research, which may have prompted participants to consider environmental issues, and downplay the role of image, more than they would spontaneously. The current research provides a qualitative exploration of factors important to people when deciding which car to buy. Open-ended discussion with recent car-buyers revealed the factors which were most important during the participants' decision making processes, without prompting participants to agree with ideas raised by the experimenter. These issues were explored in two studies, using a series of focus groups (Study 1), and one-on-one interviews (Study 2). In both studies, the two most central factors were issues of practicality and finance, consistent with previous research. However, unlike in previous research, both studies found image had substantial impact on purchasing decisions. Further, earlier explicit surveys claimed people often considered environmental factors when choosing a vehicle, yet these were hardly mentioned in the current studies. This highlights the importance of using a range of research methods when studying personal travel decisions. Key areas for follow-up research and implications for policy makers aiming to increase uptake sales of low-carbon cars are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The optimal route packaging takes into account the perspectives of all stakeholders in a bus transit system-the commuters, operators and the regulator. The problem is formulated as a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem. To solve the formulated MINLP, we transform it into a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) by using linearization techniques so that global optimality of the solution could be guaranteed. A numerical study is then performed on a real life transit network to evaluate the model validity. The proposed methodology provides a comprehensive decision making framework for the regulator contemplating to contract out bus transit route packages through CT so as to achieve the objectives of encouraging competition, ensuring the attractiveness of the bus transit market to contesting operators and meeting commuters' expected service levels.

Using data on the 7th European Parliament (2009-14), we analyze the relationship between the outside earnings of its Members (MEPs) and their parliamentary activities. The supranational nature of the European Parliament thereby allows a novel analysis of ` moonlighting' free of countryspecific bias. We find outside earnings to be negatively correlated with the particularly workintensive production of draft reports and opinions. Utilizing the considerable freedom of Member States in organizing elections, we find this relationship to be dependent on the electoral system under which MEPs are elected. While the effect of the trade-off between outside and parliamentary work is predominantly negative in all other systems, outside earnings of MEPs from centralized but candidate-focused systems correlate positively with their productivity, indicating a possible benefit from selection effects.","[Staat, Christian] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium; [Kuehnhanss, Colin R.] Vrije Univ Brussel, Brussels, Belgium",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Kuehnhanss, CR (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Appl Econ, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",ckuehnha@vub.ac.be,,"Kuehnhanss, Colin R./0000-0002-3840-5674",Research Foundation Flanders (FWO),Research Foundation Flanders (FWO)(FWO),"The authors would like to thank the editor and four anonymous referees for their constructive comments and suggestions.

This study examines whether the available data could have helped to predict or identify the crisis in real time. After assessing the accuracy of previous recession forecasts, we examine that of forecasts published from April to December 2008 by twelve major national and international forecast institutions and confront them with real-time data from official statistics, major surveys, and indicators. While annual forecasts for 2008 were unusually accurate due to errors of semi-annual forecasts offsetting each other, forecasters failed to observe the onset of the recession in Q2 2008, although from May onward an increasing amount of data indicated that the economy was in recession or was likely about to enter one. Though the data were neither ambiguous nor misleading, forecasters recognised the onset of the recession as late as mid-November, but also failed to warn of a coming recession. The most convincing explanations for these failures to recognize the crisis in time appear to have been the 'truth effect' and forecasters' 'low priors about the likelihood of a recession'.","[Heilemann, Ullrich] Univ Leipzig, Inst Empir Wirtschaftsforsch, Grimma Str 14, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany; [Heilemann, Ullrich] Fraunhofer MOEZ, Neumarkt 9-19, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany; [Schnorr-Baecker, Susanne] Stat Bundesamt, D-65180 Wiesbaden, Germany",Leipzig University,"Heilemann, U (通讯作者)，Univ Leipzig, Inst Empir Wirtschaftsforsch, Grimma Str 14, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany.;Heilemann, U (通讯作者)，Fraunhofer MOEZ, Neumarkt 9-19, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany.",heilemann@wifa.uni-leipzig.de; susanne.schnorr-baecker@destatis.de,,,,,,,61,2,2,0,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

While there are associated health benefits to this potential shift, there are also higher risks for elderly pedestrian injuries, especially at street crossings. This naturalistic study compares street crossing behaviors of different population age groups in large Quebec cities through observational data, situational characteristics and environmental characteristics of location. We assess if observed crossings could be completed safely within the allocated time. Street crossing observations on 2073 pedestrians was gathered at 135 signalized crossings during a four-month period in the summer of 2013. Mixed effect logit models are used to assess the individual, contextual, behavioral and environmental correlates of street crossing ending. Differences in age groups and other correlates are assessed for their association with the type of street crossing ending (on red light, on red hand or on both). In multivariate models, older age did not have an impact on finishing crossing on time, but many factors associated with older age were: having a walking aid, hesitating, and slowing down mid-crossing. Longer white man silhouette timing was also associated with reduced odds ratio of failing to finish crossing on time. The presence of cycling infrastructure increased those odds. Without walking, many elders will experience decreasing level of access. In neighborhoods with high concentrations of elderly populations, providing shorten crossing distance or longer crossing timing, may increase the convenience of walking for elderly populations. Longer signal timing may also be warranted in locations where cycling infrastructures were added to account for the increased level of difficulty. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Three case studies are examined: the US Financial Stability Oversight Council, the European Systemic Risk Board and the UK's Financial Policy Committee. Policy-makers' motivations are captured by examining the specific institutional features of the newly created SRAs and by tracing the legislative debates that surrounded their creation. The findings of this empirical analysis call into question several of the conventional claims that are used to justify delegation to technocratic agencies from the functionalist and ideational scholarship. Given the limitations of the explanations based on efficiency considerations and socialisation of welfare losses, this paper suggests that the delegation of powers to SRAs was ultimately motivated by what is referred to as the logic of symbolic politics.' It is argued that the main motivation that emerges from the legislative debates for delegating this important task is that the SRAs provided a quick institutional fix' to signal to the public that in the wake of the international crisis of 2007-2009, policy-makers were redressing regulatory mistakes made prior to and during the crisis that had caused a severe deterioration of public's wealth.","[Lombardi, Domenico] Ctr Int Governance Innovat, Execut Management Comm, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Moschella, Manuela] Ctr Int Governance Innovat, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Moschella, Manuela] Scuola Normale Super, Int Polit Econ, Florence, Italy",Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa,"Lombardi, D (通讯作者)，Ctr Int Governance Innovat, Execut Management Comm, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",dlombardi@cigionline.org,,,,,,,78,28,30,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Applying the index to situations with barriers to trade yields biased results compared to a true import price index. To circumvent this problem, it is common to use average prices, such as unit values, as an aggregator function. However, the use of average prices is not rooted in economic theory. In this paper, I generalise the economic import price index to allow for barriers to trade in the form of quantity constraints. To illustrate the theoretical framework, I use the case of imports of textiles to Norway from 1988 to 1997. I find that a standard economic import price index, such as the Laspeyres index, grossly overstates import costs and that this bias is significantly reduced by using unit values.","[von Brasch, Thomas] Stat Norway, Res Dept, Unit Macroecon, N-0033 Oslo, Norway; [von Brasch, Thomas] NUPI, Dept Int Econ, N-0033 Oslo, Norway",Statistics Norway,"von Brasch, T (通讯作者)，Stat Norway, Res Dept, Unit Macroecon, N-0033 Oslo, Norway.;von Brasch, T (通讯作者)，NUPI, Dept Int Econ, N-0033 Oslo, Norway.",vonbrasch@gmail.com,,,,,,,26,1,1,0,6,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Achieving local fiscal optimality in the municipalities of FYROM and especially in the municipality of Tetovo even today remains one of the most important challenges in fiscal and institutional management of the local governments. The harmonization of financial revenues and expenditures in the municipality of Tetovo and also in the other municipalities in FYROM remains one of the crucial issues in the processes of local government, due to the fact that FYROM is still a country in transition and has a very low rate of economic development and the high level of financial centralization prevents local sustainable development. This is the reason why most of the municipalities fail to meet even the basic needs of its citizens because they lack financial resources to meet many of the requirements for capital investments, investments in education, culture, sports, etc. This big imbalance between revenues and expenditures of local governments makes it impossible to achieve fiscal optimality point at which financial revenues would cover the expenditure. Through our econometrical model we conclude that the revenues from VAT (Value Added Tax) which the municipalities receive in return from the total VAT revenue that is collected is only 4%, and it is at a very low level and increasing the VAT revenue return from 4% to 11.45%, will result with optimal level of revenues to cover the actual expenditures of local governments. This result can be useful for both central and local governments not only in FYROM but also in the region as a model for redefining the methodology of distribution of incomes and taking more steps toward fiscal decentralization.","[Arifi, Avni] South East European Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Ilindenska 35, Tetovo 1200, Macedonia; [Ganiu, Benizar] South East European Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Finance & Accounting, Ilindenska 35, Tetovo 1200, Macedonia",,"Arifi, A (通讯作者)，South East European Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Ilindenska 35, Tetovo 1200, Macedonia.",a.arifi@seeu.edu.mk; ba09304@seeu.edu.mk,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,1,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2017,,,,,,,42,58,,10.18502/kss.v1i2.646,0.0,,,17,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BJ1DU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417433200004,0

It helps us to understand the nature of the relationship between Buchanan and Tiebout. Usually, it is claimed that Buchanan modelled Tiebout's insights, that there exists a Buchanan-Tiebout hypothesis, and that Buchanan in 1965 complemented what Tiebout had written in 1956. We show that Buchanan could not have written An Economic Theory of Clubs as a complement of A Pure Theory of Local Public Expenditures. He disagreed with Tiebout's ideas on mobility because he saw mobility as a cause of inefficiencies and not a cause of homogeneity in groups. This is what we show by putting Buchanan's comment on Tiebout into historical perspective. It appears that Buchanan interpreted Tiebout 1956 from the perspective of his works on fiscal federalism from the early 1950s. We show that there is a continuity between Buchanan's work from the early 1950s and his works in the early 1970s; and Buchanan's way of reading Tiebout is part of it. Hence, when he wrote An Economic Theory of Clubs, Buchanan was convinced that Tiebout was wrong and that he was offering an alternative framework for public economics.","[Boettke, Peter J.] George Mason Univ, Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Marciano, Alain] Univ Montpellier, Econ, Ave Mer, F-34960 Montpellier, France",George Mason University; Universite de Montpellier,"Boettke, PJ (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",pboettke@gmu.edu; alain.marciano@umontpellier.fr,,,,,,,72,12,13,6,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

After periods of exclusion, they both also faced strong pressures to adapt to changes in the modern world, both internal and external, and to reduce status differentiation within the hierarchy and between the clergy/apparatchiki hierarchy and the laity/population. The present article compares and contrasts de-Stalinization under Khrushchev (1956-1964) with the results of Vatican II (1959-1965), and Gorbachev's reforms (1985-1991) with the efforts of Pope Francis to reform the RCC (2013-present). The comparisons validate the explanatory power of the noted similarities between these sacred institutions, while also highlighting significant differences in structure, mission, and process, which explain why Pope Francis has adopted an incremental strategy for reform of the RCC, in contrast to Gorbachev's revolutionary strategy for reforming the CPSU.","[Breslauer, George W.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Polit Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Breslauer, GW (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Polit Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",bresl@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,47,6,6,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

Theoretical framework of the research consists of the theoretical insights of Paul Thomson (2000) and Alessandro Portelli (1991) that the oral history provides an opportunity to extend and even change the content of the history aimed at making it democratic and more personal. The publication is executed as a thematically descriptive account of qualitative analysis of content of the press articles and interviews. In the course of its elaboration the author concluded that the analyzed narratives, indirectly confirming the historical developments of the Third Awakening, inform about the participants of the process of historical studies in the new higher education institution in Latgale region, while themes of the press publications allows tracing down the awareness of society about the foundation of the higher education institution and the beginning of its operation. The results of the research prove that the community spirit and the emotional uplift, typical of society during the final stage of awakening is present in the individual experience of the readers and graduates, who were the participants of the initial stage of historical studies in the Rezekne Higher Education Institution, both as a context and stimulus for a purposeful cooperation and interaction.","[Caksa, Valda] Rezeknes Tehnologiju Akad, Rezekne, Latvia",,"Caksa, V (通讯作者)，Rezeknes Tehnologiju Akad, Rezekne, Latvia.",,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,0,REZEKNE HIGHER EDUC INST-REZEKNES AUGSTSKOLA,REZEKNE,"LIBERATION ALLEY 90, REZEKNE, SL-4600, LATVIA",1691-5887,,,SABIED INTEGR IZGL,,,2017,,,,,,,27,38,,10.17770/sie2017vol4.2271,0.0,,,12,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary; Economics; Public Administration",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BP8NT,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000566189200002,0

It argues that the successes and failures of GMO agriculture have been partly circumscribed by the structural requirements of the capitalist system, as well as by the materiality of GMO crops themselves. Successful innovations have been able to mitigate the material barriers to accumulation found in agricultural production, and thus appeal directly to farmers as comparatively profitable capital inputs. In this way, they cohere with David Goodman's notion of appropriationism, where manufactured capital inputs (such as pesticides, machinery and fertilisers) replace 'natural' inputs (such as manure or draft animals), reducing labour time and biological contingency, and thus creating a competitive advantage for those farmers who adopt the new technology (at least temporarily). Conversely, innovations that are geared at consumers rather than farmers have largely failed due to their status as value-added products (whose value is subjective and market-driven) rather than capital goods. The article uses contrasting case studies of herbicide-tolerant soybeans, beta-keratin-enhanced rice and slow-ripening tomatoes to demonstrate how and why the structural imperatives of global capitalism have enabled the success of some, and the failure of other innovations.","[Carroll, Myles] Univ Victoria, Sch Environm Studies, Victoria, BC, Canada",University of Victoria,"Carroll, M (通讯作者)，Univ Victoria, Sch Environm Studies, Victoria, BC, Canada.",mylesc@uvic.ca,,,University of Victoria; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,University of Victoria; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This project received funding from the University of Victoria and from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.,,44,6,6,0,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Monetary policy operations are carried out by the central bank through the management of the Singapore dollar against a currency basket. As is well recognised, such foreign exchange interventions do have an impact on domestic liquidity conditions. However, in the case of Singapore, this tends to be counteracted by the liquidity impact of public sector operations related to the fiscal position and the national pension scheme. The central bank takes into account the net liquidity impact of these and other autonomous money market factors as well as banks' demand for funds when performing money market operations to regulate the amount of domestic liquidity in the financial system. We conclude with an explanation of the negligible liquidity impact of currency in circulation as reflecting Singapore's gradual transformation towards a cashless society.","[Chow, Hwee Kwan] Singapore Management Univ, Econ & Stat Practice, Singapore, Singapore",Singapore Management University,"Chow, HK (通讯作者)，Singapore Management Univ, Econ & Stat Practice, Singapore, Singapore.",hkchow@smu.edu.sg,"CHOW, Hwee Kwan/D-1423-2009","Chow, Hwee Kwan/0000-0002-4520-9102",,,,,15,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0921-8580,2197-1889,978-3-319-59846-8; 978-3-319-59845-1,FINAN MON P,,,2017,44.0,,,,,,65,76,,10.1007/978-3-319-59846-8_5,0.0,,,12,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL1NM,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447914500005,0

A seemingly natural solution to this problem is to instrument for gasoline prices using gasoline taxes, but this approach tends to yield implausibly large price elasticities. We demonstrate that anticipatory behavior provides an important explanation for this result. Gasoline buyers increase purchases before tax increases and delay purchases before tax decreases, rendering the tax instrument endogenous. Including suitable leads and lags in the regression restores the validity of the IV estimator, resulting in much lower elasticity estimates.

It considers why is corporate social responsibility a competitive advantage in a contemporary global market therefore a process that can easily stand out in stakeholder's mind. Furthermore, paper examines how and why are employee engagement programs important part of the overall corporate social responsibility. The author analyses cases of successful organizations that have been selected as a best employers in Croatia. Through comparative analysis of different cases and by giving examples of the CSR best employer approaches, this paper is awakening the idea of integrating, more intensively, public relations activities within the corporate social responsibility programs. The paper is questioning the criteria and standards for best employer awards and how employer branding can be used for improving organizational reputation. Moreover, the author analyses tools and techniques which can be implemented in CSR programs that are aimed for employees. The paper also gives a media perspective on CSR. It observes publicity as strategic outcome of CSR. The author illustrates how publicity and media relations are associated with corporate social responsibility programs and employer branding. The concept of CSR is associated, as well as supported, with the public relations and marketing professions which are inevitably intertwined in their activities.

The introduction of volumetric water pricing at the group level, to replace area-based pricing, induces institutional change to prevent each member's overuse of water when the volumetric price levels are moderate. Depending on the initial conditions, the multiple pathways of change lead to new institutional arrangements, with all of them contributing to water savings. However, when the price is set high enough, many farmers exit a WUG for private irrigation. This tendency is associated with an increased probability that the remaining members do not undertake institutional change and that they do not end up saving water. This may be due to the increased management difficulties among the remaining members whose fields are separated by former members who have now opted out for private irrigation across the WUG. As a result, we do not find evidence that the reservoir water is saved at high volumetric price levels.","[Kajisa, Kei] Aoyama Gakuin Univ, 4-4-25 Shibuya, Tokyo 1508366, Japan; [Dong, Bin] Wuhan Univ, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China",Aoyama Gakuin University; Wuhan University,"Kajisa, K (通讯作者)，Aoyama Gakuin Univ, 4-4-25 Shibuya, Tokyo 1508366, Japan.",k.kajisa@sipeb.aoyama.ac.jp; dongbin@whu.edu.cn,,"Kajisa, Kei/0000-0002-9062-7303","Foundation for Advanced Studies on International Development (FASID), Tokyo, Japan; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16H02733] Funding Source: KAKEN","Foundation for Advanced Studies on International Development (FASID), Tokyo, Japan; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The first author was a senior scientist at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) when this research project was conducted.

Much of the existing analysis of financial sanctions cites as evidence of their success the case of the US Treasury's 2005 accusations against Macao's Banco Delta Asia of facilitating North Korean money laundering. We argue, however, that analysis of the broader impact of financial sanctions on North Korea's principle bilateral economic relationship, namely the Sino-North Korean border economy, reveals that such measures have merely served to increase the scope of evasive economic activity. In particular, financial sanctions have meant that methods of trade settlement in the border economy are based primarily on cash and barter, with minimal recourse to the official banking system. This raises questions not only regarding the effectiveness of financial sanctions but also the degree to which they serve to provoke counter-responses that actively undermine the broader objectives pursued by sender states. Through examining the case of Sino-North Korean border economy, this article contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the shortcomings of financial sanctions as a tool of foreign policy.","[Lee, Jong-Woon] Far East Univ, Fac Liberal Arts, Eumseong Gun, South Korea; [Gray, Kevin] Univ Sussex, Dept Int Relat, Brighton, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Lee, JW (通讯作者)，Far East Univ, Fac Liberal Arts, Eumseong Gun, South Korea.",,"Gray, Kevin/IWL-9326-2023","Gray, Kevin/0000-0002-8456-8562; Lee, Jong-Woon/0000-0002-9640-0281",Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2016S1A5A8020098],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea [grant number NRF-2016S1A5A8020098].,,55,17,19,2,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

How do different carbon tax rates affect emission reduction and economic growth? Whether tax refund can reduce the negative influence of the carbon tax on economic growth? In this paper, a computable general equilibrium model (CGE) is applied to study different scenarios: combine different carbon tax rates with tax refund. The results show that it is feasible to achieve the goal of reducing the high carbon energy consumption by levying the carbon tax.","[Liang, Wei; Yang, Ming] Univ Jinan, Business Sch, Jinan 250002, Shandong, Peoples R China",University of Jinan,"Liang, W (通讯作者)，Univ Jinan, Business Sch, Jinan 250002, Shandong, Peoples R China.",sm_liangw@ujn.edu.cn; 839529439@qq.com,,,"MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Youth Foundation of Humanities and Social Sciences [14YJCZH087, 15YJC790047]; Scientific Research Foundation of University of Jinan [14ZD03, X1219]",MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Youth Foundation of Humanities and Social Sciences; Scientific Research Foundation of University of Jinan,"Work is financially supported by MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Youth Foundation of Humanities and Social Sciences (Grant No. 14YJCZH087 and No. 15YJC790047), Scientific Research Foundation of University of Jinan (Grant No. 14ZD03 and No. X1219).",,11,0,0,0,8,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-357-9,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,21.0,,,,,,68,73,,,,,,6,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6JA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426729800013,0

We will show, along the lines of Le Jalle, that these similarities end on a divergent appreciation of the importance of envy in commercial societies for, contrary to Rousseau, Smith did not consider envy to be a major threat in commercial societies. Part 1 presents their quite similar definitions of envy based on three characteristics: envy comes from a disadvantageous comparison with others; it is painful and malevolent. Part 2, then, studies their moral psychology, or the way they understand the relationship between sympathy and pity on the one hand, and comparison and envy on the other. Here, we identify significant differences between our two philosophers which might explain why they have opposing views on the predominance of envy in commercial societies and on the issue of inequalities of wealth as we show in Part 3. Rousseau thinks that envy increases with wealth and inequality and thus pervades commercial societies, while Smith sees envy as the exception rather than the rule, and, moreover, does not provide a historical genesis for envy. For Smith, it is emulation rather than envy which is the driving force of the progress of society.","[Pignol, Claire] PHARE Normandie Univ, Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, UCBN, CREM, Caen, France; [Walraevens, Benoit] Normandie Univ, UCBN, CREM, Cherbourg Inst Technol, Caen, France",Universite de Caen Normandie; Universite de Caen Normandie,"Pignol, C (通讯作者)，PHARE Normandie Univ, Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, UCBN, CREM, Caen, France.",benoit.walraevens@unicaen.fr,"Walraevens, Benoît/HTN-7772-2023",,,,,,48,5,5,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

Drawing on the material culture of financialisation, financial education policy is perceived as part of a broader neoliberal project to extend commodification and (re)construct social and economic reproduction in ways favourable to the financial sector. It argues that, while numerous contradictions inherent in financial education programmes jeopardise the goal of improving individual financial decisions through education, the ideological goal of these initiatives is not compromised. It is the neoliberal cultural project of cultivating self-reliance and individual responsibility at the expense of collective forms of provision across new areas of economic and social life.","[Santos, Ana C.] Univ Coimbra, Ctr Social Studies, Coimbra, Portugal",Universidade de Coimbra,"Santos, AC (通讯作者)，Univ Coimbra, Ctr Social Studies, Coimbra, Portugal.",anacsantos@ces.uc.pt,,"Santos, Ana Cordeiro/0000-0002-3654-2544",European Union [266800],European Union(European Union (EU)),The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement number 266800.,,49,23,27,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Potential impact of the changes of labour force in developed countries is a subject of ongoing research in scientific community. Among all aspects, at least changes of labour productivity may appear because of changes of age structure of labour force. The issue of dependency of labour productivity on age has not been deeply discussed in the Czech Republic up to now. It is also affected by difficult availability of appropriate data. Our contribution provides the guidance how to combine different types of data. Our dataset is based on the combination of data from business statistics, statistical survey on wages and national accounts. The paper estimates the effects of age structure of labour force on level of wages and value added. It also identifies these effects both on level of total economy and particular industries for the Czech Republic between 2005 and 2015.

While Lifelong Learning involves both vocational and non-vocational education, policymakers seemed to be preoccupied by an extensive interest to meet the needs of European labour market, so they have paid much effort to promote Vocational Education and Training instead of Adult Education.

By combining insights on institutional change and Chinese elite politics, it demonstrates that the evolution of access criteria can be explained by interdependent bargaining between Chinese party leaders, administrative authorities and corporate interests. The 2008 global financial crisis triggered fundamental shifts in resource interdependencies that altered the bargaining dynamics between these agents. The changes in internal and external conditions are decisive for understanding how the QFII programmes evolved. The analysis draws on an original data-set coupling 91 multi-stakeholder interviews, database analysis and internal government records. The findings show that institutional change in China's cross-border investment programmes is a negotiated economic outcome bridging interdependent state and market agents. These results have important implications for the study of globalisation and institutional change in non-Western contexts. They challenge existing narratives of an all-pervasive Chinese party-state that is resistant to change.","[Topfer, Laura-Marie] Univ Oxford, Smith Sch Enterprise & Environm, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Töpfer, LM (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Smith Sch Enterprise & Environm, Oxford, England.",,,"Topfer, Laura-Marie/0000-0002-0680-4515",UK Economic and Social Research Council [ES-J500112-1]; Royal Geographical Society [RGS-IBG]; Oxford Clarendon Fund [OUCF]; Hertford College of the University of Oxford [HC-MSS]; Brasenose College of the University of Oxford [BNC-SGS]; Economic and Social Research Council [1369431] Funding Source: researchfish,UK Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Royal Geographical Society [RGS-IBG]; Oxford Clarendon Fund [OUCF]; Hertford College of the University of Oxford [HC-MSS]; Brasenose College of the University of Oxford [BNC-SGS]; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by the UK Economic and Social Research Council [ES-J500112-1]; Royal Geographical Society [RGS-IBG-2014]; Oxford Clarendon Fund [OUCF-2013]; Hertford College of the University of Oxford [HC-MSS-2015] and Brasenose College of the University of Oxford [BNC-SGS-2013].,,63,9,12,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

There are two parallel links for one origin and destination pair and two groups of travellers, where the group with the higher value of time also has higher schedule delay values. Previous scholars argued that as users become more heterogeneous, they benefit more from product differentiation, making private supply of roads more efficient. However, we find that local monopoly power might also increase if there is a separating equilibrium, which is an equilibrium where at least one group only uses one private road due to the different combinations of toll and congestion of the two roads. The private road can thus increase its toll without worrying about the competition from the other road for this group: it has a local monopoly over them. This lowers the efficiency of private supply. The problem is especially severe with flat tolls, which are constant over the peak. With fine tolls which vary continuously over the day there tends to be a pooling equilibrium where both types use both roads and competition remains intense. Flat tolling is also worse for users than fine tolling, as it has higher generalized prices.","[Fu, Xinying; van den Berg, Vincent A.

It is found that a significant reduction in serious road casualties of 30% was achieved for the first 12-months after the introduction of the Road Safety System Approach through the reformed road safety initiatives in Brunei. This shows that Brunei's road safety record is now similar to other high road safety performing countries.

Whereas some studies warn against the destructive effect of real currency misalignment on productivity growth, others simply encourage it, at least, in the form of undervaluation. This paper documents evidence in support of the latter argument for 100 middle-income countries for the 1994-2010 period, using fixed-effects and generalized method of moments estimation techniques. The paper finds real currency misalignment to enhance productivity growth if it occurs as undervaluation; and to hamper productivity growth if it occurs as overvaluation. The paper also finds the impact of real currency misalignment on productivity growth to be symmetric, implying that the size of the impact is independent of the size of the misalignment. Moreover, the choice of the real misalignment measure may matter.","[Iyke, Bernard Njindan] Deakin Univ, Dept Finance, 221 Burwood Hwy, Melbourne, Vic 3125, Australia",Deakin University,"Iyke, BN (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Dept Finance, 221 Burwood Hwy, Melbourne, Vic 3125, Australia.",bnjindan@deakin.edu.au,,,,,,,58,5,5,0,7,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We consider a two-sector economic growth model where the development of tourism activities generates a production externality and a structural change, which modifies the resources-use intensity, ultimately affecting tourist flows. We characterize the balanced growth path equilibrium and analyze under which conditions structural change may generate fast economic growth, providing a theoretical support for the empirical evidence on tourism countries. We also show that structural change may alternatively lead to stages of rejuvenation, stagnation, or decline consistently with what advanced by the tourism area life cycle hypothesis. By combining these different results, we also show that an eventual phase of decline generated by structural change does not necessarily have to be interpreted as a poor economic outcome since there might exist a bell-shaped relationship between residents' income and number of visitors.","[Marsiglio, Simone] Univ Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia",University of Wollongong,"Marsiglio, S (通讯作者)，Univ Wollongong, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",simonem@uow.edu.au,"Marsiglio, Simone/K-2863-2012",,,,,,37,12,13,1,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Therefore, it is important to compute saturation flow with a higher order of accuracy. Highway capacity manual (HCM) has provided a saturation flow model for homogeneous traffic condition with strict lane discipline. However, traffic in many parts of the world is highly heterogeneous and hence, it is necessary to develop saturation flow models for such situations. To this end, this paper presents saturation flow models for heterogeneous traffic conditions. To be specific, four saturation flow models based on Kriging variants have been proposed. Unlike available saturation flow models, the proposed models consider the effect of both geometric and traffic characteristics. Field data from fifteen intersections located in five different cities of India - Delhi, Patiala, Chandigarh, Mumbai and Panchkula - are used for developing and validating the models. Results obtained using the proposed models have been compared with other saturation flow models available in the literature. It is observed that the proposed models yield superior results outperforming existing saturation flow models.","[Saha, Arpita; Ghosh, Indrajit] Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Dept Civil Engn, Roorkee 247667, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Chakraborty, Souvik] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Aerosp & Mech Engn, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Chandra, Satish] CRRI, CSIR, New Delhi 110025, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Roorkee; University of Notre Dame; Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - Central Road Research Institute (CRRI),"Saha, A (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Dept Civil Engn, Roorkee 247667, Uttar Pradesh, India.",arpitasaha2904@gmail.com; schalcrab@nd.edu; satisfce@gmail.com; indrafce@iitr.ac.in,"Chakraborty, Souvik/I-5168-2014; Chandra, Satish/AAZ-9105-2020; SAHA, ARPITA/AAC-5261-2021; Ghosh, Indrajit/B-4691-2011; Ghosh, Indrajit/J-9514-2017","Ghosh, Indrajit/0000-0002-1341-0258; Ghosh, Indrajit/0000-0002-1341-0258",,,,,38,16,17,2,19,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

It also investigates the effects of serving these markets on productivity. Using a detailed firm-transaction level matched data set of FOEs in China covering 2000-07, the first-stage estimation of propensity score matching (PSM) method reveals that less productive FOEs tend to undertake assembly exports, and this effect is particularly relevant to those located in inland regions. By contrast, more productive FOEs are likely to serve domestic markets or undertake ordinary exports. Other firm characteristics also exhibit diverse influences on market choices. Export-oriented FOEs, particularly those undertaking assembly exports, experience lower productivity growth than that of local market-oriented FOEs. This suggests that the effects of local market competition do result in substantial enhancement of the productivity of FOEs in China. This pattern is mainly exhibited by FOEs in inland regions, whereas FOEs undertaking ordinary exports in coastal regions might have somewhat higher total factor productivity (TFP) growth than their local market-oriented counterparts. Among export-oriented FOEs, exporting more product value-whether assembly or ordinary exports-has a positive influence on productivity.","[Yang, Chih-Hai; Tsou, Meng-Wen] Natl Cent Univ, Taoyuan, Taiwan",National Central University,"Yang, CH (通讯作者)，Natl Cent Univ, Taoyuan, Taiwan.",,,,,,,,52,5,5,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2018,41.0,12,,,SI,,3482,3502,,10.1111/twec.12724,0.0,,,21,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,HE7HH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000453601800011,0

This paper argues that democracy's effect on economic liberalization hinges on international-systemic factors. To develop this argument, we focus on one important reform issue: capital account liberalization. We hypothesize that the level of financial openness abroad moderates the relationship between democracy and financial policy at home. An open global financial system increases societal support for capital account liberalization and incentivizes democratic leaders to liberalize the capital account. Analyses of country-level panel data demonstrate that democracy is only positively associated with capital account openness when proximate countries maintain open capital markets. Firm-level survey data and an illustrative case study of Argentina provide support for the mechanisms by showing that policy choices abroad influence domestic support for capital account liberalization. Our findings suggest that integrating domestic- and international-level variables in a single framework improves our understanding of the political economy of reform.","[Steinberg, David A.] John Hopkins SAIS, Washington, DC USA; [Nelson, Stephen C.] Northwestern Univ, Polit Sci, Evanston, IL USA; [Nguyen, Christoph] Freie Univ, Berlin, Germany",Northwestern University; Free University of Berlin,"Steinberg, DA (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Sch Adv Int Studies, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",dsteinberg@jhu.edu,,,,,,,91,9,11,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Few works are reported addressing the modeling of rail transit network resilience under operational incidents which could be more important analyzing the network performance changes under daily operations. This study demonstrates a resilience approach for rail transit network under daily operational incidents. Integrating the network topological and passenger volume characteristics, this approach explicitly accounts for the impacts of accumulative affected passengers quantifying the varying resilience of rail network with time under different incidents. The proposed methodology was applied to Shanghai Metro Network in Shanghai, China. Results show that critical stations are identified differently depending on duration time of different incidents and characteristics of the failed stations, and stations on network legs could be more important than those with redundant rail alternatives.

In these cases it is more appropriate to conduct welfare analysis using inverse demand models that take quantities as given and allow prices to adjust to clear the market. One challenge faced by economists conducting demand analysis is how to limit the number of commodities in the analysis while accounting for the relevant substitutability and complementarity among goods. A common approach in direct demand modeling is to assume weak separability of the utility function and apply a multi-stage budgeting approach. This approach has not, however, been applied to an inverse demand system or the associated welfare analysis. This paper develops a two-stage inverse demand model and derives the total quantity flexibilities which describe how market clearing prices respond to supply changes in other commodity groups. The model provides the means to estimate consumer welfare impacts of an increase in finfish and shellfish harvest from the Chesapeake Bay while recognizing that harvests from other regions are potential substitutes. Comparing the two-stage results with single-stage analysis of the same data shows that ignoring differentiation of harvests from different regions, or the availability of substitutes not affected by a supply shock, can bias welfare estimates.","[Moore, Chris; Griffiths, Charles] US EPA, Natl Ctr Environm Econ, 1200 Penn Ave NW,MC 1809T, Washington, DC 20460 USA",United States Environmental Protection Agency,"Moore, C (通讯作者)，US EPA, Natl Ctr Environm Econ, 1200 Penn Ave NW,MC 1809T, Washington, DC 20460 USA.",moore.chris@epa.gov,"Moore, Chris/I-4802-2017","Moore, Chris/0000-0002-6972-2787",Intramural EPA [EPA999999] Funding Source: Medline,Intramural EPA,,,26,6,6,0,4,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Multiple waves of zoning and land use conversion data at the parcel level allow for a decomposition of the long-run effects of zoning and an exploration of the mechanisms through which zoning influenced future land use. In particular, I disentangle short-run impacts on land use from long-term institutional hysteresis, showing that the latter played a sizable role in shaping future land use. Additionally, data on variances allows me to examine early compliance levels, an underexplored topic with implications for long-run impacts. While much has been written about persistence in urban form due to purely economic forces, relatively little research has explored how institutional forces can entrench or alter this trajectory, and I find that such institutional constraints can have substantial influence.","[Twinam, Tate] Univ Washington Bothell, Interdisciplinary Arts & Sci, Bothell, WA 98011 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Bothell,"Twinam, T (通讯作者)，Univ Washington Bothell, Interdisciplinary Arts & Sci, Bothell, WA 98011 USA.",twinam@uw.edu,,,,,,,20,10,12,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

A considerable body of literature argues that if more freight could be carried on the rail network, substantial reductions in carbon footprints could be made. This paper describes a modelling framework for estimating the spatial transfer or movement of aggregates between quarries in England and Wales and local authority districts (demand zones). A key part of this framework is the estimation of the carbon emissions associated with both road and rail travel. Once built and calibrated, the model is used for a variety of what-if scenarios relating to the increased use of rail (which includes the necessary construction of new uplifting facilities as well as the number of rail-linked quarries) against future road haulage undertaken through a modernised vehicle fleet. The latter is shown to provide a more realistic and economic solution to reducing carbon emissions associated with the transportation of aggregates.","[Zuo, Chengchoa] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Publ Adm, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zuo, Chengchoa; Birkin, Mark; Clarke, Graham] Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [McEvoy, Fiona; Bloodworth, Andrew] British Geol Survey, Nottingham NG12 5GG, England",Huazhong Agricultural University; University of Leeds; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC British Geological Survey,"Clarke, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",g.p.clarke@leeds.ac.uk,"Zuo, Chengchao/AAT-8686-2021","Zuo, Chengchao/0000-0002-1419-7989; Birkin, Mark/0000-0001-5991-098X",BGS-University of Leeds joint research scholarship; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2662016QD019]; ESRC [ES/L011891/1] Funding Source: UKRI; NERC [bgs05010] Funding Source: UKRI,BGS-University of Leeds joint research scholarship; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This research was supported by the BGS-University of Leeds joint research scholarship, and by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under project 2662016QD019.",,40,17,17,9,61,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

However, many cities have more recently seen their transit ridership plateaued, if not decreased. This trend in transit ridership has produced a lot of discussion on which factors contributed the most to this new trend. While no recent study has been conducted on this matter, understanding the levers that can be used to sustain and/or increase transit ridership is essential. The aim of this study is, therefore, to explore the determinants of public transport ridership from 2002 to 2015 for 25 transit authorities in Canada and the United States using a longitudinal multilevel mixed-effect regression approach. Our analysis demonstrates that vehicle revenue kilometers (VRK) and car ownership are the main determinants of transit ridership. More specifically, the results suggest that the reduction in bus VRK likely explains the reduction in ridership observed in recent years in many North American cities. Furthermore, external factors such as the presence of ridesourcing services (Uber) and bicycle sharing, although not statistically significant in our models, are associated with higher levels of transit ridership, which contradicts some of the experts' hypotheses. From a policy perspective, this research suggests that investments in public transport operations, especially bus services, can be a key factor to mitigate the decline in transit ridership or sustain and increase it. While the results of this study emphasize that fare revenues cannot support such investments without deterring ridership, additional sources of revenues are required. This study is of relevance to public transport engineers, planners, researchers, and policy-makers wishing to understand the factors leading to an increase in transit ridership.","[Boisjoly, Genevieve; Grise, Emily; Maguire, Meadhbh; Veillette, Marie-Pier; Deboosere, Robbin; Berrebi, Emma; El-Geneidy, Ahmed] McGill Univ, Sch Urban Planning, Suite 400,815 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada",McGill University,"El-Geneidy, A (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Sch Urban Planning, Suite 400,815 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada.",ahmed.elgeneidy@mcgill.ca,"El-Geneidy, Ahmed/N-3904-2013","El-Geneidy, Ahmed/0000-0002-0942-4016; Boisjoly, Genevieve/0000-0001-5375-7750",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC),Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)CGIAR),"This research was funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) discovery program and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC).

The socio-economic status of grandsons is more strongly associated with the status of paternal grandfathers than maternal grandfathers. The status of maternal grandfathers is more strongly correlated with the status of granddaughters than grandsons, while the opposite is true for paternal grandfathers.

The same can be said for studies on the performance of spatial econometric models under misspecification of explanatory variables and unknown structure of the spatial weight matrix. In this article, we introduce a new class of data generating processes (DGP), called MGWR-SAR, in which the regression parameters and the spatial autocorrelation coefficient can vary over the space. For the estimation of these new models, we resort to the Spatial Two-Stage Least Squares (S2SLS) technique. We rely on a Monte Carlo experiment for testing the performance of classical models, such as OLS, GWR (Geographically Weighted Regression), mixed GWR and SAR (Spatial AutoRegressive model), as well as our proposals, paying special attention to simulated data under the realistic assumption that they suffer from multicollinearity/concurvity problems and/or misspecification of the covariates. The results suggest that certain model specifications amongst the newly proposed family MGWR-SAR are the more robust. Furthermore, to complete our proposal, we also suggest a specification procedure to identify the correct spatial weight matrix for DGPs with spatial heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation of the endogenous. We conclude the article with an empirical study on the Lucas County house price dataset, confirming the good performance of the proposed estimators.","[Geniaux, Ghislain; Martinetti, Davide] INRA, UR Ecodev, Avignon, France",INRAE,"Geniaux, G (通讯作者)，INRA, UR Ecodev, Avignon, France.",ghislain.geniaux@inra.fr; davide.martinetti@inra.fr,"Martinetti, Davide/ABB-2172-2020","Martinetti, Davide/0000-0003-2047-1793",EU [267196]; project URBANSIMUL; project EPIDEC,EU(European Union (EU)); project URBANSIMUL; project EPIDEC,"Davide Martinetti has received the support of the EU in the framework of the Marie-Curie FP7 COFUND People Programme, through the award of an AgreenSkills fellowship under grant agreement 267196.

Thus, there seems to be a higher propensity for mortgage lenders to swiftly increase their customers' mortgage interest rates subsequent to an increase in its borrowing costs, than to decrease their customers' mortgage rates subsequent to a corresponding decrease in the cost of borrowing. A unique contribution is our proposed wavelet method which enables a robust detection of positive asymmetric price transmission effects at various time-frequency scales, while simultaneously controlling for non-stationary trends, autocorrelation, and structural breaks. Since traditional time-series analysis methods essentially implies that several wavelet time scales are aggregated into one single time series, the blunt traditional error correction analysis totally failed to discover APT effects for this data set. In summary, using the wavelet method we show that even though the customers in the end finally will benefit from decreases in the mortgage lenders' financing costs, the lenders wait disproportionally long before the customers' mortgage rates are decreased.","[Mansson, Kristofer; Sjolander, Par; Shukur, Ghazi] Jonkoping Univ, Jonkoping, Sweden; [Shukur, Ghazi] Linnaeus Univ, Vaxjo, Sweden",Jonkoping University; Linnaeus University,"Månsson, K (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Univ, Jonkoping, Sweden.",kristofer.mansson@ju.se,,,,,,,58,0,0,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

In this paper, we argue that restricting attention to tournaments is justified by the existence of a conservative extension, which inherits most of the commonly considered properties from its underlying tournament solution.","[Brandt, Felix] Tech Univ Munich, Inst Informat, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Brill, Markus] Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Softwaretech & Theoret Informat, D-10587 Berlin, Germany; [Harrenstein, Paul] Univ Oxford, Dept Comp Sci, Oxford OX1 3QD, England",Technical University of Munich; Technical University of Berlin; University of Oxford,"Brill, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Softwaretech & Theoret Informat, D-10587 Berlin, Germany.",brandtf@in.tum.de; brill@tu-berlin.de; paul.harrenstein@cs.ox.ac.uk,"Brandt, Felix/JQJ-3604-2023","Brill, Markus/0000-0001-9509-7017","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [BR 2312/7-2]; Feodor Lynen research fellowship of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; ERC [291528, 639945]",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Feodor Lynen research fellowship of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); ERC(European Research Council (ERC)),"This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft under Grant BR 2312/7-2, by a Feodor Lynen research fellowship of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, and by the ERC under Advanced Grant 291528 (RACE) and Starting Grant 639945 (ACCORD).

By assuming a Utility-Based departure time choice model, the time-dependent OD flow becomes a function, whose parameters are those of the utility function(s) within the departure time choice model. In this way, the DODE is solved using a parametric approach, which, on one hand, has less variables to calibrate with respect to the classical bi-level formulation while, on the other hand, it accounts for different trip purposes. Properties of the model are analytically and numerically discussed, showing that the model is more suited for estimating the systematic component of the demand with respect to the standard GLS formulation. Differently from similar approaches in literature, which rely on agent-based microsimulators and require expensive survey data, the proposed framework is applicable with all those DTA models, which are based on OD matrix, and do not necessarily need any data at user level. This has been proven by applying the proposed approach with a standard macroscopic realistic Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA).","[Cantelmo, Guido; Viti, Francesco] Univ Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Cipriani, Ernesto; Nigro, Marialisa] Univ Roma Tre, Rome, Italy",University of Luxembourg; Roma Tre University,"Cantelmo, G (通讯作者)，Univ Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",guido.cantelmo@uni.lu,"NIGRO, Marialisa/AAN-6991-2020","NIGRO, Marialisa/0000-0003-0640-5810; Viti, Francesco/0000-0003-1803-4527; Cantelmo, Guido/0000-0001-5218-2609; CIPRIANI, Ernesto/0000-0002-5073-9378",AFR-PhD grant [6947587 IDEAS],AFR-PhD grant(Luxembourg National Research Fund),We acknowledge for financing the following grant: AFR-PhD grant 6947587 IDEAS.,,22,10,10,0,9,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Tourism service providers are suggested to remain conservative under a positive economic condition and progressive under a moderate economic condition when engaging in a new business opportunity. However, a fringe level of progressivism may be maintained under a moderate economy and a low-risk environment.

Financial turbulence is proxied by the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans in a country. Spillover effects are defined as significant changes in the linkages between countries due to a shock, and interdependence effects as strong linkages among pairs of countries independent of shocks. Using annual data of 40 countries from 2003 to 2010, we find that interdependence and spillover effects should be jointly analyzed. Furthermore, our results suggest that the capital flows channel is more important than the other two channels in capturing propagation of financial turbulence. By deriving what is known in the spatial econometrics literature as direct and indirect effect estimates, we show that the marginal effects of macroeconomic variables (like GDP growth, inflation, and credit growth) on financial turbulence take different forms during a crisis than in tranquil periods.","[Jing, Zhongbo] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Elhorst, J.

Although both theories may in part account for why firms choose to franchise, past studies have not seriously considered the potential relationship between franchising and capital structures. Using Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition analysis, this study examined the impact of franchising on short- and long-term debt leverage. The final sample included 191 restaurant firms from 1980 to 2015. Sixty-five firms were non-franchise firms, while 126 firms engaged in the franchising business. The results of the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition analysis showed that franchising has a significant effect on decreasing long-term debts and confirmed that franchising plays an important role as an additional source of long-term capital. Consequently, the capital scarcity theory is supported as one aspect of long-term debt leverage. However, franchise restaurant firms have larger short-term debt than non-franchise firms, although it is merely marginally significant. This contradicts capital scarcity theory but is in accordance with some past studies (e.g. Norton, 1988; 1995). This implies that franchisors constantly need short-term capital to support franchisees.","[Park, Kwangmin] Sejong Univ, Seoul 143747, South Korea; [Jang, SooCheong (Shawn)] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Sejong University; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Park, K (通讯作者)，Sejong Univ, Seoul 143747, South Korea.",kmpark@sejong.ac.kr,"Jang, SooCheong/L-3880-2019",,,,,,68,6,7,1,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

By matching UNESCO's creative and cultural exports classification to trade and migration data, we find a strong positive effect of birthplace diversity on the export of creative products. In particular, a 10% increase in the birthplace diversity index implies a 4% increase in creative goods exports. These results are robust across several specifications and shed light on a potential new channel through which migrants can contribute to the host country's export performance. It is interesting to note that only diversity of secondary and tertiary educated immigrants contributes to an increase in exports of creative and cultural goods.

This paper examines reasons that such funds may be established, discusses how these funds are organized, and draws some policy lessons. The paper then develops a theory of how petroleum funds may affect the economic and political equilibrium of an economy, and how this depends on the initial institutions. A challenge with petroleum funds is that they may produce economic and political incentives that undermine their potential benefits. An alternative to establishing petroleum funds is to use revenues to invest domestically in sectors such as infrastructure, education, and health. Such investments have the potential to produce a better economic, as well as institutional, development. This is particularly the case if the initial institutions are weak.","[Torvik, Ragnar] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Torvik, R (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",ragnar.torvik@ntnu.no,,,Royal Norwegian Embassy in Dar es Salaam,Royal Norwegian Embassy in Dar es Salaam,"This paper is a product of the research program Tanzania as a future petro-state: prospects and challenges, funded by the Royal Norwegian Embassy in Dar es Salaam.

We estimate discrete choice migration models to quantify the trade-offs across locations faced by veterans. Veterans were more likely to move to a neighborhood or county where men from their same war company lived and were more likely to move to such areas than to areas where other veterans were located. Veterans also were less likely to move far from their origin and avoided urban immigrant areas and high mortality risk areas. They also avoided areas that opposed the Civil War. This co-location evidence highlights the existence of persistent social networks.

This is the first study to combine the case-resampling bootstrap method with the coskewness and cokurtosis test. Thus the new method works well on data with a non-normal distribution or non-constant variance. Additional channels of contagion may also be detected to reflect a more precise pattern of contagion. In contrast to Hatemi-J and Hacker, Applied Financial Economics Letters, 1(6), 343-347 (2005)'s result, we find that the case-resampling bootstrap method diminishes the overall effect of contagion. In particular, no additional channels of contagion can be found when the case-resampling bootstrap method is applied on the coskewness test, but when the case-resampling bootstrap method is applied on the cokurtosis test, additional channels of contagion are detected. Furthermore, the overall effect of contagion is greater on the general equity markets than on the securitized real estate markets.

By considering hierarchical preferences in consumption, it assumes that income inequality has a negative influence on regional economic growth because it lowers the incentive to innovate. Using a structural equation model, the effect of income inequality on regional economic performance, as well as the mediating effect of entrepreneurship, is tested. The results show that income inequality negatively affects both entrepreneurship and economic growth. This result suggests that insufficient demand for new products/services hampers entrepreneurial activities as well as regional economic performance. The findings contribute to the field, highlighting that entrepreneurship mediates between income inequality and economic performance based on demands.","[Jung, Hyejin] Korea Univ Technol & Educ, Cheonan, South Korea; [Seo, Inseok] Anyang Univ, Dept Publ Adm, Anyang, South Korea; [Jung, Kyujin] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Publ Adm, 25-2 Sungkyunkwan Ro, Seoul 03063, South Korea; [Jung, Kyujin] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Graduae Sch Governance, Seoul, South Korea",Korea University of Technology & Education; Anyang University; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Jung, K (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Publ Adm, 25-2 Sungkyunkwan Ro, Seoul 03063, South Korea.",kjung1@skku.edu,,"Seo, Inseok/0000-0003-2079-3856; Jung, Kyujin/0000-0002-2241-2415; Jung, Hyejin/0000-0002-5880-0137",,,,,77,7,9,1,32,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Drawing on 2015 hourly data from France's electricity transmission network operator (RTE) and the French dayahead spot market, this paper attempts to quantify the disturbance observed and the transfers of revenues among consumers, producers and providers. This study calculates, through a modeling of the day-ahead market, the impact on conventional electricity producers in France in terms of the loss of economic value owing to the introduction of renewable energies. In the same time consumers benefit from lower electricity prices but have to pay for feed-in tariffs. Renewable electricity producers and electricity providers are also the winners. An estimation of the cross-subsidies induced by the injection of renewable electricity is given.","[Percebois, Jacques] Montpellier Univ, UMR CNRS Art Dev, CS 79606, F-34960 Montpellier 2, France; [Percebois, Jacques] Paris Dauphine Univ, CREDEN, Climate Econ Chair, Richter, CS 79606, F-34960 Montpellier 2, France; [Pommeret, Stanislas] Soc Chim France, 28 Rue St Dominique, F-75007 Paris, France",Universite de Montpellier; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine,"Percebois, J (通讯作者)，Montpellier Univ, UMR CNRS Art Dev, CS 79606, F-34960 Montpellier 2, France.;Percebois, J (通讯作者)，Paris Dauphine Univ, CREDEN, Climate Econ Chair, Richter, CS 79606, F-34960 Montpellier 2, France.",jacques.percebois@umontpellier.fr; stanislas.pommeret@societechimiquedefrance.fr,"Pommeret, Stanislas/M-7229-2018",,,,,,37,7,7,0,8,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,MAY,2018,39.0,3,,,,,245,267,,10.5547/01956574.39.3.jper,0.0,,,23,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GE7EG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431395500011,0

Despite these intra- and inter-institutional constraints, early agreements can be concluded because agents execute two parallel tasks on behalf of their principals: representing them inter-institutionally and acting as the deal-facilitator intra-institutionally. We identify three ways in which the agents can combine these two acts of delegation and conclude an early agreement: (1) creating a tied-hand situation for themselves; (2) affecting the intra-institutional coalition formation by bringing in allies from the other institution; and (3) actively searching for signals from the principals and the fellow agent on the zone of possible agreement. We illustrate these dynamics through a case study of the policy-making process on the 2015 Decision on the Market Stability Reserve.","[Delreux, Tom; Laloux, Thomas] Catholic Univ Louvain, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain,"Delreux, T (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Sci Polit Louvain Europe ISPOLE, Pl Montesquieu 1,L2-08-07, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",tom.delreux@uclouvain.be,,"Laloux, Thomas/0009-0004-0893-2192",,,,,42,20,20,2,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The theoretical result obtained by Alonso (1964) and Muth (1969) is that a higher wage has offsetting effects on commuting by increasing both the demand for housing and the time cost of commuting. This study places these offsetting effects in a model of bid-rent for a two-worker household that extends the model presented by White (1977). The basic finding is that an increase in the wage rate increases the worker's commuting time by a small statistically significant amount. The result holds for both husbands and wives. The net effect of a higher wage on commuting time is positive and small. As other studies have found, commuting time is greater for husbands than for wives.","[Hong, Sung Hyo] Kongju Natl Univ, Div Econ & Trade, Gongju 314701, Chungchungnam D, South Korea; [Lee, Bun Song] Univ Arkansas, Dept Accounting Econ & Finance, Ft Smith, AR 72913 USA; [McDonald, John F.] Univ Illinois, Dept Econ & Finance, Chicago, IL 60680 USA",Kongju National University; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fort Smith; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"McDonald, JF (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Econ & Finance, Chicago, IL 60680 USA.",shong11@kongju.ac.kr; bun.lee@uafs.edu; mcdonald@uic.edu,,,,,,,18,7,7,1,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

We study the impact of that buffer on the volatility of oil prices. After estimating the stochastic process that generates shocks to demand and supply, and assessing OPEC's limited ability to accurately measure and offset those shocks, we find that OPEC's use of spare capacity has reduced price volatility, perhaps by as much as half. We also apply the principle of revealed preference to infer the implicit loss function that rationalizes OPEC's investment in spare capacity and compare it to other estimates of the cost of crude oil supply shortfalls. That comparison suggests that OPEC's buffer capacity was in line with global macroeconomic needs.","[Pierru, Axel; Zamrik, Tamim] KAPSARC, POB 88550, Riyadh 11672, Saudi Arabia; [Smith, James L.] Southern Methodist Univ, Edwin L Cox Sch Business, Dallas, TX 75275 USA",Southern Methodist University,"Pierru, A (通讯作者)，KAPSARC, POB 88550, Riyadh 11672, Saudi Arabia.",axel.pierru@kapsarc.org; jsmith@mail.cox.smu.edu,,,,,,,29,23,24,0,12,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,MAR,2018,39.0,2,,,,,173,196,,10.5547/01956574.39.2.apie,0.0,,,24,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FZ4RB,,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427578400008,0

The landmark in Russian history comprised violent protests, resulting in the introduction of a parliament and the adoption of a constitution. While this was appreciated by investors, related events and the associated political and economic uncertainty combined with large financial pressure resulted in a negative securities market reaction. Further, the Russo-Japanese War, closely linked with the revolutionary events, is considered. Consistent with the established literature, war-related events did not always translate into price reactions. In addition to Berlin, the paper examines the Saint Petersburg Stock Exchange. The results suggest that the two markets were already well integrated at the turn of the 20th century.","[Opitz, Alexander] Univ Hohenheim, Dept Econ, Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Opitz, A (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Dept Econ, Stuttgart, Germany.",,,,German Academic Exchange Service,German Academic Exchange Service(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),"The author is grateful to the German Academic Exchange Service, which generously funded the research stay in Saint Petersburg.

We involved quantitative variables in the study, which reflect the financial characteristics of the listed companies, such as: return on equity ratio, return on assets ratio, gross margin, indebtedness (financial leverage), turnover taxation rate, effective tax rate, intangible assets rate, tangible assets rate and revenue per employee. To analyse the data, we have used, complementary to the descriptive methods, the correlation analysis, the multiple regression analysis and the factorial multiple correspondences analysis.

However, the evolution of these debates has been underpinned by a persistent firm-centrism, with insufficient attention paid to states, public authority and politics. Building on a renewed interest in these themes in recent literature, we contribute to growing demand for a more robust political economy of governance in GVC/GPN debates, wherein the key governance functions of the state can be classified as facilitative, regulatory and distributive in nature. In this context, we explore how the politics of state governance play out in the South African fruit sector, and particularly focus on the labour crisis that occurred in 2012/2013. Our analysis underscores the centrality of the state in governing GVCs/GPNs, and highlights important tensions within and across the three arenas of state governance, and between public and private governance, with significant developmental implications for local actors operating at the base of GVCs/GPNs. Our findings to the importance of a 'relational' understanding of state governance, which reveals how the dynamics of state governance are shaped both by continual political contestation and the competitive commercial context of GVCs/GPNs.","[Alford, Matthew] Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, People Management & Org PMO Div, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Phillips, Nicola] Kings Coll London, Dept Polit Econ, London, England",University of Manchester; Alliance Manchester Business School; University of London; King's College London,"Alford, M (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, People Management & Org PMO Div, Manchester, Lancs, England.",matthew.alford@manchester.ac.uk,,"Phillips, Nicola/0000-0001-9588-976X; Alford, Matthew/0000-0002-1614-7862",,,,,113,57,62,0,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

For the successful execution of a project, it is essential to develop specific project competences in individuals participating at any stage of the project. Even though it is possible to develop project competences in a number of different ways, it is the higher education system, i.e. specialist study programmes focusing on the area of project management that should have the key role in this. Currently, the number of such higher education programmes in the Republic of Croatia is still insufficient but has an upward trend. The aim of this paper is to establish how much importance employers generally attach to individual elements of project competences and explore to what extent these competences are developed in project management graduates they are hiring. The research was conducted using a purposive and convenience sample of 30 organisations hiring project management graduates. Research results suggest a generally high level of significance that project competences have for such employers. The expected level of knowledge corresponds to the estimated level of the students' competence, while the expected level of experience is statistically much higher compared to the students' estimated level of competence. The results of this research can be used primarily as guidelines for further development of the given study programme and its alignment with the current needs of the labour market in the Republic of Croatia. Furthermore, this research may also serve as the basis for any future research in this field.","[Barilovic, Zlatko] Univ Appl Sci Baltazar Zapresic, Zapresic, Croatia",,"Barilovic, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci Baltazar Zapresic, Zapresic, Croatia.",zlatko.barilovic@bak.hr,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,2,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,64,79,,,,,,16,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300004,0

We assumed that, based on investors' opinions, we would be able to conclude whether the location advantages of the Province changed and, if so, in what direction. Using the same direct questionnaire study: 1) in 2010 we interviewed 92 micro and small companies with foreign capital (CFCs); 2) in 2015 we interviewed 52 micro and small CFCs which had invested in the Lodz Province between 2010 and 2015. The 24 factors included in the questionnaire were divided into three groups, reflecting supply, demand and institutional conditions. We used the Mann-Whitney test in order to identify significant changes in motivations behind FDI location in the Lodz Province before the end of 2009 and between 2010 and 2015. We found that, generally, the Province became somewhat less attractive for small foreign investors, and the importance of most factors did not change significantly. In both periods they valued the abundance of relatively cheap and skilful labour the most. This was the biggest location advantage of the Province, enabling them to lower production costs. In 2015, investors clearly appreciated improvements in infrastructure, but they were more critical of information policy and relations with the administration.","[Dorozynski, Tomasz; Swierkocki, Janusz; Urbaniak, Wojciech] Univ Lodz, Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Dorozynski, T (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Lodz, Poland.",,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,0,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-344-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,155,166,,,,,,12,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP0MG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000535358500015,0

Kintamani coffee is popular because it has strong notes of citric acid and brown sugar sweet. Those sensory characteristics are attributed by different roasting profiles and brewing methods. Cold brew is a coffee brewing method that brews coffee in cold, full immersion or slowly dripping within 16 up to 24 hours of extraction. Unlike hot brewing techniques which are more commonly used, cold brewing is less popular due to its complexity. In this current study, the sensory attributes of cold brew coffee will be compared to that of French Press (hot brew) coffee by applying RATA (Rate-All-That-Apply) method. The result shows that light-roasted Kintamani is more fruity (flavor) and acidic (taste and flavor) than that of dark-roasted. Meanwhile the dark-roasted Kintamani is more roasty (flavor), more bitter (taste) and thicker. In terms of brewing techniques, hot brewing tends to enhance the thickness, acid taste/flavor and bitter taste. Those sensory perceptions are attributed to higher caffeine, total phenolic content and lower pH of hot brewed coffee. On the other hand, cold brewing tends to enhance sweet flavor and balance taste.","[Fibrianto, Kiki; Umam, Khoirul; Wulandari, Eka Shinta] Univ Brawijaya, Fac Agr Technol, Sensory & Appl Food Sci Res Grp, Malang, Indonesia",Brawijaya University,"Fibrianto, K (通讯作者)，Univ Brawijaya, Fac Agr Technol, Sensory & Appl Food Sci Res Grp, Malang, Indonesia.",kiki.fibrianto@ub.ac.id; khoirulumam@gmail.com; ekashintaw@gmail.com,"fibrianto, kiki/V-2667-2019; Wulandari, Eka Shinta/JMB-3663-2023","fibrianto, kiki/0000-0003-1011-8275; Wulandari, Eka Shinta/0009-0007-5034-2593",,,,,33,5,5,0,4,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5401,,978-94-6252-619-8,AER ADV ENG RES,,,2018,172.0,,,,,,194,197,,,,,,4,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BP7HZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000562072800040,0

This may result from mis-specification of the econometric tests, due for example to the uncertainty over the presence of a trend, or the possible presence of structural breaks and non-stationary volatility in the data. This paper makes a contribution by addressing the underlying characteristics of energy price data that influence such econometric tests. First, we detect whether the data are characterised by non-stationary volatility and possible trend breaks. The next step involves employing novel unit root tests that unify the underlying characteristics, such as trend break and/or nonstationary volatility, of the data. We conclude shocks to energy prices are not transitory. We further decompose a benchmark oil price and its demand and supply components into their permanent and transitory components and compute the cross correlations to find that they conform to standard theories of commodity storage models.","[Ghoshray, Atanu] Newcastle Univ, Business Sch, 5 Barrack Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Ghoshray, A (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Business Sch, 5 Barrack Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England.",Atanu.Ghoshray@newcastle.ac.uk,,,,,,,60,3,4,0,6,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2018,39.0,,,,1,,175,191,,10.5547/01956574.39.SI1.agho,0.0,,,17,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HJ4BL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000457118600011,0

Thereafter, the economy grows with a tendency for the population to increase faster than the capital while limiting the actual wage below the decreasing maximum until it enters a stationary state and the actual wage and profit rates are reduced to their minimum. Such a theory has been attributed to Ricardo by some scholars, but Torrens proposed a more fully developed account than Ricardo's.","[Hisamatsu, Taro] Doshisha Univ, Fac Commerce, Kyoto, Japan",Doshisha University,"Hisamatsu, T (通讯作者)，Doshisha Univ, Fac Commerce, Kyoto, Japan.",thisamat@mail.doshisha.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [16K17095, 25780144]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K17095, 25780144] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [grant number (B): 16K17095], [grant number (B): 25780144].",,29,3,3,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

Global distribution of these products is supported by cold chain services (e.g. transport, warehousing) that allow maintaining specific freight conditions such as temperature and atmosphere during the whole journey from the point of origin to the final customer. Relying on a desk study research, this paper aims to elaborate the relationship between the integrity of the cold chain and food losses, which can be directly correlated with the carbon footprint. The paper starts with an analysis of the global perishable goods trade and the reefer transportation markets. It also explains the key drivers, challenges, and trends in those aspects that lag behind the impressive development of these markets. Next, the specific requirements of perishables are briefly described, which directly translate to the technological and organizational complexity of the cold chains. Maintaining the freshness and condition of perishable goods and preventing spoilage are the most challenging and critical activities vital to the success of the logistic chain. Every interruption in the cold chain (not maintaining defined temperature and/or atmosphere) may result in cargo losses or damages, and this issue is subject to further consideration. Finally, the paper shows that food cargo losses cannot be treated only as a financial loss suffered by any actor of the supply chain. Instead, they should be viewed in a wider context also as a contribution to GHG emissions and loss of resources used up during production, transport, and utilization. A properly functioning cold chain may considerably reduce food losses due to transport and warehousing.","[Klopott, Magdalena] Gdynia Maritime Univ, Dept Logist & Transport Syst, Gdynia, Poland",Gdynia Maritime University,"Klopott, M (通讯作者)，Gdynia Maritime Univ, Dept Logist & Transport Syst, Gdynia, Poland.",m.klopott@wpit.am.gdynia.pl,"Klopott, Magdalena/X-7818-2018",,,,,,36,0,0,0,6,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,703,721,,,,,,19,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300039,0

Nevertheless, the Russian Orthodox Church has been able to reclaim most of these buildings. This article draws attention to the increase in the power of the Russian Orthodox Church, characterising the interplay between religion and politics in Russia as entangled authorities'.

We develop a new empirical methodology to (i) detect if these markets are integrated, i.e., if all the spatial arbitrage opportunities between the two markets are being exploited, and (ii) decompose the observed spatial price differences into factors such as transportation costs, transportation bottlenecks, and the oligopolistic behavior of the arbitrageurs. Our framework incorporates a new test for the presence of market power and it is thus able to distinguish between physical and strategic behavior constraints on marginal cost pricing. We use the case of the Interconnector pipeline linking Belgium and the UK as an application. Our empirical findings show that all the arbitrage opportunities between the two zones are being exploited but confirm the presence of market power.","[Massol, Olivier] IFP Energies Nouvelles, 1-4 Av Bois Preau, F-92852 Rueil Malmaison, France; [Massol, Olivier] IFP Sch, Ctr Econ & Management, 228-232 Av Napoleon Bonaparte, F-92852 Rueil Malmaison, France; [Massol, Olivier; Banal-Estanol, Albert] City Univ London, Dept Econ, Northampton Sq, London EC1V 0HB, England; [Banal-Estanol, Albert] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Business, Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 08005, Spain",IFP Energies Nouvelles; IFP Energies Nouvelles; City University London; Pompeu Fabra University,"Massol, O (通讯作者)，IFP Energies Nouvelles, 1-4 Av Bois Preau, F-92852 Rueil Malmaison, France.;Massol, O (通讯作者)，IFP Sch, Ctr Econ & Management, 228-232 Av Napoleon Bonaparte, F-92852 Rueil Malmaison, France.;Massol, O (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Dept Econ, Northampton Sq, London EC1V 0HB, England.",olivier.massol@ifpen.fr,"Banal-Estanol, Albert/D-7578-2013","MASSOL, Olivier/0000-0002-9611-7312",French Energy Council; Chair The Economics of Natural Gas,French Energy Council; Chair The Economics of Natural Gas,"This paper has greatly benefited from the judicious comments of two anonymous referees and the editors.

Drawing on relational theory, we identify four dimensions of ethnicity that are each important in distinctive ways in Ukraine: individual language preference, language embeddedness, ethnolinguistic identity, and nationality. Using original survey data collected in May 2014, we show that the choice of one over the other can be highly consequential for the conclusions one draws about ethnicity's role in shaping attitudes (e.g. to NATO membership), actions (e.g. participation in the Euromaidan protests), and the anticipation of outgroups' behavior (e.g. expectations of a Russian invasion). Moreover, we call attention to the importance of including the right control variables for precisely interpreting any posited effects of ethnicity, making specific recommendations for future survey research on ethnic identity in Ukraine.","[Onuch, Olga] Univ Manchester, Dept Polit, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Hale, Henry E.] George Washington Univ, Elliott Sch Int Affairs, Washington, DC 20052 USA",University of Manchester; George Washington University,"Onuch, O (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Dept Polit, Manchester, Lancs, England.",olga.onuch@manchester.ac.uk,"Onuh, Ol'ga/A-2726-2015","Onuh, Ol'ga/0000-0002-6442-035X",National Science Foundation [SES-1445194],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work was supported by the National Science Foundation [grant number SES-1445194].,,79,39,43,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

Conducted research at the very beginning will go in two directions. The first part will refer to the achieved tourism results, whereas the second part will refer to the retail trade results. Ultimately, by a comparative analysis of one and the other important economic element, the differences will be clarified, if there are any. The transition years will be explained, namely the ones that had a decrease, or the ones that had an increase. For the Republic of Croatia, according to collected data, the turning point was 2013. With the accession to the European Union, the Republic of Croatia gained a reputation of on one hand, a more secure destination that ensures quality, whereas, on the other hand, it gained a lot of problems when it comes to the emigration of young people. Taking into account already mentioned parameters which will be supported by the data from the Central Bureau of Statistics, as well as some other relevant organizations and institutions, we will come to the conclusion how much has the Republic of Croatia been able to make use of the increase of tourist arrivals through retail trade, as well as, how much it has not been able. The analysis that covers the 2010-2016 period, shows that the two segments are moving forward. The number of tourist overnight stays grows year after year, especially after the accession to the European Union, but retail trade, on the other hand, has declined.

The effectiveness of a bankruptcy prediction model is determined by the accuracy of its outcome. Models are mainly divided into two categories: statistical and artificial intelligence models. Mostly used statistical model methods are Multivariate discriminant analysis, logit, probit and others. However, in this century the use of Artificial Intelligence techniques in predicting bankruptcy is undergoing rapid development. As its main techniques can be mentioned - Decision trees, Classification and regression tree, Artificial neural network, Genetic algorithms, Support vector machines and others. The main conclusion is that Artificial Intelligence techniques yield the result with much higher accuracy than the statistical methods that is essential for bankruptcy prediction considering potential financial consequences.

However, the recent crisis has complicated the activity and margins of financial entities in Spain, which has derived in a deep credit crunch in the Spanish economy. In the middle of the dramatic restructuring and recapitalization process implemented by Spanish commercial banks, credit unions have strengthened their solvency and increased their market share during the crisis period. Despite this evidence, in general, credit unions have been considered less efficient than commercial banks because they have a dual nature: on the one hand, these companies are cooperatives so they are Social Economy enterprises, and, on the other hand, they are entities in the banking system. However, few studies have focused on empirically evaluating their efficiency, and even less in a crisis context. This study aims to estimate the financial efficiency in the banking activity of Spanish credit unions during the period 2008-2013 and to analyse their determinants. To achieve these objectives, an innovative two-stage Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methodology is applied under the condition of national and sectorial homogeneity. Our results suggest that credit unions in Spain were quite inefficient in their banking activity during the crisis period, although they were able to improve the management of their inputs to obtain their financial outputs year after year. The findings also show that both the agglomeration in urban areas and the regional effect have influenced significantly on their financial efficiency.","[Sierra-Fernandez, Maria-Pilar; Martinez-Campillo, Almudena; Fernandez-Santos, Yolanda] Univ Leon, Leon, Spain",Universidad de Leon,"Sierra-Fernandez, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Leon, Leon, Spain.",pilar.sierra@unileon.es; amarc@unileon.es; yfers@unileon.es,"Martinez-Campillo, Almudena/G-8575-2015; Fernández-Santos, Yolanda/L-8070-2016",,,,,,30,0,0,0,4,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,114,124,,,,,,11,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540720300014,0

If so, what is the nature of their power, when and how do they use it and to what ends? Using the counterintuitive case of Walmart's efforts to improve the Best Aquaculture Practices standard for sustainable aquaculture, I develop a conceptualization of business power that flows from the position of retailers and supermarkets as lead firms within buyer-driven global value chains (GVCs). This position affords them considerable leverage over transnational sustainability standards (TSS) through their ability to act as gatekeepers' to their networks of suppliers, thereby controlling the degree to which sustainability standards gain market uptake. However, this power can be constrained or redirected by value chain and sector-specific conditions that may shift the balance of power towards other actors in a production network. As a result, lead firms may sometimes counterintuitively advocate for TSS that are more inclusive, independent and demanding. This article brings together the literatures on GVCs, global production networks, transnational governance and business power in global governance to offer an initial framework for theorizing power dynamics between multinational corporations and the transnational standard setters that seek to govern them.","[van der Ven, Hamish] McGill Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Leacock Bldg,Room 414,855 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada; [van der Ven, Hamish] McGill Univ, Sch Environm, Leacock Bldg,Room 414,855 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada",McGill University; McGill University,"van der Ven, H (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Leacock Bldg,Room 414,855 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada.;van der Ven, H (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Sch Environm, Leacock Bldg,Room 414,855 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada.",hamish.vanderven@mcgill.ca,,"van der Ven, Hamish/0000-0002-9223-9080",,,,,99,25,25,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The results showed that the advantages of the old campus mainly lie in its unique university culture atmosphere and convenient traffic conditions, and the disadvantage lies in its implemented infrastructure; in contrast, advantages of the new campus are disadvantages of the old campus, and disadvantages of it are advantages of the old campus. Therefore, the two can achieve their own development through strategic complementarity, giving full play to their respective advantages, seizing outside opportunities, and overcoming disadvantages and eliminating threats. However, if we assumed that only one campus could be conserved in the future due to the fact of the reduction in school-age students, then we found that most of the respondents were willing to giving up the new campus. The characteristics of the university itself and the social and economic characteristics of the respondents have effect on conserving willingness of the campus.

The prepared RA-PC was then evaluated for its anti-inflammatory activity against the murine macrophage-like cell line RAW264.7. Using glycerol as solvent and formamide as water mimic, RA-PC was successfully prepared. Upon optimizing the molar ratio (RA/LPC), the amount of glycerol, and the reaction time, a maximum yield of 57.5 mol% was obtained. A dose dependent decrease in the expression levels of IL-6 and IL-1 beta was observed upon addition of RA-PC into the culture medium of RAW264.7.

In this paper, for the first time, we test for sigma convergence in decile income shares across countries. We compile panel data on decile income shares for more than 60 countries over the last 25 years. Regardless of the level of development, within-country inequality increased; income shares of the poorest deciles declined and those of the top decile increased significantly. Importantly, the decile income shares exhibited a statistically significant decline in dispersion between 1985 and 2011, providing strong evidence of sigma convergence in inequality. Convergence was more prominent among developing countries and less so among developed countries. The findings are robust to an array of sensitivity tests. Our analysis suggests that cross-country income distributions became more unequal but noticeably similar over time.","[Chambers, Dustin] Salisbury Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Salisbury, MD USA; [Dhongde, Shatakshee] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Econ, 221 Bobby Dodd Way, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",University System of Maryland; Salisbury University; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Dhongde, S (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Econ, 221 Bobby Dodd Way, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",Shatakshee.Dhongde@econ.gatech.edu,"Chambers, Dustin L/A-8328-2009","Chambers, Dustin L/0000-0001-7722-2240",,,,,26,5,5,0,8,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We employ a set of global tourism companies and find that mandatory IFRS adoption has a significantly negative relation with the cost of equity capital. However, we find that this relation is varied with different business cultures and geographic areas. Moreover, from interactive analyses of country institutions for the relation between mandatory IFRS adoption and tourism firm's cost of equity, we show that adopting IFRS complements the deficiencies of various country institutions, such as investor protection, the strength of legal enforcement, and corporate governance.","[Feng, Zhi-Yuan] Beijing Inst Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Ying-Chieh] Ming Chuan Univ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Huang, Hua-Wei] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Tainan, Taiwan",Beijing Institute of Technology; Ming Chuan University; National Cheng Kung University,"Wang, YC (通讯作者)，Ming Chuan Univ, Dept Accounting, 250 Zhong Shan N Rd,Sec 5, Taipei 111, Taiwan.",wangyc@mail.mcu.edu.tw,"Wang, Ying-Chieh/O-4469-2019; Baldissera, Annalisa/AHD-6334-2022; HUANG, HUA-WEI/P-5954-2015","HUANG, HUA-WEI/0000-0002-1036-1796; Feng, Zhi-Yuan/0000-0003-2700-9630",Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [LY15G020015],Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This material is also based on the work funded by Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China under grant no.

Here the problem is formulated analytically considering a representative single line where hourly passengers flow and average trip lengths differ between peak and off-peak periods. Analytical and numerical results show that minimizing social costs (operators and users) for the whole day yields a larger fleet of smaller buses than if only the peak period is considered. Contrary to previous results on this issue, optimal frequencies across periods differ by a large amount, as optimal peak and off-peak frequencies are larger and smaller respectively than what would be obtained modeling each period by itself. The optimal bus size lies in-between the capacities obtained when each period is independently optimized.

Using firms that were not affected by these policy changes as our control group in each case, we find that credit expansion increased the growth rate of bank borrowing and had a positive effect on exports.

But using name generators and interpreters in surveys increase respondent burden and survey length. The position generator is a technique used in the social science to study social capital and allows for measuring access to networked resources via occupational diversity of network contacts. The influence of these social capital measures is mostly unknown in the context of activity and travel. Since few activity-travel studies have used the position generator previously, a case study using the Pew Internet Personal Networks and Community survey was performed to explore the role of social network occupational diversity in activity participation. The name generator and position generator indicators were compared for predicting activity participation. Social capital was correlated with activity participation for all of the activity types analyzed. Network diversity as measured from the position generator was found to be a reasonable predictive variable for activity participation. The network diversity indicator was found to hold more explanatory and predictive power than core network indicators from a name generator. Additionally, due to the limited use of position generators in travel behavior analysis, the robustness of the social network occupational diversity measure was analyzed. On the measures of predictive accuracy, model fit, and bias and variability of parameter estimates, social network occupational diversity was found to be robust to varying position generator lengths.","[Maness, Michael] Univ Maryland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 1173 Martin Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Maness, Michael] Univ S Florida, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 4202 E Fowler Ave,ENB 118, Tampa, FL 33620 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida,"Maness, M (通讯作者)，Univ S Florida, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 4202 E Fowler Ave,ENB 118, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",manessm@usf.edu,,"Maness, Michael/0000-0001-5780-8666",,,,,35,7,9,3,8,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

However, it has been reported that actual multipliers for a real economy are sometimes < 1; the reason for this has not been adequately explained in the literature. This study analyzes the influence of inefficient public expenditure on gross domestic product, using both an agent-based model and a theoretical derivation of the equation for the multiplier of public investment, the latter of which is based on our revised version of Morishima's economic linkage table. The use of both of these instruments indicates that gross domestic product decreases with an increase in the inefficiency of public expenditure, which is defined as the ratio of firm subsidies to the government's total expenditure. The multiplier of public investment becomes < 1 when the degree of inefficiency is sufficiently large, and the ratio of the firm's investment spending to the total amount of subsidy funding is sufficiently small. A multiplier lower than 1 is thought to appear when the degree of inefficiency in public expenditure is sufficiently large and firms are reluctant to invest; much of the surplus amount of subsidized funds can be deposited into a bank account, thus reducing the money stock in the market.","[Ogibayashi, Shigeaki; Takashima, Kosei] Chiba Inst Technol, Sch Social Sci, Chiba 2750016, Japan; [Ogibayashi, Shigeaki; Takashima, Kosei] Chiba Inst Technol, Res Inst, Chiba 2750016, Japan",Chiba Institute of Technology; Chiba Institute of Technology,"Ogibayashi, S (通讯作者)，Chiba Inst Technol, Sch Social Sci, Chiba 2750016, Japan.;Ogibayashi, S (通讯作者)，Chiba Inst Technol, Res Inst, Chiba 2750016, Japan.",shigeaki.ogibayashi@it-chiba.ac.jp,,,,,,,18,3,3,1,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

This paradox is manifested in the Lisbon treaty that delegated significant formal leadership functions to the European level. We probe the question how and by whom leadership can and should be performed in EU foreign policy. To answer this question, we advance a new theoretical framework drawing on sociological institutionalism and role theory. We argue that leadership should be understood as a social role shaped in a process of interaction between leader and followers. We contribute with new empirical knowledge of leadership role relations based on an interview survey conducted in 2016. The empirical results point to role conflicts over the formal leadership functions in EU foreign policy and the emergence of new informal leadership practices by EU member states.","[Aggestam, Lisbeth; Johansson, Markus] Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Aggestam, L (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Ctr European Res CERGU, Dept Polit Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden.",lisbeth.aggestam@gu.se,"Johansson, Markus/X-5696-2019","Johansson, Markus/0000-0003-0875-3624",Riksbankens Jubileumsfond (Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation) [P14-0030: 1]; Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences [P14-0030:1] Funding Source: Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences,Riksbankens Jubileumsfond (Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation); Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences(Swedish Foundation for Humanities & Social Sciences),"The authors would like to thank Louise Roman for research assistance.

Yet, very little has been said on how these improvements affect the spatial organization of the economic activity in the suburbs. This paper analyses the effects of transportation's changes on employment subcenters formation. Using data from metropolitan Paris between 1968 and 2010, we first show that the spatial pattern of job decentralization is reinforcing the polycentric nature of Paris: the number of subcenters grew from 21 in 1968 to 35 in 2010 and the employment growth was very intense within them. Second, our main contribution is to show that the new rail transit clearly affects the emergence of subcenters: not only does the presence of a rail station increase the probability of a suburban municipality of becoming (part of) a subcenter by 5 to 10%, but a 10% increase in municipality proximity to a suburban station is found to increase its chance to be part of a subcenter by 3 to 5%.","[Garcia-Lopez, Miquel-Angel] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Hemet, Camille] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Garcia-Lopez, Miquel-Angel; Hemet, Camille; Viladecans-Marsal, Elisabet] Inst Econ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Hemet, Camille; Viladecans-Marsal, Elisabet] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England; [Viladecans-Marsal, Elisabet] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Garcia-Lopez, Miquel-Angel] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Appl Econ, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain; [Hemet, Camille] Ecole Normale Super, PSE, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France; [Viladecans-Marsal, Elisabet] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ, Avinguda Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Paris School of Economics; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of Barcelona; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); University of Barcelona,"Garcia-López, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Appl Econ, Edifici B, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain.",miquelangel.garcia@uab.cat; camille.hemet@psemail.eu; eviladecans@ub.edu,"Garcia-López, Miquel-Àngel/K-4603-2014","Garcia-López, Miquel-Àngel/0000-0002-0515-2922; Viladecans-Marsal, Elisabet/0000-0003-3722-2371","Societe du Grand Paris; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [ECO2010-20718, ECO2014-52999-R, ECO2013-41310-R, ECO2016-75941R]; Generalitat de Catalunya [2014SGR1326, 2014SGR420]; Xerxe de Referncia da+D+I en Economia Aplicada'",Societe du Grand Paris; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya); Xerxe de Referncia da+D+I en Economia Aplicada',"We are very grateful to Gilles Duranton, Laurent Gobillon, Miren Lafourcade, Daniel P.

Drawing on a large set of geo-referenced employer-employee data, we use exact route distances between place of work and place of residence to calculate individual net wage benefits from commuting subsidies. In line with urban efficiency wage theories, we find robust evidence that employers compensate workers on average for about one third of the net wage loss caused by the reform if wages are individually negotiated. We find no comparable effect for workers covered by collective wage agreements. The subsequent existence of two common subsidy regimes within an otherwise stable institutional environment allows to draw inference on how each regime redistributes income between wage groups and between regions. We find that the introduction of a lower bound for commuting distances leads to a more equal distribution of net wage benefits between wage groups and regions compared to a regime without a lower bound.","[Heuermann, Daniel F.; Assmann, Franziska] Univ Regensburg, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany; [vom Berge, Philipp] Inst Employment Res IAB, Regensburger Str 100, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany; [Freund, Florian] Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst, Bundesallee 50, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany",University of Regensburg; Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute,"Heuermann, DF (通讯作者)，Univ Regensburg, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany.",Daniel.Heuermann@ur.de; Franziska.Assmann@yahoo.com; Philipp.Berge@iab.de; Florian.Freund@thuenen.de,"Freund, Florian/HSG-3698-2023","Freund, Florian/0000-0003-0803-6238; vom Berge, Philipp/0000-0003-2013-0761",,,,,57,7,7,1,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

It adds to the literature in three aspects. First, we update existing figures on the gender pay gaps in the EU based on the Structure of Earnings Survey 2010 (SES). Second, we enrich the literature by undertaking comprehensive country comparisons of the gap components based on an Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition. Overall, we analyse 21 EU countries plus Norway, which clearly exceeds the scope of existing microdata studies. Third, we examine the sources of the unexplained gap. We find that about one third of the gap can be traced back to the role of the explanatory factors included in our analysis. Human capital related factors are of minor importance. Instead, the sectoral segregation of genders is identified as the most important barrier to gender pay equality in European countries. In addition, the fact that part-time positions are more frequent among women notably contributes to the gap. Furthermore, sector premiums are generally to men's advantage, this might point to a less advanta-geous within-sector positional sorting for women compared to men. We conclude that policies aiming at closing the gender pay gap should focus more on the sector level than on the aggregate economy.","[Boll, Christina; Rossen, Anja] Hamburg Inst Int Econ HWWI, Baumwall 7, D-20459 Hamburg, Germany; [Rossen, Anja] Inst Employment Res IAB, Thomas Mann Str 50, D-90471 Nurnberg, Germany",,"Rossen, A (通讯作者)，Hamburg Inst Int Econ HWWI, Baumwall 7, D-20459 Hamburg, Germany.",boll@hwwi.org; anja.rossen4@iab.de; wolf@hwwi.org,,,,,,,99,16,16,4,40,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Participants submitted six- to eight-page business plans and defended them before a three-or four-judge panel. We surveyed applicants shortly after they applied and one and two years after the competition. We use follow-up surveys to construct measures of enterprise growth and baseline surveys and panel scores to construct measures of enterprise growth potential. We find that a measure of ability correlates strongly with future growth, but that the panel scores add to predictive power even after controlling for ability and other survey variables. The survey questions have more power to explain the variance in growth. Participants presenting before the panel were given a chance to win customized management training.

Relevant labor economics literature motivates the prediction that post-Bosman entrants will be more productive and consequently have a higher probability of earning/retaining a first-team spot in top European leagues. To test these predictions, proprietary data were collected on all players who entered the English Premier League in 4-year windows around the Bosman ruling. Regression discontinuity design displays evident discontinuity in player productivity parameters around the ruling, and the ability to decompose the treatment effect among subgroups of players identifies an incentive effect of increased competition for foreign players. Strong and robust empirical support for the motivating predictions is also established through the application of survival analysis indicating that post-Bosman entrants are dominant in terms of career duration to their pre-Bosman counterparts. Robustness of the results is established by controlling for relegated players through the application of stratified duration models and by testing for endogeneity bias for the productivity parameters employed.","[Radoman, Mihailo] Carleton Univ, Dept Econ, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada",Carleton University,"Radoman, M (通讯作者)，Carleton Univ, Dept Econ, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",mihailoradoman@cmail.carleton.ca,,,,,,,17,4,5,2,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

The estimation takes advantage of an original ticket-level revealed preference data set on travels from the New York City area to Toronto that contains prices and characteristics of not only flight choices but also of all non-booked alternative flights. Consistent with having higher valuations, our results show that travelers buying closer to departure have a higher utility of flying. Moreover, consumers' heterogeneity decreases as the flight date nears. At the carrier level, we identify which carriers have more price sensitive consumers and which carriers face greater competition. In addition, the results suggest that our multi-airport metropolitan area can be considered as a single market and that JFK and Newark are relatively closer substitutes. Overall, consumers are more willing to switch to alternative carriers than between airports or departure times. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous research has shown that private cars are preferred over public transport, but it is not known whether that preference holds in large cities that attenuate the usual benefits of car travel. The small body of research comparing cycling with car driving has found a preference for cycling, but it is not clear what that preference is based on, nor its generalizability, particularly beyond those who already cycle frequently. The current study, which was undertaken as part of the EU-funded project, SUPERHUB (SUstainable and PERsuasive Human Users moBility in future cities), compares liking and experiences of car driving, public transport and cycling in three European cities: Barcelona, Helsinki and Milan. Cycling was liked significantly more than car driving and public transport, and was rated significantly more positively than or equivalent to cars on many attributes, including flexibility and reliability, indicating an important role for cycling in the reduction of urban car use. Public transport was rated significantly less positively than car driving for some attributes (e.g. flexibility, reliability) but more positively for others (e.g. value for money, safety), demonstrating that in large cities, the usual advantages of car driving over public transport are considerably attenuated. Almost all these findings were replicated across all three cities, suggesting that they can be generalised. Most city dwellers already use more than one mode regularly, which may support mode change campaigns. In particular, a substantial proportion of car driver commuters already enjoyed cycling on a regular basis, suggesting the potential for mode switching, via multimodality to overcome the obstacle of journey distance.

Due to their potential impact, governments often promoted railway construction through subsidies. The Uruguayan state offered profit guarantees to foreign railway companies and was able to attract massive investment in the railway sector. This paper asks the question of whether these railway guarantees were efficient, and estimates subsidized and unsubsidized private returns, as well as the social returns, of the Uruguayan railway network from 1863 to 1913. The results show that subsidies more than doubled profitability, but did not compensate the opportunity cost of capital. Social returns were low relative to railways in other regions, and benefits created by new investment in each year did not justify subsidies. However, average social returns were higher than the likely returns for alternative investments and the distribution of these returns was not unfavorable to the consumers of railway services.","[Diaz, Gaston] Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias Sociales, Programa Hist Econ & Social, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Diaz, Gaston] Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias Econ & Adm, Montevideo, Uruguay","Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay; Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay","Diaz, G (通讯作者)，Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias Sociales, Programa Hist Econ & Social, Montevideo, Uruguay.;Diaz, G (通讯作者)，Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias Econ & Adm, Montevideo, Uruguay.",econgaston@gmail.com,,,"Programa de Historia Economica y Social of the Facultad de Ciencias Sociales, UdleaR; Instituto de Economia of the Facultad de Ciencias Economicas y Administracion, UdelaR","Programa de Historia Economica y Social of the Facultad de Ciencias Sociales, UdleaR; Instituto de Economia of the Facultad de Ciencias Economicas y Administracion, UdelaR","The author thanks the Programa de Historia Economica y Social of the Facultad de Ciencias Sociales, UdleaR, and the Instituto de Economia of the Facultad de Ciencias Economicas y Administracion, UdelaR, for their financial support in carrying out this project.

Hazmat are transported on a regular basis instead of a single shipment. In addition, different types of hazmat, posing different levels of risk, must be transported at the same time. We developed a methodology to incorporate the concept of equity in the spatial distribution of risk when multiple types of hazmat must be distributed along various simultaneous routes including not only the risk added by the transportation process but also other baseline risks from exogenous sources. The article describes the development of a multi-product multi-shipment hazmat routing model with equity constraints, departing from a theoretically rich single product single shipment hazmat routing model found in the literature, aimed to minimize the conditional expectation of the consequence of a catastrophic accident. The resultant modeling approach is a linear fractional programming model that incorporates a flexible set of linear constraints that allow a fair distribution of risk among populated zones, restricting the total level of risk below a socially acceptable threshold. We applied this modeling framework to two hypothetical examples and to an actual case in Santiago, Chile (a large capital city with over 6 million inhabitants) showing to be both mathematically tractable and useful for decision makers in practice.

We use a large amount of new data, to explore in particular the role played by urbanization - the process of the population shifting from rural to urban areas within countries - in affecting four important drivers of NCDs world-wide: diabetes prevalence, as well as average body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol level and systolic blood pressure. Urbanization is seen by many as a double-edged sword: while its beneficial economic effects are widely acknowledged, it is commonly alleged to produce adverse side effects for NCD-related health outcomes. In this paper we submit this hypothesis to extensive empirical scrutiny, covering a global set of countries from 19802008, and applying a range of estimation procedures. Our results indicate that urbanization appears to have contributed to an increase in average BMI and cholesterol levels: the implied difference in average total cholesterol between the most and the least urbanized countries is 0.40 mmol/L, while people living in the least urbanized countries are also expected to have an up to 2.31 g/m(2) lower BMI than in the most urbanized ones. Moreover, the least urbanized countries are expected to have an up to 3.2 p.p. lower prevalence of diabetes among women. This association is also much stronger in the low and middle income countries, and is likely to be mediated by energy intake-related variables, such as calorie and fat supply per capita.

To obtain a computationally simple binomial tree with constant volatility, the transformation method and the probability density matching approach are introduced. A tilt parameter is then added to the jump movements to obtain smooth convergence. Therefore, the Richardson extrapolation (RE) can be used to enhance the convergence of the discrete binomial lattice models to continuous models when pricing European options. In addition, our smooth convergent models can also be applied to pricing American options.","[Zou, Dong; Gong, Pu] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Gong, P (通讯作者)，Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",gongpu@hust.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71231005]; Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China [20110142110068],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China(Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China (RFDP)Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (SRFDP)),"The authors wish to express their sincere appreciation to the Editor in Chief, Professor Sirmans and the two anonymous referees for their helpful comments and suggestions, which helped to improve the quality of the paper tremendously.

In doing so, it extends work on retail internationalisation by focusing on the importation, rather than the exportation of business models. The three firms - Coles, Myer and Woolworths - exhibited differing degrees of absorptive capacity in identifying and commercialising knowledge flows. This was reflected in fluctuating levels of success, the scope of store networks and relative positioning in the Australian market. Further, the role played by informal associations between managers in non-competing firms in different markets during the development of discount department stores in Australia advances the case for socialising analyses of business knowledge transfer more broadly.","[Bailey, Matthew] Macquarie Univ, N Ryde, NSW, Australia",Macquarie University,"Bailey, M (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, N Ryde, NSW, Australia.",matthew.bailey@mq.edu.au,,"Bailey, Matthew/0000-0002-0625-3821",,,,,61,10,12,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-8992,1467-8446,,AUST ECON HIST REV,Aust.

Some scholars characterize the EU as one of the most important shapers of global regulations; others argue that the EU's effectiveness critically depends on its regulatory cohesion, the political opportunity structure and regulatory capacity of its interlocutors. Since global sport represents a regionally segmented industry and is governed by private actors of diverse regulatory capacity, global sport regulation represents an excellent domain to study these propositions systematically. Comparative case studies on global sport regulation support the idea that the EU can impose its regulatory ambitions on sport governing due to market size and regulatory capacity.

First, Monte Carlo simulations show that predictive densities for the various MIDAS models derived from the block wild bootstrap approach are more accurate in terms of coverage rates than predictive densities derived from either a residual-based bootstrap approach or by drawing errors from a normal distribution. This result holds whether the data-generating errors are normally independently distributed, serially correlated, heteroskedastic or a mixture of normal distributions. Second, we evaluate density forecasts for quarterly US real output growth in an empirical exercise, exploiting information from typical monthly and weekly series. We show that the block wild bootstrapping approach, applied to the various MIDAS regressions, produces predictive densities for US real output growth that are well calibrated. Moreover, relative accuracy, measured in terms of the logarithmic score, improves for the various MIDAS specifications as more information becomes available.

EU funds are found to be concentrated in smaller municipalities and economically weak sub-regions, and do not increase in the municipalities' fiscal capacity. Our primary focus rests on the question whether regional governments follow their own political self-interest when allocating EU funds even though national parties only play a minor role in Polish local politics and thus the conventional logic of supporting aligned governments does not apply. Difference-in-difference estimations show that the answer is affirmative: Municipalities whose voters are aligned with the regional government receive more EU funds per capita than non-aligned municipalities. Furthermore, we find support for the swing-district hypothesis: EU funds per capita decrease in the vote-share differential between the two leading parties.","[Bischoff, Ivo] Univ Kassel, Dept Econ, Nora Platiel Str 4, D-34109 Kassel, Germany; [Banaszewska, Monika] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Dept Publ Finance, Al Niepodleglosci 10, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland",Universitat Kassel; Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Bischoff, I (通讯作者)，Univ Kassel, Dept Econ, Nora Platiel Str 4, D-34109 Kassel, Germany.",monika.banaszewska@ue.poznan.pl; bischoff@wirtschaft.uni-kassel.de,"Banaszewska, Monika/ABC-0651-2022; Bischoff, Ivo/AAQ-3278-2021","Banaszewska, Monika/0000-0003-2787-9986;",,,,,38,11,11,0,1,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Our empirical analysis is motivated by a simple theoretical framework of endogenous technology adoption, heterogeneous firms and imported inputs. The model predicts a positive effect of input tariff reductions on firms' technology choice to source capital goods from abroad. This effect is heterogeneous across firms depending on their initial productivity level. Relying on India's trade liberalization episode in the early 1990s, we demonstrate that the probability of importing capital goods is higher for firms producing in industries that have experienced greater cuts on tariffs on intermediate goods. Only those firms in the middle range of the initial productivity distribution have benefited from input-trade liberalization to upgrade their technology.","[Bas, Maria] Univ Paris 01, Paris, France; [Berthou, Antoine] Banque France, Paris, France; [Berthou, Antoine] CEPII, Paris, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; European Central Bank; Bank of France,"Bas, M (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Paris, France.",maria.bas@univ-paris1.fr; antoine.berthou@banque-france.fr,,,,,,,42,20,20,3,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

A replication in a narrow sense confirms their empirical results which are mainly based on Poisson models (i.e., with a single set of regression coefficients). However, when extending the model framework by count data hurdle models, it is shown that the two hurdle parts do not coincide-as they should under the Poisson model-but lead to different results. Nevertheless, a remarkably stable positive correlation of citation-weighted patents and institutional ownership across all model specifications can be shown.","[Berger, Susanne; Zeileis, Achim] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Stat, Univ Str 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Stocker, Herbert] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Econ, Univ Str 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria",University of Innsbruck; University of Innsbruck,"Berger, S (通讯作者)，Univ Innsbruck, Dept Stat, Univ Str 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",susanne.berger@uibk.ac.at; Achim.Zeileis@R-project.org,"Zeileis, Achim/K-9226-2015","Zeileis, Achim/0000-0003-0918-3766",University of Innsbruck; Medical University of Innsbruck,University of Innsbruck; Medical University of Innsbruck,Open access funding provided by University of Innsbruck and Medical University of Innsbruck.,,36,6,7,0,20,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Using a variety of data, at both the macro- and the micro-level, we address the following questions: What are the patterns of mortality among Europeans born during this period? Do war-related shocks in childhood and adolescence help predict adult health, human capital and wellbeing of the survivors? Are there differences by sex, socio-economic status in childhood, and age when the shocks occurred? At the macro-level, we show that the secular trend towards lower mortality was interrupted by dramatic increases in mortality during World War I, the Spanish Flu, the Spanish Civil War, and World War II, and we quantify the size of these mortality shocks. Different patterns characterize these high-mortality episodes, with substantial variation by country, sex and age group. At the micro-level, we show that war-related hardship in childhood or adolescence, in particular exposure to war events and experience of hunger, is associated with worse physical and mental health, education, cognitive ability and subjective wellbeing at older ages. The strength of the association differs by sex and type of hardship, with war exposure being more important for females and experience of hunger for males. We also show that hardships matter more if experienced in childhood, and have stronger consequences if they last longer. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The estimates obtained in the analysis imply that a household's probability of stock purchases increases by about 1-3 % points if a sibling has purchased stocks. The positive results are not due to alternative explanations, such as uncontrolled correlation of age effects, financial support from siblings, common shocks, or other unobservable correlations.

As a benchmark I adopt a common BVAR specification, including 18 variables, estimated shrinkage, and no nonlinearity. Then I entertain alternative specifications of the zero lower bound. I account for the possibility that the effect of monetary policy on the economy is different in this regime, replace the federal funds rate by its shadow rate, consider a logarithmic transformation, feed in monetary policy shocks, or utilize conditional forecasts allowing for all shocks implemented through a rejection sampler. The latter two are also coupled with interest rate expectations from future contracts. It is shown that the predictive densities of all these specifications are greatly different, suggesting that this modeling choice is not innocuous. The comparison is based on the accuracy of point and density forecasts of major US macroeconomic series during the period 2009:1 to 2014:4. The introduction of the zero lower bound is not beneficial per se, but it depends on how it is done and which series is forecasted. With caution, I recommend the shadow rate specification and the rejection sampler combined with interest rate expectations to deal with the nonlinearity in the policy rate. Since the policy rate will remain low for some time, these findings could prove useful for practical forecasters.","[Berg, Tim Oliver] Ifo Inst, Ctr Business Cycle Anal & Surveys, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany",Ifo Institut,"Berg, TO (通讯作者)，Ifo Inst, Ctr Business Cycle Anal & Surveys, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany.",Tim-OliverBerg@gmx.de,,,,,,,34,4,4,0,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

It is indeed well-known that the Gaussian distribution is not able to capture many stylized facts of the return series such as skewness, excess kurtosis and heavy tails. Through a large simulation study and an empirical analysis of the US stock market, we show that a NIG-based MSR model allows to adequately account for both skewness and fat tails in the data and, according to model selection criteria, is the best overall model in the majority of the cases considered, even preferred over other popular distributional assumptions such as Student-t and GED. We develop an EM algorithm which allows the estimation of the model parameters in closed form. As a natural byproduct of the algorithm we also derive the scores of the model estimators that allow us to perform dynamic specification tests to check for autocorrelation and for the violation of the first-order Markov assumption.","[De Angelis, Luca; Viroli, Cinzia] Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, Via Belle Arti 41, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"De Angelis, L (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, Via Belle Arti 41, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",l.deangelis@unibo.it,,,"Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca","Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca, (Grant/Award Number: PRIN project 'Multi-variate statistical models for risk assessment').",,37,0,0,0,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

Specifically, we see the role of smart technology in the hands of customers as the new rubric to deliver services that are individualised to the needs and preferences of current and future public transport users. This frontline of service delivery has become known as mobility as a service (MaaS) whereby an individual can book a service delivered through a range of possible modes of transport. At one extreme we have point-to-point car based services such as Uber, Lyft, BlaBlaCar and RydHero (for children), with futuristic suggestions of these gravitating to driverless vehicles (cars and buses). Variations around this future are bus-based options that include smart bookable 'point-v ia-point-to-point' services that offer up options on travel times and fares (with the extreme converting to the point-to-point car service, possibly also operated by a bus business); as well as the continuation of conventional bus services (with larger buses) where the market for smart MaaS is difficult or inappropriate to provide (e.g., contracted (often free) school bus services). This paper, as a think piece, presents a number of positions that could potentially represent future contexts in which bus services might be offered, recognising that a hybrid multi-modal state of affairs may be the most appealing new contract setting, enabling the design of contracts to be driven by the mode-neutral customer experience, and the growing opportunity to focus on MaaS. We suggest that the adrenal rush for mobility services, however, may not deliver the full solution that supporters are suggesting. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We experimentally test the robustness of this behavioral inertia in a collective decision-making setting by varying the default option type and the decision-making environment. We examine the impacts of automatic-participation and no-participation default options on subjects' participation in a public goods provision and their contributions. Two variants of public goods game are employed: the linear and the threshold public goods games. The study shows the evidence of partial stickiness rather than complete stickiness of default options as indicated in empirical studies. Our experimental results square with the evidence of behavioral inertia only when the automatic-participation default is used. This default boosts contributions in the linear public goods game but not in the threshold public goods game. The evidence of partial stickiness is robust to the variation of the game employed, but the effect on contribution is sensitive to it.","[Liu, Jia] Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, 5 Barrack Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England; [Riyanto, Yohanes E.] Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Econ, 14 Nanyang Dr HSS-04-70, Singapore 637332, Singapore",Newcastle University - UK; Nanyang Technological University,"Liu, J (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, 5 Barrack Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England.",jia.liu@newcastle.ac.uk; yeriyanto@ntu.edu.sg,"; Riyanto, Yohanes E./C-2939-2009","Liu, Jia/0000-0001-9568-0317; Riyanto, Yohanes E./0000-0001-7343-4043",Nanyang Technological University,Nanyang Technological University(Nanyang Technological University),This research benefited from the start-up Grant (SUG) and Tier 1 Grant awarded to Yohanes E.

Testing for systematically underreported GNI estimates,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS,,,English,Article,,,,,,World Bank; Data; Foreign Aid,REGRESSION DISCONTINUITY DESIGN; US,"Coordinating aid distribution to the poorest countries requires identifying which countries are poor. In practice this has meant sorting countries into developmental cohorts on the basis of macroeconomic data, with countries in poorer cohorts gaining access to more and more concessional aid programs. To the extent that governments can influence their macroeconomic data, some, especially those in aid-dependent countries, may prefer to report data that sorts them into lower development cohorts. We term such behavior Baid-seeking data management. The possibility of data management has substantial implications for aid distribution, and for the use of macroeconomic data in social scientific settings. We look for evidence of aid-seeking data management in the distribution of GNI per capita data around the eligibility threshold for the World Bank's International Development Association (IDA). Because macroeconomic data are subject to frequent ex post revisions, we separately analyze the heavily revised data available for download from the World Bank's World Development Indicators and the substantially less revised data that we gleaned from back issues of print edition of World Bank Atlas. We find that the less revised GNI per capita data display patterns that are consistent with aid-seeking data management among aid-dependent countries, and only among aid-dependent countries. This finding is robust to a variety of model specifications, but somewhat sensitive to the exclusion of individual countries from the sample. We find no such evidence in the currently downloadable data, suggesting that whatever biases aid-seeking data management may have generated in early data releases are largely and perhaps entirely wiped away in ex post revisions.","[Kerner, Andrew; Beatty, Alison] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Jerven, Morten] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Akershus, Norway",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Kerner, A (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",amkerner@umich.edu; mjerven@sfu.ca; azbeatty@gmail.com,"Baldissera, Annalisa/AHD-6334-2022","Jerven, Morten/0000-0002-7302-3575",,,,,40,25,25,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

Different systems are developed for the quantification of day trippers, based on both primary (fieldwork) and secondary data, and we apply both to the case of a comarca in the Province of Barcelona (Catalonia). The results show the relevance of the phenomenon of 'sameday trips' (for tourism) and the interest for defining and characterizing this phenomenon correctly in order to implement tourism policies that address the different profiles presented by day trippers.","[Surinach, Jordi; Andre, Marien; Murillo, Joaquim; Romani, Javier] Univ Barcelona, AQR Res Grp, Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Casanovas, Josep A.] Cegos Consultur, Madrid, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Suriñach, J (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, AQR Res Grp, Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",jsurinach@ub.edu,"Suriñach, Jordi/E-6801-2016","Romani, Javier/0000-0001-7998-1056; Surinach, Jordi/0000-0003-2622-3280","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CSO2014-55780-C3-2-P, ECO2013-41022-R]; Diputacio de Barcelona, Area de Desenvolupament Economic Local","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Diputacio de Barcelona, Area de Desenvolupament Economic Local","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Javier Romani acknowledges support of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under grant CSO2014-55780-C3-2-P (National R&D&I Plan).

C. This paper provides a model of the birth of coinage that brings these advances into a broad analysis of the subject-matter. It pulls together many factors that are often treated separately. In addition, the model yields one important new result. Contrary to popular assumption, early coinage was not highly profitable. The Lydian government and the Greek city-states provided an extremely wide array of denominations of coins in a single precious metal at considerable cost. Their willingness to bear this cost must have reflected a political strategy of promoting coinage. Such a political strategy would also be easy to explain. As a large payer and recipient of money in the form of precious metals, the government had much to gain from the spread of coinage in order to economize on transaction costs in its own affairs.","[Melitz, Jacques] ENSAE, Malakoff, France; [Melitz, Jacques] CEPII, Paris, France",Institut Polytechnique de Paris,"Melitz, J (通讯作者)，ENSAE, Malakoff, France.;Melitz, J (通讯作者)，CEPII, Paris, France.",j.melitz@hw.ac.uk,,,,,,,70,1,1,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

Much of the analysis of this issue has adopted a supply side perspective informed by the values of the orthodox scientific model of biomedical innovation, arguing that national and transnational regulation has failed to impose appropriate standards on the illicit' supply of stem cell treatments. In contrast, this paper shows how and why the analysis of global stem cell innovation governance must incorporate the market and health consumer demand into the conceptual framework. Central to the argument is the role of innovation models in mediating the relationship between demand and supply in the global market of new stem cell treatments. Different models of scientific and medical innovation mediate that relationship in different ways and, in jurisdictions where health consumer demand is frustrated, may result in parallel political demands for change in stem cell innovation governance. Such demands are likely to be resisted by the dominant scientific model, producing a further response from health consumers and a continuing dynamic in the political economy of stem cell treatments.","[Salter, Brian] Kings Coll London, Dept Polit Econ, Polit, London, England; [Zhou, Yinhua; Datta, Saheli] Kings Coll London, Dept Polit Econ, London, England",University of London; King's College London; University of London; King's College London,"Salter, B (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept Polit Econ, Polit, London, England.",brian.g.salter@kcl.ac.uk,"Zhou, Yinhua/G-5306-2010; Datta Burton, Saheli/IZE-7105-2023","Salter, Brian/0000-0002-0779-2712; Datta Burton, Saheli/0000-0001-8268-9013",ESRC Rising Powers programme [ES/J012521/1]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J012521/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/J012521/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC Rising Powers programme(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The research for this article was conducted as part of the work of the project 'State strategies of governance in global biomedical innovation: the impact of China and India', funded under the ESRC Rising Powers programme, grant reference ES/J012521/1.",,79,10,10,1,52,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

In contrast, small-scale farms, particularly those involved in cattle and wheat production, have struggled to manage the uncertainty brought by price tumult. The paper goes on to examine the role that these uneven distributional dynamics play in debates around how hedging and speculation should be defined and regulated in the wake of the food crisis of 2007-08. It shows that a coalition of small-scale farmers has actively pushed for a far-reaching definition of speculation and concomitantly wide-ranging curbs on what they deem to be speculative activity. Conversely, the major commodity traders and a plurality of organizations representing large-scale grain producers have called for a narrower interpretation of speculation which leaves the extant regulatory regime largely in place. With these insights, I suggest that financialization and associated price volatility tend to reinforce inequality in rural America while possibly exacerbating social instability and hardship abroad.","[Baines, Joseph] Kings Coll London, Dept European & Int Studies, London, England",University of London; King's College London,"Baines, J (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept European & Int Studies, London, England.",joseph.baines@kcl.ac.uk,,"Baines, Joseph/0000-0002-0554-2998",,,,,86,20,21,0,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Inadequately developed financial sector that does not provide suitable financing to innovative firms can be damaging to the overall innovation activity in transition countries. The main focus of this paper is related to the predictors of access to finance difficulties in the aftermath of the economic crisis in post-transition countries. The empirical analysis is based on the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS V) data for 30 post-transition countries. We estimate probability of considering access to finance as a business obstacle corrected for the decision to apply for financing employing Heckman selection estimation procedure. Results reveal that innovative firms are more likely to apply for financing, probably as a consequence of constrained internal resources. Older and larger firms as well as those that expect their business growth in the future are also more likely to apply for financing. At the same time, establishments belonging to a larger enterprise are less likely to apply for financing, probably due to available internal sources. Firms with female top management according to our estimates are less likely to apply for financing as well as small and micro firms. When it comes to perceptions on access to finance as an obstacle for doing business we have established that older and larger enterprises, private firms or those established as joint ventures (i.e. more oriented towards market principles) and those with positive expectations towards their future business activities are less likely to perceive access to finance as major obstacle. Whether an enterprise is innovative or not has no bearing on the perceptions of access to finance, after controlling for application to finance mechanism.","[Botric, Valerija; Bozic, Ljiljana] Inst Econ Zagreb, Trg JF Kennedy 7, Zagreb, Croatia",Institute of Economics Zagreb (EIZ),"Botric, V (通讯作者)，Inst Econ Zagreb, Trg JF Kennedy 7, Zagreb, Croatia.",vbotric@eizg.hr,"Božić, Ljiljana/I-6327-2019",,,,,,44,1,1,0,6,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2017,,,,,,,28,41,,10.18502/kss.v1i2.645,0.0,,,14,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BJ1DU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417433200003,0

Retaining and attracting talented young people may be at the heart of growing a high prosperity of cities. As we know young people are the most likely demographic group to move. The primary challenge for cities is to create places that young talents not only visit, but also treat as attractive places to study, work and live. Therefore, it is important to conduct studies to identify factors affecting city liveability perception and people's decisions regarding the choice of a city as a place to live, study and work. The main aim of the paper is to determine the perception of Wroclaw's attractiveness as a city to live and identify the impact of selected factors affecting city liveability perception. The logit model is used for the assessment of the effects of explanatory factors on the chance that Wroclaw is perceived as a good place to live. The analysis is made basing on real data from the survey on the attractiveness of Wroclaw through the eyes of international students. We focused on evaluating the overall perception of the liveability of the city, in relation to perception of Wroclaw's liveability for different groups of residents. We also tested if perception of Wroclaw as a liveable city depends significantly on the national wealth of home country of international students. We discuss the findings and provide some managerial implications regarding city development and implications for future research.","[Daszkiewicz, Magdalena] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Econ Sci, Dept Mkt Res, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland; [Mazurek, Edyta] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Management Comp Sci & Finance, Dept Stat, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business; Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Daszkiewicz, M (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Econ Sci, Dept Mkt Res, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",magdalena.daszkiewicz@ue.wroc.pl; edyta.mazurek@ue.wroc.pl,"Mazurek, Edyta/R-1376-2018; Daszkiewicz, Magdalena/P-3016-2018","Daszkiewicz, Magdalena/0000-0003-1466-2454",,,,,23,0,0,0,2,WYDAWNICTWO UNIW EKONOMICZNEGO & WROCLAWIU,WROCLAW,"UL KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WROCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",2453-9902,,978-83-7695-693-0,APPLI MATH STAT ECON,Applications of Mathematics and Statistics in Economics Conference Proceedings,,2017,,,,,,,75,87,,10.15611/amse.2017.20.06,0.0,,,13,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BP1SD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540714200006,0

Thus, the theoretical framework of this work relies on Bourdieu's theory of practice and its definition of social capital. The research adopts a qualitative approach by using the method of phenomenological interviewing. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted on a sample of ten entrepreneurs in the Northwest Croatia. The research material was analysed by coding technique. In the first stage of the analysis of empirical material, open coding is performed. In the second stage, focused coding is performed. Research results show the diversity of strong and weak ties that represent a significant resource for entrepreneurs in creative and cultural industries.

This paper investigates automotive early adopter attitudes toward FCVs by performing interviews with high-end BEV owners. This sample was chosen as based on a preceding study it was expected that these adopters would have a greater level of awareness and knowledge of FCVs compared to the general population. It was expected that this would lead to more insightful results. In this study 5 consumer barriers to FCV adoption emerge. These are; the lack of hydrogen infrastructure, the source of hydrogen, the inability of FCVs to be recharged from home, cost issues and also concerns about hydrogen safety. This paper goes on to make recommendations on how to solve these consumer barriers stating that; hydrogen infrastructure needs to be pre-developed, hydrogen should be sustainably generated, FCVs should have the ability to be partially charged at home, hydrogen fuel will need to be subsidised in the early market, vehicles need to be positioned in the correct markets, and safety concerns can be mitigated partly through education and outreach. Finally this paper finds that consumers do desire the range of a FCV and there is also consumer demand for FCVs ability to provide emergency back-up power.

The main benefit of the service, for the individual client, is the expertice, individual care, independence, availability of services regardless of the opening hours of financial instituions. The research paper is processed by using specific methods that were selected with an emphasis on the need to generate background data in order to build the Model of stability of the portfolio for mortgage financing. There were used especially those methods: (1) semi-structured interviews with financial intermediaries, (2) questionnaires, (3) analysis of existing financial portfolios, (4) analysis of the supply of mortgage loans from specific banks in the Slovak Republic. The output is the Model of stability of the portfolio for mortgage financing. The model provides the background data for right decisions in the process of applying for a mortgage. Functionality of Model of stability of the portfolio for mortgage financing will be verified by application to particular cases of client's portfolios. The proposed Model of stability of the portfolio for mortgage financing will benefit the applicants for a mortgage, because model provides them the information if their actual revenue is high enough for the requested mortgage. Nowadays many people have turned for advice to financial advisors and intermediaries. The proposed Model of stability of the portfolio for mortgage financing provides the opportunity to check the suitability of the proposed solution, not just blindly trust the skills and knowledge adviser or intermediary. Finally, it may be beneficial for intermediaries and consultants.","[Janac, Jan; Mariak, Vladimir] Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Bratislava, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Janac, J (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Bratislava, Slovakia.",jan.janac@fm.uniba.sk; vladimir.mariak@fm.uniba.sk,,,,,,,18,0,0,1,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,335,342,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8SX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428763000034,0

A growing number of studies have demonstrated that service capabilities are related to competitive advantage and organizational performance. When encountering an environment characterized by economic uncertainty, the shipping industry was required to emphasize dynamic capabilities associated with adaptation to sustain competitive advantage. The purpose of this study was to examine the linkages between dynamic capabilities, service capabilities, competitive advantage, and organizational performance in container shipping using data surveys from 134 respondents in container shipping firms in Taiwan. Exploratory factor analysis was employed to identify the crucial dimensions underlying dynamic capabilities, and service capabilities. Furthermore, structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the research hypotheses. The research findings indicated that dynamic capabilities positively influenced both competitive advantage and service capabilities. Service capabilities and competitive advantage were positively related to organizational performance. Practical implications of the research findings for container shipping firms are discussed.

In order to fight unemployment and social exclusion, Latin American countries have introduced public policies and programs focused on the Social and Solidarity Economy. One of this programs is Spinning the Development implemented by the National Institute of the Popular and Solidarity Economy from Ecuador. The objective of this program is to eliminate barriers to early childhood and basic level education by giving free uniforms to pupils. Additionally, the program aims to improve live conditions of micro and small size companies from the textile and clothing manufacturing sector by offering them the possibility to access public contracts for the production of scholar uniforms. The first years' results of the implementation of this program show that the contracts closed with sole proprietorship have not contributed to strengthening these businesses. In the last cycle 2015-2016, the program has given priority in the award of contracts to formal business partnerships. This practically presses these businesses to work on partnerships, which is contrary to the concept of a partnership based on the voluntary union of people for reaching a goal. Therefore, for a long term survival of these partnerships, their goal must go beyond of achieving public contracts for the production of uniforms. In this research the relational coordination model has been applied to evaluate the quality of relationships among the partners belonging to business partnerships from the program Spinning the Development in Tungurahua, Ecuador, and its impact on perceived advantages and satisfaction with the partnership results. By using a Structural Equations Model analysis it is shown that trough relational coordination mechanisms business partnerships can improve the quality of relationships among their partners, the perceived advantages of the partnership and the satisfaction with its results.","[Maria Margalina, Vasilica; Coba Molina, Edisson Marcelo] Univ Tecn Ambato, Ambato, Ecuador; [de Pablos Heredero, Carmen] Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Tecnica de Ambato; Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Margalina, VM (通讯作者)，Univ Tecn Ambato, Ambato, Ecuador.",mm.vasilica@uta.edu.ec; carmen.depablos@urjc.es; edisoncoba@uta.edu.ec,"De Pablos, Carmen/A-3519-2014; Margalina, Vasilica-Maria/P-8451-2018; Coba, Edisson/P-9735-2018","De Pablos, Carmen/0000-0003-0457-3730; Margalina, Vasilica-Maria/0000-0002-8479-8966; Coba, Edisson/0000-0003-4548-948X",,,,,37,0,0,0,6,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,631,640,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8SX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428763000066,0

We conduct an empirical comparison of out-of-sample predictive performance against some well-established univariate alternatives. We use daily S&P500 logarithmic returns and investigate sequences of 1525 density forecasts for horizons of 1 to 6 trading days ahead (3rd of January, 2011 till 30th of December, 2016) and the training sample begins on 3rd of January, 2006. We obtain the density forecasts using Bayesian methods. A general Beta-Gen-t-EGARCH model dominates other specifications in terms of criteria for density forecast comparison like LPS and CRPS. Moreover, it provides best estimates of Value-at-Risk. In general the results indicate the importance of asymmetric modelling of the news impact curve and of heavy-tailed conditional distribution, which is not unexpected; the results also suggest importance of tail asymmetry which is not addressed here.","[Mazur, Blazej] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Econometr & Operat Res, Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Mazur, B (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Econometr & Operat Res, Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",blazej.mazur@uek.krakow.pl,"Mazur, Błażej/V-3905-2018","Mazur, Błażej/0000-0001-5096-5175",,,,,10,0,0,0,1,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-65173-85-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,251,260,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ0TS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417167000026,0

These mergers form part of the structural reforms of local self-government. where technical aspects of local government operation are targeted. To be specific, it is assumed, among other things, that municipal mergers and the subsequent consolidation of local government units would enable achieving economies of scale and subsequently reduce costs. This paper presents theoretical considerations on the reasons for municipal mergers, and subsequently, practical evidence on the outcome of these processes in various countries is also presented. The paper also focuses on the driving factors of mergers and extrapolates them for the potential of municipal mergers in the Slovenian context.

In order to contribute to the discussion we focus on interstate conflicts with territorial disputes. So far, this debate has been highlighted by Liberals, whose argument was that trade promotes peace. However, our argument is built on the theoretical basis of Realism. We argue that the positive impact of economic interdependence is actually a myth, since it does not raise the levels of national security of the threatened state, therefore it cannot be considered as a power-balancing factor. In order to support our argument we developed an analytical framework, which consists of variables representing economic interdependence and national security. Trade, FDI, energy supply, economic agreements and membership in common economic or monetary organizations are variables that show the level of economic interdependence. Military expenditures, number of violations, possession of nuclear weapons and membership in military alliances are variables that show the level of national security respectively. First, we determine, through objective and subjective factors, which of the two rivals is the threatened state. Second, comparing indicators of economic power, we define the asymmetry in economic interdependence. Third, we analyze the indicators of economic interdependence between the rivals and we examine their impact on the national security of the threatened state. To support our opinion that asymmetric economic interdependence has no impact on national security in this paper we examine the territorial conflict in Senkaku/Diaoyu islands between Japan and the People's Republic of China. We conclude that asymmetric economic interdependence is not a power-balancing factor and it has no positive effects on the national security of the threatened state.","[Poufinas, Thomas] Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Econ, Univ Campus, Komotini 69100, Greece; [Pistikou, Victoria] Univ Peloponnese, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, 1 Aristotelous & Athinon Ave, Korinth 20132, Greece",,"Poufinas, T (通讯作者)，Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Econ, Univ Campus, Komotini 69100, Greece.",tpoufina@econ.duth.gr,"Pistikou, Victoria/AAM-7188-2021",,,,,,21,0,0,0,6,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2017,,,,,,,142,159,,10.18502/kss.v1i2.653,0.0,,,18,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BJ1DU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417433200011,0

The negotiators of the TPP aspired to create a next-generation transformative agreement' that would address a new trade agenda focused on regulatory coherence and business facilitation. The expectation was that this agenda would generate a 21st Century trade politics that would be less contentious, at least among business actors, than traditional negotiations on market access. Studies of another Mega-FTA under negotiation, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) that has a similar agenda found unified business support for the agreement domestically and the emergence of transnational business coalitions in support of the agreement. Recent theorising on trade politics suggests, however, that global value chains (GVCs) that involve vertical intra-industry trade introduce traditional' distributional issues that will divide business interests domestically - and, in the case of GVCs organised on different geographical bases, internationally as well. This cleavage was evident in the TPP negotiations, unlike those for TTIP, as were other divisions among business - both domestically and across countries - over the sharing of existing rents and of new rents generated by regulatory harmonisation.","[Ravenhill, John] Balsillie Sch Int Affairs, Waterloo, ON, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Ravenhill, J (通讯作者)，Balsillie Sch Int Affairs, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",jravenhill@thebsia.ca,"Ravenhill, John/AAA-3836-2019",,,,,,122,26,25,2,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

We show that these price caps create a need for subsidies and cross-subsidies, and affect the economics of wind power. We model the price caps using a mixed complementarity formulation, calibrated to 2012 data. We find that the caps impose an annual cost of 45 billion RMB, alter the generation and fuel mixes, require subsidies for the market to clear, and do not incentivize adding capacity for a reserve margin. They incentivize market concentration so that generators can cross-subsidize power plants. Depending on the regulatory response, increasing wind capacity can alleviate the distortions due to the price caps. The added wind capacity, however, does not have a significant impact on the amount of coal consumed. We also find that the feed-in tariff was priced slightly higher than necessary.","[Rioux, Bertrand; Galkin, Philipp; Murphy, Frederic; Pierru, Axel] KAPSARC, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Murphy, Frederic] Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Pierru, A (通讯作者)，KAPSARC, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",Axel.Pierru@kapsarc.org,,"Williams-Rioux, Bertrand/0000-0003-0518-5609",,,,,35,10,10,1,9,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2017,38.0,,,,1,,63,75,,10.5547/01956574.38.SI1.brio,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EW9PI,,"Green Published, hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402851300006,0

The assessment of the situation in the labour market for each of the municipalities is made with the use of two characteristics: the share of registered unemployed persons in the number of the working age population and the number of business entities per 10 000 working age population. The spatial and spatio-temporal tendencies and dependences are in turn investigated using the conception of spatial trends and spatial autocorrelation. The empirical analyses have been supplemented by simulations of the labour market situation in the province resulting from situation improvement in selected urban centres.","[Szulc, Elzbieta; Jankiewicz, Mateusz] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Econ Sci & Management, Gagarina 13A, PL-87100 Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Szulcl, E (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Econ Sci & Management, Gagarina 13A, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",eszulc@.umk.pl; mateuszj@doktorant.umk.pl,"Jankiewicz, Mateusz MJ/C-6657-2019","Jankiewicz, Mateusz MJ/0000-0002-4713-778X",,,,,11,1,1,0,0,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-65173-85-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,397,406,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ0TS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417167000041,0

Yet little is known about what are the sources of value and the effects of contract control mechanisms for value appropriation. This paper explores this issue from the perspectives of both public sector agencies and private sector firms involved in the provision of toll roads. Using data collected from a stated choice experiment on toll road participation to obtain a composite measure of resource values, we find that resource values have little influence on decisions to form a partnership, while partner's (un)trustworthiness and social activism by external stakeholders have a discernible effect on their decisions. Mitigating controls moderate these influences. An internal coordination framework within the public organization and the enactment of institutional policy can help to reap the most from the combined resources for shared value creation, particularly when trust is yet to be established during the contracting phase.","[Chung, Demi] Univ New S Wales, Sch Accounting, Business Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Hensher, David A.] Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Sydney,"Hensher, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",Demi.chung@unsw.edu.au; David.Hensher@sydney.edu.au,,"Hensher, David/0000-0003-0058-2242",,,,,40,12,17,1,58,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

The model applies the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform to US quarterly GDP data and then uses the decomposed variables to build a large 80-dimensional state-space linear-quadratic tracking model. Using a political targeting design for the frequency range weights, we simulate jointly optimal fiscal and monetary policy where: (1) both fiscal and monetary policy are dually emphasized, (2) fiscal policy is unrestricted while monetary policy is restricted to achieving a steady increase in the market interest rate, (3) only monetary policy is relatively active, while fiscal spending is restricted to achieving a target growth rate, and (4) monetary policy emphasizes short-run stabilization, while fiscal policy utilizes political cycle targeting. The results show that fiscal policy must be more aggressive when the monetary authorities are not accommodating the fiscal expansion and that the dual-emphasis policy leads to a series of interest rate increases that are balanced between a steadily increasing target and a low, fixed rate. This research is the first to construct integrated fiscal and monetary policies in an applied wavelet-based optimal control setting using US data.","[Crowley, Patrick M.] Texas A&M Univ, Coll Business, Dept Decis Sci & Econ, OCNR 373,6300 Ocean Dr, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA; [Hudgins, David] Texas A&M Univ, Coll Business, Dept Decis Sci & Econ, OCNR 314,6300 Ocean Dr, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University System,"Hudgins, D (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Coll Business, Dept Decis Sci & Econ, OCNR 314,6300 Ocean Dr, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA.",patrick.crowley@tamucc.edu; david.hudgins@tamucc.edu,,"Crowley, Patrick M./0000-0003-2796-6975",,,,,25,8,9,1,9,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Household debt appears to be expansionary in developing countries whereas contractionary in developed countries. Nonfinancial corporation debt appears to have no impact on developing countries but negative impact on developed countries.

One of the explanations advanced for these declines is the urbanisation of young adults, their growing concentration in the denser areas of larger cities. This study analyses the changing spatial patterns and travel behaviour of young adults over time using a complete national dataset for England between 2001 and 2011. It uses a fractional response model to analyse the changing relationship between the proportion of young adults driving to work, and using public transport to get to work, and population density and settlement size. It finds that urbanisation contributed to less driving and more public transport use amongst young adults aged 1634. These changes followed a change in national planning policy which encouraged higher density development in urban areas. These policies caused a re-urbanisation of the population as a whole, with the strongest trends amongst young adults. The re-urbanisation of the population was accompanied by a widening of the differentials in travel behaviour between those in the densest areas and the largest settlements (who drove less) and the rest. These findings cast new light on the controversy over residential self-selection. They suggest that a change in planning policy probably caused a modest national fall in driving. Residential self-selection, which is often considered a barrier to such policies, facilitated those outcomes.","[Melia, Steve; Chatterjee, Kiron] Univ West England, Ctr Transport & Soc, Coldharbour Lane, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England; [Stokes, Gordon] Univ Oxford, Transport Studies Unit, Oxford, England",University of West England; University of Oxford,"Melia, S (通讯作者)，Univ West England, Ctr Transport & Soc, Coldharbour Lane, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England.",steve.melia@uwe.ac.uk,,,UK Department for Transport,UK Department for Transport,"The research reported in this paper was largely carried out as part of the 'Young People's Travel Behaviour' project which was commissioned and funded by the UK Department for Transport.

With a large market but lacking fossil fuels, the EU attempted to achieve its aims mostly through regulatory power. However, both the Russian and the EU external energy policy strategies have recently become more nuanced.

To our knowledge, this is the first paper to find strong evidence for club convergence of retail prices. These clubs emerge due to the interaction of traded and nontraded factors. For example, countries physically closer to potential trade partners converge faster than countries in the high distance regime as long as they have low initial labor productivity or low initial income. Moreover, we find an asymmetry in the extent that arbitrage opportunities related to international trade are exploited, with low initial price regime countries exhibiting faster convergence from below than high initial price regime countries exhibit from above, consistent with less resistance to exporting than to importing due to political economy considerations. We interpret our findings as evidence of a local law of one price due to barriers to price convergence influencing the duration of the effect of price shocks.","[Glushenkova, Marina] Univ Nottingham Ningbo China, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Kourtellos, Andros; Zachariadis, Marios] Univ Cyprus, Dept Econ, POB 537, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus",University of Nottingham Ningbo China; University of Cyprus,"Zachariadis, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cyprus, Dept Econ, POB 537, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus.",zachariadis@ucy.ac.cy,"Glushenkova, MARINA/AAC-9443-2019; Zachariadis, Marios/S-1140-2017","Glushenkova, MARINA/0000-0002-4206-3697; Zachariadis, Marios/0000-0002-2308-1881",,,,,36,1,1,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0883-7252,1099-1255,,J APPL ECONOMET,J.

We adopt a randomized correspondence audit design by sending inquiry emails to randomly selected property owners or agents from Craigslist. The signals are conveyed by names, body text, and signature-line quotations. The findings suggest landlords have preferences about tenants and make decisions based on signals communicated in inquiry emails from potential applicants.

In the short-run version of the SP experiment, the respondents receive information about available travel options shortly before they had planned to travel. In the long-run version, the respondents receive information about available travel options one month ahead of the planned travel. The short-run context concerns temporary changes in available travel options, while the long-run context concerns permanent changes. We find significantly higher valuations of trip attributes in the long-run context. Moreover, our results indicate that the usual arrival time at work as well as the intrinsically preferred arrival time at work serve as reference points in the short-run as well as the long-run choice context, with the former dominating in the short-run context and the latter in the long-run context.","[Peer, Stefanie] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria; [Peer, Stefanie] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Borjesson, Maria] VTI Swedish Natl Rd & Transport Res Inst, Stockholm, Sweden; [Borjesson, Maria] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Stockholm, Sweden",Vienna University of Economics & Business; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; VTI; Royal Institute of Technology,"Peer, S (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria.",stefanie.peer@wu.ac.at,,"Peer, Stefanie/0000-0002-6106-8741; Borjesson, Maria/0000-0001-9235-0232",Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment; ERA-NET Cofund Smart Cities and Communities (IP-SUNTAN),Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment; ERA-NET Cofund Smart Cities and Communities (IP-SUNTAN),"The authors wish to thank the anonymous referees for their constructive suggestions.

Examples of these measures are use of public transport, cycling, walking, energy efficient vehicles, biofuels. The challenge before transport decision makers is which one(s) to choose for implementation as often there is no or limited quantitative data available on the subject. Moreover, the context of each city, its geographic and transport conditions restrict the generalization of results obtained in experienced cities. In this paper, we are investigating application of ideal solution based multicriteria decision making (MCDM) techniques namely fuzzy TOPSIS, fuzzy VIKOR, and fuzzy GRA for sustainability evaluation of urban mobility projects. A real application for city of Luxembourg is provided. Three projects are evaluated namely implementation of a new tramway in the city center of Luxembourg, re-organization of existing bus lines in the city to perform optimized service, and implementation of electric vehicle car-sharing stations in the city. Sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the influence of input parameters on modeling results. The proposed work is one of the first few works to investigate application of ideal-solution based multicriteria decision making techniques for sustainability evaluation of urban mobility projects under uncertainty. Besides, the best alternative is selected using veto thereby overcoming the limitations of single MCDM methods.","[Awasthi, Anjali] Concordia Univ, CIISE, EV 7-636,1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd West, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada; [Omrani, Hichem; Gerber, Philippe] CEPS INSTEAD, 3 Ave Fonte, L-4364 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg",Concordia University - Canada,"Awasthi, A (通讯作者)，Concordia Univ, CIISE, EV 7-636,1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd West, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada.",awasthi@ciise.concordia.ca; hichem.omrani@ceps.lu; philippe.gerber@ceps.lu,"Omrani, Hichem/C-9647-2013; Gerber, Philippe/I-5786-2019; Omrani, Hichem/AAP-8294-2021","Omrani, Hichem/0000-0003-1484-3028; Gerber, Philippe/0000-0003-2324-5708;",,,,,63,69,71,4,73,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,1879-2375,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

The analysis is based on time series data for the Swedish ski lift industry spanning from 1980 to 2017. Since 1970, snow depth in winter sport destinations has decreased markedly by about 5 cm per decade. Estimations based on the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model show that revenues (in constant prices) of ski lift operators are significantly positively related to natural snow conditions, given the impact of relative prices and real GDP. However, ARDL estimations with rolling windows reveal that the sensitivity of revenues from ski lift ticket sales to variations in snow depth is declining over time. For the subsamples starting at the end of 1980s onward, revenues no longer significantly depend on natural snow depth. This is likely due to the implementation of adaptation measures such as investments in snowmaking facilities.","[Falk, Martin] Austrian Inst Econ Res, Vienna, Austria; [Lin, Xiang] Sodertorn Univ, Alfred Nobels Alle 7, S-14189 Huddinge, Sweden",Sodertorn University,"Lin, X (通讯作者)，Sodertorn Univ, Alfred Nobels Alle 7, S-14189 Huddinge, Sweden.",xiang.lin@sh.se,"Lin, Xiang/AAG-3795-2022; Lin, Xiang/AFK-5217-2022; Falk, Martin Thomas/T-8325-2019","Falk, Martin Thomas/0000-0003-0518-6513; Lin, Xiang/0000-0003-3747-9038",,,,,60,15,15,0,35,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

A smaller literature has begun to examine the intergenerational impacts of in utero conditions. A link between these two literatures-the impacts of in utero conditions on family formation-has had few examinations but offers a potential set of mechanisms for the intergenerational reach of early conditions. This paper draws from the 1960 US Decennial Census to examine whether individuals exposed in utero to the 1918/19 influenza pandemic had different family formation patterns than adjacent unexposed cohorts. The findings suggest small overall effects on marriage rates, number of children, and several measures of type of spouse for men, but moderate effects for women. For example, women with in utero exposure during their first trimester marry men with 0.2 fewer years of schooling than those not exposed. The findings show that exposed individuals have spouses with lower schooling than unexposed counterparts, this effect is particularly large for women, and it increases the likelihood of marrying spouses with very low levels of schooling.

This study examines the effects of proximity to a Mexican restaurant-the dominant type of ethnic fast casual restaurant-on maternal and child health. I match data on the complete residential addresses of all mothers who gave birth in the Miami metropolitan area between 1990 and 2009 to a time series of all establishments (restaurants and stores) selling food and drink. This unique data set allows me to use mother fixed effects and to exploit the variation over time of the food environment to identify the effects on maternal weight gain and childbirth outcomes. The results show that living in proximity to a Mexican restaurant is associated with an 8% lower likelihood of excessive weight gain among US-born mothers. These effects are concentrated in low-income neighborhoods and among members of disadvantaged groups (e.g., low-skilled, young, and African American individuals). However, the results show no protective effect for foreign-born mothers. Lastly, there is no evidence of significant effects on other maternal outcomes or on various child health metrics at birth.

We perform the selection of the relevant covariates with a state-of-the-art penalized-likelihood estimation procedure relying on L-1-penalty terms. A simulation study indicates that this approach efficiently selects covariates of interest and tackles spurious regression issues encountered when dealing with integrated time series.

Coherence within EPG exists, though it varies across issues, EPGs and between election years examined: it is greater on European integration than on left-right issues and it is particularly high for right wing eurosceptics though for most parties it deteriorates between 2009 and 2014.","[Lefkofridi, Zoe] Univ Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria; [Katsanidou, Alexia] GESIS Leibniz Inst Social Sci, Mannheim, Germany; [Katsanidou, Alexia] Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany",Salzburg University; Leibniz Institut fur Sozialwissenschaften (GESIS); University of Cologne,"Lefkofridi, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Salzburg, Dept Polit Sci, Comparat Polit, Rudolfskai 42, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria.;Lefkofridi, Z (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, European Governance & Polit Program EGPP, Robert Schuman Ctr Adv Studies, Florence, Italy.",zoe.lefkofridi@sbg.ac.at,"Katsanidou, Alexia/AAA-4803-2022","Katsanidou, Alexia/0000-0001-5187-5171",,,,,49,21,21,2,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Using cohort fixed effects and county fixed effects, I find that among black mothers in Southern regions, school desegregation reduces preterm births by 1.7 percentage points. These results are robust to county-specific cohort trends, county-specific year trends, and state-specific cohort fixed effects. In addition, school desegregation increases maternal education and prenatal care in the first trimester and decreases the likelihood of the child having a teenage father. These may be important pathways to improved infant health. This paper adds to the growing literature on the importance of school desegregation in areas beyond academic achievement.

To do this, we derive fractional Black-Scholes equation by creating a self-financing portfolio strategy under Leland's strategy. Then, we use the Mellin transform method for solving this equation and obtain the price of a European option as a particular case of the proposed solution. A sensitivity analysis is carried out through numerical experiments which shows the differences between Black-Scholes model and the fractional Black-Scholes model. Moreover, an empirical analysis shows that the fractional Black-Scholes model with Hurst exponent greater than one-half is more precise to predict the real market prices than the classical Black-Sholes model.","[Mehrdoust, Farshid; Najafi, Ali Reza] Univ Guilan, Fac Math Sci, Dept Appl Math, POB 41938-1914, Rasht, Iran",University of Guilan,"Mehrdoust, F (通讯作者)，Univ Guilan, Fac Math Sci, Dept Appl Math, POB 41938-1914, Rasht, Iran.",far.mehrdoust@gmail.com,"Najafi, Ali Reza/ABA-6686-2020","Najafi, Ali Reza/0000-0002-5148-571X",Iran National Science Foundation (INSF) [92038581],Iran National Science Foundation (INSF)(Iran National Science Foundation (INSF)),The authors would like to thank the referees for very constructive suggestions.

Based on the realization that outputs of complex activity-travel decisions form a continuous pattern in space-time dimension, the estimation framework is treated as a pattern selection problem. In particular, we define a variant of HAPP that has capabilities of forecasting activity selection and durations in addition to activity sequencing. The framework is comprised of three steps, (i) choice set generation, (ii) choice set individualization and (iii) model estimation. The estimation results show that utilities for work, shopping and disutilities for travel time, time outside home, and average tour delay are found to be significant in activity-travel decision making.","[Xu, Zhiheng; Kang, Jee Eun] Univ Buffalo, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Chen, Roger] Rochester Inst Technol, Golisano Inst Sustainabil, Rochester, NY 14623 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; Rochester Institute of Technology,"Kang, JE (通讯作者)，Univ Buffalo, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",jeeeunka@buffalo.edu,,"Xu, Zhiheng/0000-0002-1486-6732; Chen, Roger/0000-0002-0528-6007","Region II University Transportation Research Center (UTRC); US National Science Foundation (NSF); Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn [1536918] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Region II University Transportation Research Center (UTRC); US National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))","This work, in part, has been funded by the Region II University Transportation Research Center (UTRC) and the US National Science Foundation (NSF).

It is hardly a surprise that all across Europe, but especially in high corruption risk countries, it is a primary target of corrupt elites. This article provides a state-ofthe-art review of the literature on the cost of corruption and estimates the level of corruption risks and associated costs in European infrastructure development and maintenance in 2009-2014 using novel data on over 40,000 government contracts. Two forms of corruption costs are investigated in the empirical section: (1) distorting spending structure and project design, and (2) inflating prices. Findings indicate that corruption steers infrastructure spending towards high value as opposed to small value investment projects. It also inflates prices by 30-35% on average with largest excesses in high corruption risk regions. Contrary to perceptions, corruption risks in infrastructure are decoupled to a considerable extent from the national corruption environment.

First, using evidence from chain bankruptcies and data on 12 million to 18 million establishments per year, we show that large retailers produce significant positive spillovers. Second, local governments respond to the size of these externalities. When a town's boundaries allow it to capture a larger share of retail spillovers, it is more likely to offer retail subsidies. Third, these subsidies partially crowd out private sector mechanisms that also subsidize large retailers, such as shopping malls. These facts provide powerful evidence of the Coase theorem at work and highlight a concern for local development policies even when externalities can be targeted.","[Shoag, Daniel] Harvard Kennedy Sch, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Veuger, Stan] Amer Enterprise Inst Publ Policy Res, Washington, DC USA",Harvard University; American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research,"Shoag, D (通讯作者)，Harvard Kennedy Sch, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,63,17,21,1,11,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Scholars have argued that a normative power has to meet certain discursive standards; representing others in a non-antagonistic, humble way.

The empirical enquiry establishes that while the EU High Commissioner communicates in line with the stipulated standards, the newly established East Stratcom Taskforce and its publication Disinformation Digest' diverges from this ideal. The establishment of the Taskforce has led to the EU losing reflexivity and normative power.

All the variables were found to be stationary based on recent panel unit root tests. On fully applying both static (OLS, FE, and RE) and dynamic (system GMM) panel data approaches, it was found that there is a relationship between CO2-GDP that foregrounds the Kuznets curve for individual cases. In fact, the Kuznets curve is valid in the BRICTS countries. This validation is strengthened through the relationship between emissions and population density, as well as between CO2 emissions and FDI inflows. The overall results showed that the population density and FDI inflows initially increased, which reduced the CO2 emissions as the population and FDI inflows reached the threshold level, thus confirming the FDI halo hypothesis (FDI halo). In contrast, the Kuznets curve between CO2 emissions and economic growth is not valid. This implies that the increase of economic growth impedes the environmental quality. These empirical insights are of particular interest to policymakers as they help build sound economic and energy conservation policies to support the environment quality.","[Abdouli, Mohamed; Hamdi, Besma] Fac Econ & Management Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia; [Kamoun, Olfa] Higher Sch Econ & Commercial Sci Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia",Universite de Sfax,"Abdouli, M; Hamdi, B (通讯作者)，Fac Econ & Management Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia.;Kamoun, O (通讯作者)，Higher Sch Econ & Commercial Sci Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia.",mohamedabdouli3@gmail.com; olfakamoun@yahoo.fr; hamdibes2014@gmail.com,,"Hamdi, Besma/0000-0001-7577-5474",,,,,60,47,47,1,53,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Specifically, we test whether the effect of aid on economic growth is reduced by the share of years a country served on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) in the period the aid is committed, which provides quasi-random variation in aid. Our results show that the effect of aid on growth is significantly lower when aid was committed during a country's tenure on the UNSC. This holds when we restrict the sample to Africa, which follows the strictest norm of rotation on the UNSC and thus where UNSC membership can most reliably be regarded as exogenous. We derive two conclusions from this. First, short-term political favoritism reduces the effectiveness of aid. Second, results of studies using political interest variables as instruments for overall aid arguably estimate the effect of politically motivated aid and thus a lower bound for the effect of all aid.","[Dreher, Axel] Heidelberg Univ, Int & Dev Polit, Alfred Weber Inst Econ, Heidelberg, Germany; [Dreher, Axel] Univ Goettingen, CEPR, Gottingen, Germany; CESifo, Heidelberg, Germany; [Dreher, Axel] KOF Swiss Econ Inst, Heidelberg, Germany; [Eichenauer, Vera Z.] Heidelberg Univ, Heidelberg, Germany; [Gehring, Kai] Univ Zurich, Chair Polit Econ, Zurich, Switzerland",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; University of Gottingen; Ifo Institut; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; University of Zurich,"Dreher, A (通讯作者)，Heidelberg Univ, Int & Dev Polit, Alfred Weber Inst Econ, Heidelberg, Germany.",mail@axel-dreher.de; vera.eichenauer@awi.uni-heidelberg.de; mail@kai-gehring.net,"Dreher, Axel/AAN-1839-2020","Dreher, Axel/0000-0002-7227-3599; Eichenauer, Vera Z./0000-0002-0440-3136; Gehring, Kai/0000-0003-2576-4245",German Research Foundation [DFG GZ: DR 640/2-2],German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We thank the editor Andrew Foster, Angus Deaton, Byungwon Woo, Christian Conrad, Christopher Kilby, Daniel Nielson, Hristos Doucouliagos, Isleide Zissimos, James Snyder, Jamus Lim, Jean-Paul Azam, Jude Hays, Katharina Michaelowa, Kurt Annen, Martin Paldam, Matthias Hartmann, Paul Schaudt, Philip Keefer, Richard Jong-A-Pin, Sarah Bermeo, Sarah Langlotz, Valentin Lang, participants at the 6th Annual Conference on The Political Economy of International Organizations (Mannheim/Heidelberg 2013), the Second Warwick Political Economy Workshop (2013), the Beyond Basic Questions Workshop (Lucerne 2013), the European Public Choice Society Meeting (Zurich 2013), the Conference on Research Frontiers in Foreign Aid (Princeton 2013), the Spring Meeting of Young Economists (Aarhus 2013), the Schliersee Workshop on Public Finance and Political Economy I, the 2013 Silvaplana Workshop in Political Economy, the 2013 annual meeting of the International Political Economy Society at Claremont Graduate School, the Northeast Universities Development Consortium Conference 2013 at Harvard University, the EUDN Scientific Conference 2013, the  Workshop on Political Institutions and Inclusive Development at the Hertie School (Berlin 2014), and at seminars at the Instituto Universitario de Lisboa (ISCTE-IUL), the University of Milano-Bicocca, the University of Auvergne (CERDI), the University of Hamburg, and Heidelberg University for helpful comments.

In particular, we adopt a spike-and-slab prior for the regression coefficients to sidestep the potential complications of highly collinear covariates in the variable selection problems. We find a number of important growth determinants that are distinct from the previous works in the ranking and sign of estimated coefficients, partly because of the presence of highly correlated covariates. Importantly, we find that our results from variable selection are not qualitatively changed when various degrees of freedom for t-errors are considered.

Most scholarship focuses on how given endowments, such as geographic location and existing industries, affect the local economic impacts of these contentious policies. This study considers local actors' room for maneuver by focusing on a controlled case comparison of two city pairs along the Texas-Mexico border. These city pairs possessed very similar resource endowments and formal institutions prior to the enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement, but diverged dramatically afterward in their economic growth patterns. A detailed comparison of policy implementation reveals that distinct local informal institutions were a key source of their economic divergence. The identification of the role of these repertoires of unwritten local habits and practices underscores the potential impact of collaborative efforts on long-term economic outcomes while adding to our understanding of the basis on which such collaborations are built.","[Pipkin, Seth] Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Social Ecol, Urban Planning & Publ Policy, Irvine, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Pipkin, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Social Ecol, Social Ecol 1 218E, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",spipkin@uci.edu,,,,,,,146,2,4,1,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Due to the irreversible nature of housing investment, uncertainty should be an important determinant of housing investment. From a theoretical point of view, though, this impact is ambiguous. This paper extends previous empirical work by employing the techniques of bivariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models in a group of forty-eight US states. In particular, we use data on housing permits as a proxy for housing investment and the house price index for the forty-eight contiguous US states and estimate bivariate GARCH models (BEKK) for each state, in order to obtain proxies of housing investment and house price uncertainty. Moreover, we use the Economic Policy Uncertainty index as an alternative measure of uncertainty. This setup allows us to test for the impact of uncertainty on housing investment growth and house price inflation and examine whether the effects differ across the different states. In general, we find that in most states uncertainty tends to increase housing investment growth and to decrease house price inflation. The cross-state differences in results may be due to variation in the degree of speculation in housing markets.","[Christidou, Maria; Fountas, Stilianos] Univ Macedonia, Dept Econ, 156 Egnatia St, Thessaloniki 54006, Greece",University of Macedonia,"Fountas, S (通讯作者)，Univ Macedonia, Dept Econ, 156 Egnatia St, Thessaloniki 54006, Greece.",sfountas@uom.gr,"Fountas, Stilianos/AAP-7402-2021",,,,,,37,21,22,0,15,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

The Act imposes requirements for specific types of advertising signs, including on-property signs, directional and official signs, and new signs in commercial and industrial areas. Over the years, many issues have been surrounding the Highway Beautification Act, such as attitude and relationship issues, organizational issues, and substantive issues. In order to address the aforementioned issues, this study performs a comprehensive survey among the State Departments of Transportation. Throughout the survey, the data are gathered using a detailed questionnaire, which captures the major aspects of the Federal Outdoor Advertising Control Program. All 50 States and District of Columbia participated in the study. Based on analysis of the collected data, the key regulatory difficulties and inconsistencies, associated with outdoor advertising signs, are determined. A set of baseline standards is proposed to assist the State and Federal agencies with resolving the identified regulatory difficulties and inconsistencies, including the following: lack of uniform requirements in terms of spacing, size, and lighting for advertising signs; clear definition of the areas for effective control; challenges related to the new technologies implementation for outdoor advertising; maintenance and continuation of nonconforming signs; vegetation control challenges; and others. Findings from the conducted survey and the proposed baseline standards are expected to improve effectiveness of the Federal Outdoor Advertising Control Program implementation across the nation.","[Dulebenets, Maxim A.; Ozguven, Eren Erman; Moses, Ren] Florida State Univ, Florida A&M Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 2525 Pottsdamer St,Bldg A,Suite A124, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida A&M University; Florida State University,"Dulebenets, MA (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Florida A&M Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 2525 Pottsdamer St,Bldg A,Suite A124, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA.",mdulebenets@eng.famu.fsu.edu; eozguven@eng.famu.fsu.edu; moses@eng.famu.fsu.edu,"Dulebenets, Maxim A./AAG-2461-2021","Ozguven, Eren/0000-0001-6006-7635",Florida Department of Transportation,Florida Department of Transportation,"This study was supported by the Florida Department of Transportation.

This is analyzed by using data from 7,889 CSOs that are registered in the EU Transparency Register. Two criteria should be met for funding to combat inequalities among CSOs: the funding must support underrepresented interests, and it must increase their participation in the policy process. The results of a logistic regression analysis show that the Commission's funding scheme does support underrepresented interests but makes participation more unequal by also supporting already overrepresented groups. Furthermore, the analysis shows that the probability of a CSO having access to formal channels of participation significantly increases if it has received funding. The conclusion is that funding could be used more efficiently if the Commission were to consistently support underrepresented interests.","[Persson, Thomas; Edholm, Kajsa] Uppsala Univ, Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University,"Persson, T (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Dept Govt, POB 514, SE-75120 Uppsala, Sweden.",thomas.persson@statsvet.uu.se,,"Persson, Thomas/0000-0002-8289-7469",,,,,46,10,10,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

We answer this question by looking at how gay and lesbian employees make sense of their homosexuality in the highly normative context of audit firms. As a first step, we unveil the subtle pressures exerted on those who possess concealable stigmatized identities. Homosexual auditors engage in partial or full concealment of their sexuality. They live in the fear of being misjudged and cast out of a context in which male values are tantamount. However, the efforts required to conceal create a situation of unrest, which eventually interferes with their social integration at work. We draw on rich ethnographic material in French audit firms, benefitting from the exogenous shock of a gay marriage bill. The study's findings shed new light on audit as a gendered profession and the cost of concealing stigmatized invisible identities.","[Stenger, Sebastien] ISG, Accounting & Management Control, Paris, France; [Roulet, Thomas J.] Kings Coll London, 150 Stamford St, London SE1 9NH, England",University of London; King's College London,"Roulet, TJ (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, 150 Stamford St, London SE1 9NH, England.",Thomas.roulet@kcl.ac.uk,"Roulet, Thomas/AAE-1457-2019","Roulet, Thomas/0000-0002-9148-3743",,,,,48,43,48,2,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

It not only increases the amount of water available but also reduces water pollution. The benefits and costs of this practice, and the public perception of reuse are the focus of several studies. However, the evidence on industrial wastewater reuse at the firm level remains scant. This paper is aimed at filling this gap by presenting evidence on the determinants of both wastewater treatment and reuse practices in a developing country context. I use firm level data from the Survey on Firms' Environmental Practices of Ecuador. My results show that wastewater management in general, and reuse in particular, are still limited practices in the industrial sector of the country. My results suggest that firm's decisions to treat and reuse depends on long-term firm's characteristics, such as annual investment, the nature of the production process and local conditions, as well as the scale of production and water consumption. Volumes of wastewater treated and reused depend positively on the amount of water used in the production process and the firm's annual level of investment or expenditure. The cost of the practice only affects the volume treated. The results suggest that targeting water-intensive industry sectors and the costs of wastewater treatment can play an important role for a more sustainable use of water in the industrial sector of Ecuador.","[Zapata, Oscar] Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada",University of Calgary,"Zapata, O (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",ozapata@ucalgary.ca,,"Zapata, Oscar/0000-0001-5453-3564",,,,,32,1,1,1,20,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2382-624X,2382-6258,,WATER ECON POLICY,Water Econ.

The 2008 Mobility in Germany (MiD) and the 2012 California Household Travel Survey (CHTS) provide an opportunity to start filling this gap by teasing out what built environment and socio-economic variables impact the likelihood that a household is carless (voluntarily or not) in Germany and in California, two car-dependent societies with different carless rates. Results from our generalized structural equation models show that in both Germany and California, households who reside in denser neighborhoods, closer to transit stations, and who have a lower income or fewer children, are more likely to be voluntarily carless. However, households with more education are more likely to be voluntarily carless in Germany, whereas the reverse is true in California. Moreover, employment density and public transit have a higher impact on voluntary carlessness in Germany than in California. Our results also show that different socio-economic groups have substantially different residential location preferences in Germany and in California. These differences may be explained by cultural preferences, historical differences in land use and transportation policies, and by the higher cost of owning a motor vehicle in Germany.","[Kuehne, Kathrin] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Informat Syst Inst, Koenigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Mitra, Suman K.] Bangladesh Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Mitra, Suman K.] Univ Calif Irvine, Inst Transportat Studies, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Saphores, Jean-Daniel M.] Univ Calif Irvine, Civil & Environm Engn Econ & Planning Policy & De, Inst Transportat Studies, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",Leibniz University Hannover; Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET); University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Saphores, JDM (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Civil & Environm Engn Econ & Planning Policy & De, Inst Transportat Studies, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",kuehne@iwi.uni-hannover.de; skmitra@uci.edu; saphores@uci.edu,"Mitra, Suman/HPE-7906-2023; Saphores, Jean Daniel/Q-5445-2019; Saphores, Jean-Daniel/JCZ-2810-2023","Saphores, Jean Daniel/0000-0001-9514-0994; Saphores, Jean-Daniel/0000-0001-9514-0994; Mitra, Suman/0000-0002-7776-5779","Graduierten Akademie of the Leibniz University of Hannover, Germany","Graduierten Akademie of the Leibniz University of Hannover, Germany","The first author is grateful to the Graduierten Akademie of the Leibniz University of Hannover, Germany, for providing financial support for this collaborative research project.

Using the monthly percentages of residential property auction sales for Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch regions in New Zealand from 2006 to 2015, and the exuberance testing method proposed by Phillips, Shi and Yu, we find that animal spirits have been developing in the Auckland housing market since 2013, but not in other regions. When compared to the results based on price-to-rent ratios, auction sales provide more meaningful results for identifying market-wide irrational exuberance at an early stage. The causality test on price-to-rent ratios and auction sales volume shows that asset prices and animal spirits influence each other in the short run. In the long run, prices have significant effect on animal spirits, but not vice versa.","[Shi, Song] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Design Architecture & Bldg, 15 Broadway, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia; [Kabir, M.

What characterized the industrial re composition was the major shift from export-processing and home-demand oriented sectors to the import competing textiles. That was in turn driven by the combined forces of massive terms of trade shock, tariff protection and stagnant incomes. Crucially, the panel data analysis of disaggregated growth patterns indicates that the effect of tariff protection on growth was much smaller than usually assumed in the historiography.","[Karakoc, Ula] Humboldt Univ, Econ Hist Inst, Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Karakoç, U (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Econ Hist Inst, Berlin, Germany.",ulas.karakoc@hu-berlin.de,"Karakoc, Ulas/HKM-4545-2023","Karakoc, Ulas/0000-0002-7527-9881",London School of Economics; LSE Middle East Centre; TurkPetrol Foundation,London School of Economics; LSE Middle East Centre; TurkPetrol Foundation,"I am grateful to Sevket Pamuk, Peter Howlett and Stephen Broadberry for their valuable comments and advice.

A model of the credit market is explored which disentangles demand and supply. A Bayesian estimation methodology with data augmentation for the latent variables is proposed. The analysis is carried out separately for each type of loan (short- and long-term business loans, consumer loans and mortgages) enabling the comparative study of the credit rationing and supply constraint effects across loan categories. The results indicate that, for all loan categories, excess demand characterized the boom period. After the intensification of the debt crisis, long-term business loans, consumer loans and mortgages were constrained from the supply side, however, demand for short-term business loans has slowed down more than supply, reflecting businesses' need for stable funding. Finally, the structural effects of the crisis are investigated. The present paper aims to contribute to the strand of literature investigating the tools to analyse credit developments by formulating an enhanced and flexible version of a model which disentangles credit demand and supply and enables the monitoring of the evolution of financial imbalances.","[Vouldis, Angelos T.] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Vouldis, AT (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany.",Angelos.Vouldis@ecb.int,,,,,,,74,0,0,0,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

The continent has experienced growth in domestic, intra- and inter-continental air traffic services over the past two decades that we project will continue over the medium term. Applying a gravity model in which corruption, conflict, common language and land-locked indices contribute to the demand estimation, we forecast annual intra-African growth of 8.1% up to 2030. As witnessed in established markets, deregulation will likely result in hub-spoke network designs in order to accommodate demand efficiently if mobility and access is to be encouraged. In this research, we modify the p-hub median problem in order to identify multiple, economically viable, hub-spoke networks that would adequately serve the intra- and inter-continental demand for air transport. Aside from current hubs, namely Cairo (Egypt), Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) and Johannesburg (South Africa), future hubs could include airports in the North that serve European-African flows, such as Algiers, and Nigeria in the West due to its relatively large population and wealth. By 2030, we also find that demand is sufficient to justify an additional hub in central Sub-Saharan Africa, such as Lusaka (Zambia). However, this would be dependent on the implementation of liberalisation policies as set out in the Yamoussoukro Decision.","[Adler, Nicole] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Sch Business Adm, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel; [Njoya, Eric Tchouamou] Univ Huddersfield, Sch Business, Dept Logist Operat Hospitality & Mkt, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England; [Volta, Nicola] Cranfield Univ, Ctr Air Transport Management, Univ Way, Cranfield MK43 0TR, Beds, England",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; University of Huddersfield; Cranfield University,"Volta, N (通讯作者)，Cranfield Univ, Ctr Air Transport Management, Univ Way, Cranfield MK43 0TR, Beds, England.",msnic@huji.ac.il; E.Njoya@hud.ac.uk; n.volta@cranfield.ac.uk,"Adler, Nicole/GYV-1956-2022; Adler, Nicole/AAL-5010-2021","Adler, Nicole/0000-0002-5242-2542; Adler, Nicole/0000-0002-5242-2542; Tchouamou Njoya, Eric/0000-0002-1799-9469; Volta, Nicola/0000-0002-4436-4469",Recanati Foundation,Recanati Foundation,"We would like to thank the participants of the ATARD Cost Action (2015), the University of Bergamo workshop (2016), the GARS Africa workshop (2016) and DLR/Airbus forecasting workshop (2016) for valuable comments.

Empirically, the evidence has been inconsistent. I highlight two key deficiencies in existing research, and present a more nuanced theoretical framework for considering this relationship. First, I make the case that the costs and risks associated with conflict are a function of both intensity and duration. Both should be accounted for. Second, I argue that the logic governing multinational corporations' (MNC) behavior changes post-entry into the host country. Combining these two insights, I argue that firms' sensitivity to conflict, and that the particular signals they respond to, vary in predictable ways across different stages of the FDI lifecycle. I test the according hypotheses using firm-level foreign investment data, and find supporting evidence. Multinationals look for sustained peace when pursuing new ventures, but prove resilient to all but the most intense and persistent conflicts after the costs of entry have been sunk.","[Barry, Colin M.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Polit Sci, Norman, OK 73019 USA",University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Barry, CM (通讯作者)，Univ Oklahoma, Dept Polit Sci, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",,,"Barry, Colin/0000-0001-7578-5090",,,,,64,18,21,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Given the topical issue of nowadays - the lack of consumer awareness of ecologic performance and health impact of products, and the physical availability of domestic products in the Latvian food retail chains - and the trends of development of integrated marketing communications, businesses need to focus product promotion on communication with consumers in order to foster a greater understanding of the healthiness and ecological performance of products etc., thus contributing positively to demand for them. The authors hold a view that demand is affected by factors such as product location and placement in a shop's premises, shelves etc., advertising in mass media, internet, outdoor advertising, advertising stands, visual information about product discounts, product discount coupons etc. measures to increase sales, product tasting in shops, shop assistant consultations etc. The article is based on authors' studies conducted in the food retail sector during 2017. In their study authors used companies' data, surveyed leading food retail chains' main specialists in Latvia. The objective of the study is to research and assess the integrated marketing communications as a set of merchandising tools to develop innovative entrepreneurship In order to achieve the objective of the study, the authors used the following quantitative and qualitative methods - surveys, comparison, grouping - typically applied in the studies of science of economics.

Despite this confusion, African countries pursue emulative strategies for different purposes - whether they may be for economic transformation (in line with developmental state strategies), market-led reforms or simply to signal the implementation of best practices' to please donors. Rwanda has been lauded for the country's economic recovery since the 1994 genocide, with international financial institutions and heterodox scholars both praising different facets of its development strategy. This paper argues that Rwanda is an example of a country that has simultaneously pursued emulative strategies for different purposes - often even within the same sector. Two studies of emulation are explored: the emulation of Singapore's Economic Development Board through the establishment of Rwanda's own Rwanda Development Board (RDB) and the evolution of Rwanda's financial sector with reference to the use of contending market-led and developmental state models. The paper argues that in Rwanda, incoherent emulation for different purposes has resulted in contradictory tensions within its development strategy and the construction of a neoliberal developmental state.","[Behuria, Pritish] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Int Dev, London, England",,"Behuria, P (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Int Dev, London, England.",p.behuria@lse.ac.uk,,"Behuria, Pritish/0000-0003-3743-2045",,,,,97,14,16,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Although in most countries, including Kosovo, the audit is mandatory and regulated by law, voluntary audits should be the requirement of each organization, so that the audited financial statements increase transparency and credibility of stakeholders for this information and so would indirectly increase the value of the organization. Therefore, the main purpose of this paper is to measure the factors that affect the demand and supply of audit services for NGOs in Kosovo. In our study, we have chosen the NGO sector in Kosovo, because they are among the first organizations that have gone through the audit process in Kosovo. The authors investigated this topic but did not find any research that covered this issue. The study is generally based on data collection through a questionnaire, designed to collect relevant data about the qualitative assessment of the impact of the factors theoretically known such as; legal obligation, the obligation to donors and voluntary choice to audit the financial statements of NGOs in Kosovo. From the results of the analysis, related to the importance of the variables of the model, it resulted that the legal obligation and the obligation from the donors prevail over the voluntary choice to audit the financial reports of NGOs in Kosovo.","[Berisha, Bahtijar] Audit BB LLC, Zagreb, Croatia; [Berisha, Bahtijar; Kristek, Ivan] Fac Econ, Osijek, Croatia",,"Berisha, B (通讯作者)，Audit BB LLC, Zagreb, Croatia.;Berisha, B (通讯作者)，Fac Econ, Osijek, Croatia.",baberisha@hotmail.com; ivan.kristek@efos.hr,"Kristek, Ivan/H-2058-2018; Kristek, Ivan/GYJ-2853-2022","Kristek, Ivan/0000-0002-6331-3720",,,,,16,0,0,1,4,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,340,352,,,,,,13,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300019,0

To date, this debate has mostly focused on the contrasting fates of the thriving northern export-oriented capitalisms and the ailing southern European ones. This paper seeks to broaden the debate by focusing on Europe's Eastern periphery. It argues that a combination of domestic transformation strategies and the EU's accession policies resulted in two different growth regimes on Europe's Eastern periphery: a dependent export-driven in the Visegrad countries and a dependent debt-driven in the Baltic States. On the basis of the pre- and post-crisis trajectories of these two growth models, this paper finds that because East Central European capitalisms were profoundly shaped by EU integration, they are on balance also more compatible with deepened integration than Southern European capitalisms.","[Bohle, Dorothee] European Univ Inst, Social & Polit Change, Florence, Italy",European University Institute,"Bohle, D (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Social & Polit Change, Florence, Italy.",Dorothee.Bohle@eui.eu,,"BOHLE, Dorothee/0000-0002-7063-5875",,,,,75,63,63,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

This capital is funded in behalf of a certain individual, but in case of death before achieving the retirement age, the whole amount of accrued capital must be transferred to the first level of pension system as an additional financing of current pensioners' benefits. Thus, successors don't benefit from the really accrued capital of the second tier, as far as pension capital inheritance rights are still not provided in Latvia. The aim of the paper is to estimate an opportunity of funded pension capital inheritance in Latvia and its potential effect on the participants of Latvian pension system. For achieving the aim of the research current experience of pension capital inheritance in the EU countries has been assessed. The potential effect on the participants of the system has been evaluated by means of representative survey. One of the main conclusions of the research is that Latvia is one of few countries in the EU, which does not provide pension capital inheritance in any form. However, Latvian inhabitants consider an inheritance to be a necessary option of State Funded Pension Scheme and a method of influence on some aspects of undeclared work. Therefore, an acceptance of capital inheritance may have a positive impact on the indicators of shadow economy in Latvia.","[Bule, Larisa; Leitane, Liga; Rozite, Kristine] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Bule, L (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,0,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-344-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,79,88,,,,,,10,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP0MG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000535358500007,0

Over the past decades, this has changed dramatically with a stronger emphasis on the rights of the consumer. This is expressed in the increased focus on labelling, product tracing and consumer choice. This paper explores how the use of tracking technology in food production affects consumer choice and trust. Previously, the consumers were left to passively, or even blindly, trust the food delivery chain. In the emerging food delivery system one can talk about a new level, maybe even a new form, of autonomy through increased access to information, and by that, increased empowerment of the individual. It is reasonable to assume that the new technology based product information provides a better, more detailed picture, but also more complicated picture, disturbed by information 'noise. How does this affect trust - or how should our trust in the food delivery system and expertise be affected? Consumers need help to interpret information in order to make informed choices and the basis for trust will be altered, due to the distribution of responsibilities and use of technology. This development requires a turn from 'blind' to reflexive trust. While it may lead to information overflow and thus to a de facto decrease in consumer choice, increasing risk and development of new technologies arguably imposes a moral responsibility on the side of the consumer to collect and assess the available information.","[Carson, S.

Controversies over GM food reflect an interrelationship between social, political, and corporate forces. Among the societal agents disseminating information on GM food, NGOs' discourses play a crucial role in constructing perspectives and building agendas. The present study explored NGOs' discourses to determine how GM food is represented in Taiwanese society. We analyzed the three major NGOs in this field: Homemakers United Foundation, Homemakers Union Consumers Co-op, and NoGMO-Lunch. By collecting their pamphlets, books, publications, and website posts related to GM food from 1998 through mid-2017, a total of 482 articles underwent qualitative inductive analysis. The results showed that in addition to addressing uncertainties about health risks, claims that GM foods harm society on a worldwide scale are related to sustainability, ethics, and politics. The analyzed NGOs have attempted to promote consciousness of environmental sustainability among farmers and the general public by emphasizing that planting GM food could destroy the ecological balance and be detrimental to environmental justice. Consumption ethics has also been emphasized by encouraging people to refuse to buy or eat GM food. More crucially, in terms of political concerns, the analyzed NGOs have framed the development and implications of GM food as results of collusion within the `government-scientist-enterprise complex.' Furthermore, war metaphors have been used to describe how by importing GM food, the government had retreated from the defensive line of guarding public health. Discourse is a strategic resource by which NGOs can empower farmers and the public and contend with governments and enterprises. By using specific phrasing and metaphors and introducing scientific terminology, NGOs can act as meaning architects and knowledge brokers to potentially increase their influence over how topics are defined and reach the level of legitimacy required to further participate in the policymaking arena.","[Chiu, Y.

The modernisation sought by the Kremlin under Medvedev's term brought a greater demand for organisations capable of fulfilling the dual purpose of public communication and state advisory functions. This required clear legal definitions, areas of competence and rules of conduct.

The animals are subjected to considerable welfare risks; pre-slaughter handling can be one of the most stressful events in the life of an animal. Stress at slaughter may lead to deteriorated meat quality through increased breakdown of glycogen in the muscles, resulting in abnormally lower or higher pH values which makes the fresh meat pale, soft and exudative or dark, firm and dry, respectively. In most developed countries farm animal production is undergoing structural changes resulting in fewer but larger herds with less time for management of individual animals, making them less tolerant to handling at the time of slaughter. Despite comprehensive legal restrictions and official control of commercial abattoirs, farm animal welfare outcomes at slaughter vary considerably and are in some cases unacceptably poor. The high line speed in large-scale slaughter results in demanding working conditions, making it difficult for stockpersons to deal with hassle and balking. A considerable proportion of the animals transported to slaughter spend one night at the abattoir before being slaughtered, which may increase stress levels if lairage conditions are poor. On-farm slaughter may be conducted at a stationary plant at the farm, in a mobile unit temporarily placed at or near the farm, or by stunning and bleeding on farm followed by carcass transport to a nearby plant for further processing. On-farm slaughter may have a potential to reduce pre-slaughter animal stress by shorter or eliminated transports, minimised exposure to unfamiliar environments, animals and persons, less time in lairage and a reduced slaughter line speed, which would be in line with the increased awareness of ethical issues related to the slaughter of animals. On the other hand, on-farm slaughter involves challenges regarding food and occupational safety, waste management and public health. Requirements regarding adequate bleeding, freedom from carcass contamination, veterinary inspections and carcass refrigeration must be met. The working conditions for farm and slaughterhouse personnel must be acceptable, thus avoiding unacceptable physical and psycho social risks.","[Hultgren, J.; Berg, C.; Karlsson, A.

It argues that (1) both cases show a confidence trap' in that policy-makers of the government shared a complacent mindset that they can achieve the optimal mix of market liberalisation and repression, while believing that their political economic system is fundamentally different from others; (2) Such complacent confidence precipitated the supply-side driven financial reforms, in which both governments tried to diversify the credit channels of bank deposits by promoting non-bank financial intermediaries; (3) Exogenous shocks played a pivotal role in enforcing the government to take aggressive monetary easing and fiscal expansionary measures. But the Chinese case is different from the Japanese case in that (1) local politics has promoted a too secure to fail' situation in which rent-seeking activities are difficult to be detected, thus aggravating the hidden systemic risks; (2) China needs to liberalise its capital account with the more strengthened macroprudential regulatory governance, as the global foreign exchange markets have drastically changed from the period of the 1980s.","[Kang, Myung-koo] CUNY, Baruch Coll, Dept Polit Sci, One Bernard Baruch Way, New York, NY 10010 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Baruch College (CUNY),"Kang, MK (通讯作者)，CUNY, Baruch Coll, Dept Polit Sci, One Bernard Baruch Way, New York, NY 10010 USA.",myung-koo.kang@baruch.cuny.edu,,"Kang, Myung-koo/0000-0003-1022-4887",Research Foundation of The City University of New York [69273-00 47],Research Foundation of The City University of New York,This work was supported by Research Foundation of The City University of New York [69273-00 47].,,103,7,7,3,65,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The research conducted on a group of 223 working representatives of households shows that more than 50% of persons with bank loans also have saving that exceeds in its amount a 3-month income of a respondent. It is worth noting, however, that among persons assessing their financial situation as good or very good, the percentage of such persons is higher than in the case of people assessing their financial situation as bad or rather bad. In the latter group, many more people are holding only credit products. The research has also shown that people with saving are more likely to use car loans and credit cards, while people who do not save are more likely to use cash credits and cash loans. In both groups, the percentage of people with mortgages is comparable.","[Korzeniowska, Anna Magdalena; Misterek, Wojciech] Maria Curie Sklodowska Univ Lublin, Fac Econ, Dept Banking, Pl Marii Curie Sklodowskiej 5, PL-20031 Lublin, Poland",Maria Curie-Sklodowska University,"Korzeniowska, AM (通讯作者)，Maria Curie Sklodowska Univ Lublin, Fac Econ, Dept Banking, Pl Marii Curie Sklodowskiej 5, PL-20031 Lublin, Poland.",anna.korzeniowska@umcs.lublin.pl; wojciech.misterek@umcs.lublin.pl,"Korzeniowska, Anna M/C-7087-2013","Korzeniowska, Anna M/0000-0001-9809-5260",,,,,10,0,0,0,0,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8980-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,292,298,,,,,,7,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BM4AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000462948800037,0

One of the most important conditions for successful development of the country is to support innovative enterprises, providing them with the guidelines for analysis and global trends. Therefore, it is worthwhile to find out in which fields the process of development and financial attraction for already existing innovative enterprises has been successful, which will provide other entrepreneurs with guidelines where it would be more appropriate to invest and develop. Multidimensional analysis is considered as one of the most accurate and reliable data analysis methods. Within the study author has performed multidimensional analysis of the fields of innovative business by using correlation and regression analysis according to the indicators of Finance, Employment and Investments. These indicators were chosen on the basis of European Union studies and their results that are generally accepted and recognized as qualitative. Author has performed analysis of the fields of activity of innovative companies in Latvia comparing with European tendencies. The data of the Central Statistical Bureau and the Bank of Latvia has been used. The aim of the article is to provide the basis for further research, as well as to provide an analysis of the current situation. Entrepreneurs who are only planning their innovative activities, or think about the development of an innovative service or product, have the opportunity to compare and take into account the experience and results of their colleagues in Latvia, as well as to take into account the development trends of innovative companies in the European Union. In the research author has come to the conclusion that Latvia falls behind other Baltic States in EU Innovation rank and main reason is low level of innovations; Analyzing correlation between number of employees, turnover, investment in ICT and venture investments showed only relationship between number of employees and investment in ICT, regression analysis showed that 80% of investment in ICT is explained by an increase in the number of employees that supports given model, but the field of an enterprise does not have any effect on the success of an innovative companies.

This study examines the existing regulations on the Douala-N'Djamena international road, which is the main transport corridor in Central Africa and the backbone for internal transport in Cameroon. It benefits from the detailed existing weighing data recorded since 1998 in the corridor's 10 weighing stations. This vast amount of traffic data, together with available information on road structure and deterioration over time, has been used to conduct an accurate calculation of load equivalency factors. The HDM 4 model has been applied to three scenarios between 2000 and 2015: (1) no axle-load control, (2) the real situation and (3) no overloading tolerance. Results show that axle-load regulations have been reasonably well applied in Cameroon and have contributed to maintaining the corridor in fair condition.

Commercial attention on ethnic and racial minorities has resulted in products and services specifically developed for them. Here, we focus on this by exploring two empirical examples: US pharmaceutical clinical trials and UK stem cell transplantation. Both use racial taxonomies to discern biological difference and draw conclusions about the economic potential of people's genetic constitutions. They do so by appealing to racialised minorities' sense of responsibility towards their' communities, both buttressing the conflation of social and biological registers of human variation and demonstrating neoliberalism's mobilisation of discourses of community. However, while the inclusion of racialised minorities is hoped to bring economic benefits, it also aims to address healthcare inequalities. Drawing on Science and Technology Studies, we argue that in our examples, economic, social and cultural values cannot be disentangled. This compels us to complement narratives of the commodification of racialised difference in neoliberal (consumer) culture, and focus on the intersections between different economic and ethical values. Ultimately we find that whilst work is being done to ameliorate racial inequities, broader socio-economic and political inequalities minority communities face go unaddressed, likely precluding the realisation of health equality.","[Merz, Sibille] Goldsmiths Univ London, Sociol Dept, London, England; [Williams, Ros] Univ Sheffield, Dept Sociol Studies, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of London; Goldsmiths University London; University of Sheffield,"Merz, S (通讯作者)，Goldsmiths Univ London, Sociol Dept, London, England.",sibille.merz@gold.ac.uk,,"Williams, Ros/0000-0002-4295-2582",,,,,57,7,7,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

On the other hand, it may mean a transformation of monetary policy towards a new quality, a new monetary architecture, hitherto unknown to central banks - referred as new normal. The lack of previous experience of central banks in implementation of normalizing activities is undoubtedly a factor hindering their realization. Literature studies indicate a small number of scientific studies and publications in this research area. Therefore, appropriate definition and implementation of the exit strategies' assumptions is extremely difficult in the lack of theoretical framework. In turn, normalization without clearly formulated assumptions, implemented ad hoc, may destabilize banking sector, and finally the whole financial system. Detailed guidelines are also crucial for the effectiveness of the process. Appropriate identification of the normalization process, undertaken early enough - even during unconventional policy, will avoid the negative effects of the exit and support positive results, generated during the implementation of non-standard monetary policy. The main aim of the study is identification of possibilities of monetary policy normalization of the European Central Bank. The central bank of the Eurozone still implements extraordinary instruments (enter strategy) - in the form of quantitative easing and zero interest rate policy, while the major central banks of the global economy have developed detailed exit strategies assumptions. Thus, the article attempts to specify detailed guidelines of the ECB normalization process, paying particular attention to balance sheet normalization.","[Nocon, Aleksandra] Univ Econ Katowice, Fac Finance & Insurance, Dept Banking & Financial Markets, Ul 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Nocon, A (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Fac Finance & Insurance, Dept Banking & Financial Markets, Ul 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland.",aleksandra.nocon@ue.katowice.pl,"Nocon, Aleksandra/S-5414-2018","Nocon, Aleksandra/0000-0003-3250-2382",,,,,9,0,0,1,5,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8980-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,462,469,,,,,,8,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BM4AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000462948800059,0

To date little empirical research has been undertaken in regards to the relationship between economic diversity and regional employment growth with even less research considering the potential for regional spillovers. This paper analyses this gap in the existing literature by considering the roles of three categories of diversity (total, related and unrelated) on Irish employment growth over the period 2006-2012. Utilising a spatial econometric model we note not only the positive effect of spatial spillovers in regards to employment growth, but also the differing impacts of all three measures. Our results indicate that for this particular period a diverse industry structure has a significant positive impact on employment growth. We find that total diversity and its two sub-components related and unrelated diversity positively effects employment growth. Unrelated diversity is found to have the largest positive effect.","[O'Connor, Sean] Natl Univ Ireland, Sch Econ, Univ Coll Cork, Cork, Ireland; [Doran, Justin] Univ Coll Cork, Dept Econ, Spatial & Reg Econ Res Ctr, Cork, Ireland; [Doyle, Eleanor] Univ Coll Cork, Coll Business & Law, Dept Econ, Competitiveness Inst, Cork T12 T656, Ireland",University College Cork; University College Cork; University College Cork,"O'Connor, S (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, Sch Econ, Univ Coll Cork, Cork, Ireland.",sean.oconnor@cso.ie,,"Doran, Justin/0000-0002-9875-901X; Doyle, Eleanor/0000-0001-9838-9154",,,,,61,11,11,3,23,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

Nevertheless numerous problems regarding dogs occur. There are concerns about risk of zoonoses due to (illegal) imports of puppies and rescue dogs; hereditary health problems in (pedigree) dogs; dog bite incidents and welfare issues related to dogs in animal shelters. Although problems vary largely, they all may originate from the moment at which a specific owner decides to purchase a particular dog. While government and animal protection organizations already target (potential) dog owners by providing lots of information, preventing said problems by changing purchase behaviour remains challenging. According to Kahneman (2012) the quintessence is that people take emotional, fast decisions (system 1), while information campaigns target the rational and slow system 2. As behaviour is largely influenced by the behaviour and opinion of others (Smith and Christakis, 2008; Pompe et al., 2012) this is a starting point for determining factors in the decisions taken with system 1. We therefore study the interaction between the opinion of others and the person's mindset when purchasing a dog as well as how people deal with possible inconsistencies. As a first step we will map the public's opinion on dogs, qualitatively as well as quantitatively. The complexity of this public opinion is shown through frame analysis (Gray, 2003; Aarts and Van Woerkum, 2006) typifying the various aspects of the public opinion. Dutch media will be analysed to retrieve these frames. Ultimately these results will provide the basis for more effective methods to influence the purchase of dogs, having a greater chance of preventing risks for dogs, owners and society.","[Ophorst, C.

The data used in this study is the annual financial statements of Latvian banks operated in the period 2008-2016.

These findings are consistent with the expected results, by confirming examined Z- score model: the higher the liquidity and credit risk, the lower the stability of the banking system. The size of the bank and the inflation rate have significant positive impact on banks' stability, as a result, large banks are more stable compared to smaller banks. Similarly, when interest rates are adjusted according to the expected inflation, the inflation effect on the stability of the banks is positive. We do not find a significant impact of GDP Growth, Efficiency of Banks Operations and Profitability on banks' stability.

Recent studies have demonstrated that dairy cattle veterinarians are also concerned about animal welfare, specifically on issues related to the housing environment, painful conditions and procedures, and managing disease of the adult animals. However, less is known regarding their perspectives on calf welfare. The goal of this study was to engage cattle veterinarians in an in-depth discussion to gain a better understanding of what they think about calf welfare, as well as provide clarity on what they feel is their responsibility in improving the welfare of dairy calves. Focus groups (n=5), that collectively had 33 participants representing five Canadian provinces and different geographical regions, were conducted as part of a continuing education workshop for Canadian cattle veterinarians. Two trained individuals undertook exploratory data analysis using applied thematic analysis where initial themes were identified and used to develop a detailed codebook to guide the coding process. All transcripts were coded twice to further test the validity of the initial codes and themes. Four major themes were identified: (1) Veterinarians prioritized calf health; frequently trading off this issue for other issues such as the calf's social needs. (2) Veterinarians see their role in improving calf welfare within the context of shifting norms of calf management, believed to be consequence of pressure from within their profession, but also arising from pressure from their clients and the public. (3) Veterinarians see their role as one of exerting social influence, primarily as an educator of their clients. Finally, (4) veterinarians see their responsibility in improving calf welfare as shaped by their personal values and professional ethics. Our results indicate that the veterinarians participating in this study are concerned about a range of calf welfare issues, believe they should be more involved in calf management on farms, and see their role in improving calf welfare as shaped by their own values, the needs of their clients, and the concerns of the public.","[Sumner, C.

The result of this research shows that majority of farmer in Bantul Regency has passed all adoption process stages including introduction, persuasion, decision and confirmation. The adoption process that needs to be concidered is persuasion stage at the time of the implementation of demonstration plot, the success of demonstration plot is influenced by the speed of innovation in adoption, so the failure of the demonstration plot should be minimized. The reason of farmer to decide sustainability adoption is because there are some different opinions such as the ease of farming, suitability of land, profit of farming and influence of farmer's group.

We confirm our thesis in three steps by means of the case of a hypothetical dairy cow who suffers from mastitis. In the first step, we point out that Grimm and Huth's (cf. 2017) normative theory of the animal patient contradicts the intuitive use of the term 'patient' with regard to the case of a dairy cow whose mastitis is treated by a vet. While Grimm and Huth deny that the cow can be understood as a patient, the cow qualifies as a patient according to the use of the term 'patient' in everyday language. In the second step, we sketch the main points of Grimm and Huth's theory in order to explain why the authors refuse to consider the dairy cow a patient. In the third step, we focus on the intuition that the cow should be seen as a patient and demonstrate by means of a heuristic method that linking the concept of the patient with the concept of moral status is mistaken. We argue that the end of a veterinary intervention to promote an animal's health-related interests is sufficient in order to qualify as an animal patient. Opposed to Grimm and Huth (cf. 2017), we claim that respecting the animal's moral status is not a necessary condition. In summary, the link between the concept of the animal patient and the concept of moral status will be questioned and the argument put forward that it cannot be plausibly sustained.","[Thurner, E.; Huth, M.; Grimm, H.] Messerli Res Inst, Unit Eth & Human Anim Studies, Vet Pl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria",University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna,"Thurner, E (通讯作者)，Messerli Res Inst, Unit Eth & Human Anim Studies, Vet Pl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria.",elena.thurner@vetmeduni.ac.at,,"Huth, Martin/0000-0001-8518-984X",,,,,7,2,2,0,0,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,260,265,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_40,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000040,0

The increased investment activity of companies over the last few years poses important questions about their balancing by economic activities. The comparative advantages of the regions as a prerequisite for attracting investors can lead to the concentration of investment interests in the same sphere. This could be a problem for the future socio-economic development of the regions in several important aspects. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the structure of investments in Bulgaria and to make specific recommendations to overcome the established forms of imbalance. The study is based on secondary data from official information sources and covers the period 2012-2016. Different forms of investment imbalance can be critical to the return on investments and their cost-effectiveness. In this connection, research interest is focused on the need to balance the investments and benefits for the target audiences: businesses, consumers, residents, visitors and society as a whole. The efforts of country and municipalities to create a favorable investment environment will continue to be an important incentive to attract the right investors. Coordination, synchronization and alignment of investment intentions and processes will contribute to the sustainable development of regions and the efficient use and reproduction of resources.","[Tonkova, Evgeniya; Petrov, Dancho; Hristova, Sevdalina] Univ Econ Varna, Varna, Bulgaria",University of Economics Varna,"Tonkova, E (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Varna, Varna, Bulgaria.",,"Tonkova, Evgeniya/AAN-6109-2020; Petrov, Dancho/AAC-7557-2019; Hristova, Sevdalina/AAK-8894-2021","Petrov, Dancho/0000-0001-6085-1702; Hristova, Sevdalina/0000-0001-8762-397X",,,,,18,0,0,0,3,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-344-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,747,756,,,,,,10,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP0MG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000535358500069,0

Since most above-named systems are characterised by stick-slip phenomena conditioned by interruption of continuity in developing processes of various types, it is proposed to enrich the synergetic approach to studying structure formation particularities with methods of catastrophe theory, which is studying sudden qualitative system reformations resulting from smooth change of external conditions or internal properties.

Research program includes solution of tasks connected to description and analysis of such phenomena when increasing the intensity of technological treatment leads to qualitatively new system behaviour. Methodological base of research is the analysis of processes of disperse systems structure formation in dynamical and static conditions from the point of view of synergetics and catastrophe theory. Understanding the nature of dispersions abnormal rheological behaviour uncovers the possibility of implementation of optimal dynamic condition of the system and corresponding level of isotropic decomposition of the structure, which is the necessary condition for obtaining materials with requested properties. Therefore, the matter of informational interpretation of non-trivial viscosimetric data has practical importance for solving many material science tasks. Use of new ideas for disperse systems evolution under conditions of different technological operations let us raise physics-chemical processes modeling to the new level to create modern compositions.","[Trofimova, Larysa] Odessa State Acad Civil Engn & Architecture, Odessa, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Odessa State Academy of Civil Engineering and Architecture,"Trofimova, L (通讯作者)，Odessa State Acad Civil Engn & Architecture, Odessa, Ukraine.",lara.reverberator119@gmail.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,76,84,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540723300009,0

Although regional and sectoral heterogeneities in energy consumption and emission patterns prevail, they have not been taken into account in the PDA literature. By incorporating relevant decomposition methods, this study proposes an extended PDA approach to resolving the heterogeneity issue.

Based on whether the construction period and the private operation period are defined together or separately, there are two concession period structures: single-period concession structure (SPCS) and two-period concession structure (TPCS). This paper simultaneously compares socially optimal toll prices in both private and public operation periods, road quality, and concession period under SPCS and TPCS, respectively. We find that if the marginal social welfare with respect to toll price in private operation period is sufficiently more responsive than to road quality, then the optimal road capacity and toll prices under SPCS are higher than those under TPCS. Otherwise if marginal social welfare in public operation period is sufficiently more responsive to road quality, then the optimal toll prices under SPCS are lower while the optimal road quality under SPCS is higher. We also find that the optimal concession periods are independent of concession period structures. This paper has made three extensions to further investigate the effects of concession period structures (1) when the toll price is determined by the private firm; (2) when renegotiation takes place; and (3) when government support policies are present. Based on our model results, this paper derives several policy implications regarding BOT road contract design under different concession period structures.","[Zhang, Yiwen; Zhang, Shuibo] Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Feng, Zhuo] Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China",Tianjin University; Dalian University of Technology,"Feng, Z (通讯作者)，Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China.",zhangyiwen@tju.edu.cn; zhfeng@dlut.edu.cn; zhangshuibo@tju.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71231006, 71572124, 71702020, 71734001]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2016M600208, 2017T100179]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [DUT16RC(3)035]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This research is financially supported by grants from National Natural Science Foundation of China (71231006, 71572124, 71702020, and 71734001).

We introduce Bayesian hierarchical formulation that allows for the joint treatment of group and variable selection using the Group-wise Gibbs sampler. Our group variable selection shows that pre-crisis financial policies and trade linkages play a particularly important role in explaining the severity of the crisis, alongside institutions, and within the selected groups we identify a broader set of variables correlated with the crisis, which in turn leads to an improvement in prediction performance. In the robustness analysis we also find that our results are not qualitatively changed on alternative measures of crisis intensity, different groupings of variables, or prior assumptions.

This research uses the 2001 and 2009 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data to examine how Asian immigrant travel behavior changes over time. Based on cohort analysis and regression analysis, two types of temporal changes are analyzed: The first type of change occurs as immigrants stay in the U.S. for several years, and the second type of change happens in the initial status between the more recent arrivals and those who arrived earlier. Along the first temporal dimension, this research finds travel differences between recent Asian immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for fewer than four years and native-born Asian Americans, but the differences are inconsistent between 2001 and 2009. Meanwhile, established Asian immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for more than four years assimilate into the automobile culture with similar travel patterns as native-born Asian Americans. Along the second temporal dimension, recent immigrants in 2009 do not have greater transportation mobility than recent immigrants in 2001: travel differences between recent immigrants and native-born Asians were smaller in 2001 than in 2009. The results indicate that Asian immigrant travel behavior differs from that of other immigrant groups and shed light on how to improve transportation services for a diverse and multicultural population.","[Hu, Lingqian] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, POB 413, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Hu, LQ (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, POB 413, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",hul@uwm.edu,"Hu, Ivy/L-3119-2019","Hu, Ivy/0000-0002-5687-0764",,,,,79,25,25,1,17,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

The existing forms of work and labour control, embedded in capitalist and patriarchal relations, are significant for women's ability to question or resist their conditions of work. To understand the relations among workers and between workers and contractors/employers, this study draws on Scott's idea of the moral economy'. I argue in this article that in the absence of formal or legal contracts between workers and contractors, women are led to mobilize on their social capital or their valued relations with contractors and co-workers. Women's responses to their situation may not demonstrate a strong articulation of exploitation in class or feminist terms, but their political sense is informed by ideas of morality and reciprocity in relationships. Their resistance could be strengthened when they collectively act with workers in a similar situation.","[Khurana, Sakshi] NITI Aayog Natl Inst Transforming India, Skill Dev & Employment Vert, Delhi, India",,"Khurana, S (通讯作者)，NITI Aayog Natl Inst Transforming India, Sansad Marg, New Delhi 110001, India.",sakshi.khurana@gov.in,,,"Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR) Ph.D. Fellowship from the Institute of Economic Growth, Delhi University","Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR) Ph.D. Fellowship from the Institute of Economic Growth, Delhi University","The author received the Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR) Ph.D. Fellowship from the Institute of Economic Growth, Delhi University for this research.",,32,12,12,2,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

We find positive spillovers across ranks (flowing from higher-ranking to lower-ranking women) but negative spillovers within ranks.

Using a novel dataset on housing capital expenditure, I verify as accurate the claim of disinvestment theory made in earlier studies. When capital expenditure investment, neighborhood price trends, number of Multiple Listing Service listings and neighborhood fixed effects are controlled for, the negative effect on property prices is significant from nearby foreclosures, real estate owned (REO) listings and REO sales, but not from default and delinquent properties. The effect is larger in a depressed market than in an appreciating market. I argue that the most plausible explanation for these results is that a foreclosure discount drives down the reference prices for nearby properties and depresses neighborhood values.

Total sample includes 15,321 respondents. Results indicate that 19% of respondents are unwilling to pay for road pricing, including a low average estimate for road tolls. In addition, the results provide comprehensive analysis of willingness-to pay and willingness-to-accept, accounting for day of the week, vehicle origin, trip purpose, roadway use frequency, and income. The results are further interpreted in the context of a transition country, with high percentage of low income citizens, and lack of trust in public institutions. Planners can use the findings to determine the road toll price by relying on both willingness-to-pay and willingness-to-accept values, while also aiming for financial sustain ability. In order to provide recommendations for planning and policy learning in SEE, discussion provides recommendations for further analysis that should account for both economic and sociopolitical aspects.

State-level policies, as opposed to county socioeconomic characteristics, have stronger influences on movements out of disconnection. The findings from the analyses provide a base for policy discussions about helping this vulnerable population.","[Kwon, Jinwoo; Hetling, Andrea] Rutgers State Univ, Edward J Bloustein Sch Planning & Publ Policy, 33 Livingston Ave, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Kwon, J (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Bloustein Sch Planning & Publ Policy, 33 Livingston Ave, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",jinwoo.kwon@rutgers.edu,,,Fahs-Beck Fund for Research and Experimentation in the New York Community Trust; Rutgers University Faculty Council,Fahs-Beck Fund for Research and Experimentation in the New York Community Trust; Rutgers University Faculty Council,"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The project was supported in part by grants from the Fahs-Beck Fund for Research and Experimentation in the New York Community Trust and Rutgers University Faculty Council.",,45,1,2,1,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

The latter two terms represent housing fundamentals. The magnitudes of the components of price-rent ratio's variance are estimated to distinguish the relative impact of the three parts on housing prices. Using time series data from the housing markets in the four largest cities in China (1991:Q1-2011:Q1 for Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen; 1993:Q2-2011:Q1 for Beijing), this paper presents a number of empirical findings: (a) the variance of rational bubbles is much larger than the variance of price-rent ratio, and rational bubbles contribute more fluctuations directly to price-rent ratio than the expected returns or the expected rent growth rates do; (b) the covariance between rational bubbles and expected returns or expected rent growth rates is also large; (c) the positive covariance of rational bubbles and expected returns implies that high expected returns coexist with bubbles, which differs from previous findings that lower expected returns drive asset prices; (d) the negative covariance of rational bubbles and expected rent growth rates indicates that the larger the bubbles are, the lower the expected rent growth rates are; (e) the positive covariance of expected returns and expected rent growth rates reveals under-reaction of the housing markets to rents.","[Liu, Renhe; Lv, Jiaqi] South China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Hui, Eddie Chi-man] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yi] Peoples Bank China, Guiyang Cent Subbranch, Beijing, Peoples R China",South China Agricultural University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; People's Bank of China,"Lv, JQ (通讯作者)，South China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",vicky0731@foxmail.com,"Liu, Renhe/L-4793-2016; Hui, Eddie Chi Man/L-2037-2016","Hui, Eddie Chi Man/0000-0002-6974-891X",National Social Science Foundation of China [14BJY186]; Philosophy and Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China [GD12CYJ07],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Philosophy and Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China,Renhe Liu acknowledges the financial support of the National Social Science Foundation of China (No. 14BJY186) and the Philosophy and Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China (No. GD12CYJ07).,,52,19,23,2,75,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

It is therefore relevant to investigate the determinants of adult height. There is mixed evidence on the effects of undernutrition during early life on adult height. Therefore, our study aims at assessing the impact of undernutrition during gestation and at ages younger than 15 on adult height. We used data from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam. Exposure to undernutrition was determined by place of residence during the Dutch famine during World War II. Included respondents were born between 15 May 1930 and 1 November 1945 and lived in the northern part of the Netherlands during the famine period (n = 1008). Exposure data was collected using interviews and questionnaires and adult height was measured. Exposed and non-exposed respondents were classified in the age categories pregnancy-age 1 (n = 85), age 1-5 (n =323), age 6-10 (n = 326) or puberty (age 11-15, n=274). Linear regression analyses were used to test the associations of adult height with exposure. The robustness of the regression results was tested with sensitivity analyses. In the models adjusted for covariates (i.e., number of siblings, education level of parents, and year of birth) and stratified by gender, adult height was significantly shorter for females exposed at ages younger than 1 (-4.45 cm [-7.44-1.47]) or at ages younger than 2 (-4.08 cm [-7.20-0.94]). The results for males were only borderline significant for exposure under age 1 (-3.16 [-6.82-0.49]) and significant for exposure under age 2 (-4.09 cm [-7.20-0.96]). Exposure to the Dutch famine at other ages was not consistently significantly associated with adult height. In terms of public health relevance, the study's results further underpin the importance of supporting pregnant women and young parents exposed to undernutrition. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

As residential decisions are considered to be long-term decisions which affect daily travel behaviour significantly, knowledge of residential experiences made over the life-course may lead to a deeper understanding of later residential decisions and thus travel behaviour. Quantitative retrospective surveys are carried out to gather this information. These studies deal with missing information on particular life stages, e.g. childhood. This paper shows a new methodological approach for quantitative studies, illustrating how such missing life course data can be reconstructed using complementary information taken from linked lives. The data used have been retrospectively collected from a sample of spatial planning students at TU Dortmund University, their parents and grandparents. The parents' residential biography from birth until the setting up of a household of their own is reconstructed using information from the grandparents. The reconstructed data are compared with the statements the parents made for the relevant life stages, thus testing how well the reconstruction worked. The resultS show that the reconstruction works better for the mothers (than fathers) using the grandmothers' information (rather than the grandfathers'). The findings also indicate that the reconstruction is more or less successful for various types of reconstructed data. The paper concludes with guidelines for future data reconstruction.

J,"Geertman, S",,,,"Geertman, Stan",,,PSS: Beyond the implementation gap,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Planning Support Systems (PSS); Implementation gap,PLANNING SUPPORT; SYSTEMS; MODELS,"In the last couple of decades, a large number of papers on planning support systems (PSS) have been published in national and international, scientific and professional journals. What is remarkable about PSS is that for quite some time their history has been dominated by an implementation gap, that is, a discrepancy between supply and demand: despite the availability of a growing number and diversity of potentially valuable PSS instruments, planning practitioners are rather hesitant to buy, implement or apply them. This implementation gap leads to the question whether PSS are a valuable tool for planning practice. In this commentary, I answer this question by taking a closer look at the PSS debate from four perspectives, namely those of PSS history, PSS research, PSS education and PSS in practice. Although these perspectives are closely related, I show that they also reveal different aspects of this issue. For each of these perspectives, I start with a hypothetical conclusion and present some of my underlying considerations. At the end of this contribution, I summarize the situation, finalize the hypothetical conclusions and provide some recommendations concerning the implerbentation gap. These include focusing on the positive rather than the negative: we should look at the success stories (successful or best practices) and try to learn from them; after all, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Furthermore, PSS are by no means a panacea for all our problems or challenges in planning practice. In my opinion, selectivity in their application in actual planning practice evidences a growing maturity of the PSS field. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We use graphical price-theoretic reasoning to characterize the interaction between these forces. Using a calibrated model of health insurance, we show that the risk adjustment commonly used to offset adverse selection can reduce coverage and social surplus.

We find there is considerable heterogeneity in what is considered development economics: there is a narrow core of topics (growth theory, poverty and inequality, human capital, and institutions) taught in at least half the classes and large variation in the role of theory versus empirics. Employing clustering techniques, we find four views of development: a theoretical macro-based approach; an empirical micro-based approach; a mixed approach narrowly focused on these common core topics; and an expansive approach covering a much broader range of topics. We find country, course, and instructor characteristics are all associated with these differences in how development economics is conceptualized.","[McKenzie, David; Paffhausen, Anna Luisa] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Paffhausen, Anna Luisa] Univ Passau, Passau, Germany",The World Bank; University of Passau,"McKenzie, D (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",dmckenzie@worldbank.org; apaffhausen@worldbank.org,,,World Bank Knowledge for Change Trust Fund,World Bank Knowledge for Change Trust Fund,"The authors thank the editor, two anonymous referees, Stephen Smith, and commentators on a blog post on the Development Impact blog for helpful discussion, and all the instructors who participated in their data collection.

The main difficulty for tool developers is designing an AI that is at the same time technically rigorous and usable in practice. Measuring accessibility is indeed a complex task, and AI outputs are difficult to communicate to target end-users, in particular, because these users are professionals from several disciplines with different languages and areas of expertise, such as urban geographers, spatial planners, transport planners, and budgeting professionals. In addition to this, AI developers seem to have little awareness of the needs of AI end-users, which in turn tend to have limited ability for using these tools. Against this complex background, our research focuses on the viewpoint of AI developers, with two aims: (1) to provide insights into how AI developers perceive their tools and (2) to understand how their perceptions might change after testing their AI with end-users. With this in mind, an analysis of 15 case studies was performed: groups of end-users tested different AI in structured workshops. Before and after the workshops, two questionnaires explored the Al developers' perceptions on the tools and their usability. The paper demonstrates that the workshops with end-users were critical for developers to appreciate the importance of specific characteristics the tool should have, namely practical relevance, flexibility, and ease of use. The study provides evidence that AI developers were prone to change their perceptions about AI after interacting directly with end-users. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

It shows how the market encompasses a chain of relationships between clients, intermediaries and musicians, considering how the idea of 'moral economy' - a subject of revived interest in employment sociology - fits empirical reality. It shows that function musicians have created a strong moral economy regulating the distribution of opportunities and resources within bands. However, other actors in the chain, particularly agents, are able to impose intensified labour competition on bands. This competition leads trust relationships to fray and social expectations about the distribution of resources to weaken. These tensions are embodied in the role of the fixer: a musician who uneasily straddles market and moral domains.","[Umney, Charles] Univ Leeds, Work & Employment Relat, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Umney, C (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, GM-19 Maurice Keyworth Bldg,Moorland Rd, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",c.r.umney@leeds.ac.uk,,,,,,,38,12,12,1,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Accessibility instruments can play a major role in developing a common understanding, and help to identify key challenges of spatial development. In consequence, these instruments can foster joint strategies between transportation and land-use. This paper presents selected experiences using the TUM Accessibility Atlas, an accessibility instrument developed at Technical University of Munich (TUM). This instrument consists of a GIS-based platform on various scales that links spatial opportunities, such as population and jobs, with multiple modes of transport. The instrument was a reference for planning support systems within the European COST action Accessibility Instruments in Planning Practice, and has been applied in various real-life planning processes within the metropolitan region of Munich. The usefulness and implementation potential of the tool are assessed based on an expert workshop and experiences in practice. The analysis results demonstrate that a number of suitable accessibility indicators and visualization techniques can provide important added value to the debate among stakeholders involved in the planning and decision-making process. The appropriate complexity and level of detail of the tool highly depend on both the target group (e.g. decision makers, planning experts, citizens) and the respective planning issue. The TUM Accessibility Atlas improves the mutual understanding of different participants by serving as a platform for different partners to connect to. However, developing a common language remains a key challenge for interdisciplinary groups. The visual appeal and comprehensive nature of the accessibility instrument enables to build shared perspectives on land-use and transport. To facilitate more dynamic planning and decision-making processes, interactive tools are strived for. The TUM Accessibility Atlas has already been widely used in real-life applications, showing how to overcome the implementation gap of such planning support systems. Furthermore, the strengths and limitations of the TUM Accessibility Atlas are discussed, concluding with the need for further development of the modelling methods and the existing processes.

Using a rail rapid transit line announcement in Vancouver, BC, Canada, we estimate the net capitalization effect for each individual commercial property price resulting from expected improved urban center access. We focus on 1895 repeat sales straddling this announcement date and use a nonparametric estimation technique - Locally Weighted Regressions - to estimate how travel time changes to the Richmond, BC and Vancouver, BC central business districts, the Olympic Village, and Vancouver International Airport affect various commercial property prices differently. By differencing our estimation equation over the two periods of the repeat sales, the time-invariant variables drop out and we are left with the travel time savings and the difference in temporal fixed effects as regressors. We find travel time savings' marginal effects on property values can be positive or negative, and patterns vary dramatically across commercial land use types and locations. Falsification and balancing tests validate our findings.","[Cohen, Jeffrey P.] Univ Connecticut, Sch Business, Ctr Real Estate & Urban Econ Studies, 2100 Hillside Rd,Unit 1041-RE, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Brown, Mike] Greater Toronto Airports Author, Mississauga, ON, Canada",University of Connecticut,"Cohen, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Sch Business, Ctr Real Estate & Urban Econ Studies, 2100 Hillside Rd,Unit 1041-RE, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",Jeffrey.Cohen@business.uconn.edu; Mike.Brown@gtaa.com,,,,,,,26,19,19,6,38,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

The mixed MDCP model recognizes the unobserved heterogeneity across commercial vehicles in response to customer-to-customer travel speeds, and service time/dwell time at customer stops due to customer preferences for predefined business hours. Possible common unobserved factors affecting different times of day are also captured estimating a general covariance error structure. The estimated models show that a host of factors affect commercial vehicle time of day choice behavior. These include commercial vehicle class, type, commodity type, total unloading weight, as well as location features of base and intermediate stops, frequency of stops to office locations and construction sites; and time of day attributes including travel speed and service time. The results indicate that travel needs, are for the most part, influenced by activity needs. The estimated model can be used to predict the likelihood of commercial vehicle time of day choice for performing daily activities and the VMT generated at the chosen time(s) of day.

Hitherto, this subject has primarily been explored in organizational contexts; less is known in the context of self-employment. This article advances our understanding of work-life balance by analysing the everyday stories of self-employed immigrant parents in Norway. In this study, work-life balance is constructed in contrasting ways between mothers and fathers on the individual level and simultaneously in binary and potentially competing ways on the couple level. Hence, through an analysis of the participants' work and family availabilities, this study sheds light on how gender relations may be shaped at the micro level within the Nordic dual-earner family model.","[Munkejord, Mai Camilla] Uni Res Rokkan Ctr, Nygardsgaten 112-114, N-5008 Bergen, Norway; [Munkejord, Mai Camilla] UiT, Dept Child Welf & Social Work, Social Sci, Alta, Norway",UiT The Arctic University of Tromso,"Munkejord, MC (通讯作者)，Uni Res Rokkan Ctr, Nygardsgaten 112-114, N-5008 Bergen, Norway.",mai.munkejord@uni.no,,"Munkejord, Mai Camilla/0000-0002-5700-7639",Norwegian Research Council,Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),"This article is based on data from the research project 'Border-crossing business activity in the Barents Region: understanding the drivers and barriers for transnational entrepreneurship' (2012-16), financed by the Norwegian Research Council.",,32,23,24,6,29,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

To deter illegal commercial vehicle parking, enforcement policies are defined by the citation fine and level of enforcement. This paper investigates how rational carriers react to a policy under steady state equilibrium conditions. To model the equilibrium, the paper uses the theory of bilateral searching and meeting where enforcement units meet illegally parked commercial vehicles at a rate which depends on the size of the two agents (illegally parked commercial vehicles and enforcement units). In assessing policy effectiveness, two objectives are defined which are profit maximization and social cost minimization. With the two objectives, the paper presents three market regimes and studies the equilibrium of each market. The proposed model covers several gaps in the parking literature by introducing illegal parking behavior elasticity with respect to parking dwell time, level of enforcement, citation fine, and citation probability. The model is applied on a case study of the City of Toronto and the results show that the citation probability increases with dwell time and the level of enforcement. Increasing either the citation fine or level of enforcement will hinder illegal parking but the obtained profit remains approximately constant. Sensitivity analysis on the meeting rate elasticity shows that profits are low when both elasticities are either high or low. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Musgrave in his Theory of Public Finance (1959). The concept of merit wants can only be understood as a complement to the concept of public goods. I suggest that Musgrave invented the concept to apprehend some considerations that have been left out in the process of consolidation of the concept of public good. The narrow definition of the latter could not account for important state responsibilities that have been asserted by many economists.I attempt to reconstruct Musgrave's intellectual background. First, I select examples of arguments for state intervention from authors influential in Musgrave's formative period (J.S. Mill, H. Sidgwick, E. Sax, H. Ritschl, G. Cassel, A. Wagner). Second, I argue that the invention of the concept in the 1950s reflected contemporary concerns for redistributive policies. I show that critics of the New Welfare approach (G. Colm, A. Hansen, W. Heller, H.

We find that the AD action reduced Vietnamese imports to the EU by as much as 65 per cent. Given that the EU makes up almost two-thirds of Vietnam's footwear exports and footwear is among the top four export industries for Vietnam, this reduction is economically significant. Consistent with predictions of our model, we find evidence of trade diversion by Vietnamese producers from the EU to the US market. Our difference-in-difference estimates of the AD actions on the value of Vietnamese footwear imports to the United States ranged from 69 to 71 per cent over the period 2004-07 and 69 to 72 per cent in terms of quantity. These results highlight the spillover effects of trade policy in third markets when firms adjust to trade barriers. Our results are robust to triple-difference specifications where we adjust for trend differences and a series of placebo specifications.","[Nguyen Trong Hoai] Univ Econ, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Nguyen Truong Toan] Curtin Univ, Bankwest Curtin Econ Ctr, Sch Econ & Finance, Bentley, WA, Australia; [Nguyen Truong Toan] Univ Econ, Vietnam Netherlands Program, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Pham Hoang Van] Baylor Univ, Waco, TX 76798 USA",Ho Chi Minh City University Economics; Curtin University; Ho Chi Minh City University Economics; Baylor University,"Hoai, NT (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",,"Nguyen, Toan/R-3431-2019","Nguyen, Toan/0000-0002-6111-0727",,,,,15,5,5,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUN,2017,40.0,6,,,,,1128,1154,,10.1111/twec.12421,0.0,,,27,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,EX3DS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000403112800006,0

Previous research shows that students choose the degree/major that reports them the maximum utility level. This evidence relies on data from revealed preferences, implicitly assuming that the degree/major a student pursues is the student's preferred degree. However, numerus clausus and other restrictions can condition the choice of major. Under these restrictions, the revealed choice is not necessarily the alternative that maximizes utility. We analyze data from pre-enrollment student-stated preferences regarding degrees within a natural field choice experiment setting. Our findings are in line with the rational choice results obtained in the literature, thus contributing external validity in a previously unexplored setting. In addition, we also contribute a discrete choice modeling strategy and estimation method. The discrete choice model accounts for individual characteristics, degree attributes and their interaction in an specification that is as general as discrete choice models used in the literature. The estimation method can handle cases where the number of alternatives and individual observations is large while other methods are unfeasible.","[Artabe, Alaitz; Gardeazabal, Javier] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Avda Lehendakari Agirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain",University of Basque Country,"Gardeazabal, J (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Avda Lehendakari Agirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain.",javier.gardeazabal@ehu.eus,"Gardeazabal, Javier/G-9765-2015","Gardeazabal, Javier/0000-0001-9200-1710; Artabe, Alaitz/0000-0002-9101-8446",Basque Government through Programas de Ayudas para la Formacion y Perfeccionamiento del Personal Investigador; Fundacion Banco Herrero; Spanish Ministry of Economics [ECO2012-35820]; Basque Government [IT-783-13]; Spanish Ministry of Education [PR2011-0481],Basque Government through Programas de Ayudas para la Formacion y Perfeccionamiento del Personal Investigador(Basque Government); Fundacion Banco Herrero; Spanish Ministry of Economics(Spanish Government); Basque Government(Basque Government); Spanish Ministry of Education(Spanish Government),"We would like to thank Amaia Zarraga for providing us with the pre-enrollment data and her help in making sense of them.

We find no statistically significant relationship between transitory income and health responses. We also find that while there is evidence of state dependence, this does not appear to be responsible for the distribution of responses.

We mainly analyze the differential responses of trading volumes to housing price changes (denoted as price elasticity), employing a quantile cointegrating approach that allows us to capture housing boom-bust cycles earlier. In addition, we also explore the long-term impacts of monetary policies on housing sales. According to our findings, the price elasticities perform differently across the booms and busts of housing markets. Shifts in price elasticities can transmit signals of oncoming upturns, recovery, and downturns of housing cycles, which possibly relate to the business cycle. On the other hand, a contractionary monetary policy exerts a much effective control over an overheated housing market, but an expansionary monetary policy has a relatively small influence on stimulating a depressed housing market. Our findings offer some important suggestions and policy implications.","[Lee, Chien-Chiang; Zeng, Jhih-Hong] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Wang, Chin-Yu] Takming Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Insurance & Financial Management, Taipei, Taiwan",National Sun Yat Sen University; Takming University Science & Technology,"Zeng, JH (通讯作者)，Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",cclee@cm.nsysu.edu.tw; cywang@takming.edu.tw; jehun_tze@yahoo.com.tw,"Lee, Chien-Chiang/AAZ-9983-2020","Lee, Chien-Chiang/0000-0003-0037-4347",National Sun Yat-sen University [05C0301051],National Sun Yat-sen University,"The authors are grateful to the comments of the editor and the two anonymous referees on our paper.

The approximation is inspired by the univariate conditioning procedure proposed by Mendell and Elston, with some modifications to improve accuracy and speed. Very accurate parameter estimations have been achieved in reasonable time for simulated data samples with as much as one million observations.

These dynamic models are based on time-varying latent variables that follow an autoregressive process of order 1, AR(1). Two examples are the stochastic volatility models for the analysis of financial time series and the limited dependent variable models for the analysis of panel data.

In a series of estimations using measurable teacher characteristics, we find that (a) the test performance of all students improves with teacher experience; (b) teacher experience also matters for student performance after the initial years in the profession; (c) the teacher experience effect is most prominent in earlier grades; (d) the teacher experience effects are robust to the inclusion of other classroom quality measures, such as peer group composition and class size; and (e) an increase in teacher experience also matters for career stages with less labor market mobility, which suggests positive returns to on-the-job learning of teachers.

This article seeks to address the void in the extant literature by drawing on the rich experiences of a visible minority investment banker who worked in several countries with colonial legacies. Presented as a narrative, the banker's experience conceptualizes how race ubiquitously materializes in both the field of high finance and the broader postcolonial communities in which it is situated. Indeed, the narrative illuminates the contemporary complexities of race as it unfolds discursively within the organizational setting of high finance. Finally, the article considers some of the implications of racism on visible minority professionals in the era of postcoloniality.","[Prasad, Ajnesh] Tecnol Monterrey, Entrepreneurship & Leadership Res Grp, EGADE Business Sch, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Tecnologico de Monterrey,"Prasad, A (通讯作者)，Tecnol Monterrey, EGADE Business Sch, Carlos Lazo 100, Mexico City 03189, DF, Mexico.",prasad@itesm.mx,"Prasad, Ajnesh/AAS-3674-2020","Prasad, Ajnesh/0000-0002-4368-1796",,,,,30,17,19,1,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

However, many EU Member States have failed to make progress in fighting poverty. This begs the question of whether a more performant EU-level involvement in the field of social policy is conceivable. In this paper, we argue that European minimum standards are the place to start, including principles for minimum social security and minimum wages, as i) the European social objectives cannot be attained without guaranteeing adequate incomes to those in and out of work, and ii) social co-ordination should thus go beyond broad outcome goals such as the reduction of the number of households at risk of poverty or social exclusion. We propose to include policy indicators regarding minimum income protection in the recently revised EU monitoring process of the European Semester.","[Cantillon, Bea; Marchal, Sarah] Univ Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium; [Luigjes, Chris] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Antwerp; University of Amsterdam,"Marchal, S (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Ctr Social Policy, M 186,Sint Jacobstr 2, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",sarah.marchal@uantwerpen.be,,"Marchal, Sarah/0000-0001-9481-9081",European Union [290613]; Research Foundation Flanders,European Union(European Union (EU)); Research Foundation Flanders(FWO),"The research for this paper has benefited from financial support by the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2012-2016) under grant agreement No. 290613 (ImPRovE: Poverty Reduction in Europe: Social Policy and Innovation; http://improve-research.eu).

The analysis is carried out by introducing a smooth transition factor model where the transition between states ('normal' and high financial stress) depends on a financial conditions index. Employing a quarterly dataset over the period 1970: Q1 to 2008: Q4 containing 108 US macroeconomic and financial time series, I find that a monetary policy shock during periods of high financial stress has stronger and more persistent effects on macroeconomic variables such as output, consumption and investment than it has during 'normal' times. Differences in effects among the regimes seem to originate from nonlinearities in both components of the credit channel, i. e. the balance sheet channel and the bank-lending channel.

Using a sample of travel agencies who evaluated the relationship with their main supplier (relationship value, relationship benefits and perceived information and communication technologies (ICTs) use), we attempt to examine the utility of these variables as specific and subjective segmentation criteria for identifying heterogeneous groups. The estimation of a finite mixture model suggests that these bases are able to discriminate firms into six latent classes with different levels of ICT use and relationship variables. The novelty in this work lies in the application of latent segmentation methodology and the simultaneous use of bases associated with ICT and relationship variables in business-to-business tourism.","[Fuentes-Blasco, Maria] Pablo de Olavide Univ, Seville, Spain; [Moliner-Velazquez, Beatriz; Gil-Saura, Irene] Univ Valencia, E-46003 Valencia, Spain",Universidad Pablo de Olavide; University of Valencia,"Fuentes-Blasco, M (通讯作者)，Pablo de Olavide Univ, Fac Business, Dept Management & Mkt, Ctra Utrera,Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain.",mfuebla@upo.es,"Moliner-Velázquez, Beatriz/F-2082-2016; GIL SAURA, IRENE/P-7180-2015; Fuentes Blasco, Maria/E-7800-2016","Moliner-Velázquez, Beatriz/0000-0003-0357-749X; GIL SAURA, IRENE/0000-0002-5758-0806; Fuentes Blasco, Maria/0000-0002-7082-7068",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2013-43353-R],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was carried out under the project ECO2013-43353-R of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness.",,13,3,3,0,25,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

This notion is a constructive solution to theoretical problems resulting from the goal of realizing national and European democracy at the same time, but one might suspect that one of the suggested roles comes more naturally to most citizens. While state citizenship can draw on national identities, EU citizenship appears artificial and constructed, and hence not very attractive. I argue that the contraposition of 'natural' vs. 'artificial' sovereigns is inadequate. Both parts of divided sovereignty need to be understood in a constructivist sense as they are attributed to legal associations. Much in the same way as the idea of national sovereignty had to be appropriated in learning processes, citizens could grow into the role of EU sovereigns.","[Guenther, Klaus] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Günther, K (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Law, Theodor W Adorno Pl 4, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany.",k.guenther@jur.uni-frankfurt.de,,,,,,,9,5,5,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork, it shows TWAs' comprehensive management of migrant labour: recruitment and selection in the countries of origin; cross-border transportation, work and living arrangements in the country of destination; and return to the countries of origin during periods of low production. The article asks whether the distinctiveness of this specific mode of labour management can be understood adequately within the framework of existing theories on the temporary staffing industry. In approaching the staffing industry through the lens of migration labour analysis, the article reveals two key findings. Firstly, TWAs are creating new labour markets but do so by eroding workers' rights and enabling new modalities of exploitation. Secondly, the diversification of TWAs' roles and operations has transformed TWAs from intermediaries between capital and labour to enterprises in their own right.","[Andrijasevic, Rutvica] Univ Bristol, Dept Management, Bristol, Avon, England; [Sacchetto, Devi] Univ Padua, Sch Human & Social Sci, Padua, Italy",University of Bristol; University of Padua,"Andrijasevic, R (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Sch Econ Finance & Management, Dept Management, Priory Rd Complex, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England.",ra14611@bristol.ac.uk,"Andrijasevic, Rutvica/AAG-2776-2019; Andrijasevic, Rutvica/AGD-7347-2022","Andrijasevic, Rutvica/0000-0001-6979-4812; Sacchetto, Devi/0000-0002-3087-680X",,,,,41,27,28,1,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

As the most common supervisors of children's activities, parents have a potentially important role to play in obesity prevention. However, a precondition for parents to improve their children's diets, encourage them to be more physically active, or take them to see a doctor about their weight is for the parent to first recognize that their child is overweight or obese. This paper examines the extent of parental misclassification of child weight status, and its correlates, focusing on the role of parental education and the parent's own obesity status. We find evidence that, among non-obese parents, those who are better educated report their child's weight status more accurately, but among obese parents, the better educated are 45.18% more likely than parents with lower secondary education to give a false negative report of their child's overweight/obesity; this may reflect social desirability bias.

New data from the Good Jobs First Subsidy Tracker illustrates large differences in subsidy spending across the states and that established firms are the disproportionate beneficiaries. In light of this new evidence, we argue that the political presence of the business sector within the state is an important determinant of state subsidy spending. A large political presence helps forward industry interests before government and has the potential to capture state governments. We find support for the cultural capture model by demonstrating that a greater number of lobbyists and campaign contributions from businesses leads to more subsidy spending, all else equal. We conclude that subsidies, and which companies receive them, are a product of both politics and economics.","[Jansa, Joshua M.] Oklahoma State Univ, Polit Sci, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Gray, Virginia] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Polit Sci, Chapel Hill, NC USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Jansa, JM (通讯作者)，233 Murray Hall, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",joshua.jansa@okstate.edu,,,,,,,62,20,23,2,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

A non-probability quota sampling technique was used to survey domestic tourists in Italy through an online questionnaire which encompassed 26 bargaining values and one item to measure the likelihood that the tourists would bargain at the same destination in the future. The data comprised a total of 812 observations. An order probit model and marginal effects were estimated to measure the tourists' propensity to return to Italy for bargaining purposes. The study findings indicate that tourists' propensity to return for bargaining purposes is taken with the awareness that they will not obtain what they expected; as a matter of fact, they are unlikely to care about the final result but instead engage in this behaviour to have fun.","[Kozak, Metin] Dokuz Eylul Univ, TR-35210 Alsancak, Turkey; [Correia, Antonia] Univ Algarve, CEFAGE, Faro, Portugal; [Correia, Antonia] Univ Europeia, Lisbon, Portugal; [Chiappa, Giacomo Del] Univ Sassari, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Chiappa, Giacomo Del] CRENoS, Cagliari, Italy; [Chiappa, Giacomo Del] Univ Johannesburg, Sch Tourism & Hospitality, Johannesburg, South Africa",Dokuz Eylul University; Universidade do Algarve; Universidade Europeia; University of Sassari; University of Johannesburg,"Correia, A (通讯作者)，Univ Algarve, Univ Europeia, CEFAGE, Campus Gambelas, P-8005328 Faro, Portugal.",ahcorreia@gmail.com,"Correia, Antónia/A-5353-2010; Kozak, Metin/H-8361-2019","Correia, Antónia/0000-0002-6707-8289; Kozak, Metin/0000-0002-9866-7529","FCT - National Funding Agency for Science, Research and Technology [UID/ECO/04007/2013 CEFAGE]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [UID/ECO/04007/2013] Funding Source: FCT","FCT - National Funding Agency for Science, Research and Technology; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research is granted by national funds by FCT - National Funding Agency for Science, Research and Technology under the project UID/ECO/04007/2013 CEFAGE.",,77,8,8,0,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Financial network models based on financial exposures are models that aim to depict causal chains of exposures and obligations of counterparties rather than rely solely on statistical correlations on market price-based data for financial institutions. Our starting point is the bilateral claims of the ultimate risk of the main institutional sectors that include banks, non-bank private sectors and non-allocated sectors of the 10 reporting countries that consist of Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. The other non-reporting countries will be merged into one group. The results show that banking systems in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom in particular are making vast amounts of foreign investments, implying that they constitute a central hub in the core. The results in the contagion effect show that all of the other countries are collapsed after a shock from a core country such as the United Kingdom in both rates of loss given defaults of 100 and 60 %.","[Said, Fathin Faizah] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,"Said, FF (通讯作者)，Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia.",fatin@ukm.edu.my,"Said, Fathin/HTN-8384-2023",,,,,,60,3,3,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

In a competitive and efficient market, ships that have more fuel-efficient designs should, all else equal, obtain a rate premium to reflect the fuel savings. In this paper we investigate empirically the determinants of timecharter rates using a comprehensive panel data set of over 9100 timecharter fixtures for bulk carriers above 40,000 DWT between January 2001 and January 2016. We test for the presence of an energy efficiency premium using four different definitions of efficiency, while controlling for key macro, ship-specific, and contract-specific variables. Our findings suggest that the market rate for a standardised vessel dominates in terms of explanatory power, but that vessel age, fuel prices, place of delivery and DWT also are significant determinants across sizes. We show that the earlier findings on the energy efficiency premium in the literature are not robust when expanding the sample in time and vessel size. Using a substantially longer sample across an entire market cycle, we show that only 14-27% of fuel savings are reflected in a higher rate during normal market conditions, while the sign of the relationship flips during market booms such that energy inefficient vessels attract a premium. We introduce several explanations as to why there is an apparent market failure and suggest policy measures that could address this issue. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent scholarship on labour standards in supply chains emphasises the need for complementarity between public and private forms of governance, and the importance of local contexts in shaping compliance outcomes. This paper, in contrast, argues that the distinction between public and private governance belies the complex interaction of regulatory forms and industry dynamics in global production networks. It develops this argument via an analysis of the International Labour Organisation Better Work programme, which, over the last decade, has metamorphosed from a country-specific monitoring programme into a unique model of hybrid governance that has been implemented in a half dozen countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Drawing from field research conducted on Nicaragua's Better Work programme, it examines the achievements and limitations of hybrid governance, and proposes that these can best be understood when the global value chain for apparel is seen as a transnational field within which relational struggles between different stakeholders at the global and national levels shape the political contexts within which particular governance solutions are pursued.","[Bair, Jennifer] Univ Virginia, Dept Sociol, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",University of Virginia,"Bair, J (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Dept Sociol, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",jlb5md@virginia.edu,,"Bair, Jennifer/0000-0002-5083-1385",,,,,41,66,67,2,47,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The majority of firms are now delisted and a number of companies are now owned by financial investors via special purpose vehicles. In some cases, revenue streams from customer water bills have become securitised for decades into the future not only to raise funds for investment, but also for finance distributions to shareholders. The high financing costs associated with these highly leveraged corporate structures are passed on to customers. The regulator, Ofwat, tasked with protecting the interests of consumers, operates largely within a system of price controls intended to mimic a competitive market in the absence of financial speculation. This means that regulation steers away from intervening in the financialised corporate structures that have emerged around some of the water utilities. These manifestations of financialisation are considered to be market outcomes'. This paper explores the discourses and narratives that have developed in the provision of water in EW to create a situation where such rentier transfers are normalised. Using the systems of provision approach, the paper shows that the material culture of water finance has been constructed along narrow lines with superficial consumer consultation, while extensive financial engineering to increase shareholder returns continues unimpeded.","[Bayliss, Kate] Univ London, Sch Oriental & African Studies, London, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Bayliss, K (通讯作者)，Univ London, Sch Oriental & African Studies, London, England.",kb6@soas.ac.uk,"Bayliss, Kate/AAR-3329-2021","Bayliss, Kate/0000-0001-9018-5085",project FESSUD - European Union [266800],project FESSUD - European Union,"Research for this paper was supported by the project FESSUD, which is funded by the European Union under Seventh Framework Programme contract number 266800.",,43,23,24,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

In practice, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is calculated by using the Laspeyres formula, is a measure of inflation but according to the economic approach in price index theory, a well-defined index should satisfy the Laspeyres-Paasche bounding test. In the simulation study we verify this test in the case of the generalized geo-logarithmic index family.

This paper assesses the macroeconomic impact of such changes in the KSA, coupled with reductions in implicit energy subsidies. Based on a dynamic general equilibrium model, our analysis suggests that if the KSA govermrient were to deploy a relatively small quantity of renewable technology, consistent with the country's Vision 2030 plans, there would be a positive impact on the KSA's long run GDP and on households' welfare. However, we demonstrate that if the integration costs of renewable technology were high, then households' welfare would be maximized at around 30-40% renewables penetration. In addition, we show that a policy favoring renewable energy would increase the dependence of the KSA on oil, given that a larger share of GDP would be linked to oil exports and so, potentially, to oil price shocks. Finally, it is shown that exporting significantly more oil onto the international market could have a negative impact on the international oil price and thus could offset the potential gains from the renewable energy policy.","[Blazquez, Jorge; Hunt, Lester C.; Manzano, Baltasar] KAPSARC, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Hunt, Lester C.] Univ Surrey, SEEC, Guildford, Surrey, England; [Manzano, Baltasar] Univ Vigo, Vigo, Spain",University of Surrey; Universidade de Vigo,"Blazquez, J (通讯作者)，KAPSARC, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",Jorge.Blazquez@kapsarc.org; Lester.Hunt@kapsarc.org; BManzano@uvigo.es,"Manzano, Baltasar/H-4367-2015","Blazquez, Jorge/0000-0001-5658-3418",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; FEDER [ECO2015-68367-R],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government),"We are grateful to anonymous referees for their comments and suggestions that have helped to considerably improve the paper; nonetheless, we are, of course, responsible for all errors and omissions.

In analysis of this case study, the framework of 'counter-hegemonic frame integration' is developed by which political incorporation of disruptive frames into multilateral regimes can be assessed. This enables analysis of frame integration across two dimensions: strength of recognition and strength of distributive justice. Five outcomes are differentiated: non-integration, disruptive integration, covert integration, impotent integration, and dominant integration. In doing so, it provides a foundation to more precisely assess counter-hegemonic gains, and with it, theorize counter-hegemonic network influence in multilateralism. Despite various discursive and strategic innovations by advocacy networks, the frame of climate debt as it relates to climate vulnerability has been integrated to be largely compatible with structures of hegemony and stripped of subversive meaning and impact. However, this has not been a linear process: at each stage, there have been areas of progress and setbacks in terms of frame recognition and distributive justice. The analysis contributes to a broader research program to uncover the mechanisms and conditions of transformation of unequal power relations within the world system and identifies critical areas of future research.","[Ciplet, David] Univ Colorado, Environm Studies Program, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Ciplet, D (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Environm Studies Program, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",david.ciplet@colorado.edu,"Ciplet, David/AHC-3418-2022",,Robert and Patricia Switzer Foundation; Horowitz Foundation for Social Policy,Robert and Patricia Switzer Foundation; Horowitz Foundation for Social Policy,This work was supported by the Robert and Patricia Switzer Foundation; the Horowitz Foundation for Social Policy.,,70,8,8,2,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

This paper quantifies the external costs from global fuel subsidies using the latest available data and estimates from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Under preferred assumptions about supply and demand elasticities, current subsidies cause $44 billion in external costs annually. This includes $8 billion from carbon dioxide emissions, $7 billion from local pollutants, $12 billion from traffic congestion, and $17 billion from accidents. These external costs are in addition to conventional deadweight loss, estimated to be $26 billion annually. Government incentives for alternative fuel vehicles are unlikely to cost-effectively reduce these externalities as they do little to address traffic congestion or accidents and only indirectly address carbon dioxide and local pollutants.","[Davis, Lucas W.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Davis, Lucas W.] Energy Inst Haas, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Davis, Lucas W.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Davis, LW (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Davis, LW (通讯作者)，Energy Inst Haas, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Davis, LW (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",ldavis@haas.berkeley.edu,,,,,,,39,15,16,0,21,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2017,38.0,,,,1,,7,27,,10.5547/01956574.38.SI1.ldav,0.0,,,21,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EW9PI,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402851300003,0

In the case when the company is not profitable in the short term but is characterized by good financial liquidity, it has the potential for further development and for improving its performance. However, in a long-term perspective, profitability is more important because its lack in the long term will result in lacking financial liquidity. Therefore, an important element of company management is making a systematic analysis of financial liquidity and profitability, both on the basis of financial statements and on data derived from its accounts. The objective of the article is to present Polish companies' approach to managing financial liquidity and profitability. The article presents the results of a survey made on the issue. Based on the survey, the extent of the use in making management decisions of the following was determined: liquidity ratios, working capital and the demand for working capital, analysis of the cash flow statement, and indicators of profitability. The researched entities indicated the extent of usefulness of managing receivables, liabilities, inventory, and cash in financial liquidity and profitability management.","[Goldmann, Katarzyna] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Accounting, Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Goldmann, K (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Accounting, Torun, Poland.",goldmann@econ.umk.pl,,,,,,,12,5,5,4,15,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-39919-5; 978-3-319-39918-8,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,4.0,,,,,,103,112,,10.1007/978-3-319-39919-5_9,0.0,,,10,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2AH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000407615400009,0

With these types of qualifications, EU and US administration believes that this partnership will boost economic power, and not only the EU and the USA but also all countries in the world will benefit from the outputs of the agreement. On the other hand, although their intensions are widely on the same direction, sometimes controversial platforms occur, because both parties do not want to change their implementations at some topics such as conformity assessments, genetically modified products, and hormone-treated meat. Accordingly, the objective of this paper is to identify mainly the key challenges of the TTIP with qualitative and quantitative data. Descriptive analysis of the data will be displayed. The agreement has two main bodies as horizontal side which means regulatory cooperation and sectorial side. In this paper, regulatory cooperation and its context are considered as essential subjects. Sectors have more details and it is hard to explain all situations in sectors. After focusing on the reasons of the existence of the TTIP, the need will be explained. Then the main elements, such as market access, regulatory coherence, and improved cooperation, are mentioned.

We develop a conceptual framework that stresses the potential malleability of the global monetary system. Economic actors and international institutions are not static but dynamic and respond to events. Accordingly, we highlight two underexplored features of RMB internationalization: first, the variegated and politicized nature of capital account and currency management controls that China is implementing; and second, the manner in which these unique currency management systems are interacting with the ideational and institutional underpinnings of how transnational financial markets are generated and stabilized. Our analytical framework is then applied to examine the interface of China's onshore/offshore RMB markets. We argue that China is adopting a unique mode of monetary governance that reflects a different relationship between the state and market from that which we see in the West at present. Whilst the prospects of China 'muddling through' this internationalization process are uncertain, it remains possible that RMB internationalization will transform the global financial landscape in deeply qualitative as well as purely quantitative ways, ushering in an era of more illiberal state-managed monetary relations.","[McNally, Christopher A.] Chaminade Univ, Hist & Polit Studies, Honolulu, HI 96816 USA; [Gruin, Julian] Univ Amsterdam, Fac Social & Behav Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Gruin, Julian] Univ Warwick, Coventry, W Midlands, England",University of Amsterdam; University of Warwick,"McNally, CA (通讯作者)，Chaminade Univ, Hist & Polit Studies, Honolulu, HI 96816 USA.",christopher.mcnally@chaminade.edu,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/N001982/1]; Chaminade University; ESRC [ES/N001982/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/N001982/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Chaminade University; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by an Economic and Social Research Council Future Research Leaders Fellowship [grant number ES/N001982/1]; Chaminade University.,,66,33,35,2,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Over the past 30 years, many developing countries have experienced spurts of economic growth followed by collapses. In the process, some have fallen further behind the advanced economies, while only a few have enjoyed sustained economic growth. The main purpose of this paper is to provide an assessment of the empirical evidence on the effects of financial globalization for developing economies of the Commonwealth of Independent States (former Soviet Republics). This group of countries was chosen for reasons of geographic proximity and similarities in economic structure; we tried to answer the question: Did the drive by the financial sector globalization empower the growth for the sample countries? On the basis of Blundell and Bond (Journal of Econometrics 87: 115-143, 1998), a dynamic panel data model is employed. The econometric methodology is the system GMM two-step estimator developed by Arellano and Bover (Journal of Econometrics 68: 29-51, 1995), Blundell and Bond (Journal of Econometrics 87: 115-143, 1998; Econometric Reviews 19: 321-340, 2000), and Roodman (The Stata Journal 9: 86-136, 2009). Considering a possible correlation between the lagged dependent variable and the panel fixed effects and the small T, large N restriction, Windmeijer's (Journal of Econometrics 126: 25-51, 2005) procedure is implemented so that standard errors become robust after getting small sample size of the dataset under control. Our results show that only trade has a positive effect on growth, while FDI financial openness and financial integration do not have any impact on growth for the counties' sample.","[Moudatsou, Argiro; Xanthos, Georgios] Technol Educ Inst Crete, Sch Accounting & Management, Business Adm Dept, Iraklion, Greece; [Moudatsou, Argiro] Hellenic Open Univ, Patras, Greece",Hellenic Mediterranean University; Hellenic Open University,"Moudatsou, A (通讯作者)，Technol Educ Inst Crete, Sch Accounting & Management, Business Adm Dept, Iraklion, Greece.;Moudatsou, A (通讯作者)，Hellenic Open Univ, Patras, Greece.",moudatsou@staff.teicrete.gr,,"Xanthos, George/0009-0004-7250-3296",,,,,19,0,1,0,5,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-39919-5; 978-3-319-39918-8,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,4.0,,,,,,129,136,,10.1007/978-3-319-39919-5_11,0.0,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2AH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000407615400011,0

It chimes in with the view that shadow banks create 'shadow money', i.e. private substitutes for bank deposits. The article analyses how the three main forms of shadow money - money market fund shares, overnight repurchase agreements and asset-backed commercial papers - were affected by the short-term government intervention and medium-term regulation during and after the 2007-2009 financial crisis in the United States. The analysis reveals that the measures taken between 2007 and 2014 integrated some shadow money forms in the public money supply. In the year after the Lehman collapse, the initially private shadow money supply was either publicly backstopped or de-monetised as it had broken par to bank deposits. The public backstops took on the form of emergency facilities established by the Federal Reserve and guarantees proclaimed by the Treasury. Those backstops imply that the public institutional framework to protect bank deposits was extended to some forms of shadow money during the crisis. This tendency has continued in post-crisis regulation. Accordingly, the 2007-2009 financial crisis has triggered a paradigmatic change in the monetary system, attributable to the political decisions of US authorities.","[Murau, Steffen] City Univ London, Dept Int Polit, London, England",City University London,"Murau, S (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Dept Int Polit, London, England.",,,"Murau, Steffen/0000-0002-3460-0026",European Union [640772],European Union(European Union (EU)),This work was supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme via its funding for the project Distributed Global Financial Systems for Society (DOLFINS) [grant number 640772].,,91,27,27,3,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The Russian emigre economists made important contributions to the << high economic theory >> and they were essential for the formation of the economic communities and traditions in several Southeast and Central European countries (Bulgaria, former Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Romania). The majority of Russian economists studied in Germany and Austria, and shared liberal economic views. Our interest in these economists is the result of the observation that their research offers an interesting attempt for the liberal synthesis of the main ideas of the Austrian School (especially those of Carl Menger) and the key insights of Russian economic thought, especially the original economic and sociological system of Peter Struve. That synthesis could be considered as a missed opportunity for the further development of the liberal theory, because for many reasons it remained isolated.

Control through ownership over the Russian Internet companies has increased, but in a finely calibrated fashion in order not to spark discontent and risk the formation of a social movement. The Internet's global nature, however, has made it impossible to use the same methods against international companies. The Russian government has had to exert other forms of pressure, change legislation, or block entire social networks. Furthermore, increasing and more systematic control through ownership carries with it considerable long-term consequences and costs, both when it comes to the modernization of Russia and in terms of possible rising discontent if Internet users no longer accept that the repressive measures taken are in their interest.","[Pallin, Carolina Vendil] Swedish Def Res Agcy FOI, Stockholm, Sweden",FOI - Swedish Defence Research Agency,"Pallin, CV (通讯作者)，Swedish Def Res Agcy FOI, Stockholm, Sweden.",carolina.vendil.pallin@foi.se,,,"NEPORUS project, Norwegian Research Council NORRUS [228205]","NEPORUS project, Norwegian Research Council NORRUS","This work was supported by the NEPORUS project, Norwegian Research Council NORRUS [grant number 228205].",,47,53,59,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

In addressing this question, we focus specifically on small-scale corruption that arises when Russians encounter employees of service provision organizations. We analyze survey data gathered in the summer of 2015 from Russia to trace the links between personal corrupt behavior and political attitudes. We show that participation in everyday corruption lowers a person's support for the political regime, both as a bivariate relationship and in a multivariate model with controls. Being involved in corrupt transactions reduces support for the regime through two indirect mechanisms: by making the political leadership's performance seem worse and by heightening perceptions that corruption is widespread among the country's leaders. We find no support for arguments in the literature that bribery and other forms of bureaucratic corruption help citizens pursue their needs in the face of inefficient state institutions and less developed economies. In Russia, those who frequently encounter corruption are less, not more, happy with the regime.","[Reisinger, William M.; Claypool, Vicki L.

The main argument for this drive was cost-effectiveness. The handling of cash was declared expensive and risky, mainly by economists. Empirical evidence is, however, scarce, and in fact tends to show the opposite; at least for small amounts of money to be paid. More recently, the pressure has been augmented considerably. Part of it is the phasing out of the 500 (sic) banknote. This time, the argument is fighting criminal activities and, in particular, terrorism. More likely, the true reason is to make the unconventional measures of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) more effective: negative nominal interest rates and inflation targeting. Several legal concerns exist in this context. The total abolition of cash would neither be compatible with EU law nor with German constitutional law. Although the wording of Article 128 TFLU only empowers (may) the European Central Bank (ECB) to issue euro-banknotes, it presumes the existence of cash. The ECB does not have the power to abolish it. The same result may be derived from Article 20 paragraph 1 Federal Constitution of Germany (social state). Restricting the use of issued banknotes and coins denominated in euro would be incompatible with their property of being legal tender following Article 128 TFLU. It is highly questionable whether such measures would be in conformity with the principle of proportionality enshrined in Article 1 paragraph 1 and 4 TEU and protocol no 2 of the primary law of the EU. The obligation to accept cash denominated in euro follows already from its virtue as legal tender; also for government entities. In addition, this result also follows from the secondary law of the EU: Commission decision 2010/191/EU of 22 March 2010; notwithstanding recital 19 of Regulation (EC) 975/98 that is legally not part of the norm.","[Siekmann, Helmut] Goethe Univ, Money Currency & Cent Bank Law, Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Siekmann, H (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ, Money Currency & Cent Bank Law, Frankfurt, Germany.",siekmann@imfs-frankfurt.de,,,,,,,83,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0921-8580,2197-1889,978-3-319-59846-8; 978-3-319-59845-1,FINAN MON P,,,2017,44.0,,,,,,153,178,,10.1007/978-3-319-59846-8_10,0.0,,,26,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL1NM,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447914500010,0

The results are diverse and in many cases inconclusive, which makes this subject still to be of great interest, especially for the emerging countries. This study analyses the level and the factors that influence the leverage of the Bucharest Stock Exchange listed companies, basing and relating the analysis with the main theories identified in the literature. The database is formed by annual observations collected through the Reuters Eikon platform, for the period 2005-2014. The analysis was performed in SPSS.23, using multivariate regression, for an unbalanced panel data. The dependent variable, represented by leverage, was calculated in accounting indicators. The motivation of this study was testing the factors previously identified and analyzed especially on US and others big countries. Taking into account that the researches performed on the Romanian economy are hampered by the limited database, which is available for short term periods, this study may contribute to complete and validate the hypotheses. The conclusions of the models have partially validated our hypothesis. Thus, a positive impact generated by the company's size was noticed, while factors such as assets tangibility, performance or liquidity have a negative impact. Also, it had been noticed that the leverage variation in a certain period of time is strongly correlated with the initial leverage level, thereby supporting the idea that firms adjust their leverage in a certain range, or even to a target level. According to our results, it can also be said that the assumptions of the pecking order theory particularly applies on the analyzed sample.","[Vintila, Georgeta; Nenu, Elena Alexandra] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Vintila, G (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",vintilageorgeta@yahoo.fr; alexandranenu@yahoo.com,"Vintila, Georgeta/AAY-8162-2021; Vintila, Georgeta/C-4935-2011","Vintila, Georgeta/0000-0002-0342-9246; Vintila, Georgeta/0000-0002-0342-9246",,,,,57,0,0,0,0,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-383-6,,,,2017,,,,,,,327,343,,,,,,17,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7OU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455266300025,0

Due to the potential occurrence of the Downs-Thomson (D-T) Paradox after highway capacity expansion, the paper investigates whether the D-T Paradox can be circumvented by implementing transit subsidy policies. The effects of different transit subsidy schemes are explored: subsidizing the transit company (cost subsidy) or the passengers (passenger subsidy) with the financial support from either government funding or road pricing revenue.

We extend the Student's t and the exponential generalised beta distribution of the second kind stochastic location and stochastic seasonal DCS models. We consider the generalised t distribution as an alternative for the error term and also consider dynamic specifications of volatility. We use a unique dataset of spot electricity prices for El Salvador, Guatemala and Panama. We consider two data windows for each country, which are defined with respect to the liberalisation and development process of the energy market in Central America. We study the identification of a wide range of DCS specifications, likelihood-based model performance, time-series components of energy prices, maximum likelihood parameter estimates, the discounting property of conditional score, and out-of-sample forecast performance. Our main results are the following. (i) We determine the most robust models of energy prices, with respect to parameter identification, from a wide range of DCS specifications. (ii) For most of the cases, the in-sample statistical performance of DCS is superior to that of the standard model. (iii) For El Salvador and Panama, the standard model provides better point forecasts than DCS, and for Guatemala the point forecast precision of standard and DCS models does not differ significantly. (iv) For El Salvador, the standard model provides better density forecasts than DCS, and for Guatemala and Panama, the density forecast precision of standard and DCS models does not differ significantly.","[Blazsek, Szabolcs; Hernandez, Hector] Univ Francisco Marroquin, Sch Business, Guatemala City 01010, Guatemala",,"Blazsek, S (通讯作者)，Univ Francisco Marroquin, Sch Business, Guatemala City 01010, Guatemala.",sblazsek@ufm.edu,,,Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Universidad Francisco Marroquin,Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Universidad Francisco Marroquin,"We would like to thank the journal editor and the anonymous reviewer for their helpful comments.

With constant elasticity of substitution utility function and unit demand, we find positive market share for both high-end and low-end vehicles, but not necessary for middle-end vehicles. Market segmentation may have two regimes according to different levels of subsidy on electric vehicles (EVs), and only a sufficiently high subsidy allows for the existence of low type EV market share welcomed by median income consumers. An EV subsidy cut will definitely crowd out the market share of high type EV and expand that of internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV). And given in a regime where low type EVs survive, EV subsidy cut's influence on low type EV market share is ambiguous, which depends on the relative consumer density around decision cutoff points.","[Chen, Xiao] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wu, Tian] Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, NCMIS, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wu, Tian] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wu, Tian] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Big Data Min & Knowledge Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Rui] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Psychol, Key Lab Behav Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Guo, Xiaoxian] China Petr Technol & Dev Corp, Beijing, Peoples R China","Tsinghua University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Academy of Mathematics & System Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Psychology, CAS","Wu, T (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, NCMIS, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Zheng, R (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Psychol, Key Lab Behav Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",chenx.09@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn; wutian@amss.ac.cn; zhengrui@psych.ac.cn; guoxx@cptdc.cnpc.com.cn,"Chen, Xiao/GYV-1077-2022","Chen, Xiao/0000-0003-0387-2288; Wu, Tian/0000-0002-5557-7232","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71390331, 71771209]; Special fund for research cooperation of the faculty and research institute of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences [Y652025Y00]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Special fund for research cooperation of the faculty and research institute of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences,"The project was co-sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71390331, 71771209), Special fund for research cooperation of the faculty and research institute of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Y652025Y00).",,22,17,18,9,49,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,1879-2375,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Their coordinated development between the two can better promote sustainable, steady and fast growth of metropolitan economy. However, little quantitative research has been conducted on their mutual relations. To fill this gap, three contributions are made. First, through literature review and field survey, two sets of key indicators for metropolitan logistics and economic development are proposed. Second, the entropy method is applied to objectively determine indicators' weights to precisely evaluate the development level of metropolitan economy and logistics. Third, an evaluation model for coordinated development is constructed to scientifically measure the coordinated development degree. Empirical studies based on the measuring model have been conducted by taking five China's metropolises as subjects. Scores can be obtained to examine which indicators are the constraints for sustained, coordinated development and which are below the average, which are of vital importance affecting governmental policy-making and investment planning.","[Lan, Shulin] Univ Hongkong, Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Tseng, Ming-Lang] Asia Univ, Inst Innovat & Circular Econ, Taichung, Taiwan; [Tseng, Ming-Lang] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Business, Panjin, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong; Asia University Taiwan; Dalian University of Technology,"Tseng, ML (通讯作者)，Asia Univ, Inst Innovat & Circular Econ, Taichung, Taiwan.;Tseng, ML (通讯作者)，Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Business, Panjin, Peoples R China.",Lanshulin1349@sina.com; Tsengminglang@gmail.com,"Tseng, Ming Lang/M-9051-2014","Tseng, Ming Lang/0000-0002-2702-3590",,,,,39,11,11,0,53,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

This research focus on the effects of both cognitive factors and risk attitudes on fire mitigation behavior. Two cognitive factors are considered: threat appraisal and coping appraisal in the Protection Motivation Theory framework. In particular, the independent influence of the six components of threat appraisal (perceived probability, perceived severity, and fear emotions) and coping appraisal (response efficacy, self-efficacy, and response cost) on fire risk mitigation behavior are examined. Three different types of fire risk mitigation behavior: maintenance and cautions, structural building measures, and fire insurance policy are considered. This study presents the data of a field survey among three ancient Chinese complexes. Results indicate that coping appraisal and risk attitudes are important variables in terms of risk mitigation behavior. In particular, response efficacy and risk attitudes significantly contribute to the models that explain fire risk mitigation behavior. These findings suggest that the effectiveness of risk mitigation measures should be focused on risk communication, and risk attitudes should be emphasized in estimating fire insurance demand.","[Liu, Tianzhuo; Jiao, Huifang] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Management, 96 JinZhai Rd, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS","Jiao, HF (通讯作者)，Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Management, 96 JinZhai Rd, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China.",tzliu@ustc.edu.cn; jhf204@mail.ustc.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71471168],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71471168).,,48,6,7,3,44,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

To date, research on the nature and directions of causality of the links between these variables has been hindered by the lack of longitudinal approaches. This paper takes such an approach by exploring how people across different population groups adjust their residential environments and attitudes over time. Two latent class transition models are used to segment a population into consonant and dissonant classes to reveal differences in their adjustment process. Interactions between (1) the distance to railway stations and travel-mode-related attitudes and (2) the distance to shopping centres and the importance of satisfaction with these distances are modelled. The models reveal mixed patterns in consonant and dissonant classes at different distances from these destinations. These patterns remain relatively stable over time.

This study uses insights from manufacturing company executives collected by means of in-depth interviews with 50 manufacturers in the United Kingdom to develop an understanding of manufacturing location decision making. The findings indicate that companies derive competitive advantage from organizing manufacturing in different ways. Retaining or reshoring manufacturing to a company's home country can enhance new product development, control of quality, product customization, delivery performance, and cost leadership. On the other hand, companies can enhance new product development, customization, and delivery performance for new markets, if production facilities are offshored to or in proximity to these locations. In addition, some companies use a hybrid approach of offshoring the production of some components or products for cost arbitrage while retaining or reshoring other components or products for advantages from value chain integration. Based on the findings of this study, a set of key manufacturing location questions are developed that should be considered by firms pondering onshore, offshore, reshore, or hybrid manufacturing location decisions.","[Theyel, Gregory] Calif State Univ East Bay, Management, Hayward, CA USA; [Hofmann, Kay] Univ Appl Sci Osnabruck, Strategy & Int Business, Osnabruck, Germany; [Gregory, Mike] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England",California State University System; California State University East Bay; University of Cambridge,"Theyel, G (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Hayward, 25800 Carlos Bee Blvd, Hayward, CA 94542 USA.",gregory.theyel@csueastbay.edu,,"Hofmann, Kay/0000-0003-1320-0338",,,,,68,26,30,1,37,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Most attempts to estimate the natural rate use a closed-economy framework. We argue that in the face of greater integration of global product and capital markets, an open economy framework is more appropriate. We provide some initial estimates of the natural rate for the USA and Japan in a two-country framework. Our identifying assumptions include a close relationship between the time-varying natural rate of interest and the low-frequency fluctuations of potential output growth in both the home country and the foreign country. Our results suggest that the natural rates in both countries are mainly determined by their own trend growth rates of potential output. Nevertheless, the other country's trend growth plays an important role in several specific periods. The gap between the actual real interest rate and our estimated natural rate offers valuable insights into the recent stance of monetary policy in both of these two countries.","[Wynne, Mark A.] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Res Dept, 2200 N Pearl St, Dallas, TX 75201 USA; [Zhang, Ren] Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Econ, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Dallas; University System of Ohio; Bowling Green State University,"Zhang, R (通讯作者)，Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Econ, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA.",mark.a.wynne@dal.frb.org; renz@bgsu.edu,,,,,,,18,6,7,0,7,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We categorize the Indian states into high and low infant mortality regions to capture the diverse disease environment and analyze the nature of the association between parental human capital and child survival and nutrition measures at birth. We restrict our analysis only to firstborns to avoid confounding from a number of factors including sex-selective abortions in the higher birth orders. We broadly find that parental human capital, especially maternal health, is a strong and significant predictor of a child's birth outcomes under adverse disease environment. In the rural areas of the high infant mortality states, a 10 centimeter increase in maternal height is associated with 1.7% lower probability of a child dying as a neonate and 5% increase in birth weight around the mean. These estimates suggest that an investment in human capital of the mothers from this region could accompany large gains in survival and nutrition outcomes of their children. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Indeed, it is argued that the so-called 'Smart Mobility' transition, in which these technologies combine to transform how the mobility system is organised and operates, has already begun. As with any socio-technical transition there are critical questions to be posed in terms of how the transition is managed, and how both the benefits and any negative externalities of change will be governed. This paper deploys the notion of ensuring and enhancing public value as a key governance aim for the transition. It sets out modes and methods of governance that could be deployed to steer the transition and, through four thematic cases explores how current mobility governance challenges will change. In particular, changing networks of actors, resources and power, new logics of consumption, and shifts in how mobility is regulated, priced and taxed will require to be successfully negotiated if public value is to be captured from the transition. This is a critical time for such questions to be raised because technological change is clearly outpacing the capacity of systems and structures of governance to respond to the challenges already apparent. A failure to address both the short and longer-term governance issues risks locking the mobility system into transition paths which exacerbate rather than ameliorate the wider social and environmental problems that have challenged planners throughout the automobility transition.","[Docherty, Iain] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Marsden, Greg; Anable, Jillian] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, 34-40 Univ Rd, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Glasgow; University of Leeds,"Docherty, I (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",Iain.Docherty@glasgow.ac.uk,,"Anable, Jillian/0000-0002-4259-1641; Marsden, Greg/0000-0003-3570-2793; Docherty, Iain/0000-0002-4070-4294","RCUK Energy Programme, ESPRC Award [EP/J00460X/1]; EPSRC [EP/J00460X/1] Funding Source: UKRI","RCUK Energy Programme, ESPRC Award; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","This paper is partly based on research undertaken as part of the Disruption: the raw material for low carbon change project, funded under the RCUK Energy Programme, ESPRC Award No. EP/J00460X/1.

The narrative pays particular attention to whether the difference in power between the EU and less democratic countries affects European identity formation. The empirical explorations deliver the theoretical argument that the EU establishes an aporetic - contrasting but at the same time constitutive - relationship between a democratic European self and what the EU perceives as less democratic others. The difference in power between these two affects the content and intensity of the EU's democratization discourse, while there is no firm evidence that it directly impacts the process of aporetic identification.

Three categories of determinants of the Euro Overnight Index Average/Polish Overnight Index Average (EONIA/POLONIA) spreads are considered: (1) monetary policy instruments such as open market operations, standing facilities and minimum reserve requirements; (2) measures of liquidity conditions; and (3) market expectations and risk measures. Applying the ARFIMA-GARCH models, we show that the statistical and economic properties of the EONIA and POLONIA spreads are quite different. The EONIA spread has a long memory while the POLONIA spread is characterized by a short memory. This difference is important from the viewpoint of a stabilizing monetary policy. The impact of shocks on the future levels of the spread was stronger for the POLONIA spread, but it was short-lived in comparison with the EONIA spread. Most of the analysed variables significantly influenced the spreads during the financial crisis, while the biggest differences in the impact of determinants between the EONIA and POLONIA spreads occurred during the period of relative stability.

While these have improved citizens' lives worldwide, progress has been uneven and have in turn led to substantial cross-country health inequalities. This article looks at the effects of these inequalities on between-country economic inequality since 1900 using a level accounting framework that includes life expectancy as an important part of human capital besides education. The main results show that health has been a historically important source of cross-country income variation. In 1900 and 1955, differences in life expectancy accounted for almost 20 percent and a quarter of between-country income inequality. In addition, I find that the reduction of cross-country health differentials between mid-20th century and 1990 was an important source of income convergence. In a counterfactual exercise, I show that between-country income inequality would have been almost 20 percent higher nowadays, had the process of health convergence after 1955 not taken place. Finally, I find that the relative importance of health for income levels has stayed constant in the last three decades due to a deceleration in the rate of health convergence. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed Cluster Stations and Regress (CSR) modeling approach involves first clustering PBS stations based on the types of trips they attract using k-means or fuzzy c-means clustering techniques. After obtaining station-cluster membership values for each station, we estimate multilevel mixed-effect regression models with interactions between the station-cluster membership variables and determinants of PBS station usage. Determinants considered in the empirical models include the socio-demographic and commute characteristics of the residents in each PBS station's census tract, weather variables, temporal variables, and PBS station proximity to restaurants, jobs, transit stops, rail stations, the CBD, bicycle infrastructure, and other PBS stations. The model results clearly indicate that determinants of PBS station usage vary across station-clusters and including station-cluster interaction terms significantly improves model fit. Additionally, the results of cross-validation tests indicate that the CSR approach is a promising method to model monthly PBS station usage. The empirical results also clear up conflicting findings in the literature in terms of the impact of nearby PBS stations on station usage. We find that station usage increases with the number of other PBS stations within 1-5 km for member trips. However, after controlling for this effect, station usage decreases as the number of other PBS stations within 0.8 km increases.","[Hyland, Michael; Hong, Zihan; Pinto, Helen Karla Ramalho de Farias; Chen, Ying] Northwestern Univ Civil & Environm Engn, Transportat Ctr, 600 Foster St, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",,"Chen, Y (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ Civil & Environm Engn, Transportat Ctr, 600 Foster St, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",MichaelHyland2013@u.northwestern.edu; ZihanHong2012@u.northwestern.edu; HelenPinto2020@u.northwestern.edu; y-chen@northwestem.edu,"Hyland, Michael/L-9504-2016","Hyland, Michael/0000-0001-8394-8064",Northwestern University Transportation Center,Northwestern University Transportation Center,The authors are thankful to the Northwestern University Transportation Center for financially supporting this research.

We discuss whether there is a potential role for CS in medium to small-sized towns and in less densely populated rural areas. In large cities CS is provided by large profit oriented firms, capable of offering efficient and flexible services, using the most advanced technologies with highly differentiated and customized prices. In lower density areas and small-to-medium size cities the challenges are much greater. The lower demand resulting from a complex of unfavorable factors (higher car ownership level, larger parking availability, low public transport service, fewer or absent taxi service and so on) requires a different business model for the provision of CS: more socially oriented, with a greater involvement of local municipalities and public transport operators to offer a service, most likely at favorable prices. The paper reports the results drawn from a survey on the potential demand for CS conducted in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region, Italy, a region characterized by small-sized towns and less-densely populated rural areas where CS is not currently offered. It is found that there is a not negligible demand (3.7% of the population holding a driving license) and that the likely users would be the ones that are better informed about CS, environmentally conscious and young. They would be more frequent among students or unemployed people, rather than among professionals, as in the more urban environments. It is also found that CS would mostly be used for non-commuting and longer trips.","[Rotaris, Lucia; Danielis, Romeo] Univ Trieste, Dipartimento Sci Econ Aziendali Matemat & Stat, Ple Europa 1, I-34100 Trieste, Italy",University of Trieste,"Rotaris, L (通讯作者)，Univ Trieste, Dipartimento Sci Econ Aziendali Matemat & Stat, Ple Europa 1, I-34100 Trieste, Italy.",lucia.rotaris@deams.units.it; danielis@units.it,,,,,,,29,41,42,1,34,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

The trace statistic test for cointegration proposed by (Johansen, 1995) demonstrates the presence of such a trend for most unions. A disaggregated analysis identifies a common stochastic trend for several though fewer than half of country pairs within a union. Some unions such as the Eurozone have small shares of cointegrated country pairs. Yet, the share of cointegrated country pairs is large relative to countries outside currency unions. Comparison to a control group (country pairs where one country belongs to a given union and the other country does not) indicates that the cointegration found within a currency union is a union-specific trait and not a feature of the individual countries within the union. These results provide an alternative metric to intraunion trade for gauging the extent of currency union integration.","[Whitten, Gregory W.] Lingnan Univ, Dept Econ, Tuen Mun, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Lingnan University,"Whitten, GW (通讯作者)，Lingnan Univ, Dept Econ, Tuen Mun, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",,,"WHITTEN, Gregory William/0000-0002-4043-5258",,,,,32,0,0,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,SEP,2018,41.0,9,,,,,2414,2438,,10.1111/twec.12639,0.0,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,GS6NI,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000443813500006,0

The main novelty of the present study is that we extend previous studies by performing three wavelet variants in bivariate and multivariate frameworks, namely the wavelet multiple correlation, the wavelet multiple cross correlation and wavelet cohesion. The findings point out a significant changing pattern in the dynamic linkage between sharia stocks and Islamic bond yields in the time-frequency domain. A strong positive association is evidenced in the short horizons and a negative linkage is branded for longer time-scales. Some resemblances are found for the wavelet cohesion corroborating the existence of potential portfolios' diversification opportunities at lower frequencies. The multivariate wavelet cross correlation unveils that the intensity of the co-movement reaches its zenith at high frequencies. These results are not similar to the bivariate wavelet coherence but are coincident with the wavelet cohesion approach, which may be due to the difference in dimensionality of the wavelet approaches. The implications of this study will be useful for Islamic portfolio managers, international investors and market regulators in better encircling the best ways to adopt a proactive knowledge of Islamic financial markets behavior.","[Aloui, Chaker] King Saud Univ, Coll Business Adm, BO Box 2459, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia; [Jammazi, Rania] IPAG Business Sch, Blvd St German, Paris, France; [Jammazi, Rania] Manouba Univ, Natl Sch Comp Sci, Tunis, Tunisia; [Ben Hamida, Hela] Imam Muhammad Ibn Saud Islamic Univ IMSIU, Coll Econ & Adm Sci, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",King Saud University; IPAG Business School; Universite de la Manouba; Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University (IMSIU),"Jammazi, R (通讯作者)，IPAG Business Sch, Blvd St German, Paris, France.;Jammazi, R (通讯作者)，Manouba Univ, Natl Sch Comp Sci, Tunis, Tunisia.",cmaloui@ksu.edu.sa; jamrania2@yahoo.fr; benhamida_hela@yahoo.fr,"Aloui, Chaker/T-8129-2018",,Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University through the Research Group Project [RGP-211],Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University through the Research Group Project,C.

The decomposition of a general inequality index into these two components allows to analyse the prevalence of fair or unfair income inequality within a country. This paper suggests to test the differences between the two sources of inequality in a simple way using the ANOVA framework adapted to decompose the coefficient of variation, to better suit the requirements of an inequality index. The proposed procedure is applied to the Italian Survey on Income and Living Condition (IT-SILC data, wave 2005 and 2011). The empirical results help identifying the circumstances that foster the rise of inequality of opportunities in Italy. Our analysis shows, in particular, that father education, region of residence and gender result as the most relevant circumstances determining inequality of opportunity. On the other side, the role of mother education starting from a lower level as an inequality of opportunity factor has increased its influence over time.","[Arbia, Giuseppe] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Largo Francesco Vito 1, Rome, Italy; [Pace, Maria Lucia] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Largo A Gemelli 1, Milan, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; IRCCS Policlinico Gemelli; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Arbia, G (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Largo Francesco Vito 1, Rome, Italy.",giuseppe.arbia@unicatt.it.com; marialucia.pace@unicatt.it.com,"arbia, giuseppe/AAD-1772-2022","Pace, Maria Lucia/0000-0002-9657-3756",,,,,34,1,2,1,12,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Initially, the innovating firm in a developed country exports the branded product to a developing country. Once a patent expires or when the government grants a licence to local firms to produce generic equivalents, the innovating firm is forced to compete with generic producers. Under certain conditions, entry of generic firms reduces the price of the branded product and a generic competition paradox does not occur. There are two possible long-run equilibrium solutions. In one scenario, the innovating firm which exports the branded product and the local generic producers may coexist in the developing country. In the other scenario, the brand producer exits and a trade reversal may occur, that is, the developing country may even export the generic products to the developed economy.","[Choi, Yoonho] Simpson Coll, Indianola, IA 50125 USA; [Choi, E.

These strategies are collectively referred to as flexible-sharing strategies, and are modelled parsimoniously using a single parameter to describe their performance at the local level. This model provides a solid building block to examine these strategies at large infrastructure levels. We build an analytical framework with input output systems and fixed set theory to evaluate bimodal arterials with flexible-sharing strategies implemented at multiple locations. Using this framework, the performance of a bimodal arterial is quantified by a set of vehicle throughput. This set is convex with linear constraints, which can be used to solve optmization problems on bimodal arterials. The requirements to efficiently identify links and nodes to install flexible-sharing strategies along a bimodal arterial are mathematically established. Lastly, one particular flexible-sharing strategy, the pre-signal, is illustrated as an example both mathematically and with a calibrated simulation.","[He Haitao; Menendez, Monica] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Transport Planning & Syst, Traff Engn Grp, Zurich, Switzerland; [Guler, S.

This leaves instrumental variable estimation. In all likelihood, the system may contain certain forms of nonlinearities. These nonlinearities might arise because of endogenous weighting matrices, functional form differences in the endogenous variables, etc. The existence of such nonlinearities strongly suggests the use of nonlinear forms of the instruments. Issues of this sort were pointed out in Kelejian and Piras (Spatial econometrics, Elsevier, Amsterdam, 2017) and Kelejian (Lett Spat Resour Sci 9(1):113-136, 2016).

Kocherlakota's (1996) definition has a limitation: it is not applicable to environments with state variables. The limitation is important because many time-inconsistent problems have state variables. This paper displays a natural generalization of reconsideration-proofness to environments with state variables, and shows that it leads to nonexistence in three examples. Such nonexistence contrasts with the general existence theorem obtained in environments without state variables in Kocherlakota (1996). In the first two examples, existence can be recovered with a modification in the solution concept. In the last example, nonexistence occurs even with the modified solution concept. Insights about further research are derived from these nonexistence results.","[Nozawa, Wataru] Kyushu Univ, Dept Engn, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan",Kyushu University,"Nozawa, W (通讯作者)，Kyushu Univ, Dept Engn, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan.",wnwnwnwnwnwn@gmail.com,"Nozawa, Wataru/T-4228-2017","Nozawa, Wataru/0000-0001-8075-4248",,,,,9,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,AUG,2018,85.0,2,,,,,253,273,,10.1007/s11238-017-9637-5,0.0,,,21,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GO1ZL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439761200007,0

In contrast to prevailing literature focusing on entrepreneurial firms, this study offers insights on how social networks function in defense contractors, which tend to be mature firms. The main conclusion is that having more network connections is associated with faster short-term employment growth (from 2014 to 2015) for defense contractors, but there is a limit to that benefit. The analysis also shows that social networks do not aid market diversification for defense contractors. This poses an interesting challenge for defense contractors, as they need to balance the priorities of short-term growth and long-term success.","[Shuai, Xiaobing; Chmura, Christine] Chmura Econ & Analyt, 1309 East Cary St, Richmond, VA 23219 USA; [Shuai, Xiaobing; Chmura, Christine] Univ Richmond, Richmond, VA USA",University of Richmond,"Shuai, XB (通讯作者)，Chmura Econ & Analyt, 1309 East Cary St, Richmond, VA 23219 USA.",xshuai@richmond.edu,,,"Office of Economic Adjustment, DoD","Office of Economic Adjustment, DoD","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was prepared under contract with MassDevelopment with financial support from the Office of Economic Adjustment, DoD.",,24,1,2,1,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

By doing this, specific tactical and operational policies can be implemented to retain and attract new customers. In the public transport (PT) arena, few PSQ studies account for both service encounter and global satisfaction. Further, although some studies consider customer heterogeneity, we believe it has not been adequately captured. Regarding the problem of modelling PSQ from a PT service provider, we present a case study from Santiago, Chile. We analyse the PSQ derived from an extensive (n = 25,094) urban bus system satisfaction survey using structural equation models (SEM). Explicitly, we incorporate heterogeneity for both travel charactenstics and sociodemographic attributes utilising a Multiple Indicator Multiple Cause (MIMIC) approach. We model two simultaneous regression equations regarding satisfaction with the bus-line (service encounter) being used and with the system (global), correcting for heterogeneity in all the satisfaction constructs via the SEM-MIMIC approach. Our main result is that the most critical variable for service encounter satisfaction is frequency/waiting time. For global satisfaction, the most significant attribute is tangibles/image, which includes satisfaction with the allied Metro service, with other users' behaviour, and with information availability. As the perceived waiting time affects all satisfaction constructs negatively, we consider it a critical policy variable to tackle. Our model can serve as a planning tool for any PT administrator. The framework applies to any service setting with independent service-specific and global satisfaction attributes.","[Allen, Jaime] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Transport Engn & Logist, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile; [Carlos Munoz, Juan; de Dios Ortuzar, Juan] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Sustainable Urban Dev CEDEUS, Dept Transport Engn & Logist, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Allen, J (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Transport Engn & Logist, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile.",jallen@uc.cl,"Munoz, Juan Carlos/D-2604-2011; Ortúzar, Juan de Dios/F-8277-2013; Allen, Jaime/R-6205-2018","Ortúzar, Juan de Dios/0000-0003-3452-3574; Allen, Jaime/0000-0002-7616-009X","Volvo Research and Educational Foundations (VREF) [15110020]; FONDECYT [1150657]; Institute for Complex Engineering Systems [FONDECYT FB0816]; Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT); Universidad de Costa Rica [21151147, OAICE-CAB-08-145-2015]",Volvo Research and Educational Foundations (VREF); FONDECYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); Institute for Complex Engineering Systems; Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)); Universidad de Costa Rica,"The Centro de Desarrollo Urbano Sustentable (CEDEUS), CONICYT/FONDAP 15110020, the Bus Rapid Transit Centre of Excellence (BRT +) funded by Volvo Research and Educational Foundations (VREF), FONDECYT 1150657, and the Institute for Complex Engineering Systems (FONDECYT FB0816) supported this research.

We introduce imperfect competition within the banking system according to the Schumpeterian growth paradigm, and we theoretically and empirically show that the effects of bank concentration on economic growth depend on the proximity to the world technology frontier. The theory predicts that when a country reaches a sufficient level of financial development, bank concentration has a negative effect on development and growth and that this effect increases when the country approaches the frontier. However, for countries with credit constraints, growth depends on only financial intermediation.","[Diallo, Boubacar] Qatar Univ, Doha, Qatar; [Koch, Wilfried] Univ Quebec, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Koch, Wilfried] CIRPEE, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Qatar University; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Diallo, B (通讯作者)，Qatar Univ, Doha, Qatar.",,,,,,,,53,14,18,0,27,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

We study negotiated transaction prices in the commercial real estate market, which is characterized by heterogeneous assets, illiquidity, and highly segmented local markets, all of which increase the importance of asymmetric information in negotiated pricing outcomes. Using 114,588 industrial, multi-family and office sale transactions that occurred during 1997-2011, we document that distant commercial real estate buyers pay, on average, premiums of 4 % to 15 % relative to local buyers, controlling for individual property characteristics as well as time fixed-effects. We also examine the extent to which the sources of these observed premiums are a product of higher search costs/information asymmetry problems associated with distance (search cost channel) or a result of reference-dependence preference/anchoring based on the price levels in the investors' local market (behavioral biases channel). Our results suggest the observed price premiums are explained by distant investors who face higher search costs and are at an information disadvantage compared to investors located in closer proximity to the property. In contrast, anchoring plays a more muted role in explaining observed premiums. The use of an intermediary (broker) increases, on average, the acquisition prices of buyers and decreases the disposition prices of sellers by 3 % to 8 %. This result is consistent with the incentive real estate agents have to convince sellers to dispose of their properties too quickly and to convince buyers to search less and therefore pay higher prices.","[Ling, David C.; Naranjo, Andy] Univ Florida, Hough Grad Sch Business, Dept Finance & Real Estate, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Petrova, Milena T.] Syracuse Univ, Whitman Sch Management, Dept Finance, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Syracuse University,"Petrova, MT (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Whitman Sch Management, Dept Finance, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",david.ling@warrington.ufl.edu; andy.naranjo@warrington.ufl.edu; mpetrova@syr.edu,"Petrova, Milena/AAX-5309-2021",,Real Estate Research Institute,Real Estate Research Institute,"We thank the Real Estate Research Institute for providing partial funding of this project.

Because of the high volatility of all-cargo traffic, especially since the 2008 economic crisis, and the increasing market share of integrators, this industry requires more detailed analysis. By using stochastic frontier analysis in this study, a distinction between random deviations from the production frontier and actual differences in technical efficiency is made. We find that smaller carriers react more flexible to a crisis and that non-integrated carriers are more efficient than the integrators when they are analysed jointly, which is however complicated by their different business models. These findings are not only useful for academics and industry actors, but also for policy makers, since air cargo contributes significantly to the profitability of airlines and airports.","[Balliauw, Matteo; Meersman, Hilde; Onghena, Evy; Van de Voorde, Eddy] Univ Antwerp, Dept Transport & Reg Econ, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp,"Onghena, E (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Dept Transport & Reg Econ, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",evy.onghena@uantwerpen.be,"Balliauw, Matteo/AFS-5070-2022","Balliauw, Matteo/0000-0003-1008-8109",,,,,57,13,15,2,32,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Returning to theories of class we use Dahrendorf's reading of Marx where three components of classes, the objective, the subjective and political struggle, are used to define the current formation of the working class in China. Class is not defined by status, identity or legal rights, but location in the sphere of production embedded within conflictual capital-labour relations. By engaging with the heated debates on the rise of a new working class in China, we argue that the blending of employment situation and rights in the West with the idea of precarity of migrant workers in China is misleading.

Taking advantage of large number of high-quality studies on FDI and its role in explaining the growth in firms' productivity in Europe, we adopt recent meta-regression analysis methodsfunnel asymmetry and precision estimate tests and precision-effect estimate with standard errorsto explain the heterogeneous impact of FDI. This paper assesses the country-specific impact of FDI on firms' performance, after taking publication selection bias, econometric modelling and the individual studies' characteristics fully into account. Our results show that on average FDI has a positive indirect impact on productivity. The impact is especially significant in selected European countries, and we interpret this as a sign of better absorptive capacities in those countries.","[Bruno, Randolph Luca] UCL, London, England; [Bruno, Randolph Luca] Rodolfo DeBenedetti Fdn, Milan, Italy; [Bruno, Randolph Luca] IZA Bonn Inst Labor, Bonn, Germany; [Cipollina, Maria] Univ Molise, Campobasso, Italy",University of London; University College London; University of Molise,"Bruno, RL (通讯作者)，UCL, London, England.;Bruno, RL (通讯作者)，Rodolfo DeBenedetti Fdn, Milan, Italy.;Bruno, RL (通讯作者)，IZA Bonn Inst Labor, Bonn, Germany.",,"Bruno, Randolph Luca/I-3301-2019; Cipollina, Maria/A-9809-2016","Bruno, Randolph Luca/0000-0002-3436-5046; Cipollina, Maria/0000-0002-1454-4039",,,,,114,9,11,1,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2018,41.0,5,,,,,1342,1377,,10.1111/twec.12587,0.0,,,36,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,GF5VX,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432037100009,0

Holding constant a buyer's purchase price, property type, neighborhood, and purchase and sale timing, we find that capital gains have been systematically lower for low-income and minority home buyers in every market in our sample. In some cases, the unconditional retums realized by these buyers were higher, a phenomenon driven by their higher propensity to purchase lower-priced homes that experienced high levels of appreciation. Taken as whole, our findings call into question the widespread claim that encouraging homeownership for low-income and minority households is a panacea for addressing wealth inequality.","[Mayock, Tom] UNC Charlotte, 9201 Univ Ctr Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA; [Mayock, Tom] Belk Coll Business, Off Comptroller Currency, Dept Econ, 9201 Univ Ctr Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA; [Malacrida, Rachel Spritzer] Santander Holdings USA Inc, Boston, MA USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte; United States Department of the Treasury; Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,"Mayock, T (通讯作者)，UNC Charlotte, 9201 Univ Ctr Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.;Mayock, T (通讯作者)，Belk Coll Business, Off Comptroller Currency, Dept Econ, 9201 Univ Ctr Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",tmayock@uncc.edu; rachel.malacrida@santander.us,"Mayock, Tom/HTP-2878-2023",,,,,,69,7,10,1,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

This study fills in the gap in existing knowledge by providing evidence for non-linearity in the effects of clean water using semiparametric fixed effects approach with city-level nationwide longitudinal dataset between 1922 and 1940, which covers 91% of total city population. According to our baseline estimate, the clean water accounts for approximately 27% of the decrease in the crude death rate in this period. Our results also indicate the heterogeneities in the improving effects of clean water with respect to the coverage of tap water among citizens. We found evidence that the installation of the water-supply system itself decreased waterborne infections and infant mortality but did not substantially improve the overall mortality rate in the initial phase. However, the subsequent expansion of tap water could result in a continuous decline in the overall risk of deaths in the second phase. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Using the multi-agent concept, this study provides a simulation model based on the social force paradigm that can be applied to extract the movement characteristics of boarding passengers and calculate bus stop dwell time. For each passenger, the model incorporates five different forces that drive individual agents' boarding and alighting. Three statistical indicators (Doorway Flow Rate, Doorway Crowdedness and Waiting Entropy) are proposed to analyze the impact of static measures in different simulation scenarios. The simulation results illustrate that measures for enlarging platform areas and installing guide guardrails can observably reduce the variation in bus dwell times, but not the length of the time itself. This is because the boarding order in these measures requires a certain amount of time per passenger. However, the application of these two measures could improve the psychological experience of passenger boarding. Therefore, we recommend that transit operators in Nanjing should fully consider the gains and losses based on the implementation of the measures to make the best decision.","[Ji, Yanjie; Gao, Liangpeng; Chen, Dandan; Ma, Xinwei] Southeast Univ, Sch Transportat, Jiangsu Prov Collaborat Innovat Ctr Modern Urban, Jiangsu Key Lab Urban ITS, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ruochen] Newcastle Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Geosci, TORG, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Southeast University - China; Newcastle University - UK,"Ji, YJ (通讯作者)，Southeast Univ, Sch Transportat, Jiangsu Prov Collaborat Innovat Ctr Modern Urban, Jiangsu Key Lab Urban ITS, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",jiyanjie@seu.edu.cn,"高, 良鹏/HCI-2098-2022; Chen, Dan/GRY-2691-2022","Chen, Dan/0000-0002-1570-9034","Projects of International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [51561135003]; Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China [51338003]; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, China [LY17E080013]; EPSRC [EP/N010612/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Projects of International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, China(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","The financial support from the Projects of International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 51561135003), the Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 51338003) and the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, China (no.

Assuming that agents are bounded by their information access and processing, what are the consequences on market dynamics? We expose the result of simulations in an ABM that considers the liquidity as an endogenous characteristic of the market and allows to design investors as bounded rational. In a call auction market, where two risky assets are exchanged, traders are defined as a mix between fundamentalist and trend-follower outlook. Each one differs as to behaviour, order-placement strategy, mood, knowledge, risk-aversion and investment horizon. We place agents in a context of evolving fundamental values and order placement strategy; they perceive the fundamental but they also have some heterogeneous belief perseverance; and they adapt their orders to the market depth so as to maximise their execution probability and their profit. By adding bounded rationality in their information processing, we show that (1) usual features as trend-follower outlook and heterogeneous investment horizon are important features to generate excess volatility of asset prices and market inefficiency; (2) the learning fundamental value stabilises the market price and the trading volume; (3) the order-placement strategy increases trading volume, but reduces market efficiency and stability; (4) the agent's mood prevents illiquid market and weakly increases the market volatility as classical noise trader agents; (5) the impatience to sell of traders is always present in the market: the market sell orders are always more numerous than the market buy orders.","[Lespagnol, Vivien] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, EHESS, Marseille, France; [Lespagnol, Vivien] Cent Marseille, Marseille, France; [Rouchier, Juliette] Univ Paris 09, PSL Res Univ, CNRS, F-75016 Paris, France; [Rouchier, Juliette] LAMSADE, F-75016 Paris, France",Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Lespagnol, V (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, EHESS, Marseille, France.;Lespagnol, V (通讯作者)，Cent Marseille, Marseille, France.",vivien.lespagnol@gmail.com; juliette.rouchier@dauphine.fr,,"Rouchier, Juliette/0000-0002-4022-6720",,,,,54,5,5,2,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

New York's money-center banks anticipated the onset of a financial crisis, prepared for it by accumulating substantial reserves, and during the European crisis, continued business as usual. New York's leading bankers deliberately and collectively decided on the business-as-usual policy in order to minimize the impact of the panic in the United States.

The decision review system, introduced in November 2009, gives teams a limited right to challenge an on-field umpire's decision. Of the 1,201 on-field umpire decisions that were challenged in test matches by nine playing teams between 2009 and 2014, 310 (25.81%) were reversed by a 3rd umpire. Controlling for several match and team characteristics, logistic regressions show that (1) leg before wicket (LBW) and caught decisions that are ruled out by the on-field umpire are more likely to be reversed than decisions that are ruled not out; (2) for both LBW and caught decisions, home and away teams are equally likely to win a 3rd umpire reversal.","[Shivakumar, Ram] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, 5807 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Shivakumar, R (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, 5807 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",ram.shivakumar@chicagobooth.edu,,,,,,,12,2,2,1,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

Traditional assets experience stock adjustment costs while ICT investment incurs flow adjustment cost. In the short run, liquidity is a key determinant of investment independently of the asset type. In the long run, uncertainty significantly affects ICT.

To do so, we introduce an indicator that summarizes the threat to euro area price stability originating from self-reinforcing expected inflation differentials. The indicator is computed based on persistent deviations of national expected inflation and GDP growth rates from the corresponding euro area aggregate. It thereby captures area-wide excess demand pressure on the euro area inflation rate. In order to determine the information content of this indicator, we add it to an empirical monetary policy reaction function. We then analyze this reaction function in the framework of a generalized ordered choice model that fits the data a lot better than its commonly used, more restricted counterpart. Within this empirical framework, we find that after controlling for several area-wide aggregates, national information does not provide additional information that is indicative of the ECB's policy rate decision.","[Brauning, Christina] Nederlandsche Bank, POB 98, NL-1000 AB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Fendel, Ralf] WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Burgpl 2, D-56179 Vallendar, Germany",European Central Bank; De Nederlandsche Bank NV; WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management,"Bräuning, C (通讯作者)，Nederlandsche Bank, POB 98, NL-1000 AB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",c.a.b.braeuning@dnb.nl; ralf.fendel@whu.edu,,,,,,,29,1,1,0,5,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The government instruments are a pension scheme and a age-independent nonlinear income tax schedule. At the second-best optimum, the pension system constrains the agents' labor supply behavior, forcing them to work to achieve a required lifetime performance. Income taxes affect labor supply directly, but also indirectly through pension incentives. The indirect effect of taxes counteracts the usual forces in the efficiency-redistribution tradeoff: through the interplay with the pension system, decreasing taxes induces redistribution and reduces productive efficiency.","[Chone, Philippe] Univ Parris Saclay, Ctr Rech Econ & Stat CREST, 5 Ave Henry Chatelier, F-91120 Palaiseau, France; [Laroque, Guy] UCL, Dept Econ, London, England; [Laroque, Guy] Sci Po, Dept Econ, Paris, France",University of London; University College London; Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po),"Laroque, G (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Econ, London, England.;Laroque, G (通讯作者)，Sci Po, Dept Econ, Paris, France.",philippe.chone@ensae.fr; g.laroque@ucl.ac.uk,,,European Research Council [ERC-2010-AdG-269440-WSC WTBDS],European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)),"Funding is acknowledged from the European Research Council (reference ERC-2010-AdG-269440-WSC WTBDS).

To answer this question, we conduct a realistic out-of-sample experiment that deals with the most prominent problems in short-term forecasting: mixed frequencies, ragged-edge data, asynchronous data releases and a large set of potential information. We compare a direct leading indicator-based GDP forecast with two bottom-up procedures-that is, forecasting GDP components from the production side or from the demand side. Generally, we find that the direct forecast performs relatively well. Among the disaggregated procedures, the production side seems to be better suited than the demand side to form a disaggregated GDP nowcast.","[Heinisch, Katja] IWH Halle, Kleine Maerkerstr 8, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Scheufele, Rolf] Swiss Natl Bank, Boersenstr 15, CH-8022 Zurich, Switzerland",Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung Halle (IWH); Swiss National Bank (SNB),"Scheufele, R (通讯作者)，Swiss Natl Bank, Boersenstr 15, CH-8022 Zurich, Switzerland.",Katja.Heinisch@iwh-halle.de; Rolf.Scheufele@snb.ch,"Heinisch, Katja/ABF-6886-2020","Heinisch, Katja/0000-0002-2664-4950",,,,,71,20,20,0,14,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

When we informed farmers in randomly chosen villages about wholesale prices, average farmgate sales and prices were unaffected, but pass-through to farmgate prices increased. These results can be explained by a model where farmers bargain ex post with village middlemen, with the outside option of selling to middlemen outside the village.

We propose a new method for constructing the MST-Partial. We use daily price indices of 57 stock markets from 2005 to 2014 and find (i) that the distributions of the Pearson correlation coefficient and the partial correlation coefficient differ completely, which implies that the correlation between pairs of stock markets is greatly affected by other markets, and (ii) that both MSTs are scale-free networks and that the MST-Pearson network is more compact than the MST-Partial. Depending on the geographical locations of the stock markets, two large clusters (i.e., European and Asia-Pacific) are formed in the MST-Pearson, but in the MST-Partial the European cluster splits into two subgroups bridged by the American cluster with the USA at its center. We also find (iii) that the centrality structure indicates that outcomes obtained from the MST-Partial are more reasonable and useful than those from the MST-Pearson, e.g., in the MST-Partial, markets of the USA, Germany, and Japan clearly serve as hubs or connectors in world stock markets, (iv) that during the 2008 financial crisis the time-varying topological measures of the two MSTs formed a valley, implying that during a crisis stock markets are tightly correlated and information (e.g., about price fluctuations) is transmitted quickly, and (v) that the presence of multi-step survival ratios indicates that network stability decreases as step length increases. From these findings we conclude that the MST-Partial is an effective new tool for use by international investors and hedge-fund operators.","[Wang, Gang-Jin; Xie, Chi] Hunan Univ, Sch Business, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Gang-Jin; Xie, Chi] Hunan Univ, Ctr Finance & Investment Management, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Gang-Jin; Stanley, H.

Using Malaysian data for 2003-10, this paper provides estimates of the overall impact of economic immigration on crime, and evidence on different socio-economic mechanisms underpinning this relationship. The IV estimates suggest that immigration decreases crime rates, with an elasticity of around -0.97 for property and -1.8 violent crimes. Three-quarters of the negative causal relationship between immigration and property crime rates can be explained by the impact of immigration on the underlying economic environment faced by natives. The reduction in violent crime rates is less readily explained by these factors.","[Ozden, Caglar] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Testaverde, Mauro] World Bank, Social Protect & Labor Practice, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Wagner, Mathis] Boston Coll, Boston, MA USA",The World Bank; The World Bank; Boston College,"Wagner, M (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Boston, MA USA.",cozden@worldban-k.org; mtestaverde@worldbank.org; mathis.wagner@bc.edu,,,,,,,51,13,15,1,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

Labour is used to produce traded intermediate inputs which are used in the production of traded final goods. Large countries gain relatively more from comparative advantage than from the division of labour, while the opposite is true for small countries. As in the data, large countries export a smaller share of final goods and a larger share of intermediate goods than small countries.

These three interrelated developments indicate a transition in the way we understand the role and function of the food chain on the micro-, the meso- and the macro-level. This transition can be understood in two fundamental different ways, namely either as an extension of technocratic management beyond the micro level to the meso- and macro-level of the food chain, or as a transition to a new responsible professionalism. We argue that the technocratic approach is not able to address the socio-ethical issues that come along with these three developments, and explore various competencies and abilities that constitute a new responsible professionalism in the food chain.","[Blok, V] Wageningen Univ, Social Sci Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6707 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Blok, V (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Social Sci Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6707 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",vincent.blok@wur.nl,"Blok, Vincent/E-6210-2013","Blok, Vincent/0000-0002-9086-4544",,,,,20,0,0,0,0,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,30,34,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_2,0.0,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000002,0

It consists of undertakings, which implementation is aimed to protect human life and health, as well as property and natural environment against the danger of fire, natural disaster or other local threat. In Poland, the National Fire and Rescue System operates on three functional levels, corresponding to the administrative structure of the country. The lowest is executive level. Next, there is a voivodeship level, and the highest is central (national) level. Fire risk analyses are conducted at the central level in the scale of entire country and concern mainly forest fires. Data covering other fires (also national) are compiled by the Headquarters of the State Fire Service. They also have an aggregated form. However, there are no specific studies on the phenomena occurring at the lowest functional level, for individual entities. Their implementation would allow not only for description and analysis of occurring fires but also for forecasting and capturing the relation that affect them. Thus commanders of individual units would be able to assess their resources, both human and technical, estimate their own capabilities in relation to existing phenomena and make necessary modifications by adapting their base to predicted threats. In this way, the readiness of such a unit would increase, and as a result the chance for the quick and effective rescue operation. The article proposes a mathematical model for forecasting fire risk on the example of selected rescue and fire-fighting unit. The presented model will enable to appropriately shape the readiness of primarily available transport means and human resources, which is particularly important in systems where the safety, health, and life of people depend on the efficient and timely execution of tasks.","[Borucka, Anna] Mil Univ Technol, Fac Logist, Warsaw, Poland",Military University of Technology in Warsaw,"Borucka, A (通讯作者)，Mil Univ Technol, Fac Logist, Warsaw, Poland.",anna.borucka@wat.edu.pl,"Borucka, Anna/B-8048-2019","Borucka, Anna/0000-0002-7892-9640",,,,,6,4,4,1,1,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,373,395,,,,,,23,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300021,0

Genovesi stressed the role of private prizes (incentives) and market in fostering the development of society, and claims that crowding-in is more common than crowding-out.","[Santori, Paolo] Libera Univ Maria Santissima Assunta, I-00193 Rome, Italy",,"Santori, P (通讯作者)，Libera Univ Maria Santissima Assunta, I-00193 Rome, Italy.",santoripaolo91@gmail.com,,"Santori, Paolo/0000-0001-5705-0461",,,,,39,10,10,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

While the paper adopted a number of methods comprising of field observations, reference to relevant literature, and questionnaire survey of 96 SBFs, a regression analysis was used to ascertain the relationship between production subcontracting forms and SBFs development. In line with the literature, this study identified three production subcontracting forms-specialised subcontracting, supplier subcontracting and capacity subcontracting. The study evaluated the relationship between production subcontracting forms and SBFs development-cost reduction, risk reduction, access to resources and knowledge. The paper found that two production subcontracting forms-capacity subcontracting and specialised subcontracting have positive relationship with cost reduction and risk reduction while there was no relationship between these production subcontracting types and resource accessibility as well as knowledge accessibility. This paper concludes by suggesting that constraints to SBFs development in Nigeria can be improved upon by constant de-centralization of production activities by SBFs through the various productions production subcontracting forms analysed in this paper.","[Chukwunweike, Nwokocha Victor] Univ Nigeria, Dept Geog, Nsukka, Nigeria",University of Nigeria,"Chukwunweike, NV (通讯作者)，Univ Nigeria, Dept Geog, Nsukka, Nigeria.",victor.nwokocha@unn.edu.ng,"Nwokocha, Victor/AAT-4976-2020","Nwokocha, Victor/0000-0002-2364-4752",,,,,58,0,1,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,226,236,,,,,,11,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540723300027,0

As we know from the start of last big financial crisis risky loans (e.g., Mortgages) can cause a worldwide problem. In general people with lower levels of debt, literacy tends to transact in high-cost manners, incurring higher fees and using high-cost borrowing. Due to the New Consumer Credit Act from 2016, there was expected a change in the loan amounts and risk. It is too early to judge the impact of that act, but we can see a basic tendency that shows us people are still willing to go in debts.

Using exogenous variation in residential density, we find that an increase in density causes non-trivial decreases in property values: a 10% increase in density decreases price per square foot by between 1.3% and 2%. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first paper to measure this effect. Further, we find that the negative effect of density is biggest in magnitude for low density apartment projects and the magnitude is decreasing in the density of the project, and that the negative effect of density is increasing in magnitude in the number of facilities in the project. In contrast, the effect of project density does not differ significantly by either project height or amount of open space. Our results contribute to the discussion on whether a denser urban form is a goal worth pursuing, suggesting that at least part of the benefits arising from externalities of high density are offset by the negative effects of localized density, which is manifested in households' willingness to pay a premium to live in low density apartment projects.","[Fesselmeyer, Eric] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore, Singapore; [Fesselmeyer, Eric; Seah, Kiat Ying Sky] Natl Univ Singapore, IRES, Singapore, Singapore; [Seah, Kiat Ying Sky] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, Singapore, Singapore",National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore,"Fesselmeyer, E (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore, Singapore.;Fesselmeyer, E (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, IRES, Singapore, Singapore.",ecsef@nus.edu.sg,"Seah, Kiat Ying/J-9361-2013",,,,,,35,14,15,1,23,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

Researchers (e.g. Gounary, Koritos, 2012; Kirkman, 2012; Hariri, 2014; Serdyukov, 2017) agree that an educational innovation (including e-learning) process and the process of its adaptation are dependent on a number of factors, for example, educators should possess appropriate skills in order to adapt that innovation according to the needs and expectations of its users, and these modifications should go in line with the learning outcomes and the goals of the curriculum in general. After defining key terms and establishing a rationale for adaptation, we present a general framework to organize adaptive innovation system. The article presents a case of educational practice, illustrated by interview results that reveal the peculiarities and barriers for adaptation of e-learning tools.

Theory suggests that if the cost of owning a car increases, people will use other modes of transportation, thus reducing house prices farther away from the CBD and increasing house prices closer to the city center. However, in an empirical setting, the cost of car ownership is likely to be endogenous and correlated with various unobserved factors that also contribute to changes in the house price gradient. To obtain causal effects, we exploit a unique feature of Singapore's car registration process. All cars in Singapore must have a Certificate of Entitlement (COE), but the number available is restricted based on the traffic concerns of the government and are allocated through a competitive bidding process. We use the number of COEs available each quarter as an instrument for the price of a COE, as the quota is likely to be correlated with the price of the COE but not the price of housing at various distances from the CBD. We find that when the price of a COE increases, the price of housing closer to the city center increases, suggesting that increases in the price of a car cause individuals to increase their willingness to pay to locate closer to the CBD.","[Huang, Naqun] Nanjing Audit Univ, Inst Urban Dev, 86 West Yushan Rd, Nanjing 211815, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Li, Jing] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, 90 Stamford Rd, Singapore 178903, Singapore; [Ross, Amanda] Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Box 870224,Alston 248, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",Nanjing Audit University; Singapore Management University; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Ross, A (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Box 870224,Alston 248, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",naqun.huang.2012@phdecons.smu.edu.sg; lijing@smu.edu.sg; aross@cba.ua.edu,"Ross, Amanda/AAI-9138-2020; Li, Jing/H-6822-2013","Li, Jing/0000-0001-5269-134X; , Naqun/0000-0003-2559-2690",,,,,34,7,7,3,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

During the session, a lady asked him: Mr. Gates, Dead Aid, a book by Dambisa Moyo, illustrates that giving more aid to Africa over the course of the years did not alleviate poverty, instead it kept the economy crippled with governments asking for more aid. This fluke made a cycle of aid giving which resulted in nothing productive and it has not been used to solve the immediate problems and the money is not being used to make businesses sustainable in Africa. What's the foundation's view in this regard? To which Mr. Gates responded Books like that are promoting evil. Mr. Gates' sound bite sheds light upon aid as a topic of controversy: in his creed, aid is humane, virtuous and will do the global poor a world of good while anti-aid literature is evil. From Tibor Mende and his famous book From aid to the re-colonization (bestseller in the 70s) to Dambisa Moyo and her book Dead Aid, the issue of assistance to poor countries has been much talked about. Between the fifteen billion dollars transferred to Europe under the Marshall Plan and the thousand billion dollars sucked up by the sub-Saharan Africa since independence, we have come to understand that a poorly-designed assistance automatically produces state-aid recipients. In this paper we will endeavor to weigh the geopolitical and geo-economic impacts of aid and demonstrate why aid, presumably an altruistic deed for the benefit of the poor and the needy, has sparked such a hot debate.","[Kasbaoui, Tarik] Chouaib Doukkali Univ, FPD, El Jadida, Morocco; [Nechad, Abdelhamid] Abdelmalek Essaadi Univ, ENCGT, Tetouan, Morocco",Chouaib Doukkali University of El Jadida; Abdelmalek Essaadi University of Tetouan,"Kasbaoui, T (通讯作者)，Chouaib Doukkali Univ, FPD, El Jadida, Morocco.",,,,,,,,13,1,1,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,133,144,,,,,,12,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540718700013,0

The role of agriculture is great and multidimensional, both for a small country like the Republic of Croatia and for the community of states- the European Union. With the accession of the Republic of Croatia to the European Union, the issues of production, sales and marketing of agricultural products in the European Union are directed to the EU's common agricultural policy, whose advantages are reflected in unique and common conditions and appearances in world markets, but at the same time pose a major challenge for producers. Negative trends in employment in the agricultural sector and decreasing value-added agriculture as a percentage of the total GDP, in the Republic of Croatia, in the European Union and in the world, could be challenged by branding agricultural products, as well as branding agriculture. Even though agriculture, as an important sector of the economy, is not very popular, marketing activities are popular. Those activities, such as branding, for example, should popularize agriculture and indirectly involve youth labour force in the agricultural sector.","[Kelic, Ivan; Turjak, Sofija; Unukic, Ivana] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Kelic, I (通讯作者)，JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.",ivan.kelic@efos.hr; sofija.turjak@efos.hr; ivana.unukic@efos.hr,"Unukic, Ivana/IVU-8633-2023","Unukic, Ivana/0000-0001-8872-7930",Croatian Science Foundation [3396],Croatian Science Foundation,This work has been fully supported by Croatian Science Foundation under the project number 3396.,,11,0,0,0,3,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,1667,1679,,,,,,13,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300093,0

As a result of the ongoing transformation, a new form of economic activity has emerged, known as sharing economy. Sharing economy gives us the opportunity to make of available resources more effectively, It is possible by connecting people using online platforms that enable the provision of services and the cooperative use of assets. Transport belongs to the one of a crucial area of sharing economy. The aim of the article is to analyse changes in urban mobility model based on desk study research. Shared mobility characterizes the new urban mobility model, like the shared use of cars (carpooling and car-sharing), or bicycles (bicycle-sharing system). Furthermore, the approach of users to transport is changing, mobility is perceived as a service ordered and paid by a mobile application (Mobility as a Service). The article also presents possible visions for the development of urban mobility, which may vary depending on the adopted strategies and solutions. Some cities plan to significantly reduce car traffic or make car ownership pointless.","[Kuzia, Michal] Gdynia Maritime Univ, Dept Logist & Transport Syst, Gdynia, Poland",Gdynia Maritime University,"Kuzia, M (通讯作者)，Gdynia Maritime Univ, Dept Logist & Transport Syst, Gdynia, Poland.",m.kuzia@wpit.am.gdynia.pl,,,,,,,13,1,1,1,10,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,1526,1544,,,,,,19,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300084,0

To achieve this goal, an exploratory investigation was carried out in eight subsidiaries of multinationals established in Morocco as well as four Moroccan companies. Interviews focused on four HRM practices (recruitment, compensation, performance evaluation and career management). The empirical data analyzed show that hybridization process may depend on a range of cultural and institutional factors, the stakeholders and the type of HRM practices.

Social media has changed the way companies communicate with their targeted audience and the way they reach them, It has changed the way travellers research potential destinations and the way they choose the activities that they participate in once they arrive, but most importantly, it has changed the way that travellers use social media to make purchasing decisions. Word of mouth is considered to be the most trusted form of advertising, and Influencer marketing is essentially virtual word of mouth that has become stronger with the strengthening of social media and it is, without a doubt, impacting the behaviours of customers. Importance of Influencer marketing is seen in the fact that consumers are much more likely to positively perceive and react to a message that comes from a trusted friend or persona over a sponsored post that comes from a company. Since influencers have generated their credibility online through their user generated content (personal experience and driving messages), they can speak to certain niches and reach them more effectively. The data for this paper is collected through literature review and the main questions that this paper is seeking to get answers to are what are the benefits of using social media influencers as marketing strategy in tourism and does influencer marketing have impact on tourism industry? The findings of this paper suggest that influencers do bring a lot of benefits to a tourism industry, which can be seen in created content and extended content reach, credibility, cost-effectiveness, image building and incite to action, as well as they do impact tourism industry. This paper proposes a theoretical framework to better understand the unquestionable importance of influencers on tourism industry, but also announces several questions for further research, related to ethics and perceived credibility and trustworthiness. The existing literature focuses mostly on influencer marketing in general and there is a lack of studies specific to the tourism sector, which can be perspective for further research.","[Nujic, Lidija; Herak, Martina] Fac Econ Osijek, Management, Osijek, Croatia; [Palic, Tonina] Fac Econ Osijek, Mkt Management, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek; University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Nujic, L (通讯作者)，Fac Econ Osijek, Management, Osijek, Croatia.",lidija.nujic@gmail.com; toninapalic1@gmail.com; martinaherakdesign@gmail.com,,,,,,,34,2,2,5,57,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,1258,1275,,,,,,18,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300068,0

It does this through (1) highlighting the political significance of the far right in securing the electoral-political hegemony of neo-liberalism within Britain and the United States since the early 1980s; and (2) the way in which the socio-economic insecurities produced by neo-liberalism have helped to provoke far right responses as an alternative form of racialised moral economy. Consequently, while the relationship between the far right and neo-liberalism is contradictory, racial signifiers and racism have provided an important means through which such contradictions have been eased.","[Saull, Richard] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Polit & Int Relat, London E1 4NS, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Saull, R (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Polit & Int Relat, London E1 4NS, England.",r.g.saull@qmul.ac.uk,,,,,,,119,11,11,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Expectations are high and seem to be overwhelming. CFO should manage an efficient finance organisation and give business insights to manage performance and strategy. Those heroes are given the name Value Integrators or Performance Accelerators as they outperform in optimise performance, provide calculable insights, cover risk management and support rational decision-making. Working as an Interim CFO inside a medium-sized company will create much pressure as it is Management with a constrained duration, in which a manager is appointed from outside the organisation to perform an assignment for a limited period, after which the manager will leave the organisation. The effect of the strategic partnership between CEO and CFO has been tested. The demographic similarity in tenure and educational level have an indirect positive influence on the company's financial performance. Age and gender similarities have no significant impact. The paper seeks to identify the characteristics of the successful corporation between CEO and CFO when the CFO is an Interim Manager in medium-sized companies. A literature review looks into Interim Management, the roles, duties, traits, and success factors of CEO, CFO, and Top Management Teams. Within that context, theories on interim management and the upper echelon theory are reflected. The successful corporation between CEO and CFO is dependent on the fit of the working couple, which is influenced by the characteristics of each of them. The current situation of the organisation, the top management team characteristics and the level of necessity to change the organisation's culture determines which characteristics of the Interim CFO fit best. Future research should consider the Interim CFO fit with the CEO and the Top management team to evaluate the contributions an interim CFO can make, rather than merely comparing the organisation's performance before and after the interim Assignment. The paper would be of value for Interim Managers in the CFO role and those charged with the responsibility for the selection and development of Interim CFOs.","[Schechowiz, Ralf] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Schechowiz, R (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,"Schechowiz, Ralf/AAQ-7634-2021",,,,,,71,0,0,2,16,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-344-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,600,614,,,,,,15,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP0MG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000535358500056,0

The latter criticism is in line with Friedman, though Phelps and Friedman draw decisively different policy conclusions: While Friedman's criticism of the Phillips curve implied to not make use of such a trade- off even if it existed in the short run, Phelps explicitly discussed the options for economic policy with respect to the remaining choice between unemployment and inflation.","[Schwarzer, Johannes A.] Univ Hohenheim, Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Schwarzer, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Dept Econ 520h, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany.",schwarzer.econ@gmail.com,,,,,,,67,0,0,0,2,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

In particular, the proposed route diversion policies attempt to avoid the off-ramp queue spill-over onto the freeway mainstream and the resulting freeway congestion by appropriately re-routing the freeway vehicles through nearby off-ramps towards the same destination. The proposed route diversion concepts are based on feedback control laws and are tested for a hypothetical, but quite typical, network infrastructure and three different traffic scenarios by use of macroscopic simulation. In the first traffic scenario, the user-optimal conditions may be achieved without off ramp queue spill-over and creation of mainstream congestion; thus the route guidance system may propose an alternative route without any disbenefit for the compliant drivers. In the second case, the user-optimal conditions may be achieved only after the off-ramp queue spills back to the mainstream freeway; thus the route diversion system will have to assume sufficient compliance to the proposed route choice; or be based on mandatory actions, such as temporary off-ramp closures. Finally, in the third examined case, the user-optimal conditions cannot be achieved, due to the traffic conditions on the alternative route, thus the route diversion system should decide for the temporary off-ramp closure, when and to the extent needed, in order to prevent formation of mainstream congestion. The obtained simulation results are compared to the case where no route guidance is applied to the network and reveal interesting features and the potential for significant improvements.","[Spiliopoulou, A.; Kontorinaki, M.; Papamichail, I.; Papageorgiou, M.] Tech Univ Crete, Dynam Syst & Simulat Lab, Khania 73100, Greece",Technical University of Crete,"Spiliopoulou, A (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Crete, Dynam Syst & Simulat Lab, Khania 73100, Greece.",natasa@dssl.tuc.gr; mkontorinaki@dssl.tuc.gr; ipapa@dssl.tuc.gr; markos@dssl.tuc.gr,/AAD-6457-2021; /AFP-3000-2022,,European Union (European Social Fund ESF); Greek national funds through the Operational Program Education and Lifelong Learning of the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) - Research Funding Program: Heraclitus II,European Union (European Social Fund ESF)(European Union (EU)European Social Fund (ESF)); Greek national funds through the Operational Program Education and Lifelong Learning of the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) - Research Funding Program: Heraclitus II,This research has been co-financed by the European Union (European Social Fund ESF) and Greek national funds through the Operational Program Education and Lifelong Learning of the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) - Research Funding Program: Heraclitus II.,,22,6,8,3,31,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

So the purpose of this study is to find out the influence of the value of a property regarding the information of different sellers. Therefore, three different stereotypes are defined, including positive and negative associated individuals. In addition, one type of seller is neutral, without any information of the reason and picture. In the social psychology the use of such stimulus is called as anchor effect. The study is based on a web supported lab experiment and conducted with 112 students. The findings show that the estimated value of the property and also the control variable as a car achieve in mean both of the offered real price. The impact of the different stereotypes of sellers on the value could not be proven.

While these developments do not amount to full-fledged RL, our findings have, first, implications for the assessment of institutional developments in Italy's political economy, providing evidence of increasing coordination against accounts, emphasizing stability or the disarticulation of existing institutional relations, and second, they qualify broader theoretical arguments on institutional change in national varieties of capitalism. Against standard arguments, the article suggests that increased competition can lead to tighter rather than looser coordination among economic actors. Finally, and more speculatively, the article presents some preliminary evidence that the commercial banks' turn to RL might be contributing to the polarization of the Italian economy.","[Stolfi, Francesco] Macquarie Univ, Dept Modern Hist Polit & Int Relat, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Macquarie University,"Stolfi, F (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Dept Modern Hist Polit & Int Relat, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",,,"Stolfi, Francesco/0000-0002-0565-5888",,,,,135,2,2,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Addition of vegetable oils in milk and dairy products is an old and illegal practice that has become increasingly common and complex. The motivation for milk adulteration is economic, as well as the fluctuation in seasonal availability of sheep and goats' milk. Adulteration of milk and dairy products reduces their quality and might be dangerous for human health. Fatty acid composition of milk fat has been used for a long time as a criterion to detect adulteration with vegetable oils, mainly because milk fat is characterized by short-chain fatty acids, whereas vegetable oils have medium to long-chain fatty acids. Based on this knowledge, the aim of this study was development and validation of GC-FID method for detection of vegetable oils in dairy products according to fatty acid composition. FAMEmix standard solution (C4:0-C24:0) was used for identification of individual fatty acids. For detection and quantification of vegetable oils in dairy products the following reference materials were used: butter fat, palm and coconut oil. The linearity of the calibration curves of fatty acid standards showed high correlation coefficients (R-2 =0.9845-0.9999). The LOD was from 0.02-0.04 mg/ml and LOQ was from 0.1-0.3 mg/ml. Precision was assessed by determining the coefficient of variation (CV, %) of the areas obtained from the injection of six replicates of the standard solutions and reference materials. The CV was in the range from 0.35-1.91% for standard solution, 0.73-6.50% for butter fat, 0.51-8.19% for palm oil and 0.76-2.16% for coconut oil. The recovery of the method was from 78.93-113.52%. From 60 analysed dairy products samples, purchased from the local market, vegetable oils were detected in 23 samples. Palm oil was detected in 21 samples, and coconut oil was detected in 2 samples. High concentration of C16:0, C18:1n9c and C18:2n6c were found in samples which contain palm oil. Moreover, in the samples which contain coconut oil the content of C12:0 and C14:0 was increased. The results from this study provide valuable information for the consumers and for future studies in this area.","[Uzunov, R.; Musliu, Z. H.; Stojkovic, E. D.; Dimzoska, B.

In 2014 European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) presented policy manifesto, which pointed out three main pillars necessary to improve competitiveness of automotive industry. Those pillars are: driving innovation, fostering growth through international trade and building a supportive regulatory framework. The main goal of the article is to analyse competitiveness of the EU automotive sector. The economic performance of the EU automotive sector is evaluated. In the first part of the paper main indicators for automotive sector will be presented, for instance production, employment, trade. Authors will focus on innovation, as a key factor for economic growth. In second part of the article major challenges for automotive sector will be presented. The article is based on critical review of the literature of the subject and international reports and analysis. The statistical data is sourced from the main international statistics. Main research method employed are comparative studies. In conclusion authors emphasized that the main challenge for EU automotive industry is raising world share of Chinese automotive sector. In addition huge challenge will be adaptation new technologies - electric, hybrid and e-gas (CNG and NGV) cars, as this will require huge R&D investments. However this may gain the leadership position for EU in the global chain in automotive industry.

Today, the consumer has remained picky and demanding. At the beginning the focus was only on products. The quality of products meant conformity consumer requirements. The competitiveness of enterprises mainly originates from quality competitiveness. Quality is an important aspect that promotes competitiveness. Actuality of the topic determined to the fact that quality - one of the important factors that can gives capabilities of the a new product development and to conquer new markets. The aim of the study, based on theoretical knowledge, to explore the quality as the competitiveness's elements what can affect the success of the enterprise, to draw conclusions and make proposals. There are used the following methods: monographic and analytical research methods. The following tasks: 1) to analyze the quality meaning and the evolution of quality; 2) to develop the model of quality concept; 3) to identify the basic elements of the company's competitive advantage the realization in the market; 4) to give the model by companies a competitive advantage in building and implementation in the market; 5) to summarize conclusions and recommendations. Results show that in today's it is not enough just to analyze the progress made in quality field. Very important to analyze the competitive situation in the industry. Enterprises, who focused to consumers need to analyze and comply competition at the market. Exactly the enterprises different skills are a competitive advantage. Without different skills the enterprises can lose competitive advantage and the contrary due to their different skills the enterprises can create a competitive advantage.","[Veselova, Andzela] Univ Latvia, Aspazijas Blvd 5, LV-1050 Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Veselova, A (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Aspazijas Blvd 5, LV-1050 Riga, Latvia.",andzela.veselova@lu.lv,,,,,,,33,0,1,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,221,230,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540718700022,0

Using data on long-run income for Swedish men and women, we explore to what extent income inequality is due to circumstances beyond individuals' control, such as gender and parental income, rather than to differences in individuals' choices. The key idea is that a society has achieved equality of opportunity if there is no income inequality that is due to circumstances. Analyzing men and women separately, we find that circumstances account for up to 31% of income inequality among men and up to 25% among women. We conclude that there is greater equality of opportunity among women than among men. When we analyze men and women together, treating gender as a circumstance, at most 38% of income inequality can be attributed to circumstances. Gender accounts for up to 13% of income inequality, making gender the single most important circumstance in accounting for inequality in long-run income in Sweden.","[Hederos, Karin; Jantti, Markus; Lindahl, Lena] Stockholm Univ, Swedish Inst Social Res SOFI, Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Jäntti, M (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Swedish Inst Social Res SOFI, Stockholm, Sweden.",markus.jantti@sofi.su.se,,"Jantti, Markus/0000-0001-6075-6553","Swedish Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare (FORTE); Riksbankens Jubileumsfond","Swedish Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare (FORTE)(Swedish Research Council for Health Working Life & Welfare (Forte)); Riksbankens Jubileumsfond(Swedish Foundation for Humanities & Social Sciences)","We thank Luis Ayala, Anders Bjorklund, Lorenzo Capellari, Stephen Jenkins, Magnus Johannesson, Arnaud Lefranc, Mikael Lindahl, Vito Peragine, Xavier Ramos, Jesper Roine, Anna Sandberg and Philippe Van Kerm for constructive comments.

The attraction accessibility means the ease of reaching a given station by using certain modes of transport such as walking, bicycle, bus or taxi. The radiation accessibility represents the ease of reaching other stations from the given station. The metro transit system in Xi'an, China was used as a case study to elaborate the proposed concepts of accessibility. It has been found that the station attraction accessibility depends mainly on the walking connection accessibility, so the improvement of walking environment is a key factor in improving the station's overall accessibility. The transfer stations exhibit the highest level of radiation accessibility while the first/last stations have the lowest. The radiation accessibility of other stations varies widely and depends on their location in the network and the topological depth from the transfer stations. In general, the closer to the middle of the line, the higher the radiation accessibility, whereas the closer to the end of the line, the lower the accessibility. The findings provide decision makers with evidence on how to improve the metro stations' travel environment and the layout of the metro network.","[Li, Linbo; Duan, Zhengyu] Tongji Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Rd & Traff Engn, 4800 Caoan Rd, Shanghai 201804, Peoples R China; [Ren, Huan] Xian City Planning & Design Inst, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Shanshan] Univ Connecticut, Connecticut Transportat Safety Res Ctr, 270 Middle Turnpike,Unit 5202, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Zhang, Yahua] Univ Southern Queensland, Sch Commerce, Toowoomba, Qld, Australia; [Zhang, Anming] Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Vancouver, BC, Canada",Tongji University; University of Connecticut; University of Southern Queensland; University of British Columbia,"Duan, ZY (通讯作者)，Tongji Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Rd & Traff Engn, 4800 Caoan Rd, Shanghai 201804, Peoples R China.",llinbo@tongji.edu.cn; renhuan125@126.com; shanshan.h.zhao@gmail.com; d_zy@163.com; yahua.zhang@usq.edu.au; anming.zhang@sauder.ubc.ca,,"Zhang, Yahua/0000-0003-1522-3402; Zhang, Anming/0000-0002-9457-8414; Zhao, Shanshan/0000-0001-5476-6894",National Natural Science Foundation of China [51178346]; Shanghai Philosophy and Social Science Planning Project [2017BGL029],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Philosophy and Social Science Planning Project,We would like to thank two anonymous referees for the helpful comments.

To enhance their sustainable livelihood ability, it is important to identify these strategies and determine the factors that affect their shift from low- to high-stability employment plans. We conducted face-to-face interviews with 150 farmer households on a World Heritage Site in China. Using the sustainable livelihood framework, proposed by the Department for International Development in the United Kingdom, a detailed inventory of farmers' livelihood capital was created. A livelihood capital evaluation system was established adopting an entropy weight method. In addition, a multiple logistic regression model was used to analyze the impact of farmers' livelihood capital on their choice of tourism schemes. The results show that the most stable tourism livelihood strategies in the area studied were store types, and the most unstable, stall types. The key factors that affected the farmers' shift of livelihood strategy were physical, financial, and human capital. Farmers with a larger quantum of these types of capital were more likely to choose a high-level livelihood strategy than other farmers. Moreover, the distance from their residence to the main attractions and tourist routes was an important factor that affected their choice of livelihood strategies.","[Liu, Jun; Zhu, Jianghuan; Lin, Chu; Li, Yunyun; Wu, Lijun] Sichuan Univ, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Sichuan University,"Liu, J (通讯作者)，Sichuan Univ, Sch Tourism, 24 South Sect 1 Ring Rd 1, Chengdu 610065, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",liujun_igsnrr@126.com,"Li, Yunyun/K-9199-2016","Li, Yunyun/0000-0003-2945-1908","Social Science Planning Annual Project of Sichuan, China [SC15B046]; Soft Science Research Project of Sichuan, China [2015ZR0225]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [skqy201639]; Tourism Development Research Center of Sichuan [LYC16-04, LYC16-12]; Sichuan Center for Rural Development Research [CR1609]; Southwest Center for Poverty Alleviation and Development Research [SCP1608]","Social Science Planning Annual Project of Sichuan, China; Soft Science Research Project of Sichuan, China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Tourism Development Research Center of Sichuan; Sichuan Center for Rural Development Research; Southwest Center for Poverty Alleviation and Development Research","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by Social Science Planning Annual Project of Sichuan, China (Grant no.

In order to investigate how well RK designs handle such confounding nonlinearity, I firstly implement Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and then study the effect of fiscal equalization grants on local expenditure in Japan using an RK design. Results in both the MC simulations and the empirical application suggest that RK estimation without covariates can be easily biased, and this problem can be mitigated by adding observed covariates to the regressors. On the other hand, a smaller bandwidth or a higher-order polynomial, even a quadratic polynomial, tends to result in imprecise estimates although they may be able to reduce estimation bias.

Block factor models can be especially useful as the zero restrictions on the loadings of some factors may provide some economic interpretation of the factors. These models, however, require the econometrician to predefine the blocks, leading to potential misspecification. In Monte Carlo experiments, we show that even a small misspecification can lead to substantial declines in fit. We propose an alternative model in which the blocks are chosen endogenously. The model is estimated in a Bayesian framework using a hierarchical prior, which allows us to incorporate series-level covariates that may influence and explain how the series are grouped. Using international business cycle data, we find our country clusters differ in important ways from those identified by geography alone. In particular, we find that similarities in institutions (e.g., legal systems, language diversity) may be just as important as physical proximity for analyzing business cycle comovements.","[Francis, Neville] Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Owyang, Michael T.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Div Res, POB 442, St Louis, MO 63166 USA; [Savascin, Ozge] Fannie Mae, Econ & Strateg Res, Washington, DC USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae),"Owyang, MT (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Div Res, POB 442, St Louis, MO 63166 USA.",owyang@stls.frb.org,"Owyang, Michael T/I-5750-2016","Owyang, Michael T/0000-0002-2109-3432",,,,,43,21,23,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0883-7252,1099-1255,,J APPL ECONOMET,J.

Understanding how companies depend on oil prices is essential, especially for countries highly dependent or importers. The work intends to investigate the relationship between oil price changes and Portuguese listed companies' returns. Using the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model, we conclude that nearly 20 % of the companies are significantly affected by oil prices, finding also evidence that these effects are asymmetric, depending on the company's current situation in the market (result attributed to the lack of liquidity and the small number of firms included within the sample). There exists some differences among economic sectors in the way they are impacted by oil price changes, although not so much significant. The results show that the bigger the company, the higher the probability of being significantly affected by oil price changes. Results suggest that lagged oil price positive shocks increase Portuguese companies' returns, by opposition to the current oil price change. Findings highlight the key role played by aggregate demand-side oil price shocks over the financial economic activity, showing sector and individual companies' differences, thus inducing the possibility of results being highly dependent over the economic context faced by the country under analysis, that firms are more sensitive to oil prices when the equity market is busiest and that oil price increases affect companies returns in a negative way, but price decreases cause more positive than negative effects over company returns.","[Teixeira, Rui F.; Madaleno, Mara] Univ Aveiro, DEGEIT Dept Econ Management Ind Engn & Tourism, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Madaleno, Mara; Vieira, Elisabete S.] GOVCOPP Res Unit Invest Governance Competitivenes, Aveiro, Portugal; [Vieira, Elisabete S.] Univ Aveiro, ISCA, R Assoc Humanitaria Bombeiros Voluntarios Aveiro, P-3810500 Aveiro, Portugal",Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Aveiro,"Madaleno, M (通讯作者)，Univ Aveiro, DEGEIT Dept Econ Management Ind Engn & Tourism, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.;Madaleno, M (通讯作者)，GOVCOPP Res Unit Invest Governance Competitivenes, Aveiro, Portugal.",ruiteixeira@ua.pt; maramadaleno@ua.pt; elisabete.vieira@ua.pt,"Vieira, Elisabete S./AAC-2059-2020; Madaleno, Mara/A-6356-2018","Madaleno, Mara/0000-0002-4905-2771; Vieira, Elisabete/0000-0003-3593-368X","research unit on Governance, Competitiveness and Public Policy [POCI-01-0145-FEDER-006939]; FEDER funds through COMPETE2020-Programa Operacional Competitividade e Internacionalizacao (POCI); FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia","research unit on Governance, Competitiveness and Public Policy; FEDER funds through COMPETE2020-Programa Operacional Competitividade e Internacionalizacao (POCI); FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","This work was financially supported by the research unit on Governance, Competitiveness and Public Policy (Project POCI-01-0145-FEDER-006939), funded by FEDER funds through COMPETE2020-Programa Operacional Competitividade e Internacionalizacao (POCI)-and by national funds through FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia.

Previous studies have failed to make the important link with individuals' social context. In this paper, the Multiple Discrete-Continuous Nested Extreme Value (MDCNEV) model is applied to the choice of activity type and duration over the course of two days, using data from the Chilean city of Concepcion. In common with other studies, heterogeneity across decision makers is accommodated in the model by analysing the impact of different socio-demographic, mobility and residential location variables on both the activity choice and the time allocation decision. In addition, different social network and social capital measures are found to be significantly correlated with the choice and duration of different activities, and we show how these relationships seem to differ from the effects of socio-demographic variables. Finally, we perform a forecasting exercise using the MDCNEV model, highlighting the differences in substitution patterns from a standard MDCEV model. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we investigate the effects of FDI on trade from a network perspective, since FDI takes not only direct but also indirect channels from origin to destination countries because of firms' incentive to reduce tax burden, to minimise coordination costs and to break barriers to market entry. We use a unique data set of international corporate control as a measure of stock FDI to construct a corporate control network (CCN), where the nodes are the countries and the edges are the corporate control relationships. Network measures, as the shortest path length and the communicability, are then computed on the CCN to capture the indirect channel of FDI. Empirically, we find that corporate control has a positive effect on trade both directly and indirectly. The result is robust with different specifications and estimation strategies. Hence, our paper provides strong empirical evidence of the indirect effects of FDI on trade. Moreover, we identify a number of interplaying factors such as regional trade agreements and the region of Asia. We also find that the indirect effects are more pronounced for the manufacturing sector than for primary sectors such as oil extraction and agriculture.","[Metulini, Rodolfo] Univ Brescia, Brescia, Italy; [Riccaboni, Massimo] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Managerial Econ Strategy & Innovat, Leuven, Belgium; [Riccaboni, Massimo; Sgrignoli, Paolo; Zhu, Zhen] IMT Sch Adv Studies, Lucca, Italy",University of Brescia; KU Leuven; IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca,"Metulini, R (通讯作者)，Univ Brescia, Brescia, Italy.",,"Metulini, Rodolfo/AAF-5207-2020; Riccaboni, Massimo/D-4102-2009; metulini, rodolfo/HNQ-6356-2023; Zhu, Zhen/AAN-9861-2020","Metulini, Rodolfo/0000-0002-9575-5136; Zhu, Zhen/0000-0003-0258-1454; RICCABONI, Massimo/0000-0003-4979-8933","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR) through the National Research Program of Italy (PNR); CRISIS Lab project; project The global virtual-water network: social, economic, and environmental implications [FIRB - RBFR12BA3Y]","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR) through the National Research Program of Italy (PNR)(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); CRISIS Lab project; project The global virtual-water network: social, economic, and environmental implications","The authors acknowledge the funding from the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR) through the National Research Program of Italy (PNR), the CRISIS Lab project, and the project The global virtual-water network: social, economic, and environmental implications (FIRB - RBFR12BA3Y).

We deal with the variability of Indian trade and price policies by analyzing market outcomes during periods of low and high world prices; we also conduct stochastic simulations where Indian policies endogenously adjust to fluctuations in domestic and world supplies. South Asian wheat and rice markets operate near autarky, and therefore, intra-regional price transmission is limited. However, we find that when India's policies result in implicit export subsidies, consumers in countries that import from India benefit; meanwhile implicit producer taxation harms consumers elsewhere. Pakistan-the only country in the region that competes with India in foreign markets-would see gains in market shares when India reduces its export subsidies. We also find that the low intra-regional trade shields India's neighbors from the excess volatility caused by Indian policies.","[Villoria, Nelson Benjamin] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 342 Waters Hall, Manhattan, KS 67503 USA; [Mghenyi, Elliot Wamboka] World Bank, Food & Agr Global Practice, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Kansas State University; The World Bank,"Villoria, NB (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 342 Waters Hall, Manhattan, KS 67503 USA.",nvilloria@ksu.edu; emghenyi@worldbank.org,,"Villoria, Nelson/0000-0003-1929-0725",,,,,33,6,6,1,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

We are interested in estimating long run and short run relationships as well as asymmetric effects. In order to do so, we estimate nonlinear autoregressive distributed lags models to (1) obtain the long run or cointegrated effects and dynamics, (2) be able to mix I(1) and I(0) variables and (3) to split the effect of positive and negative changes in the variables, i.e. asymmetries. In accordance with the existing literature, industry returns are subject to lagged exposure effects, but the asymmetries vary across industries, which could be due to the discrepancies in, amongst others, trade balance and ownership of certain industries. Furthermore, the dynamic multipliers depict that industry returns quickly respond to changes in the exchange rate and correct the disequilibrium within a short time, making the long run exposure to be symmetric or very small. The remaining shocks are mainly explained by the return of market portfolios. This implies that the ongoing restrictions on the RMB daily trading band do indeed protect the Chinese stock market against the effects of currency movements.","[Cuestas, Juan Carlos] Eesti Pank Bank Estonia, Econ & Res Dept, Tallinn, Harjumaa, Estonia; [Cuestas, Juan Carlos] Tallinn Univ Technol, Dept Econ & Finance, Tallinn, Estonia; [Tang, Bo] Weichai Power Co Ltd, Strateg Dev Dept, Weifang, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Tang, Bo] Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England","Bank of Estonia (Eesti Pank); Tallinn University of Technology; Weichai Power Co., Ltd.; University of Sheffield","Tang, B (通讯作者)，Weichai Power Co Ltd, Strateg Dev Dept, Weifang, Shandong, Peoples R China.;Tang, B (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",bo.tang@hotmail.com,"Cuestas, Juan Carlos/K-4270-2014","Cuestas, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-7313-2157; Tang, Bo/0000-0001-6915-9595","MINECO (Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Spain) [ECO2014-58991-C3-2-R]; Generalitat Valenciana [AICO/2016/038]","MINECO (Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Spain)(Spanish Government); Generalitat Valenciana(Center for Forestry Research & Experimentation (CIEF))","We would like to thank an anonymous referee and the editor for suggestions.

Despite the similar conditions between the two cases and common EU stimulus, the process and final outcomes in the reform of their employment protection systems differed. In Portugal, the government persevered and implemented a reform in line with Flexicurity principles. By contrast, the Greek government initially favoured Flexicurity and initiated a reform process of the legal framework; however the reform was halted. The article explains this divergence by combining the insights of Europeanization and Varieties of Capitalism literatures. It is argued that in cases of Mixed Market Economies, misfit' with EU stimuli is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for institutional change. Instead, reforms depend on union structure and the existence of policy entrepreneurs favouring reform, which explains the divergent reform paths.","[Zartaloudis, Sotirios] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Kornelakis, Andreas] Kings Coll London, London, England",University of Birmingham; University of London; King's College London,"Zartaloudis, S (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Dept Polit Sci & Int Studies POLSIS, Polit, Dept Polit Sci & Int Studies, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",s.zartaloudis@bham.ac.uk,"Kornelakis, Andreas/L-2607-2019; Zartaloudis, Sotirios/AAZ-2160-2021","Kornelakis, Andreas/0000-0003-1569-3367; Zartaloudis, Sotirios/0000-0001-8644-7740",Bodossaki Foundation,Bodossaki Foundation,The authors would like to thank Kevin Featherstone and Waltraud Schelkle and the JCMS referees for their useful comments on earlier drafts of this article.

The main objective of this research is to analyse the behaviour of goods receivers in two Spanish cities (Santander and Barcelona) when they are confronted with the possibility of adopting new goods distribution practices. The new goods distribution policies proposed to the receivers were: an Off-Hour Deliveries policy (OHD) and a policy which uses Urban Distribution Centres (UDC). The methodology used was based on a stated preference survey and a Mixed Logit model. The results show that in both cases, receivers generally do not wish to change the manner in which they receive their goods, especially if such change involves increased costs. However, both policies were generally more accepted in a medium size city like Santander than in Barcelona, and some results can be achieved even without tax reductions which will result in fewer distribution vehicles circulating at peak times and therefore less congestion and pollution on urban streets. In addition, it is important to consider that not all the commercial sectors react the same way, so this heterogeneity has to be taken into account in the specification of the models and in the proposed policies.

It is argued that the 2000 decision to remove quantitative restrictions on taxi numbers favoured taxi users; the 2010 decision to re impose such restrictions, with the exception of wheelchair accessible taxis, had the effect of favouring taxi license holders, while doing little to meet its declared object to increase the number of wheelchair accessible taxis and the ready availability of such vehicles for wheelchair customers. Whether the late 2010s/early 2020s will be a rerun of the late 1990s, with increasing waiting times for taxi users, is a moot point. An applicant refused a taxi license might, as in 2000, successfully bring a High Court case contesting the legal basis for the present quantitative restrictions. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission might spark debate on taxi regulatory policy, while the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport might issue a policy direction to the National Transport Authority, the taxi regulator, requiring it to clarify the objectives and benchmarks for success of its existing prohibition on taxi licenses and to consider how best to create incentives for those with wheelchair accessible taxis to use them to service wheelchair users.

Using new data on banking products and their usage, it analyses consumers' ability to select optimal frontier' products. It concludes that following deregulation of retail banking, product offerings underwent such tumultuous change that the scope for effective consumer choice was severely constrained. While there were improvements towards the end of the period, progress was not assisted by the banks' strategy of proliferating and re-bundling products. Consequently, the anticipated improvements to consumer choice were slow to arrive.","[Taylor, Judy; Magee, Gary] Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic, Australia",Monash University,"Magee, G (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic, Australia.",gary.magee@monash.edu,,"Magee, Gary/0000-0002-2793-8790",,,,,27,0,0,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-8992,1467-8446,,AUST ECON HIST REV,Aust.

Norfolk's Tide light rail began operations in August of 2011 and has experienced disappointing levels of ridership compared to other light rail systems. We estimate the effect of the Tide using a difference-in-differences model and consider several outcome variables for the residential housing market, including sale price, sale-list price spread and the time-on-market. Our identification strategy exploits a proposed rail line in neighboring Virginia Beach, Virginia that was rejected by a referendum in 1999. Overall, the results show negative consequences from the constructed light rail line. Properties within 1500 meters experienced a decline in sale price of nearly 8%, while the sale-list price spread declined by approximately 2%. Our results highlight the potential negative effects of light rail when potential accessibility benefits do not out weigh apparent local costs.","[Wagner, Gary A.] Fed Reserve Bank Cleveland, 150 E 4th St, Cincinnati, OH 45202 USA; [Komarek, Timothy; Martin, Julia] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Econ, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Cleveland; Old Dominion University,"Komarek, T (通讯作者)，Old Dominion Univ, Dept Econ, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.",gary.wagner@clev.frb.org; tkomarek@odu.edu; juliammartin52@gmail.com,,,,,,,26,31,34,2,26,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

Comparative analyses were applied to identify the deficiencies of the driver licensing system (Edition of 2013). The Chinese driver licensing system primarily focuses on driver education/training, which is conducted in commercial driving schools. The learner stage is actually the driver training stage, and the length of the learner stage is not sufficient; i.e., supervised driving cannot be guaranteed, which is controversial with the principle of the GDL system. Learners' driving skills are primarily obtained by mass practice, which cannot be retained well; besides, many novice drivers do not own a car and live with parents who are experienced drivers in China and therefore seldom practice driving during the probationary period. Certain important restrictions to intermediate-stage driving - such as night driving, which has been demonstrated to be effective in reducing road accidents - are not applied. The investigations of novice drivers were also conducted to assess the system, and the results indicate that most driving leaners prepared for their driving knowledge test by mass practice, and the updated driving knowledge tests indicate that their driving knowledge faded over time. Only 66.9% of the participants passed the simulated test 3-5 months after being licensed. Investigations on in-vehicle training indicate that the average actual training time is shorter than the minimum legal requirement, although the research populations successfully passed the tests. In general, the driver licensing system of the 2013 edition cannot achieve its intended results based on the work presented in this paper. This work can be used as a reference for the driver licensing system reform in the future. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The method is based on a decomposition into trend-cycle and irregular. To derive the cycle, a band-pass filter is applied to the estimated trend-cycle. The whole procedure is fully model based. Its performance is evaluated in relation to the approach by Creal et al. (J Appl Econom 25:695-719, 2010). Using the same set of monthly and quarterly US time series as in Creal et al. two monthly business cycle indicators are obtained for the US. They are represented by the cycles of real GDP and the industrial production index. Both indicators can reproduce previous recessions very well. Series contributing to the construction of both indicators are allowed to be leading, lagging, or coincident relative to the business cycle. Their behavior is assessed by means of spectral concepts after cycle estimation. The proposed method can serve as an attractive tool for policy making, in particular due to its good forecasting performance and quite simple setting without elaborate mechanisms that account for, e.g., volatility changes.","[Marczak, Martyna] Univ Hohenheim, Schloss Hohenheim 1C, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany; [Gomez, Victor] Minist Finance & Publ Adm, Madrid, Spain",University Hohenheim,"Marczak, M (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Schloss Hohenheim 1C, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany.",marczak@uni-hohenheim.de; VGomez@sepg.minhap.es,,"Marczak, Martyna/0000-0001-9397-2666",,,,,33,3,4,0,9,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The empirical analysis is based on a panel data set including 30 OECD countries over the period 1975-2013. We argue that effective regulatory reforms have positive interaction with the electricity generated leading to a higher capacity utilization and an increase in the level of labor productivity of the sector. The threshold analysis suggests that for already economically liberalised countries the level of economic freedom does not affect electricity generation and subsequently the level of electricity performance.
