An analysis of the attitude-behaviour link,BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Organic food; Consumer purchasing decisions,WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; SUSTAINABLE WINE; LOCAL FOOD; PRODUCTS; PRICE; PREFERENCES; PERCEPTIONS; INTENTIONS; VALUATION; PURCHASES,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyse the effect of attitudes and socio-demographics on wine consumers' real purchase behaviour for organic wine. Design/methodology/approach - This study is based on GfK household panel data, a real market data source of high population coverage. A two-part fractional model was applied as two distinct categories of wine buyers were observed. The first part of the two-part fractional model consisted of a standard binary choice model and defined the likelihood of belonging to the group of organic wine buyers. The second part of the model only took organic wine buyers into account and described their purchase intensity. Findings - Preferences for organic products and sustainability concerns (e.g. environmental and social concerns) drive organic wine purchases. Proving a causal relation between attitudes and purchase behaviour gives evidence that stated preferences are a reliable indicator to predict consumer behaviour. However, the weak relation between attitudes and behaviour confirms the existence of an attitude-behaviour gap. Practical implications - Quality benefits of organic wine production need to be communicated to attract new customers. Stronger focus should be put on sustainability issues with the aim of encouraging organic customers to also increase their expenditures for organic wine. Originality/value - The influence of sustainability concerns on purchase behaviour is still controversial and no study, so far, has analysed real purchase data for organic wine. The results provide new insights on why attitudes do not fully transform into purchase behaviour.","[Schaeufele, Isabel; Pashkova, Dania; Hamm, Ulrich] Univ Kassel, Dept Agr & Food Mkt, Witzenhausen, Germany",Universitat Kassel,"Schäufele, I (通讯作者)，Univ Kassel, Dept Agr & Food Mkt, Witzenhausen, Germany.",i.schaeufele@uni-kassel.de,"Hamm, Ulrich/F-7886-2013; Hamm, Ulrich/AAI-6552-2020; Schäufele-Elbers, Isabel/GWD-1353-2022","Hamm, Ulrich/0000-0001-7444-3451; Schaufele-Elbers, Isabel/0000-0003-3740-2858",Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) [2814OE014],Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL),This work was supported by the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) based on a decision of the parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany via the Federal Office for Agriculture and Food (BLE) under the Federal Programme for Organic Farming and Other Forms of Sustainable Agriculture (Grant No. 2814OE014).

Design/methodology/approach - This research uses panel data of 44 subsectors in the Indonesian food and beverages industry for the period 1980-2014. The dynamic input directional distance function is applied to estimate the dynamic technical inefficiency. Further, the Granger causality between industrial concentration and dynamic technical inefficiency is tested using a dynamic panel data model. A bootstrap truncated regression model is finally applied to estimate the relation between industrial concentration and dynamic technical inefficiency based on the results from the Granger causality test. Findings - The results show that the Indonesian food and beverages industry has a high dynamic technical inefficiency. Investigation of the causality of the relation shows that industrial concentration has a positive effect on dynamic technical inefficiency at the subsector level, with no reversed causality. The results suggest that the quiet life hypothesis applies to the Indonesian food and beverages industry. Originality/value - The literature investigating the relation between industrial concentration and performance relies on static measures of performance, such as technical efficiency. Static measures provide an incorrect metric of the firms' performance in the presence of adjustment costs associated with investment. Therefore, this research has a contribution in measuring dynamic technical inefficiency that accounts for the presence of the adjustment cost as well as its relation with industrial concentration in the Indonesian food and beverages industry.","[Setiawan, Maman] Padjadjaran State Univ, Fac Econ & Business, Bandung, Indonesia; [lansink, Alfons G.

It involves merging global value chains and providing products, services and technologies, which countries could not provide based only on their own resources. It is about creating the conditions for a balanced partnership and development in all countries. In this paper an analysis will be carried out from the perspective of the Slavonia region, in parallel with the countries from the European neighborhood. The greatest impact on Croatian education is mobility programs funded by the European Union, which are represented throughout the European Higher Education Area (EHEA). The Bologna Process created the European Higher Education Area. Over 4,000 institutions of higher education in 47 countries have so far accepted the Bologna higher education system. This paper deals with the trends of the development of the global education market and the impact on the regional labor market. The mobility of the population, the economic development of individual countries, the aging of the population and the new economy of services are recognized as the challenges of the global education market. Developed countries are trying to invest as much as possible in education to encourage innovation and research. In addition to investing in their own human resources, these countries are trying to attract as many foreign nationals as possible to study there at affordable educational programs, scholarships, etc. One of the impacts of globalization on education is facilitating access to information on other education policies and encouraging the competitive spirit in education. Also, the knowledge gap is reduced and knowledge is more accessible, the education costs are reduced because of the tendency toward distance learning. The aim of this paper is to highlight the importance of the global market impact on education and to give an overview of the guidelines for global education in the EU and Croatia. During research of facts and possibilities that currently exist, for the formulation of the research results in this paper, the following research methods are used in a different combination: historical method, the method of analysis and synthesis, classification and description method.","[Stanic, Milan; Blazevic, Ivona] Coll Slavonski Brod, Dr Mile Budaka 1, Slavonski Brod 35000, Croatia; [Sulentic, Marina Stanic] Agencija Stan, Matije Gupca 28, Slavonski Brod 35000, Croatia",University of Slavonski Brod,"Stanic, M (通讯作者)，Coll Slavonski Brod, Dr Mile Budaka 1, Slavonski Brod 35000, Croatia.",milan.stanic@vusb.hr; ivona.blazevic@vusb.hr; marina.stani0@gmail.com,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,1,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,379,386,,,,,,8,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900039,0

By discovering and describing these viewpoints in relation to a wider societal discourse, we are adding to a holistic picture of what role influencing factors play in farmers' viewpoints towards natural resources. Consequently, we make use of a Q methodological approach which offers a way of identifying and describing the diversity of farmers' viewpoints. Based on data from 30 farmers in Lower Austria we identify the Diversity-maintaining, the Context-depending, the Economic Aspects emphasising and the Change-promoting viewpoints. To our knowledge, especially the Context-depending viewpoint in particular is not yet described in the scientific literature and, therefore, they allow a novel approach to treating environmental problems. Based on these markedly different notions, there are reasonable grounds for questioning a blanket approach from agricultural policies which does not take into account the specific differences of farmers' mindsets. It can, instead, be argued that taking this diversity of mindsets into consideration when trying to alter behaviour can contribute to a more stable environmental performance, since specifics of various farmer-groups can be tackled with more accuracy.

What's wrong with management education by Martin Parker (2018) professor who had worked for 20 years at Bristol University has started an important debate. The author claims that business schools need to stop teaching most of the standard curriculum. I would argue stronger - in the era of digitalization and internet they need to change the way of teaching. As an example: Student Teacher Evaluations (SET) should not be treated as measures of teaching quality because: (1) it encourages students to view themselves as customers/consumers of education, while the quality of their learning depends both on their and teacher's efforts; (2) as it was shown in the conducted by Michalowicz (2016) under my supervision analyses of more than 130 thousand of SET forty percent of students NEVER deliver their feedback via SET; (3) that younger lecturers contrary to old ones believe that students reciprocate good grades by giving the teacher good evaluation (Michalowicz, op.cit.). As a consequence teachers could inflate their demands and grades; (4) the metanalysis conducted by Uttl, B., White, C., A., Gonzalez D. W. (2017) has shown that students do not learn more from highly rated professors. There was no relationship between SET and students achievement. Students expect to receive practical knowledge. They do not realize that the results of the managerial research conducted in the ceteris paribus paradigm are difficult to use in practice and in teaching.","[Wierzbinska, Grazyna Wieczorkowska] Univ Warsaw, Fac Management, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Wierzbinska, GW (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Management, Warsaw, Poland.",wierzbinska@wz.uw.edu.pl,,,,,,,12,2,2,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,48,54,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540733700006,0

The analysis aims at shedding light over the complex implications that recent political and social changes have aroused for the water disputes between Jordan and Syria on the one hand, and Ethiopia and Egypt on the other. In both basins, cooperative efforts toward the integrated management of transboundary waters have been only partially effective and largely undermined by the perpetuation of unilateral actions by riparian states. In the case studies, the lack of a basin-wide vision over the control and use of shared waters has resulted in disputes among the basin states and ultimately in an unsustainable, unfair, and unwise utilization of the resources. This paper argues that a substantive and effective integration of national water policies is unlikely to occur, unless power asymmetries are properly addressed in order to overcome the likelihood of hegemonic regimes.","[Hussein, Hussam] Univ East Anglia, Water Secur Res Ctr & Tyndall Ctr Climate Change, Sch Int Dev, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Grandi, Mattia] St Anna Sch Adv Studies, Pisa, Italy",University of East Anglia; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"Hussein, H (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Water Secur Res Ctr & Tyndall Ctr Climate Change, Sch Int Dev, Norwich, Norfolk, England.",h.hussein@uea.ac.uk,", HH/AAP-5306-2020",", HH/0000-0002-1238-1715; GRANDI, Mattia/0000-0003-3892-1270",,,,,79,53,57,4,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

But do PES and related incentive programs achieve that lofty goal? Along with considerable enthusiasm, PES has faced a wide range of substantial critiques. In this paper, we characterize seven major classes of concerns associated with common PES designs, and use these as inspiration to consider potential avenues for improvements in PES outcomes and uptake. The problems include (1) new externalities, (2) misplacement of rights and responsibilities, (3) crowding out existing motivations, (4) efficiency-equity tradeoffs, (5) monitoring costs, (6) limited applicability, and (7) top-down prescription/alienating agency. As currently practiced, many PES programs are thus of limited benefit and even potentially detrimental to sustainability. From this dire conclusion, we highlight several innovations that might be combined and extended in a novel approach to PES that may address all seven problems. Recognizing that PES necessarily articulate and even normalize values, our proposed approach entails designing these institutions intentionally to articulate rights and responsibilities conducive to sustainability those we might collectively seek to entrench. Problems remain, and new ones may arise, but the proposed approach may offer a way to reimagine PES as a major social and economic tool for enabling sustainable relationships with nature, conserving and restoring ecosystems and their benefits for people now and in the future.

This error consists in the misleading identification of industry with manufacture, ignoring the contribution to Mexican industrial production made by the metallurgical sector. By incorporating the value added from metallurgy to the net output of manufacture the share of industry in GDP grows accordingly, placing Mexico among the most industrialised countries of Latin America by the end of the export era.","[Kuntz-Ficker, Sandra] Colegio Mexico, Ctr Estudios Hist, Mexico City 10740, DF, Mexico",Colegio de Mexico,"Kuntz-Ficker, S (通讯作者)，Colegio Mexico, Ctr Estudios Hist, Mexico City 10740, DF, Mexico.",skuntz@colmex.mx,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

In a review of six such impact reports, Kinnaman (2011) speculates about several major issues worth scrutiny arising with analysis using input-output models. His central critique focuses on the assumptions of how industry spending is represented and how leasing and royalty dollars are spent. In this study, we use detailed county records and results from a survey to directly address these assumptions, and compare our results to the findings in an economic impact study of Marcellus Shale development in Pennsylvania which Kinnaman critiqued. Our results, which are only about 52% of the prior study, confirm his supposition that some ex ante studies use unrealistic assumptions which lead to gross overestimates of the impacts.

In this study, we investigated the effect of a nationwide P4P scheme for general practitioners implemented in 2012 in France, on cervical cancer screening practices. Using data from a nationally representative permanent sample of health insurance beneficiaries, we analyzed smear test use of eligible women for the years 2006-2014. Our longitudinal sample was an unbalanced panel comprising 180,167 women eligible from 1 to 9 years each. We took into account that during our study period some women were exposed to another incentive for screening participation: the implementation in 2010 of organized screening (OS) in a limited number of areas. To evaluate the effect of P4P, we defined three different measures of smear utilization. For each measure, we specified binary panel-data models to estimate annual probabilities and to compare each estimate to the 2011 baseline level. To explore the combined effect of P4P and OS in areas exposed to both incentives, we computed interaction terms between year dummies and area of residence. We found that P4P had a modest positive effect on recommended screening participation. This effect is likely to be transient as annual smear use, both for the whole sample and among women overdue for screening, increased only in 2013 and decreased again in 2014. The combined effect of P4P and OS on screening participation was not cumulative during the first years of coexistence.","[Constantinou, Panayotis; Sicsic, Jonathan; Franc, Carine] Univ Paris Sud, UVSQ, Univ Paris Saclay, INSERM,Ctr Res Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, 16 Ave Paul Vaillant Couturier, F-94807 Villejuif, France",Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite Paris Saclay,"Constantinou, P (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Sud, UVSQ, Univ Paris Saclay, INSERM,Ctr Res Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, 16 Ave Paul Vaillant Couturier, F-94807 Villejuif, France.",panayotis.constantinou@inserm.fr; jonathan.sicsic@inserm.fr; carine.franc@inserm.fr,"Franc, Carine/R-4207-2018; SICSIC, Jonathan/M-1549-2018","Franc, Carine/0000-0001-7166-6895; SICSIC, Jonathan/0000-0002-5509-4791; Constantinou, Panayotis/0000-0003-4023-5915",French National Cancer Institute (INCa); Canceropole ile-de-France,French National Cancer Institute (INCa)(Institut National du Cancer (INCA) France); Canceropole ile-de-France(Region Ile-de-France),For this research we benefited from grants provided by the French National Cancer Institute (INCa) and by the Canceropole ile-de-France.,,52,7,8,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

The landscape consists of a grid of land parcels, each managed by a land user. The objective of the conservation agency is the survival of an endangered mobile species in the landscape. The comparison of the two payment schemes is made with regard to cost-effectiveness (maximizing species survival for given total conservation costs) and budget-effectiveness (maximizing species survival for given conservation budget). The model is a grid-based dynamic stochastic ecological-economic simulation model. In the model analysis it is found that within the considered model parameter ranges the output-based payment outperforms the input-based payment, except for the cases of risk-averse land users and spatial spill-overs. The comparative advantage of the output -based payment increases with increasing viability and decreasing dispersal range of the species, and with decreasing spatial variation of the conservation costs. In the light of these results, output -based payments appear as a promising policy option even for mobile species where the local outcome (presence of the species in the land parcel) of a local conservation measure is uncertain.

Direct shipment model (DT), lateral transhipment model (LTSP) and maritime lateral transhipment model (MLTSP) are developed and compared between each other by using a real life earthquake scenario prepared for the city of Istanbul by JICA (Japanese International Cooperation Agency). Developed mathematical models decide on the locations and number of disaster relief facilities, quantity of relief items to hold at those facilities, and quantity of lateral transhipment between the facilities. Vulnerability of the roads and heterogeneous capacitated facilities are also considered. It can be concluded that both LTSP and MLTSP models gave better results than DT model and lateral transhipment option helps beneficiaries to obtain relief items faster and with higher service level.

The paper questions the traditional image of an Asian trade defined by expensive, manufactured goods, oriented to an elite consumption. Considering the Memorial of Horacio Levanto (1620) and in the context of modern globalization, we propose the hypothesis that Asian trade responded to mass consumption, influencing productive structures in New Spain and Spain herself. Madeja silk from China was one of the main semi-processed goods imported via Acapulco which, as raw material, promoted the development of the Novohispanic textile industry.","[Bonialian, Mariano] Colegio Mexico Camino Al Ajusco, Ctr Estudios Hist, 20 Pedregal Santa Teresa, Teresa, DF, Mexico",,"Bonialian, M (通讯作者)，Colegio Mexico Camino Al Ajusco, Ctr Estudios Hist, 20 Pedregal Santa Teresa, Teresa, DF, Mexico.",marianobonialian@gmail.com,,,,,,,50,3,3,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper provides a discussion on the development of food SC integrity framework using triangulation of interviews' insights with literature. Findings - Current industry practices such as standards have not been sufficient in embracing the concept of food SC integrity. As the food SC is complex, food SC integrity framework is proposed as a solution. This paper proposes food SC integrity framework for halal food. It consists of four dimensions, namely: raw material, production, service, and information integrity. In addition, key elements for each dimension are derived from the interviews' insights. Research limitations/implications - The framework provides the evidence that the safeguarding of halal food integrity does not rely solely on certification; but it requires an extensive effort beyond certification. Practical implications - Safeguarding of food integrity should involve all stages and actors of the SC. Religious standards should incorporate SC integrity profiling through a controlling mechanism to promote higher food product integrity. Originality/value - Food SC integrity framework is important to religious food as it plays a significant role to the population. This study contributes to a newly developed SC integrity framework in the context of halal food.","[Ali, Mohd Helmi; Ismail, Md Daud] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Sch Management, Fac Econ & Management, Bangi, Malaysia; [Tan, Kim Hua] Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Nottingham, England",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; University of Nottingham,"Ali, MH (通讯作者)，Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Sch Management, Fac Econ & Management, Bangi, Malaysia.",mohdhelmiali@ukm.edu.my,"Tan, Kim H/E-7735-2010; ALI, MOHD/IUM-6916-2023; Ali, Mohd Helmi/P-5560-2014; Ismail, Daud/N-8518-2016","Ali, Mohd Helmi/0000-0002-2774-2659; Ismail, Daud/0000-0001-7478-1303; Tan, Kim Hua/0000-0003-4894-293X",Ministry of Education Malaysia [FRGS/2/2013/SS05/UKM/02/2],"Ministry of Education Malaysia(Ministry of Education, Malaysia)",The authors thank the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and the Ministry of Education Malaysia for funding the study under FRG scheme-FRGS/2/2013/SS05/UKM/02/2.,,111,61,65,1,44,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Awareness and perception related to these products has an important role in consumers' acceptance and subsequently long-term marketplace success of these products. The purpose of this paper is to fill the knowledge gap in this regard, study conducted in Iran. Design/methodology/approach - The theory of social marketing served as the framework of the study. Qualitative data were collected via eight semi-structured focus group discussions (FGDs), between May and September 2014. Participants were 65 women (44 housewives and 21 employed women), aged 23-68 years, selected by purposive sampling, with a maximum diversity. All FGDs were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Qualitative content analysis of the data was conducted by MAXQDA (R). Findings - Almost all participants were unfamiliar with the term functional dairy products, although, some of them had consumed these products. Apart from perceiving the functional dairy products as unnecessary by some participants, some women did not trust in health claims of these products for various reasons such as distrust in food manufacturers, exposure to contradictory information, and fear of unforeseen and dangerous side effects due to taking them. The participants agreed on the need for more information from a trusted and credible source such as health professionals or authorities through different communication channels like television, training classes, shopping center, and so on. Originality/value - This study provides a unique insight into consumers' awareness and perceptions concerning functional dairy products in Iran. To the best of the knowledge, this study is the first study in this regard in Iran. Given the novelty of these products in the market, the findings could provide information for the dairy industry to expand its market and improve its profitability and reliability, as well as public health sector to design and implement intervention programs to promote functional dairy products consumption in the population.","[Bazhan, Marjan] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Natl Nutr & Food Technol Res Inst, Fac Nutr Sci & Food Technol, Dept Community Nutr, Tehran, Iran; [Keshavarz-Mohammadi, Nastaran] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Publ Hlth, Tehran, Iran; [Hosseini, Hedayat] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Natl Nutr & Food Technol Res Inst, Fac Nutr Sci & Food Technol, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Tehran, Iran; [Kalantari, Naser] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Natl Nutr & Food Technol Res Inst, Fac Nutr, Dept Community Nutr,Sci & Food Technol, Tehran, Iran",Shahid Beheshti University Medical Sciences; Shahid Beheshti University Medical Sciences; Shahid Beheshti University Medical Sciences; Shahid Beheshti University Medical Sciences,"Keshavarz-Mohammadi, N (通讯作者)，Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Publ Hlth, Tehran, Iran.",n_keshavars@yahoo.com,"kalantari, naser/AAA-2857-2022; mohammadi, nastaran keshavarz-/AAT-5225-2021",,National Nutrition and Food Technology Research Institute of Iran,National Nutrition and Food Technology Research Institute of Iran,"This study was funded by the National Nutrition and Food Technology Research Institute of Iran.

The financial literacy of citizens depends on the financial education of the individual, regardless of their age. The complexity of financial products and services is becoming more distinct and it represents a challenge for the holders of the educational policy. Although there exist strategic documents with the aim of creating a basis for the complete involvement of the financial education into the educational processes on the national level, it is of a great importance to encourage active stakeholders engaged in the financial areas to intervene in the mutual activity and the promotion of financial literacy. The aim of this paper is thus to analyze the existent works and the present research on the financial literacy of citizens, as well as students and to examine and analyze the level of the financial literacy among the students in the professional studies of the College of Tourism and IT Management in Virovitica by means of a questionnaire, i.e. to collect the data about their attitudes, knowledge, financial behavior, as well as their attitude towards spending money. Since the focus of this work is placed on the professional studies, the paper will determine the students' attitudes on how the obligation of implementation of professional practice, field works and holding guest lectures by experts from the financial field can contribute to the strengthening of financial literacy among students, which is also a specific aim of this work. Based on the results obtained by the research, the authors will draw conclusions that will be a possible base for the improvement and/or revision of the existent study programs in part of the financial courses that are currently being held at the institution. The authors will also define recommendations for strengthening the financial literacy of students of the professional studies at the College so they can implement the obtained knowledge considering the making of financial decisions and in order for them to develop their consciousness of the financial possibilities further, taking into consideration all the possible risks.","[Bedekovic, Mladena; Kadlec, Zeljka; Ribic, Damir] Coll Tourism & IT Management Virovitica, Matije Gupca 78, Virovitica 33000, Croatia",,"Bedekovic, M (通讯作者)，Coll Tourism & IT Management Virovitica, Matije Gupca 78, Virovitica 33000, Croatia.",mladena.bedekovic@vsmti.hr; zeljka.tai@gmail.com; damir.ribic@vsmti.hr,"Kadlec, Željka/IWU-4599-2023","Kadlec, Željka/0000-0001-7484-4933",,,,,20,0,0,0,1,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,1004,1013,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500097,0

Whilst the adverse health impacts of discretionary foods are well documented, the environmental and broader sustainability impacts of these products deserve more attention, especially since their consumption has been increasing in recent decades, particularly amongst low income groups. This paper presents a quantitative case study analysis of discretionary food consumption and the associated environmental impacts for households from different income groups in Australia. Environmentally extended input-output analysis is used to estimate the full life cycle environmental impacts of discretionary food consumption on the basis of household expenditures. On average, discretionary foods account for a significant 35%, 39%, 33% and 35% of the overall diet-related life cycle water use, energy use, carbon dioxide equivalent and land use respectively. These significant percentages provide further support for the need to incentivise diets that are both healthier and more sustainable, including 'divestment' from discretionary food products. The study highlights the challenges ahead, including the need for further research on food substitutions to minimise environmental and social impacts whilst maximising nutritional quality-especially amongst poorer socioeconomic groups.

Most studies investigating this issue are grounded in the agent-based rational choice model. The aim of this study is to expand our insights by applying an alternative theoretical framework combining elements from classical institutional economics and self-determination theory to study incentives for waste sorting. The analysis is based on data from a Norwegian municipality, Ulstein, which introduced and later terminated a differentiated waste fee. There are three main findings. First, the important role of normative motivation for sorting household waste is confirmed. Second, the economic incentive had a divisive effect on the motivation to sort household waste. Perceived autonomy linked to fundamental values about environmental concern seems to play an important role in explaining why half the sample reports no extra efforts in sorting waste as a response to the economic incentive. The other half was influenced by the external logic given to them (i.e., to save costs and hence report increased motivation to sort household waste). Finally, an increased practice of illegal waste disposal was observed as a response to the differentiated waste fee. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis is based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative data of the closure of four companies. Getting a job in a skill-related industry or moving to a spinoff firm leads to skill reallocation. Thus, the result depends on regional idiosyncrasies such as industry structure and urbanization. If local policy makers and the owners exert a coordinated effort, it is possible to create success stories of less skill destruction in urban as well as peripheral regions.","[Holm, Jacob Rubaek; Ostergaard, Christian Richter] Aalborg Univ, Dept Business & Management, Fibigerstr 11, DK-9220 Aalborg O, Denmark; [Olesen, Thomas Roslyng] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Innovat & Org Econ, Kilevej 14A, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark",Aalborg University; Copenhagen Business School,"Holm, JR (通讯作者)，Aalborg Univ, Dept Business & Management, Fibigerstr 11, DK-9220 Aalborg O, Denmark.",jrh@business.aau.dk; cro@business.aau.dk; tro.ino@cbs.dk,"Holm, Jacob Rubæk/H-9402-2017; Østergaard, Christian R./P-4325-2019","Holm, Jacob Rubæk/0000-0003-1110-1918; Østergaard, Christian R./0000-0003-1782-202X",GONE project - Danish Council for Strategic Research,GONE project - Danish Council for Strategic Research,"This research is funded by the GONE project sponsored by the Danish Council for Strategic Research.

Design/methodology/approach - Two in-person surveys were administrated separately in Shanghai, China and in Taipei, Taiwan, the two most populous metropolitan areas in China and in Taiwan, respectively. Findings - Results reveal that about 32 per cent of respondents in Taipei purchase vegetables once in every two to three days. The majority of respondents in Shanghai (81 per cent) purchase vegetables on a daily basis. Results of factor analysis reveal the four dimensions, origin labelling, promotion, selection, and quality, influence purchasing decisions of respondents in Taipei and in Shanghai. For household primary food shoppers in Taipei, origin labelling and selection help food shoppers in Taipei in vegetable purchasing decisions, but not promotion. For those food shoppers in Shanghai who purchase large volume of vegetables, quality is the most important factor in purchasing decisions. Originality/value - This study provides new insights into vegetable purchasing decisions in two populous cities in China and Taiwan. The contributions of this study are to provide valuable information in vegetable purchasing decisions for effective information communication in retailing; and to fill in the gap of research in vegetable purchasing decisions in consumer behaviour studies in Chinese societies.","[Hsu, Jane Lu; Shiue, Charlene W.; Hung, Kelsey J. -R.] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Mkt, Taichung, Taiwan",National Chung Hsing University,"Hsu, JL (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Mkt, Taichung, Taiwan.",jlu@dragon.nchu.edu.tw,"Hsu, Jane Lu/AAP-2870-2021","Hsu, Jane Lu/0000-0002-0685-5814",,,,,15,3,3,2,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

We look at the supply and demand factors that affect oil prices; the ways oil prices affect the economy; the effect of interest rates, capital flows and exchange rates on oil prices and extraction; and the role of (geo)politics in governing oil and money flows. We develop an illustrative system model of the causal pathways that link oil and the economy and compare alternative explanations of the oil price shocks of the 1970s and 2000s, The emphasis of ecological economics on peak oil and resource limits to growth may be relevant over the long run, but is less capable of explaining precisely how oil contributes to concrete economic short-run crises now.

One of the factors which affects the consumer behaviour directly in the retail business is merchandising, which influences impulsive purchases consumers. On the basis of primary data, we can claim that 25 % of the surveyed respondents answered, that almost always buys a product which is exposed outside of its permanent place, and 52 % said that the product buys occasionally. Based on the survey, we can say that visual merchandising has the presumption to influence the impulsive purchase and the objective of this contribution is to point out which of the genders of young people up to 25 years purchases more impulsively - thus, on which gender has the correct exposure of the product more impulsive impact, since men and women are different individuals who react to the same appeals differently.","[Kubelakova, Andrea] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Mkt & Trade, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Kubelaková, A (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Mkt & Trade, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",a.kubelakova@gmail.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,2,7,SLOVAK UNIV AGRICULTURE NITRA,NITRA,"TR A HLINKU2, NITRA, 94976, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-552-1739-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,807,812,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6FH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426613300100,0

The purpose of this paper, cross-country hygiene study, is to determine sea fish fraud labelling on the Czech market and catering. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 57 samples of commercial Gadoid fish product from different manufacturers, distributors and catering facilities were gathered. Gadidae family, hake (Merluccius spp. Raf.), saithe (Pollachius virens L.), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.), Alaska pollock (Theragra chalcogramma Pall.), were detected in fish meat, fish products and fish meals by the qualitative PCR method. Findings - In total, 47 samples were labelled as a Gadoid fish, which were confirmed in 43 cases. Six samples were labelled as a hake and were confirmed in five samples. Four samples were labelled as a fish fillets. Three samples of fish fillets were identified as a hake and one sample was detected as a mixture of Alaska pollock and Atlantic cod. Social implications - In recent years, due to increasing interest from consumers in the sea fish meat market, accurate Identification of fish species has become more important. The mislabelling of sea fish species, whether intentional or not, was on observed on the Czech market and in catering facilities. Economic factors influence the accuracy of labelling of fish meat, which is a concern as mislabelling can threaten public health. Originality/value - The study was concentrated on the monitoring of hygiene and quality of food products and catering facilities. This study provides greater awareness of the condition and quality of food on the market and to the extent of fraudulent practices amongst dealers and producers.","[Kyrova, Veronika; Surmanova, Pavla; Ostry, Vladimir; Rehurkova, Irena; Ruprich, Jiri] Natl Inst Publ Hlth Prague, Ctr Hlth Nutr & Food, Brno, Czech Republic; [Jechova, Marie] Cent Bohemian Reg Prague, Reg Publ Hlth Author, Prague, Czech Republic",National Institute of Public Health (SZU) - Czech Republic,"Kyrova, V (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Publ Hlth Prague, Ctr Hlth Nutr & Food, Brno, Czech Republic.",kyrova@chpr.szu.cz,,,"Ministry of Health, Czech Republic - conceptual development of research organization (National Institute of Public Health - NIPH) [IN 75010330]","Ministry of Health, Czech Republic - conceptual development of research organization (National Institute of Public Health - NIPH)","This research was supported by Ministry of Health, Czech Republic - conceptual development of research organization (National Institute of Public Health - NIPH, IN 75010330).

In this paper, we propose filtering Maddison's time series for the period 1870-2010 for a selection of developed countries using a less restrictive filtering technique that does not impose but instead estimates the cutoff frequency. In particular, we use unobserved component models that optimally estimate the smoothing parameter. Using this methodology, we identify cycles of periods, primarily in the range of 4-7 years (Juglar-type cycles), and a number of patterns of cyclical convergence. We analyze the historical processes underlying this last empirical finding: Peacetime periods, monetary arrangements, trade and investment flows, and industrial boosts are confluent forces driving the economic dynamism. After 1950, we observe a common business cycle factor that groups all economies, which is consistent with the consolidation of the so-called second globalization.","[Luis Cendejas, Jose] Univ Francisco de Vitoria, Madrid, Spain; [Munoz, Felix-Fernando; Fernandez-de-Pinedo, Nadia] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Francisco de Vitoria; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Muñoz, FF (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, Madrid, Spain.",felix.munoz@uam.es,"Cendejas Bueno, José Luis/I-9879-2014; Munoz, Felix-Fernando/B-5042-2009; Fernandez-de-Pinedo, Nadia/E-2111-2012; Muñoz, Fernando/JGC-9950-2023","Cendejas Bueno, José Luis/0000-0001-8417-9455; Munoz, Felix-Fernando/0000-0002-5460-9108; Fernandez-de-Pinedo, Nadia/0000-0001-6708-1480;","Instituto de Investigaciones Economicas y Sociales Francisco de Vitoria [6-2015]; Spanish National Plan for Scientific and Technical Research and Innovation grants [CSO2014-53293-R, HAR 2012-35965/His]; [IT807-13]",Instituto de Investigaciones Economicas y Sociales Francisco de Vitoria; Spanish National Plan for Scientific and Technical Research and Innovation grants;,We acknowledge research funding from Instituto de Investigaciones Economicas y Sociales Francisco de Vitoria (Grant #6-2015); Spanish National Plan for Scientific and Technical Research and Innovation grants CSO2014-53293-R and HAR 2012-35965/His; and the research group IT807-13.,,82,5,5,1,18,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,JAN,2017,11.0,1,,,,,93,125,,10.1007/s11698-015-0135-0,0.0,,,33,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,EK0BL,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000393591300004,0

The financial crisis commenced in the U.S. spilled over very quickly to the EU through a transmission mechanism particularly affecting European monetary union's countries (ie. Euro zone). At early stage the ECB reacted by cutting interest rates to historically lowest levels. However, the application of only conventional monetary policy measures turned out to be insufficient for groaning economies underpinning. Avoiding the worst case scenario i.e. the insolvency of some peripheral European countries was the essential ECB task at the crisis height thereby introducing some atypical monetary policy measures. The main goal of this paper is the analysis of the ECB monetary policy responses to the global financial crisis and the debt crisis in Eurozone and comparison of the ECB and FED policies. This papir on one hand tends to chronologically explain the main measures in conventional and unconventional policies adopted by the ECB and to analyse their effects on key interest rates and the monetary aggregates, on the other. It may be assessed that the ECB's monetary policy responses to the crisis are constrained by the institutional framework, which tied up its acting as well as the strong member states jurisdiction over fiscal policy.","[Nuhanovic, Senija; Dzafic, Jasmina] Tuzla Univ, Fac Econ, Univ 8, Tuzla 75000, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Tuzla,"Nuhanovic, S (通讯作者)，Tuzla Univ, Fac Econ, Univ 8, Tuzla 75000, Bosnia & Herceg.",senija.nuhanovic@untz.ba; jasmina.dzafic@ef.unze.ba,,,,,,,9,0,0,2,2,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,1100,1109,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500107,0

The aim of research is development of organization by connecting: 6 scientific disciplines, 5 criteria and 4 kinds of development. Our purpose is to make a qualitative jump from alopoietic to autopoietic organization and society as a whole. Joy, happiness and love should prevail instead of existing emotions of fear, anger and sadness, which Maslow defines as a condition to reach the 5th level, expressed in an individual as self-actualization. To achieve human philosophical, scientific, religious and technological creativity with inventiveness is our final aim. Qualitative phenomenological method and method of dialectic, supported by quantitative mathematical and statistical techniques, are used in the research. We used top-down and bottom-up principles. As a challenge of present we re-processed the book Methodology of Social Science with motivation questions. We developed a model named The Tree of Development, as a model of an autopoietic organization. The result of an individual is to create life in love and freedom of activity. This is proved by the equation of development for complete progress of moral, intellectual, social, physical and financial capital. We confirm one of the factors of economy on optimal allocation of sources with this, where rate of repayment in human and physical capital is important. Autopoietic approach in self-organization is confirmed by the ABCD model. To position autopoietic organization we developed the Holistic Autopoiesis University - HAU, the aim of which is to develop and not to block self-actualization of students, as practice shows. Development of organic self-organization on existent mechanical organization, which is the consequence of Cartesian paradigm. The gap between the material and non-physical is connected again to a whole by an autopoietic organization. In psycho-social dynamics relations are improved: giving and getting. Through the ABCD model we discover the distinction of envy and unfairness of organization. Material and non-physical contribution of an individual in all spheres, with less stress but more love and freedom. Less hate and more harmony create social wellbeing. Investing in people who will contribute with their knowledge and motivation to universal progress. We see production of doctoral works as the most important production in individual social circle, as top-down principle. With motivation and knowledge, the possibility of synergy is created, as well as optimal principles for self-learning in the web of creative teams as the most important aspect of self-organization. The model of an autopoietic organization The Tree of Development, linking together: 6 scientific disciplines, 5 criteria and 4 kinds of development. The ABCD model as autopoietic approach and HAU for self-organization. We expect that FOS will be the first autopoietic institution, in the sense of HAU in Slovenia and the world.

The reason for the foregoing state of matters is the excess of information that clearly lacks specific amplification. This notion does not impress anyone anymore, and hence its faded semantic overtone. And yet with regard to road traffic, this is still a topical problem, since numbers of vehicles and drivers as well as pedestrians have been growing, which means that there are more and more users of roads. This group should also be expanded with stray dogs, wild forest animals and random obstacles, such as wind-felled trees or road pavement defects. All these factors affect to a certain extent the condition of safety in Polish public roads. And since, as aforementioned, all of them are characterised by increase trends, safety in roads has been exposed to considerable risk. This paper highlights specific conditions encountered in road traffic that threaten traffic safety. One might presume that the highway code is so tight and precise that there is no way to modify them, about which traffic police officers are particularly convinced, but it is not so at all. I personally believe that the code requires some innovations, and this is the main theme explored in this paper. My goal is to indicate specific areas the doors leading to which still remain ajar in epistemological terms.(4)","[Sleziak, Boguslaw] Sukcesor, Warsaw, Poland",,"Sleziak, B (通讯作者)，Sukcesor, Warsaw, Poland.",sukcesor@poczta.fm,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,UNIV WROCLAW,WROCLAW,"PL UNIWERSYTECKI 1, WROCLAW, 50-137, POLAND",,,978-83-64389-64-1,ICT MAN GLO COM EC G,,,2017,,,,,,,376,381,,,,,,6,Development Studies; Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BP9OZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000570154500031,0

Furthermore the authors examine if the typical purchaser is similar across six product types in Denmark and in the Netherlands. Design/methodology/approach - The authors estimate probit models using a representative panel of households registering all their daily purchases during a year, three years after the introduction of a nutrition symbol in Denmark and the Netherlands (the Keyhole and the Choices). The purchase data are matched with information about labelling status. Other product and purchase characteristics, such as store-type and organic, are controlled for. Findings - Households with children tend to have a lower probability of purchasing labelled products compared to other household types, while urbanity increases the probability. This holds both across countries and across products. In Denmark education is positively correlated with label purchase, while in the Netherlands it is income. Generally, the observable characteristics of the consumers are poor in explaining the probability of purchasing labelled products which suggests that other aspects as the underlying attitudes and general health awareness may be of greater importance in identifying these consumers. Originality/value - There is a lack of studies analysing the effect of front-of-pack symbols on households' product choices based on observed data as most previous studies are based on stated observation or purchase intentions.","[Smed, Sinne; Edenbrandt, Anna Kristina; Koch-Hansen, Pia] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Res Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Jansen, Leon] Choices Int Fdn, Brussels, Belgium",University of Copenhagen,"Smed, S (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Res Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark.",ss@ifro.ku.dk,"jansen, leon/W-9159-2019; Smed, Sinne/AFK-6410-2022; Edenbrandt, Anna Kristina/E-5213-2015","Smed, Sinne/0000-0002-3897-4439; Edenbrandt, Anna Kristina/0000-0002-9298-6705",,,,,29,6,7,0,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

To do this, it relates outcome uncertainty to the probability of occurrence of one of these impacts within a given time horizon. Unlike the existing studies, this paper links outcome uncertainty to the uncontrollable component of environmental uncertainty derived from the stochastic nature of an ecosystem's behavior. Results show that the WTP for the policy in the presence of uncertainty does not decrease compared to the scenario where climate change impacts are assumed to occur with certainty. This suggests individuals are adopting a precautionary attitude when stating their WTP. Thus, the paper provides economic justification for preventive measures in highly uncertain contexts. However, findings are not conclusive with respect to the influence of the degree of uncertainty on the support for such measures. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the positioning strategies that marketers use to persuade consumers in this segment to buy animal-friendly products (AFPs). Design/methodology/approach - The authors approach product positioning from a consumption values perspective from which they examine strategies that make animal welfare (AW) personally relevant to the buyer because they reinforce AW with suitable consumption value (functional, emotional, social, sensory, epistemic and/or ethical). Using data from 129 AFPs from a Dutch supermarket, the authors explore the positioning strategies of these products. Findings - The results identified four different strategies used to position AFPs in a Dutch supermarket. They respectively call upon consumers' emotions, functional or sensory perceptions, curiosity and sense of public welfare. The findings also show substantial category differences, with fresh products relying predominantly on emotional value and processed food on functional value. Originality/value - This study is the first to empirically explore positioning strategies of AFPs on the basis of their consumption values. The study offers a novel perspective to understand how companies try to extend the market for AFPs, thus providing a basis for a new research agenda.","[van Riemsdijk, Lenka] Univ Appl Sci Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Ingenbleek, Paul T.

Cooperation with external co-operators can benefit at every stage of the innovation process: creation, implementation, commercialization and diffusion of innovation. The results of research conducted in Polish enterprises showed that among the companies that have implemented innovations level of cooperation is significantly higher.

The analysis treats poverty as a multi-dimensional and socially disaggregated phenomenon. The paper employs a mixed methods approach to case studies of Ghana and Ethiopia to explore two critical issues. First, how income from cash crops is linked with other dimensions of poverty. Second, how income and land are socially disaggregated. The paper then draws on qualitative data to critically reflect on how poverty is understood within studied communities. The results show that some, but not all, indicators of poverty vary across income quartiles and that significant differences exist across social groups. The analysis suggests that although cash crops are essential, focusing on increasing income from cash crops will not necessarily have a predictable or progressive impact on wellbeing. Furthermore, the analysis highlights how contextual factors, such as the provision of communal services, the nature of land holdings and the quality of local governance mediate the potential poverty alleviating outcomes of income increases. Future development of sustainable intensification strategies should focus on the prevalence of trade-offs and the fundamental social relations underpinning poverty dynamics.","[Hirons, M.; McDermott, C.; Morel, A.; Malhi, Y.] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, ECI, Oxford, England; [Robinson, E.] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Reading, Berks, England; [Morel, A.; Norris, K.] Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, London, England; [Asare, R.; Mason, J.] Nat Conservat Res Ctr, Kaneshie Accra, Ghana; [Boyd, E.] Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies, LUCSUS, Lund, Sweden; [Gonfa, T.; Gole, T.

As land development has progressed, the population surrounding these and other green spaces has changed, and responsibility for their protection has shifted to the bureaucracies that manage urban environments. The sacred grove now means different things to different people, and the value of its protection is increasingly difficult to characterize. In this context, we study individual preferences for sacred groves and non-forested temples along an urbanization gradient -defined by land use- in rural locales near the megacity of Delhi, informed by the theoretical perspective of Sanskritization. We use revealed and stated preference data that includes information on visits to forests and worship sites, weighting for relevant forest characteristics, and socio-demographic factors related to culture. Respondents generally place higher value on sacred groves than on non-sacred green space, but more urbanized and sanskritized individuals exhibit higher valuations for non-forested temples and conservation of urban green space. Taken together, these results suggest a potential increase in the perception of non-sacred and non-use forest value among urbanized respondents.","[Grace, David] Duke Univ, Divin Sch, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Jeuland, Marc] Duke Univ, Duke Global Hlth Inst, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Jeuland, Marc] Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Inst Water Policy, Singapore, Singapore",Duke University; Duke University; National University of Singapore,"Jeuland, M (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Box 90239, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",marc.jeuland@duke.edu,,"Grace, David/0000-0002-4583-2623",Forest History Society; Environmental Humanities in Asia; Nicholas School of the Environment at Duke,Forest History Society; Environmental Humanities in Asia; Nicholas School of the Environment at Duke,"We acknowledge the following funding sources, which helped support field research expenses for the work described in this paper: The Forest History Society, Environmental Humanities in Asia, and several internal sources from the Nicholas School of the Environment at Duke (the International Internship Fund, KLN Fund, and Whitney Chamberlin Fund).

However, the economic models used in prior assessments largely do not include known, automatic, stabilizing factors. Crop storage can stabilize prices and U.S. crop policy tends to provide support that moves opposite prices. We quantify effects of circa 2050 climate forcing on the inter-annual variability of U.S. Corn Belt corn and soybean yields using statistical crop models and climate scenarios from regional and global climate models. Climate change generally reduces mean yields and increases the inter-annual variability of yields in the Midwestern U.S. Using these yield impacts and an economic model with automatic market stabilizers, we find only modest increases in price volatility. Although individual producers and states are negatively affected by the yield reductions, the aggregate effect for all corn and soybean producer returns can be positive because of price increases. Moreover, agricultural policies based on price levels or revenue variation offset some of the impacts of market variation on farm income. Our results differ from other recent results and temper concerns that increasing climate instability necessarily translates to greater uncertainty about agricultural commodity uses, including as food and biofuels, in the near future.","[Thompson, Wyatt; Gerlt, Scott] Univ Missouri, Agr & Appl Econ Dept, 200 Mumford Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Lu, Yaqiong; Yang, Xianyu; Kueppers, Lara M.] Univ Calif Merced, Sierra Nevada Res Inst, 5200 North Lake Rd,Sci & Engn 277, Merced, CA 95343 USA; [Yang, Xianyu] Chinese Acad Sci, Cold & Arid Reg Environm & Engn Res Inst, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Campbell, J.

Although plant diversity is positively associated with multiple ecosystem functions, it remains unclear how economic gains influence plant diversity across vegetation strata. We analyzed the relationships between economic gains, assessed as profit, and plant species richness following forest management alternatives (managing rotation age and overstorey composition) for the boreal forests of Canada. We found a hump-shaped relationship between total plant richness and profit, with total plant richness increasing initially, reaching a peak, and then declining with increasing profits. The relationship between profit and plant diversity differed among vegetation strata. Understorey plant richness followed similar trends to total plant richness, but overstorey tree richness increased linearly. The results of path analysis presented management alternatives as major drivers determining profit and plant diversity across vegetation strata. Our analysis indicated that maximum profit ($5000/ha) could lead to 20% loss of total plant species richness. Among the alternatives we compared, we conclude that managing for mixedwood with approximately a rotation of 100 years is an optimal compromise between economic and plant diversity objectives.","[Chen, Si; Shahi, Chander; Chen, Han Y.

Some Reflections from India and Bhutan,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,Post-growth; Degrowth; Agrowth; Steady-state economics; Post-development; India; Bhutan; Global South,DEGROWTH,"The critique of growth is one of the defining features of ecological economics. Yet ecological economists have had relatively little to say about post-growth in the global South. In this article, we propose a new definition of post-growth as the combined application and theorization of degrowth, agrowth, steady-state economics and post-development. We then discuss with special reference to India seven ways of thinking about post-growth in the global South. Starting with the basic observation that the current patterns of growth-fueled development are ecologically, socially and financially unsustainable, we argue that serious post-growth thinking can only be world-systemic and rooted in class analyses. We then point out that the GDP growth against poverty connection is debatable and we instead argue, normatively, that an effective post-growth program should focus on fulfilled needs and on wealth redistribution. Against the idea that growth-critical approaches have their origin in industrialized countries, we show that many post-growth ideas have non-Western roots and a substantial number of potential contemporary allies in the global South. Discussing the example of Bhutan, we suggest that preliminary elements of a post-growth program are not as utopian as it might sound.","[Gerber, Julien-Francois] Int Inst Social Studies, NL-2518 AX The Hague, Netherlands; [Raina, Rajeswari S.] Shiv Nadar Univ, Gautam Buddha Nagar 201314, Uttar Pradesh, India",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Shiv Nadar University,"Gerber, JF (通讯作者)，Int Inst Social Studies, NL-2518 AX The Hague, Netherlands.",gerber@iss.nl,"Raina, Rajeswari/ABF-6019-2020","Gerber, Julien-Francois/0000-0002-4024-2480; Raina, Rajeswari/0000-0002-0277-075X",,,,,50,32,34,3,18,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

We contribute to the literature in the following three ways. First, we conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to control biases due to endogeneity. Second, we utilize eye-trackers to examine how different product labels result in different visual attention. The combination of an RCT and eye-tracking techniques is new in the literature on purchasing behavior for environmentally friendly products. Third, our experiment measures participants' purchasing behavior that incurs actual costs rather than examining their willingness-to-pay (WTP) based on hypothetical questions. We find that concerns regarding environmental issues do not promote purchases of certified forest coffee. Information about certification programs does not have any effect on purchasing certified forest coffee unless information is provided to prior purchasers of certified forest coffee. By contrast, illustrations of forests on certified forest coffee labels attract participants' visual attention and further stimulate actual purchases of certified forest coffee, suggesting that a 1-second increase in visual attention increases the likelihood of purchasing certified forest coffee by 22 percentage points.","[Takahashi, Ryo; Todo, Yasuyuki; Funaki, Yukihiko] Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Shinjuku Ku, 1-6-1 Nishi Waseda, Tokyo 1690051, Japan",Waseda University,"Takahashi, R (通讯作者)，1-6-1 Nishi Waseda,Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1690051, Japan.",ryota@aoni.waseda.jp; yastado@waseda.jp; funaki@waseda.jp,"Todo, Yasuyuki/N-2336-2019","Todo, Yasuyuki/0000-0002-3201-4488","JSPS KAKENHI [15K21001, 25101003]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K21001, 25101003] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) Number 15K21001 and Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas Number 25101003.

Consumers are also increasingly demanding ready-to-eat products, especially in urban environs, where modem lifestyles tend to limit their available time. Understanding the pro-environmental behaviour of convenience food consumers is particularly challenging because there is often a contradiction between eco-friendly behavioural intent and time constraints imposed by modern lifestyles in large cities. It is not clear to what extent information labels on such products are trusted by consumers and considered when making food choices. This study aims at contributing to the debate investigating the determinants influencing consumer purchase intention, focusing on minimally processed vegetables labelled with integrated-pest-management standards. More specifically, the analysis investigates the role consumer trust plays in consumer intention to buy such products. The conceptual framework builds on and extends the theory of planned behaviour. The analyses are based on face-to-face interviews in a large European city (Milan, Italy). Data were analysed by means of structural equation modelling. Results confirm the important role of consumer trust, which positively affects attitudes towards the purchase of convenience food with eco-friendly attributes, and negatively affects consumer concerns around agricultural practices in relation to environmental and health impacts.","[Ricci, Elena Claire; Banterle, Alessandro; Stranieri, Stefanella] Univ Milan, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Via Celoria 2, I-20133 Milan, Italy",University of Milan,"Stranieri, S (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Via Celoria 2, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",elenaclaire.ricci@unimi.it; alessandro.banterle@unimi.it; stefanella.stranieri@unimi.it,"Banterle, Alessandro/ACT-7678-2022; Ricci, Elena Claire/AAG-6844-2019","Ricci, Elena Claire/0000-0002-4355-7277; Stranieri, Stefanella/0000-0002-9936-8942",,,,,135,121,124,27,183,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

A novel feature of our research is the analysis of subjective public judgments with Bayesian inference techniques, which are ultimately connected with environmental conditions through mathematical modeling. Our case study is the Bay of Quinte, Ontario, Canada; an embayment at the northeastern end of Lake Ontario with a long history of eutrophication, characterized by frequent and spatially extensive algal blooms and predominance of toxic cyanobacteria. In this study, we present a major survey to determine public opinions on water quality in the area. Our survey was conducted among a random sample of 1527 local residents and tourists during the summers of 2013 and 2014. The key findings of the survey were: (i) fishing (29%) and beauty of the area (20%) were the main reasons for public use of the Bay of Quinte; (ii) among different water-quality problems, the public chose the algal scums (26%) and the integrity of fish populations (22%) as the main issues; (iii) only 30% of the returning visitors noticed that the clarity of water is better now relative to the prevailing conditions five years ago; (iv) there is a dramatic change in public sentiment between the beginning and end of the summer season; and (v) a substantial portion of local residents were willing to contribute financially towards the restoration of the bay. Our modeling analysis suggests that the likelihood of public satisfaction increases significantly when the total phosphorus concentrations fall below the critical levels of 20-25 mu g L-1, which however is a difficult target to achieve even under significantly reduced nutrient-loading conditions. Other biological variables such as chlorophyll a concentrations, harmful algal blooms, and toxin levels in locations frequently used by the public appear to more closely influence their satisfaction level.","[Ramin, Maryam; Cheng, Vincent Y.

We contribute to the literature on institutions in ecological economics by examining the practice of institutional creation in the context of the literature on Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES). While a large literature outlines ideal PES models, PES literature tends to overlook the demanding everyday work involved in building and maintaining the institutions upon which successful PES models depend. Drawing on the theory of institutional work, we conduct an extensive survey of the literature on PES to find examples of everyday work undertaken to build and maintain PES institutions, or else to disrupt institutions that stand in the way. Finding very limited discussion of the work of institutional creation, we present a case study of efforts to develop Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD +) in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, identifying numerous examples of institutional work essential to the initiative. We suggest that institutional work, with its highly developed typologies of actions involved in institutional creation, can be a helpful tool for critical institutionalist studies of ecological economics.","[Jespersen, Kristjan] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Soc & Commun, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Jespersen, Kristjan] Copenhagen Business Sch, Ctr Corp Responsibil, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Gallemore, Caleb] Lafayette Coll, Int Affairs Program, Easton, PA 18042 USA",Copenhagen Business School; Copenhagen Business School; Lafayette College,"Jespersen, K (通讯作者)，Dalgas Have 15,2 O022, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",kj.msc@cbs.dk,,,Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation [QZA-12/0882]; European Communities [EUROPEAID/DCI-ENV/2011/269-520]; United Kingdom Department for International Development [203034-103]; Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Australia through the Center for International Forestry Research's Global Comparative Study on REDD (GCS-REDD) [63560]; Environmental Policy Initiative at The Ohio State University; Mershon Center for International Security Studies at The Ohio State University; University of Minnesota,Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation(Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD); European Communities(European Union (EU)); United Kingdom Department for International Development; Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Australia through the Center for International Forestry Research's Global Comparative Study on REDD (GCS-REDD); Environmental Policy Initiative at The Ohio State University; Mershon Center for International Security Studies at The Ohio State University; University of Minnesota(University of Minnesota System),"We would wish to thank the Department of Management Society and Communication at the Copenhagen Business School for their ongoing and inspiring support.

The usefulness of these global valuation exercises that combine hundreds of individual value estimates depend on the robustness of the results. This commentary raises a potential issue with these aggregate estimates: the fragility to a few influential outliers. Using recent research as an illustration, I demonstrate how these synthesis studies can mask how a few specific value estimates are responsible for a large portion of ecosystem service value. These findings suggest that additional caution should be used in interpreting aggregate value estimates, that researchers should check aggregate estimates for the presence of influential outliers, and specific ecosystem service research areas that should be pursued.","[Lloyd-Smith, Patrick] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 51 Campus Dr, Saskatoon, SK S7M 5A8, Canada",University of Saskatchewan,"Lloyd-Smith, P (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 51 Campus Dr, Saskatoon, SK S7M 5A8, Canada.",patrick.lloyd-smith@usask.ca,"Lloyd-Smith, Patrick/ABE-4463-2020","Lloyd-Smith, Patrick/0000-0002-0786-0877",,,,,7,4,6,1,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

As part of a larger research endeavor, interviews were conducted with the AOSIS representative (or a knowledgeable delegate) from over a dozen Pacific Small Island States (PSIS) with regard to climate change planning and preparation. This research is unique in that approximately three-quarters of the sought-after island states agreed to give anonymous, non-attributable interviews about diplomatic and sensitive topics. This particular subset of the research question focused upon how PSIS self-perceive their participation and membership in the only island-based organization at the UN level speaking on behalf of islands and whether their understandings and assessment of AOSIS merged with theoretical frameworks describing productive and fruitful multijurisdictional cooperation. The findings from the research illustrate that PSIS overwhelmingly identify AOSIS as an organization that provides a stable and cooperatively balanced organizational structure that promotes collaboration and solidarity across the Pacific. With the research questions focused on climate change in particular, respondents' answers indicate an organization seen as successfully and effectively following many of the theoretical tenets of a collaborative- and cooperative-based type of governance, often only seen in hypothetical, literature-based examples.","[Schwebel, Michael B.] Temple Univ, Dept Geog & Urban Studies, 1800 North Broad St,Gladfelter Hall, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Schwebel, Michael B.] 100 Resilient Cities 100RC,420 5th Ave,19th Floor, New York, NY 10018 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Schwebel, MB (通讯作者)，Temple Univ, Dept Geog & Urban Studies, 1800 North Broad St,Gladfelter Hall, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.;Schwebel, MB (通讯作者)，100 Resilient Cities 100RC,420 5th Ave,19th Floor, New York, NY 10018 USA.",mschwebel@100rc.org,,,,,,,19,4,5,7,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Among other developments, a growing political interest in the National Welfare Index (NWI) and its regional adaptation (Regional Welfare Index, RWI) points to the possibility of change. The NWI was created in 2009 with support from the Federal Ministry of Environment to improve sustainability and welfare accounting in Germany at the federal level, by developing a methodology based on the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW) and the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI). In response to a demand by political actors, it was adapted for the state level in 2011. Results both on the national and the regional level show striking divergences between NWI/RWI and GDP, but also between different German states. Challenges remain with regard to data availability, methodology and political adoption. However, there is growing recognition of the NWI/RWI as a serious alternative and support for the improvement of the data necessary for its calculation. Drawing on our experience, we discuss some theses on conditions that may favour or impede the adoption of alternative welfare measures.","[Held, Benjamin; Rodenhaeuser, Dorothee; Diefenbacher, Hans] FEST eV Heidelberg, Protestant Inst Interdisciplinary Res, Schmeilweg 5, D-69118 Heidelberg, Germany; [Zieschank, Roland] Free Univ Berlin, Environm Policy Res Ctr, FFU, Ihnestr 22, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin,"Held, B (通讯作者)，FEST eV Heidelberg, Protestant Inst Interdisciplinary Res, Schmeilweg 5, D-69118 Heidelberg, Germany.",benjamin.held@fest-heidelberg.de; dorothee.rodenhaeuser@fest-heidelberg.de; hans.diefenbacher@fest-heidelberg.de; zieschan@zedat.fu-berlin.de,,,,,,,56,23,22,2,35,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Alternatives where also animal welfare matters intrinsically are analyzed both theoretically and empirically. The general public's ethical preferences are measured through a survey of a representative sample in Sweden, and the responses from a clear majority suggest that animal welfare should indeed carry intrinsic weight in public decision making. Current legislation in many countries is consistent with this. A brief review of moral philosophy on animal welfare indicates that a large majority of philosophers believe that animal welfare should count intrinsically. It is moreover demonstrated that it is theoretically and practically possible to generalize welfare economics in order to give intrinsic value also to animal welfare. The paper concludes that there are strong reasons to (sometimes) generalize welfare economics in order to take animal welfare into account directly, i.e., in addition to effects through individual utilities. The practical implications of doing so are likely to be more important over time as the scientific methods of measuring animal welfare are gradually improving.","[Johansson-Stenman, Olof] Univ Gothenburg, Sch Business Econ & Law, Dept Econ, Box 640, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Johansson-Stenman, O (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Sch Business Econ & Law, Dept Econ, Box 640, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",Olof.Johansson@economics.gu.se,,,Formas through the program Human Cooperation to Manage Natural Resources (COMMONS),Formas through the program Human Cooperation to Manage Natural Resources (COMMONS)(Swedish Research Council Formas),"I am grateful for very constructive comments from Seth Baum, Martin Dufwenberg, Peter Martinsson, workshop participants at the London School of Economics and Political Science, seminar participants at the Stockholm School of Economics, participants at the World Conference in Environmental and Resource Economics in Gothenburg, and anonymous referees.

We investigate the preferences of Italian and Czech households towards climate change mitigation policy options directly related to residential energy use. We use discrete choice experiments, which are administered in a standardized fashion to representative samples in the two countries through computer-assisted web interviews. Our preferred estimates of the willingness to pay per ton of CO2 emissions avoided is (sic)133 for the Italians and 94 Euro for the Czech respondents (at 2014 purchasing power parity). We find evidence of considerable heterogeneity in WTP driven by income. The two samples differ in their within-sample income elasticities of WTP, but comparison across the two countries suggests an income elasticity of WTP of one-or even greater than one for certain mixed logit specifications.","[Alberini, Anna] Univ Maryland, AREC, 2200 Symons Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Alberini, Anna; Bigano, Andrea] FEEM, Milan, Italy; [Bigano, Andrea] Euromediterranean Ctr Climate Change CMCC, Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Scasny, Milan; Zverinova, Iva] Charles Univ Prague, Ctr Environm, Jose Martiho 2-407, Prague 16200 6, Czech Republic",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Fondazione Mattei; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Charles University Prague,"Scasny, M (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Ctr Environm, Jose Martiho 2-407, Prague 16200 6, Czech Republic.",aalberin@umd.edu; andrea.bigano@feem.it; milan.scasny@czp.cuni.cz; iva.zverinova@czp.cuni.cz,"Scasny, Milan/F-7394-2012; Bigano, Andrea/ABE-7843-2020; Zverinova, Iva/P-2008-2016","Scasny, Milan/0000-0001-5040-1281; Bigano, Andrea/0000-0002-9325-6018; Zverinova, Iva/0000-0002-9440-0405",European Union [265325]; H2020-MSCA-RISE project GEMCLIME-2020 under GA [681228]; Czech Science Foundation [GA15-23815S],European Union(European Union (EU)); H2020-MSCA-RISE project GEMCLIME-2020 under GA; Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),The research was funded by the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement no. 265325 (PURGE - Public health impacts in Urban Environments of Greenhouse gas Emissions reduction strategies) and H2020-MSCA-RISE project GEMCLIME-2020 under GA no 681228.

A mosque is regularly used at least five times a day for praying, and for weekly events such as Jumu'ah (Friday prayers). Therefore, a mosque should be accessible for all. But in fact, persons with disabilities still find difficulties in accessing mosques. For example, the calling to prayer and Friday sermon (Khutba) through loudspeakers, is a problem for persons with hearing loss. Persons with physical disabilities, especially users of wheelchairs, walkers or crutches, have difficulties in several areas in the mosque, including the entrance, place of ablution, the lavatories and the area for removing shoes at the entrance to the prayer hall. People are not allowed to enter the place of ablution or prayer hall wearing shoes, people are also not allowed to enter with their personal mobility devices. This is so that dirt from outside does not get carried into the mosque. In order to understand the accessibility requirements for persons with disabilities in a mosque, we have to know the essential parts in the construction of the mosque and the mobility pattern that usually occurs in a mosque. In this paper, an accessibility checklist which has been developed on the basis of an analysis of accessibility requirements in mosques is presented.","[Al-Mansoor, Nazem Fawzi] Minist Community Dev, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates",,"Al-Mansoor, NF (通讯作者)，Minist Community Dev, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.",nazem.fawzi@msa.gov.ae,,,,,,,0,4,4,0,4,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-9630,1879-8365,978-1-61499-923-2; 978-1-61499-922-5,STUD HEALTH TECHNOL,,,2018,256.0,,,,,,293,298,,10.3233/978-1-61499-923-2-293,0.0,,,6,"Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7JT,30371488.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455118100027,0

There are many factors that affect the situation of women in society and stop them from having a career, but for sure the recent access of women to university studies, their preference for studying social sciences, and the difficulty of combining family and work commitments should be mentioned. Additionally, there is a deep-rooted cultural phenomenon, called 'Glass Ceiling', which gives social acceptance for inequality of genders. On the other hand, nowadays women are present in almost every area of the economy, and they start to perform many responsible functions. This is due to different factors, such as industrialization, the First and Second World War, many technological advances, but also declining birth rates, and women's access to education. Considering such a background, this paper analyzes the influence of gender diversity in management on the profitability and degree of indebtedness, on a sample of 4347 companies from the hotel sector. The purpose of this article is to show the relationship between presence of women in the top management and the level of profits and indebtedness of companies. Apart from the financial analysis, different theories and empirical evidence regarding the relationship between women in senior management and profitability of the company have been discussed. The results obtained in the research show that hotels run by women generated lower financial results, such as profitability, ROA or ROE. This may be related to greater caution of women in making decisions. The study focuses on the Spanish market, where there is currently an open debate about the importance of women's presence in business management, driven by the creation of legislation on gender equality, which is also observed in other European countries. Thus, the discussed topic is important both from the economic and social point of view.","[Arnao-Nieto, Belen; Minguez-Vera, Antonio] Univ Murcia, Murcia, Spain; [Hernik, Joanna] West Pomeranian Univ Technol Szczecin, Szczecin, Poland",University of Murcia; West Pomeranian University of Technology,"Arnao-Nieto, B (通讯作者)，Univ Murcia, Murcia, Spain.",belen.arnao@um.es; jhernik@zut.edu.pl; minver@um.es,"Hernik, Joanna/ABC-5009-2020; Hernik, Joanna/JXY-3573-2024","Hernik, Joanna/0000-0001-8895-6039;",,,,,25,0,1,1,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,109,117,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540733700013,0

The experiment was arranged as randomize complete design, consisted of seven treatments and provided with four replications. Synergism test was carried out using filter paper disc method. The filter paper disc (d= 5 mm) were soaked in each suspension of selected isolates and stick onto NA plate media directly for single isolate treatments (B, C, D), while combined isolate treatments (E, F, G) were spread first against another isolate according to its treatments. Each treatments were incubated for 72 h at 30 degrees C then inhibition zone was observed. The solubilizing index was tested by sticking soaked filter paper disc on supplemented Pikovskaya agar plate and incubated for 72 h at 30 degrees C. Liquid inoculants were prepared by inoculating of each selected bacteria into 40 ml modified Pikovskaya media supplemented with 0,09 g.L-1 NaCl (EC= 4 dS.m(-1)), shaken at 100 rpm for five days.

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the state of regional and traditional food production in Poland and identify the prospects of its development. Design/methodology/approach Both secondary and primary data were used. The sample size included 1,067 respondents selected based on their place of residence and sex. The five-point Likert scale was used to measure the participant attitudes following the construction and validation procedure. Cronbach's test was used to evaluate the reliability of the measuring scale, estimated at 0.85, indicating the accuracy of the scales used. Statistica 13 - including t-test, ANOVA and regression analysis - was a software program used to carry out statistical analysis. Prior to the analysis, multivariate normality was examined by testing each variable for normal distribution. Findings The research showed the existence of a statistical relationship between the sex of respondents and the suggested traditional food consumption patterns such as organoleptic qualities, high quality, and finally, curiosity and trying new foods. Sex did not statistically influence the responses for the remaining factors. Originality/value The increased interest in traditional and regional food products is a manifestation of new food-related tendencies and is implied by the desire to exhibit behaviors and values resulting from cultural heritage. Polish consumers are becoming wealthier, better educated, more aware of both tangible and intangible product attributes, and they are having more opportunities to expose their social preferences when shopping. The importance of food attributes such as traditional and regional food certificates, source of origin or the image of the producer (e.g. respecting ethical behavior) is growing. This research is significant not only because of its theoretical input, but its applied value as well.","[Barska, Anetta] Univ Zielona Gora, Fac Econ & Management, Zielona Gora, Poland; [Wojciechowska-Solis, Julia] Univ Life Sci Lublin, Dept Agritourism & Rural Dev, Fac Agrobioengn, Lublin, Poland",University of Zielona Gora; University of Life Sciences in Lublin,"Wojciechowska-Solis, J (通讯作者)，Univ Life Sci Lublin, Dept Agritourism & Rural Dev, Fac Agrobioengn, Lublin, Poland.",a.barska@wez.uz.zgora.pl; julia.wojciechowska@gmail.com,"GARCIA, SERGIO ERICK/X-9320-2018","Barska, Anetta/0000-0001-7413-1781; Wojciechowska-Solis, Julia/0000-0002-4634-0241",,,,,35,33,33,1,26,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The literature concerning organizational and management theory provides insufficient analysis of this matter. The need to fill this gap with the latest empirical data prompted the authors to conduct pilot research in companies operating in Poland with the use of a survey as a tool. It was built on the basis of the objectives of the evaluation system which were previously classified in a query. The purpose of this article is to describe and analyse the empirical research concerning possible benefits of the implementation of an evaluation system in an organization. 48 out of 100 studied organizations declared the implementation of the system. Student's t-test did not show statistically significant differences between the organizations analyzed for each statement in terms of the evaluation of selected performance parameters of a given organization. In such a situation further research is essential. There are some inclinations that the system does have a curing effect on the organisation. One can risk an interpretation that the greater the knowledge of the employees' potential and their development opportunities, the more accurate and reliable decisions and the more effective the human resources management is.

There is no other business activity that equally affects the development of all spheres of society, business sector and public administration. As well, this sector was one of the few in the course of the last economic crisis, which did not have a strong decline of the business revenues and employment. However, despite the above, the publications on the Croatia IT sector emphasized the existing obstacles to the continuation of its progressive development. Some of those are non-stimulating business environment, the inflexibility of the education system (resulting in the inadequate supply of skilled labour), the low level of available financial supports utilization, the absence of double taxation agreements with some of the largest world markets etc. The aim of this paper is to determine the impacts of the existing business environment on the regional IT sector performance, measured by selected financial indicators. Therefore, this paper presents the review of relevant literature and the results of the financial analysis of the largest IT companies of Eastern Croatia (that includes 62 and 63 codes of NACE classification) for the period 2012 to 2016. In accordance with stated above, the research comprises financial and statistical analysis of selected financial indicators including variations of business revenues, EBITD, EBITDA, NPM, CapEx, NIPE, RoA, total assets horizontal analysis, etc. The research gave the insight of the development trends of regional IT sector and insight of possible development obstacles, which can in the future be the basis for designing the recommendations for policymakers.","[Bukvic, Ivana Bestvina] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Dept Cultural Studies, Trg Sv Trojstva 3, HR-31000 Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Bukvic, IB (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Dept Cultural Studies, Trg Sv Trojstva 3, HR-31000 Osijek, Croatia.",ibbukvic@kulturologija.unios.hr,"Bestvina Bukvić, Ivana/J-3206-2019","Bestvina Bukvić, Ivana/0000-0002-9157-1479",,,,,14,1,1,0,0,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,719,727,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900074,0

To meet these UN demands, several countries have created cultural programs to offer children art and culture activities in school. In the Norwegian Cultural Schoolbag-program they emphasize that art and culture can provide experiences that may be decisive in order to develop the individual's personal identity, life quality and alternative worldviews. Since 2015 one county offers a unique Accessible-Program for children with special needs. From many years of research, we know the health-promoting value of artistic and musical activities. New technology opens up completely new ways to make art and culture accessible for all. In this paper, we show how we used music and cultural artefacts with musical and visual capabilities (RFID, AI), giving diverse users new musical, artistic, sensorial and creative experiences. We do this in relation to Ruud's concepts of Health Affordance and Cultural Immunogen. As a travelling interactive art installation, being part of the Norwegian Accessible-Program, we made participatory observations in six schools. We experienced how the children expressed themselves, co-created, showed self-efficacy and made different cultural experiences, depending on disability and relations.

To justify exclusive European regulation it is necessary to prove the positive value of a GI quality signal (i.e. label), which is often achieved by quantifying its monetary value for the consumers. But even though a large number of literary contributions already deal with this question, they lack the evaluation of overall effect sizes for the GI label. The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to quantify and evaluate the overall marginal consumer willingness to pay for the European GI label. Design/methodology/approach To reach this aim, a meta-analysis is used for which a literature survey had been carried out in order to determine the GI label effects (LEs). In addition to previous works, this paper not only includes a meta-analysis, but also implements a heterogeneity analysis to distinguish between the LEs of individual GI standards. To eliminate study- and product-specific determinants of heterogeneity, moderator variables are used. Findings The empirical results indicate that consumers have a highly significant and positive marginal willingness to pay for GIs. However, the marginal willingness to pay differs significantly between the individual GI standards and indicates great heterogeneity between the protected products. Originality/value As an extension to previous studies and meta-analysis; this paper includes the most extensive GIs meta-data set so far, and conducts for the first time an independent heterogeneity analysis to distinguish between the LEs of individual GI standards and implements a moderator analysis to eliminate study- and product-specific determinants of heterogeneity from the GI effects.","[Leufkens, Daniel] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Inst Agrarpolit & Marktforsch, Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Leufkens, D (通讯作者)，Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Inst Agrarpolit & Marktforsch, Giessen, Germany.",Daniel.Leufkens@gmx.de,,,,,,,58,18,18,5,42,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

However, little is known about the welfare consequences of participation. This paper analyzes the impact of cooperative member participation in decision-making on their incomes, using data from 364 members of China's land cooperative program. We distinguish two levels of participation in decision-making voting and obtaining financial information and use a bivariate probit model and propensity score matching to estimate their impact. The results indicate that household head's age, gender and education and family size, wealth, and political affiliation determine participation in decision-making.

Design/methodology/approach - Prior to the field survey, the authors constructed a theoretical model for clear identification of partial quantity rationed dairy farmers. Data from 154 dairy farmers were collected that represented three districts of the province. The collected data were analyzed in two stages: first, the efficiency level of dairy farmers was estimated using a stochastic frontier approach; second, the authors employed an inefficiency-effects model to estimate the effect of partial quantity rationing of credit on technical efficiency. Findings - The results revealed that education level of the household head, cross-breed and imported cattle, and electric chaff cutter, all had significant positive impacts on technical efficiency, followed by diversified sources of income. Conversely, the analysis of our key variables, interest rate on principal amount and partial quantity rationing of credit had significant negative effects on the technical efficiency of dairy farmers in selected districts of the Punjab province in Pakistan. Originality/value - The study will be an important contribution to the existing credit constraints and technical efficiency literature and will particularly help the rural financial institutions in terms of approving the loan amount according to the actual requirements of the borrowers. The study's findings and subsequent recommendations will be useful for policy makers in achieving the actual production level, bringing down the poverty levels and ensuring food security in the country.","[Mehmood, Yasir; Rong, Kong] Northwest Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Yangling, Peoples R China; [Mehmood, Yasir; Arshad, Muhammad] Govt Punjab, Dept Agr Planning & Evaluat Cell, Lahore, Pakistan; [Bashir, Muhammad Khalid] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Fac Social Sci, Inst Agr & Resource Econ, Faisalabad, Pakistan; [Arshad, Muhammad] Inst Socioecon, Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res, Muncheberg, Germany",Northwest A&F University - China; University of Agriculture Faisalabad; Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF),"Rong, K (通讯作者)，Northwest Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Yangling, Peoples R China.",kongrong1996@yahoo.com,"Bashir, Muhammad Khalid Khalid/H-9729-2014","Bashir, Muhammad Khalid Khalid/0000-0001-5572-2666; Mehmood, Yasir/0000-0003-2389-6324","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71373205, 71773094]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under project Grant No. 71373205 and No. 71773094.

Specific policy matters of the next programming period are unclear, yet in general, it is clear that the reduction of emissions or at least the introduction of emission abatement measures are binding on agriculture. A popular way how to analyse GHG emission abatement measures is to use a marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) that ranges the measures according to their costs and emission reduction potential. Such a research study has been done and the measures have been analysed in Latvia. A MACC, however, gives a relative notion of the effects of GHG emission abatement measures on sustainable development in Latvia. The research aim is to analyse the effects of GHG emission abatement measures on sustainable development in Latvia. The key instrument of the present research is Integrated Impact Assessment; according to it, experts from various fields identify the effects of GHG emission abatement measures on the economy, the environment and social development, determining its vector (positive/negative) as well as effect intensity (on a scale from 1 to 3). The results showed that some measures, e.g. promotion of biogas production, could have a negative effect in some sustainability sub-dimensions, yet overall the GHG emission abatement measures make positive and significant effects not only on the environment but also on sustainability at large. At the same time, it has to be taken into consideration that the effects identified by the experts are indicative and more research has to be done to make a more accurate assessment.","[Naglis-Liepa, Kaspars; Popluga, Dina; Lenerts, Arnis] Latvia Univ Life Sci & Technol, Fac Econ & Reg Dev, Jelgava, Latvia; [Rivza, Peteris] Latvia Univ Life Sci & Technol, Fac Informat Technol, Jelgava, Latvia; [Kreismane, Dzidra] Latvia Univ Life Sci & Technol, Fac Agr, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies; Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies; Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Naglis-Liepa, K (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Life Sci & Technol, Fac Econ & Reg Dev, Jelgava, Latvia.",,"Lenerts, Arnis/AAG-5998-2019; Naglis-Liepa, Kaspars/AAG-5991-2019","Lenerts, Arnis/0000-0003-1329-918X; Naglis-Liepa, Kaspars/0000-0003-2336-3915",,,,,23,3,4,0,3,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9984-48-294-1,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2018,49.0,,,,,,77,83,,10.22616/ESRD.2018.121,0.0,,,7,Development Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO1ZQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503493500009,0

Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional analysis of 150 recipes focusing on calorie, total fat and carbohydrates, saturated fatty acids, fibre, sugar, protein and salt content was performed. Main course recipes were evaluated against the UK Food Standards Agency (FSA), and the proportions of energy derived from each nutrient were evaluated against the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations. Findings While a significant proportion met the FSA and WHO recommendations for energy and salt, 58 per cent were above the FSA recommendation for total fat ((2)=5.598, p=0.01), 56 per cent failed to meet the recommendations for saturated fatty acids ((2)=4.551, p=0.03) and 60 per cent exceeded the FSA protein recommendations ((2)=12.602, p<0.001). Only 17 and 21 per cent of the recipes met the minimum recommendations for carbohydrates ((2)=30.429, p<0.001) and fibre ((2)=16.909, p<0.001), respectively. Only 37 per cent had adequate portion of fruits and vegetables. The nutritional content varied depending on the composition of the recipes; vegetarian recipes were more likely to meet the recommendations than poultry, meat or fish recipes. Research limitations/implications Foods displayed by children's popular TV cooking show fall short of the standards for healthy eating, thus warranting further research on how these shows affect eating behaviour.

Design/methodology/approach For the evaluation of vital gluten quality, two commercial vital wheat gluten named A and B were used. The simple tests performed with these samples were wet and dry gluten contents and index gluten, extensbility test and expansion test. The Pearson correlation was performed among data from dough rheological tests (farinograph and extensograph) and bread quality parameters (specific volume (SV) and crumb firmness) obtained from the fortification of wheat flour with 7g/100g of VGA or VGB (previous work, data not shown). Findings The simple tests showed differences in the viscoelastic properties of vital gluten A and B; vital gluten A presented higher elasticity and lower extensibility than vital gluten B, and the gluten ball of sample A presented higher SV. By correlation analysis, it was verified that the simple tests studied may be useful to assess the baking performance of commercial vital gluten when this product is added to wheat flour for its fortification. Furthermore, the results indicate the need for more information on vital wheat gluten proteins for its commercialisation and use. Originality/value This work is very important, not just for the scientific community, but also for the bakery industry, that requires more information about vital wheat gluten before its use in bread making. As there are great differences in the protein quality of commercial vital wheat glutens and their functionality, the study was developed to solve this problem.","[Ortolan, Fernanda] Inst Fed Educ Ciencia & Tecnol Sao Paulo, Matao, Brazil; [Ortolan, Fernanda; Urbano, Karoline; Steel, Caroline Joy] Univ Estadual Campinas, Campinas, SP, Brazil",Instituto Federal de Sao Paulo (IFSP); Universidade Estadual de Campinas,"Ortolan, F (通讯作者)，Inst Fed Educ Ciencia & Tecnol Sao Paulo, Matao, Brazil.;Ortolan, F (通讯作者)，Univ Estadual Campinas, Campinas, SP, Brazil.",fernanda.ortolan@iffarroupilha.edu.br,"Steel, Caroline J./N-9790-2018; Ortolan, Fernanda/Y-1191-2019",,"National Council of Scientific and Technological Development [163129/2013-4, 123530/2015-6]",National Council of Scientific and Technological Development(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"This work was supported by the National Council of Scientific and Technological Development (Grants Nos 163129/2013-4 and 123530/2015-6) for grants to the authors Fernanda and Karoline, respectively.

Pursuant to the Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the State has a duty to ensure the proper implementation of the legislative and administrative framework established for the protection of the rights of the patient and must also ensure responsibility for negligence in the field of health care. States have a positive obligation to adopt regulations that oblige public and private health institutions to adopt appropriate measures to protect the life and physical integrity of their patients and also must provide victims of medical negligence with access to compensation procedures. Thus, states must provide patients with an effective and independent judicial system (criminal/civil) for compensation for damage due to negligent treatment. The responsibility for a medical error can only be determined by the court with the aid of independent and impartial opinions of medical experts. As the expert witnesses of the medical profession are at the same time part of the same public health system, the issue of their impartiality and independence and the existence of appropriate procedural guarantees in domestic law is raised. Especially due to complaints that the concept of medical errors and medical negligence is not appropriately defined in the Croatian legal system and a number of difficulties in determining whether an action/omission of health workers caused harmful consequences for the patient (death, bodily injury or impairment of health). Therefore, one of the important standards of fair trial is to provide formal and factual independence and impartiality of expertise that play a key role in assessing the very complex issues of non-cure treatment. The standards expressed in the decisions of the ECHR require an independent judicial system to ensure adequate compensation in criminal and/or civil proceedings which must be effective in practice and be carried out without undue delay.","[Radanovic, Nina Misic] Univ Split, Univ Dept ofForens Sci, Split, Croatia",University of Split,"Radanovic, NM (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Univ Dept ofForens Sci, Split, Croatia.",nina.misic.radanovic@unist.hr,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,358,368,,,,,,11,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Law",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies; Government & Law,BP1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540727600041,0

Monthly data are taken from January 2005 to December 2017 and analyzedby carrying out cointegration analysis starting with a stationarity test of each variable, i.e.retail price of rice (PRR) and rice market operations (MO). The PRR and MO variables are stationary in the first difference test or I (1). The cointegration test indicates that MO and PRR have a long-run equilibrium. The result of the analysis using an error correction model shows that the sign of cointegration is negative, real and in line with expectation which shows a convergence to the long-run equilibrium, so that there is a rice price stabilization in the long-run equilibrium.","[Sembiring, Surya Abadi; Sibuea, Posman] Univ Katolik Santo Thomas Medan, Fac Agr, Medan, Indonesia",,"Sembiring, SA (通讯作者)，Univ Katolik Santo Thomas Medan, Fac Agr, Medan, Indonesia.",suryasembiring1961@gmail.com,,,Universitas Katolik Santo Thomas; Kemenristekdikti [229/K1.1/LT.1/2018],Universitas Katolik Santo Thomas; Kemenristekdikti(Ministry of Research and Technology of the Republic of Indonesia (RISTEK)),The author is grateful to the Universitas Katolik Santo Thomas and to Kemenristekdikti for research grants in 2018 with a Contract No. 229/K1.1/LT.1/2018.,,23,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1755-1307,,,IOP C SER EARTH ENV,IOP Conf.

They are visual aids simplifying complex nutritional messaging for the public. While pyramid and circle formats are the most common shapes in use worldwide, the dinner plate format is increasing in use due to its perceived effectiveness. However, research examining visual attributes of food guide graphics, and the dinner plate model specifically, is limited. The purpose of this paper is to systematically compare and analyse key visual attributes of plate food guide graphics (across multiple examples) to assess their potential for effective visual communication of nutrition messaging. Design/methodology/approach - This study engages in a qualitative analysis of compositional elements of food guide graphics. Data collection and analysis are grounded in the methods of compositional interpretation, which includes a qualitative, descriptive approach to establishing a thematic survey of the data. Findings - Unique visual attributes of the plate food guide (including image content, spatial organisation and expressive content) present challenges in the communication of key nutritional messaging regarding proportionality, moderation and overall usability. Practical implications - A better understanding of the visual attributes of the plate food guide model will contribute to improved design and development of this key public health tool by researchers, educators and health practitioners. Additionally, the examination of visual attributes has implications for the study of food guide understanding and use. Originality/value - This study highlights the need for critical visual skills in qualitative health research, and to address gaps in health education more broadly.","[Truman, Emily] Univ Calgary, Dept Commun Media & Film, Calgary, AB, Canada",University of Calgary,"Truman, E (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Dept Commun Media & Film, Calgary, AB, Canada.",emily.truman@ucalgary.ca,,"Truman, Emily/0000-0003-3377-9869",O'Brien Institute for Public Health at the University of Calgary,O'Brien Institute for Public Health at the University of Calgary,"This research was supported by funding from the O'Brien Institute for Public Health at the University of Calgary.

Deconsumption means taking responsibility for the long-term and multi-faceted effects of consumer decisions that are being taken nowadays. It assumes the elimination of consumer's hedonistic behaviors oriented at immediate gratification in favor of more demanding ones, which are characterized by postponed gratification, but - in the long run - are of more value. Deconsumption is a reaction against the feeling of exhaustion caused by excessive consumption (consumerism) and a distinctive feature of a consumer living in a post-ownership era, for whom the value lies in the benefits from using a products and not in its ownership and possession. Deconsumption is demonstrated mostly by limiting (rationalizing) consumption [caused by disappointment and fatigue resulting from excessive consumption, lowered importance of consumption and a human element within the system], greening consumption, servitisation, being involved in collaborative consumption (sharing economy and access economy). In a broad sense, deconsumption also includes anti-consumer behaviours, including those related to consumer resistance (e.g. consumer boycott, retaliation against companies that, for instance, abused their position, etc.). So far, deconsumption has not been adequately described in the literature on the subject (both in Poland and abroad) and there is a great cognitive gap regarding this phenomenon. Most of the research carried out in this area is of qualitative character. Quantitative research has been focusing on selected aspects and, additionally, it has been conducted on low-key, convenient trials (mainly involving students). The basic aim of this study is to diagnose the deconsumptive attitudes and behaviour of Generation Y in Poland. People born between 1980 and 2000 acquired consumer awareness in a competitive, free-market economy. Thanks to technological development they have access to global information and they can follow trends from different parts of the world. Are they therefore ready to give up a consumer lifestyle and the will to increase their ownership? The conclusions are based on the results of quantitative research conducted on a representative sample of 600 young Poles. The sample was selected by random-quota method. The respondents were selected based on gender, age and place of residence.","[Wilczak, Agnieszka] Univ Warsaw, Fac Management, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Wilczak, A (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Management, Warsaw, Poland.",,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,297,305,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540733700034,0

Design/methodology/approach The horizontal bar graphic's single number shows the per cent content of the dominant nutrient, marked Most, contrasting with Least at the origin. A separate bar for energy is expressed as percentage of 3,700kJ, the energy in 100g of fat. Six randomised table and equivalent graph images were shown to subjects who answered questions about the foods' energy, dominant nutrient and per cent content, and relative abundance of seven mandated nutrients. One trial tested 40 food science students, another 100 online Australasian consumers. Scores were compared by the (2) test. Liking of the two formats was compared by t-test. Findings Correct online consumer responses were: energy - 18 per cent (tables), 71 per cent (graphics); dominant nutrient - 81, 96 per cent; per cent dominant nutrient - 43, 82 per cent. All differences were highly significant. Relative abundance questions created a 7 nutrient x 6 food matrix (42 combinations) where tables were more accurately understood 14 times (3 significant) and graphics 28 times (12 significant). Responses in the student trial paralleled the consumer trial; differences were less marked but with similar statistical significances. Consumers liked the graphic more. Practical implications The graphic format was more understandable than the table format, and would be useful in internet-based applications.

These lapses in regulatory oversight and enforcement have led to high levels of pollution in many mining communities. The likelihood is high that the risk of pollution-related sicknesses will necessitate increasingly high healthcare expenditures in affected communities. In this study, we propose and estimate a hedonic-type model that relates healthcare expenditure to the degree of residents' exposure to mining pollution using data obtained on gold mining in Ghana. This has been confirmed by our empirical results, with an elasticity coefficient of 0.12. Furthermore, while healthcare expenditure does not vary between males and females, younger household heads spend more on their health than their older counterparts after controlling for health status, income and access to health insurance.

That knowledge gap is troubling, as there is evidence that outdoor production takes place in ecologically sensitive areas. Policy aimed at mitigating the impacts of current and future cultivation should be based on an understanding of what drives cultivation siting. Using parcel level data and a Heckman sample selection model, we estimate where cannabis cultivation is likely to take place and the number of plants in each site using biophysical, historical, and network variables. We use this model to estimate drivers of greenhouse and outdoor cultivation siting. We find strong implied network effects - parcels are far more likely to have cultivation sites if there are cannabis plants nearby. However, the proximity of other cannabis sites does not impact the size of a parcel's own cultivation. Similarly, a history of timber harvest increases the likelihood of outdoor cultivation, but is linked to cultivation sites with fewer plants. Biophysical properties such as slope, aspect, and distance to water did not statistically impact the likelihood of a parcel to be cultivated. Our results are a first step toward understanding the emergence of an agricultural activity likely to grow in other locales in the future. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A frequently cited example of this is the infection of wild salmon by sea lice from salmon farms. Management of the disease risk to wild salmon populations requires an understanding both of the disease transmission mechanisms and the control incentives faced by fish farmers. In this paper we develop a bioeconomic model that integrates sea lice population dynamics, fish population dynamics, aquaculture, and wild capture salmon fisheries. Using an optimal control framework, we investigate options for managing the sea lice infection externality. We pay particular attention to the role of sea lice management on the stability of wild stocks, and the sensitivity of sea lice effects on wild fisheries. We find that the stability of wild stocks is related to sea-lice-induced mortality (inversely) and the value of wild fishery.

The need to adapt is increasingly recognized, from the community level to regional and national governments to the donor community, yet adaptation faces many-constraints, particularly in low income settings. This study documents and examines the challenges facing adaptation in Africa, drawing upon. semi-structured interviews (n = 337) with stakeholders including high-level stakeholders, continent-wide and across scales: in national government and UN agencies, academia, donors, non-governmental organizations, farmers and extension officers. Four key concerns about adaptation emerge: i) Climate data, scenarios and impacts models are insufficient for supporting adaptation, particularly as they relate to food systems and-rural livelihoods; ii) The adaptation response to-date has been limited, fragmented, divorced from national planning processes, and with limited engagement with local expertise; iii) Adaptation policies and programs are too narrowly focused on explicit responses to climate change rather than responses to climate variability or broader development issues; and iv) Adaptation finance is insufficient, and procedures for accessing it present challenges to governments capacities. As a response to these concerns, we propose the 4-Cs framework which places adaptation for Africa at the center of climate projections, climate education, climate governance and climate finance, with corresponding responsibilities for government and non government actors.

They conclude that DMV overcomes some flaws of conventional stated preference (SP) methods, addresses many of my concerns and at the same time avoids some of the problems generated by DV. Several of their comments are debatable. A closer look at DMV in comparison with DV and conventional SP methods shows that Bartkowsld and Lienhoop's DMV approach addresses only one out of six major issues with conventional SP methods - the lack of opportunities for group discussion. My conclusion therefore remains unaffected: Due to the many technical issues with measuring individual willingness to pay (WTP), valuations based on majority voting principles are not only more transparent and more democratically legitimate than conventional SP or DMV. They may also produce superior proxies for aggregated individual WTP.

Through ethnographic observations, in-depth interviews, and a participatory scenario workshop we develop four narratives centering on the links of nature and ecosystem services. Benefits derived from ecosystem services are fundamental building blocks in the local vision of 'the good life' and emerge from a combination of satisfied preferences and struggle, hardships, and capabilities inflicted by a demanding environment and challenging work conditions. Beyond a certain level of meeting basic needs and provisioning of essential public services, simplicity in life and local control over resources and surroundings was preferred over a multitude of other opportunities and services. Well-being was strongly linked to maintenance of identity through traditional practices for harvesting of natural resources, nurturing of skills, social cohesion, and acting meaningfully in one's local environment. In a relational perspective, cultural ecosystem services are constituted and given meaning through interaction with nature. The main policy implication is that contributions of natural and social capital to well-being proved to be hard to meaningfully separate. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

BRs offer a unique opportunity to examine these relationships because they aim to foster more adaptive and collaborative forms of management, i.e. adaptive co-management (ACM). Accounting for the outcomes of ACM is a difficult task and little progress has been made to this end. However, we show here that ACM efforts in all four BRs had a myriad of positive results as well as ecological and livelihood effects. Process variables of collaboration and learning explained over half (54.6%) of the variability in results and over one third (35.1%) of the variability in effects. While the overall models for outcomes and subsequent process were not significant, the regressions revealed predictive potential for both process variables. Our analysis highlights that a better process is associated with more positive outcomes and that collaboration and learning make unique contributions to outcomes. Opportunities for quantitative techniques to be utilized in understanding, the dynamics of ACM are illustrated. Understanding relationships between process and outcomes (and vice versa) provides a sound basis to answer critiques, enhances accountability, and maximizes the potential of positive impacts for ecosystems and humans.

We find strong effects of hotter and wetter weather early in U.S. history, but these effects have generally been attenuated in recent decades. The results suggest that estimates from a given period may be of limited use in forecasting the longer-term impacts of climate change.","[Bleakley, Hoyt] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, 611 Tappan Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Hong, Sok Chul] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Seoul National University (SNU),"Hong, SC (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",hoytb@umich.edu; sokchul.hong@snu.ac.kr,,"Bleakley, Hoyt/0009-0002-2825-6107",NIH [P01 AG10120]; National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2011-327-B00079],NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),"We have benefited from comments and suggestions from Michael Greenstone, Paul Rhode, Wolfram Schlenker, Richard Steckel, Gary Libecap, Daniel Hamermesh, William Collins, and two anonymous referees, and from the participants in the workshops at the University of Chicago, UIUC, and Queen's University, Sogang University, Korea University, and Seoul National University, and in the seminars at NBER Universities' Research Conference, the American Economic Association Annual Meetings, and World Economic History Congress.

Therefore, important marketing decisions relate to a firm's strategy for developing quality enhancements and releasing new versions. This paper explores this type of product development using a dynamic duopoly model that endogenizes each firm's decisions over how much to invest in R&D and when to release new versions. Specifically, I explore how two key industry fundamentals-the degree of horizontal differentiation and the cost of releasing a new version-affect firms' product development strategies and, accordingly, the evolution of industry structure. I find that varying the degree of horizontal differentiation gives rise to three distinctly different types of competitive dynamics: preemption races when the degree of horizontal differentiation is low; phases of accommodation when it is moderate; and asymmetric R& D wars when it is high. Furthermore, I find that an increase in the cost of releasing a new version can induce firms to compete more aggressively for the lead and, in doing so, release new versions more frequently despite the higher cost.","[Borkovsky, Ron N.] Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto,"Borkovsky, RN (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON, Canada.",ron.borkovsky@rotman.utoronto.ca,,,General Motors Center for Strategy in Management at Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management; SSHRC [410-2011-0356],General Motors Center for Strategy in Management at Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management; SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"I am extremely grateful to Mark Satterthwaite, David Besanko, Ulrich Doraszelski, Sarit Markovich, Andrew Ching and Avi Goldfarb for their guidance and feedback.

I develop a model in which poor farmers cannot credibly commit to purchase water rights. I show that empirical evidence on savings and prices is consistent with this interpretation. A temporary increase in output prices in the 1950s and better financial institutions allowed farmers to accumulate savings and solve the commitment problem.

Using these novel data, we trace out how advertising affects consumer behavior along the path-to-purchase. We find advertising has no significant effect on the number of consumers visiting the category being advertised. The null effect is precisely estimated. At the upper bound of the confidence interval, a one-standard-deviation shift in advertising increases category traffic by only 1.3%. We do find a significant effect at the lower end of the conversion funnel. A onestandard- deviation change in advertising (evaluated at the point estimate) increases category-level sales by 10%. We further decompose the impact on sales and find the increase is driven by the same number of consumers buying a larger number of products of the same brand. We find no evidence of spillover effects of advertising between categories that are stocked in proximity of each other, nor between different products in the same category. Two mechanisms are consistent with these patterns: consumers retrieve memory of the ad only when interacting with the category or only consumers wanting to purchase the brand choose to consume the ad.","[Seiler, Stephan] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Yao, Song] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Stanford University; Northwestern University,"Seiler, S (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",sseiler@stanford.edu; s-yao@kellogg.northwestern.edu,"Yao, Song/JJC-2914-2023","Yao, Song/0000-0002-0339-9649; Seiler, Stephan/0000-0001-8636-1840",,,,,35,8,15,4,59,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

Both the discovered and constructed preference perspectives imply this is not necessarily the case. There can be a large situational component to expressed preferences that add to the uncertainty of sampling error. Most non-market valuation studies only collect data from one point in time so the degree of temporal variability cannot be tested. Test-retest studies that provide data from two points in time generally find significant differences in preference structure and willingness-to-pay (WTP). In this study we test stability of WTP for beach erosion management using a fully ranked discrete choice experiment survey with not one but two retests over a six month period. We find that stability does not improve with the additional repetition as the preference discovery hypothesis implies it might. WTP confidence intervals overlap but the models are significantly different at each point in time, even after allowing for variation in choice error. Either the survey did not facilitate sufficient preference discovery or preferences were reconstructed. However, respondents with high scores of self-reported certainty in their choices in the first survey had significantly more stable WTP estimates. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The study examined four US national forests designated as priorities for investments to restore fire resiliency and generate economic opportunities to support local industry. We were particularly interested in economic trade-offs that would result from prioritization of management activities to address forest departure and wildfire risk to the adjacent urban interface. The results showed strong trade-offs and scale effects on production possibility frontiers, and substantial variation among planning areas and national forests. The results pointed to spatially explicit priorities and opportunities to achieve restoration goals within the study area. However, optimizing revenue to help finance restoration projects led to a sharp reduction in the attainment of other socioecological objectives, especially reducing forest departure from historical conditions. The analytical framework and results can inform ongoing collaborative restoration planning to help stakeholders understand the opportunity cost of specific restoration objectives. This work represents one of the first spatially explicit, economic trade-off analyses of national forest restoration programs, and reveals the relative cost of different restoration strategies, as well scale-related changes in production frontiers associated with restoration investments.

We draw on passenger manifests from immigrant ships for information on the individual migrants. Simulations, based partly on the these manifests, reveal that the costs of migration, borrowing constraints, concern for status, and country-specific taste preferences account for key immigrant characteristics, and help explain the large wage differentials that persisted despite Canada's relatively open immigration policy.","[Armstrong, Alex] Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Lewis, Frank D.] Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",University of Ottawa; Queens University - Canada,"Lewis, FD (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",armstronga@econ.queensu.ca; lewisf@econ.queensu.ca,,,,,,,55,2,2,0,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,MAY,2017,11.0,2,,,,,153,182,,10.1007/s11698-016-0141-x,0.0,,,30,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,ET1IQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000400021400001,0

A reassessment,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Defensive medicine; Medical malpractice; Obstetrics,DEFENSIVE MEDICINE; MALPRACTICE LITIGATION; OBSTETRICS; LIABILITY; DELIVERY; RATES,"Investigations into the existence and impact of defensive medicine in obstetrics have produced mixed and often conflicting implications. The most widely-cited and accepted results in this literature find that less severe malpractice environments cause an increase in the use of cesarean section. This has been interpreted as offensive medicine; taking advantage of lenient malpractice environments by providing unnecessary services in order to raise revenue. In this article we show that an assumption concerning births with an unknown method of delivery, which is not explicitly stated in the literature, is pivotal in obtaining these results. Using data on tort reforms and birth outcomes from 1989 to 2001 in 24 US states, we show that for the 98.4% of births with a confirmed method of delivery, the estimated effects of tort reform on C-section rates are insignificant. Therefore, without this assumption, there is little evidence to support an interpretation of offensive medicine.","[Cano-Urbina, Javier] Florida State Univ, Dept Econ, 113 Coll Loop,257 Bellamy Bldg, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Montanera, Daniel] Georgia State Univ, Inst Hlth Adm, 35 Broad St NW,Suite 805, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Montanera, D (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Inst Hlth Adm, 35 Broad St NW,Suite 805, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA.",jcanourbina@fsu.edu; dmontanera1@gsu.edu,,"Montanera, Daniel/0000-0002-1324-5061",,,,,18,6,8,3,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

Specifically, the paper applies the most recent cointegration tests under multiple structural breaks and extends the work of Okunade (J Health Econ 21(1):147-159, 2002) with the possibility whether a linear cointegration model with multiple structural breaks would provide a better economic model to quantify the impact of some major determinants of US real per capita health expenditure. This paper presents evidence to show that per capita real income, technology as indicated by four proxy measures and life expectancy at birth are some major drivers of real per capita health expenditure in the United States. Contrary to the available evidence in the literature, the finding of this paper is that the point aggregate income elasticity of health expenditure estimate is less than one, indicating that health care has evolved to become a necessity in the United States. Policy implications of the empirical findings are discussed in the paper.","[Murthy, Vasudeva N.

This article also explores the different factors influencing the nature and intensity of the selection process. The empirical exercise stresses that the stock of previous migration was a fundamental factor in allowing less literate individuals to join the migration process as well. Interestingly, distance to Madrid hardly affected the profile of male migrants, but it was a strong influence on female migration, although its importance diminished over time. Lastly, the results presented here show that other internal destinations were attracting different types of migrants, often resulting in negative self-selection.","[Beltran Tapia, Francisco J.] Univ Cambridge, Magdalene Coll, Cambridge, England; [de Miguel Salanova, Santiago] Univ Complutense Madrid, Madrid, Spain",University of Cambridge; Complutense University of Madrid,"Tapia, FJB (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Magdalene Coll, Cambridge, England.",,"Tapia, Francisco J Beltrán/H-4337-2015","de Miguel Salanova, Santiago/0000-0003-1392-0925","Spanish Ministry of Science and Education [HAR2012-30732, ECO2012-33286, HAR2011-26904]",Spanish Ministry of Science and Education(Spanish Government),"Financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Education (Projects HAR2012-30732, ECO2012-33286, and HAR2011-26904) is also gratefully acknowledged.",,59,18,18,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

The case of Berlin, Germany",BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Disclosure; Food safety; Compliance; Behavioural drivers; Generalized ordered regression model,MODELS; NONCOMPLIANCE; COREGULATION; RECIPROCITY; INFORMATION; GOVERNANCE; ECONOMICS,"Purpose - A whole series of food scandals indicates that misdirected incentives continue to be a source of food risks. Lacking market transparency and the opportunistic use of seemingly profitable opportunities to break the rules cause negative externalities and failure of markets. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of mandatory transparency schemes on food businesses' behavioural drivers and thus on compliance. Design/methodology/approach - The authors use an adopted analytical framework developed by Hirschauer et al. (2012) as the theoretical background. The authors provide an empirical analysis of the effects of a disclosure system on businesses' behavioural drivers in three urban parts of the German capital Berlin. The authors conducted a pen-and-paper survey among food businesses to collect data and used a generalized ordered logit regression model to analyse them. Findings - The results show that the higher the businesses assess the possible negative effects of a negative smiley on sales, the higher the probability of compliance. Considering the immaterial behavioural drivers (protective factors) the authors find the statistical significant influence of a feeling of embarrassment in case of disclosure and the feeling of a fair evaluation on compliance. Thus, the study supports the expectation that disclosure policies affect behavioural drivers and have the potential to steer food businesses' compliance. Practical implications - The study supports the expectation that hygiene controls' disclosure positively affects food businesses' compliance. These findings should be taken into consideration in the ongoing discussion about disclosure. Nowadays, there is no mandatory transparency in Germany due to a strong opposition from businesses and their lobbying groups. Originality/value - The authors conducted a pen-and-paper survey among food businesses in three urban districts of the German capital Berlin, namely, Pankow, Lichtenberg and Marzahn-Hellersdorf in 2014. The food authorities in these districts were the only ones in Germany that had introduced and run a mandatory disclosure system (smiley-system) for food businesses. The results of the inspections were published on the authorities' homepages in the internet, and were displayed in businesses. Thus the data mirror the unique experiences of the only German food businesses that participated in a mandatory transparency scheme.","[Bavorova, Miroslava; Fietz, Anica Veronika; Hirschauer, Norbert] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Agribusiness Management, Halle, Germany",Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Fietz, AV (通讯作者)，Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Agribusiness Management, Halle, Germany.",anica.fietz@googlemail.com,,"Hirschauer, Norbert/0000-0001-6027-8889",German Research Foundation DFG,German Research Foundation DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),The authors acknowledge the financial support provided by the German Research Foundation DFG.,,68,11,11,0,14,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Self-administered questionnaires were administered to participants after the education session. In total, 5,292 valid questionnaires were obtained, yielding a response rate of 93.3 per cent. In the last three months of the pilot study, a random sample of 305 from 1,493 participants was chosen and followed up six months later. Bivariate analysis was used to study the association of knowledge gained and attitude. Behavioural change was measured in terms of whether participants had reported an increase in their consumption of healthier food. Findings - Majority (W98 per cent) of participants reported that the HC corner was useful, and had helped increase their awareness and knowledge of creating healthier meals and making healthier food choices. 95.7 per cent were willing to make changes after visiting the HC. At six months follow-up, 84 per cent of the participants reported positive changes in their dietary habits. Those who made positive changes were younger (mean age: 58.0 years) compared with those who did not (mean age 61.0 years, p = 0.035). Research limitations/implications - Incorporating cooking demonstrations as part of nutrition education is effective in inculcating healthy eating practices and changing self-reported eating habits in the short term. Further research is needed to verify actual change in eating habits and to determine if this change is sustainable in the long run.

Design/methodology/approach - In order to examine the content and structure of the information found on the website of selected FBs, an ad hoc analysis model was designed and validated with the support of marketing and industry experts through an inspecting focus group (Mich, 2007). Findings - The subsequent observation of the websites of the businesses studied showed that family-run Italian wineries use their websites mainly to present information about the business and as a relational tool through edutainment activities; FBs yet neglect the potential of e-commerce. Research limitations/implications - The study highlights the importance and the attention that FBs, among others, should dedicate to the role of web communications within their communications strategy. Although this path has allowed the traits essential to launch effective online communications for FBs, the small number of businesses surveyed (ten) does not permit a theoretical generalisation of the results. Thus, we expect to integrate the information obtained from this preliminary study with in-depth interviews with the digital strategists for the companies examined or by increasing the number of FBs studied. Originality/value - The paper provides an evaluation model to effectively organise the websites' contents; wine businesses should consider and customise these essential elements with the brand's specific details.","[Iaia, Lea; Scorrano, Paola; Fait, Monica; Cavallo, Federica] Univ Salento, Dept Management Econ Math & Stat, Lecce, Italy",University of Salento,"Scorrano, P (通讯作者)，Univ Salento, Dept Management Econ Math & Stat, Lecce, Italy.",paola.scorrano@unisalento.it,"Fait, Monica/AAA-4283-2020; Iaia, Lea/R-4911-2019; scorrano, paola/N-6534-2015","Fait, Monica/0000-0003-2448-3839; Iaia, Lea/0000-0003-4650-1233; scorrano, paola/0000-0002-7964-9931",,,,,64,17,19,0,32,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

In climate adaptation and natural resource management literature, this structural component is often related to social capital, which is defined in various ways but usually refers to a public good that is built and fostered within a network of social relations. While hypotheses about social capital in networks are well studied in network literature, here, I argue that they should be reflected and tested in the particular context of climate change adaptation policy. I ask: how do communities affected by climate change and the broad range of actors involved in the design of climate adaptation policies build social relationships? And, how do they manage to maintain those relations over time? To answer these questions, climate adaptation policies in six Swiss mountain regions are investigated via social network analysis. Hypotheses about the creation and preservation of weak versus strong ties under the particular setting of Swiss federalism and climate-affected local communities are tested. Results confirm that the creation of weak ties, such as one-way information transfer, can lead to the establishment of mutual collaboration relations over time. Such mutual and reciprocal relations can then more easily be activated by local communities to produce both short-term responses and long-term solutions to climate change impacts.

The development of the ecological agriculture in Slovak Republic is influenced by several negative factors, therefore it is being developed slowly.","[Recky, Roman; Kadekova, Zdenka; Kubicova, Lubica] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Mkt & Trade, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia; [Horvathova, Jarmila] Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Foreign Languages, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Récky, R (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Mkt & Trade, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",roman.recky@uniag.sk; jarmila.horvathova@uniag.sk; zdenka_kadekova@yahoo.com; kubicova.lubka@gmail.com,"Kádeková, Zdenka/AAH-6817-2021","Kádeková, Zdenka/0000-0003-2814-5239",,,,,7,0,0,1,5,SLOVAK UNIV AGRICULTURE NITRA,NITRA,"TR A HLINKU2, NITRA, 94976, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-552-1739-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,654,660,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6FH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426613300081,0

Indeed, the first conviction in the UK for 20 years was a farmer stealing from neighbouring farmers. The theft of sheep in the UK is an expanding criminal enterprise which remains under researched. The purpose of this paper is to examine what is known of the illegal trade and its links to food fraud from a supply chain perspective with an emphasis on food integrity issues. Design/methodology/approach - There is a dearth of current viable literature on livestock theft in a western context making it necessary to turn to socio-historical research and to official documents such as those published by the NFU and other insurance companies to build up a picture of this illegal practice. This is supplemented by documentary research of articles published in the UK press. Findings - From this raw data a typology of rustlers is developed. The findings point to insider supply chain knowledge being a key facet in the theft of livestock. Other examples in the typology relate to urban thieves wrestling live sheep into a car and to industry insiders associated with the abattoir sector. Research limitations/implications - The obvious limitations is that as yet there are few detected cases of rustling in the UK so the developing typology of rustlers is sketchy. Another limitation is that much of the evidence upon which the typology is developed is anecdotal. Originality/value - The typology should prove helpful to academics, insurance companies, investigators, industry insiders and farmers to help them understand this contemporary crime and how to prevent its spread. It also sheds light on food integrity in relation to the purchase and consumption of the end product in that customers expect to be purchasing legally and ethically reared animal products.","[Smith, Robert] Univ West Scotland, Dept Management & Enterprise, Dumfries, Scotland",,"Smith, R (通讯作者)，Univ West Scotland, Dept Management & Enterprise, Dumfries, Scotland.",rob.smith@uws.ac.uk,"Smith, Robert/I-6933-2013","Smith, Robert/0000-0002-8929-4804",,,,,58,7,8,1,21,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

After collecting the professional literature, the study of the same leads to the conclusion that there is a definite unambiguous model that could be applied in the implementation of privatization in some countries. The aim of this study is to prove that each country is unique and that in the selection of the privatization method must be taken to ensure the fact that no existing model will not be able to implement completely and without the necessary changes. For a start it is necessary to explain the very notion of privatization and the difference between privatization in countries with socialist economy (which must fully reconstruct its economy) from privatization in countries with a capitalist economy (in which there is already a private capital which can take state property). Subsequently will be explained the method of privatization, which may be implemented through free distribution or by selling. When choosing a model is also necessary to keep in mind if one wants to implement privatization at once or gradually, over a longer period of time. It is important to decide whether the state property share or sell only to employees of those companies, or if the population and foreign investors will be included in the process. A brief review of previous privatization in Slavonia will be shown at the end and due to failure of its implementation will be presented major shortcomings in the process of converting the state into private ownership.

At the same time, most of the family farms also facing with competition, caused by among other things with insufficient knowledge of the market trends, poor positioning in the market and lack of access to supply chains. The aim of this paper is to present different forms of business associations and to explore the basic barriers of development and interest of agricultural farms towards cooperative business. The survey that was conducted in June 2016 on the sample of 210 farms in Eastern Croatia included questions that evaluated the potential of an association of farms interest for the cooperative way of doing business. It can be concluded that only 9% of respondents are included in some form of business cooperation, but over half the majority of respondents are ready to cooperate with other farms due to a possibility of getting major projects, achieving greater subvention and economies of scale. Further guidelines for the development of the cooperative should be based on education (formal, no formal, informal education), the involvement of young people in farming and to encourage the finalization of agricultural products as well as the development of services in the cooperatives. By accomplishing these objectives, cooperatives will achieve theirs common economic and social interests and at the same time, they will strength the local community and effect on sustainable development.","[Sudaric, Tihana; Zmaic, Krunoslav; Tolic, Snjezana] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Agr Osijek, Vladimira Preloga 1, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Sudaric, T (通讯作者)，JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Agr Osijek, Vladimira Preloga 1, Osijek, Croatia.",stihana@pfos.hr; kzmaic@pfos.hr; stolic@pfos.hr,,,,,,,11,1,1,0,3,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,567,576,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500054,0

But as the literature on carbon lock-in has shown, overcoming path dependence is all but trivial. Even well-minded decision-makers tend to relapse into inertia when it comes to making concrete divestment decisions. We investigate one specific case, the 2016 Swiss popular initiative to phase out nuclear power, to explore the cognitive and affective drivers of energy path dependence on the individual level. Within eight weeks of an intense political campaign, support for this initiative dropped from more than 60 to just 45.8% of Swiss voters. Based on a representative longitudinal survey (N = 1014), we show that changes in perceived risk and benefit of nuclear power play key roles in explaining fading voter support for nuclear divestment, and that affect is in turn a significant driver of those changes. By framing it as a choice between the lesser evil of nuclear power or importing German coal power, opponents of the phase-out managed to introduce an asymmetrically dominated option into voters' choice set, leading many to change their original voting intentions. Our paper responds to calls for integrating dual-process theories (thinking fast and slow) into research in Ecological Economics.","[Rinscheid, Adrian; Wuestenhagen, Rolf] Univ St Gallen, Chair Management Renewable Energies, Tigerbergstr 2, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland; [Rinscheid, Adrian] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Andlinger Ctr, 86 Olden St, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",University of St Gallen; Princeton University,"Rinscheid, A (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Chair Management Renewable Energies, Tigerbergstr 2, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",adrian.rinscheid@unisg.ch; rolf.wuestenhagen@unisg.ch,"Rinscheid, Adrian/ABA-6487-2020","Rinscheid, Adrian/0000-0003-3160-538X; Wustenhagen, Rolf/0009-0000-5306-3628",Innosuisse - Swiss Innovation Agency,Innosuisse - Swiss Innovation Agency,"This work has benefited from fruitful exchanges with the members of the Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research SCCER CREST, supported by Innosuisse - Swiss Innovation Agency.

To this end, it is of strategic importance to provide a common framework that makes it possible to identify the key decarbonization wedges at the national level and to highlight the potential benefits of international cooperation. The article proposes an advanced index decomposition analysis methodology based on sectoral energy service indicators and on a specific decomposition in the power sector for quantifying the contribution of different mitigation strategies. It is applied to national deep decarbonization pathways elaborated in the Deep Decarbonization Pathway Project (DDPP) by the sixteen largest GHG emitting countries. In a global perspective, the results reveal the key role of energy efficiency and decarbonization of energy carriers in the industry sector, deployment of renewables in the power sector and, to a lesser extent, coal/gas substitution, and efficiency and energy decarbonization in the transport sector. The analysis also calls for a deeper understanding of the role a reduction in energy-service demand can play in mitigation scenarios and of the respective contribution for industry of energy efficiency and structural change.","[Mathy, Sandrine; Menanteau, Philippe; Criqui, Patrick] Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, INRA, Grenoble INP,GAEL, F-38000 Grenoble, France",INRAE; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble,"Mathy, S (通讯作者)，Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, INRA, Grenoble INP,GAEL, F-38000 Grenoble, France.",sandrine.mathy@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr; philippe.menanteau@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr; patrick.criqui@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr,,"Mathy, Sandrine/0000-0002-7998-4115",,,,,60,28,33,1,38,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Yet, while there are studies that exemplify how the fund has been implemented as well as the strategies that individual countries adopt, there is still a lack of academic literature about the steps taken and implemented to devise successful alternative production strategies. In this case study, we analyze Jordon's current strategy to reduce ozone-depleting Halon 1211 and 1301, two fully halogenated hydrocarbons that are extensively used in Jordan for their exceptional fire-extinguishing characteristics. In response to the Montreal Protocol, an international treaty to phase out halon use, Jordan adopted a halon management program to manage the use of halons, build strategic reserves for essential uses, and limit the amount of these substances that are released into the atmosphere. This study presents the actual inventory data of halons in Jordan in addition to the challenges and obstacles in the halon bank management system in Jordan. Moreover, this research covers the prospects of Jordan halons banking to achieve the goal of meeting Jordan's halons demand for essential uses up to the year 2030. To this end as well as to fulfill Jordan's commitment to the Montreal Protocol, the research recommends finding the balance between effectively enforcing regulations against the use of ozone-depleting substances while being able to meet halons demand for the essential uses until alternatives are comparably affordable and available on the national market. The research recommends that regulations should be supported with effective governance measures to minimize the occurrences of ozone-depleting substances escaping into the atmosphere as well as to meet halons demand.","[Al-Awad, Tareq K.] Princess Sumaya Univ Technol, Environm Technol & Management Program, Amman, Jordan; [Saidan, Motasem N.] Univ Jordan, Sch Engn, Chem Engn Dept, Amman 11942, Jordan; [Saidan, Motasem N.] Univ Jordan, Water Energy & Environm Ctr, Amman, Jordan; [Gareau, Brian J.] Boston Coll, Dept Sociol, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA",Princess Sumaya University for Technology; University of Jordan; University of Jordan; Boston College,"Saidan, MN (通讯作者)，Univ Jordan, Sch Engn, Chem Engn Dept, Amman 11942, Jordan.;Saidan, MN (通讯作者)，Univ Jordan, Water Energy & Environm Ctr, Amman, Jordan.",m.saidan@gmail.com,"Saidan, Motasem/B-1519-2014","Saidan, Motasem/0000-0001-9517-0835; Gareau, Brian/0000-0002-0529-3389",,,,,76,21,21,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

A powerful means to ensure this, is to dynamically redistribute the ambulances over the region, depending on the current state of the system. In this paper, we provide new insight into how to optimally (re)distribute ambulances. We study the impact of (1) the frequency of redeployment decision moments, (2) the inclusion of busy ambulances in the state description of the system, and (3) the performance criterion on the quality of the distribution strategy. In addition, we consider the influence of the EMS crew workload, such as (4) chain relocations and (5) time bounds, on the execution of an ambulance relocation. To this end, we use trace-driven simulations based on a real dataset from ambulance providers in the Netherlands. In doing so, we differentiate between rural and urban regions, which typically face different challenges when it comes to EMS. Our results show that: (1) taking the classical 0-1 performance criterion for assessing the fraction of late arrivals only differs slightly from related response time criteria for evaluating the performance as a function of the response time, (2) adding more relocation decision moments is highly beneficial, particularly for rural areas, (3) considering ambulances involved in dropping off patients available for newly coming incidents reduces relocation times only slightly, and (4) simulation experiments for assessing move-up policies are highly preferable to simple mathematical models.","[van Barneveld, Thije; Jagtenberg, Caroline; Bhulai, Sandjai; van der Mei, Rob] Ctr Wiskunde & Informat, Sci Pk 123, NL-1098 XG Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van Barneveld, Thije; Bhulai, Sandjai; van der Mei, Rob] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1081a, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"van Barneveld, T (通讯作者)，Ctr Wiskunde & Informat, Sci Pk 123, NL-1098 XG Amsterdam, Netherlands.",thijevanbarneveld@ziggo.nl; c.j.jagtenberg@gmail.com; s.bhulai@vu.nl; r.d.van.der.mei@cwi.nl,"Jagtenberg, Caroline/AAO-3131-2020","Jagtenberg, Caroline/0000-0002-0742-7707; Bhulai, Sandjai/0000-0003-1124-8821",Technology Foundation STW [11986],Technology Foundation STW(Technologiestichting STW),"We would like to thank the ambulance service providers of the EMS regions of Flevoland, GGD Flevoland, and Amsterdam, Ambulance Amsterdam, for providing data.

This paper proposes an economic model of stormwater runoff damage estimation. Using a hedonic property model that allows us to account for the heterogeneity in each parcel's generation of stormwater runoff, we estimate the marginal implicit cost of an additional 10,000 ft(3) of annual runoff (which represents about a 2% increase in the average annual runoff volume coming from each lot) to a downstream community in the Allen Creek watershed located in Rochester, NY. We estimate that an additional 10,000 ft(3) of runoff translates to nearly $12,000 (or $1.20 per cubic foot) of damages to downstream residences under current development conditions. Results can be compared with abatement cost estimates from other studies to help quantify one important part of the tradeoffs between the desirability of development versus the increase in environmental challenges and economic costs that may result.","[Hellman, Kelly; Lass, Daniel] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Resource Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Wagner, Jeffrey; Hanna, Brid Gleeson] Rochester Inst Technol, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14623 USA; [Korfmacher, Karl] Rochester Inst Technol, Environm Sci Program, Rochester, NY 14623 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Rochester Institute of Technology; Rochester Institute of Technology,"Hellman, K (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Resource Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",khellman@resecon.umass.edu,,,,,,,44,5,5,1,31,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

We introduce a new methodology that combines production frontier and impact evaluation insights that allows using DEA as an identification strategy of a treatment with high and low quality teachers within schools to assess their performance. We use a unique database of primary schools in Spain that, for every school, supplies information on two classrooms at 4th grade where students and teachers were randomly assigned into the two classrooms. We find considerable differences in teachers' efficiency across schools with significant effects on students' achievement. In line with previous findings, we find that neither teacher experience nor academic training explains teachers' efficiency. Conversely, being a female teacher, having worked five or more years in the same school or having smaller class sizes positively affects the performance of teachers.","[Santin, Daniel] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Appl Econ 6, Campus Somosaguas 28223 Pozuelo de Alarcon, Madrid, Spain; [Sicilia, Gabriela] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Econ & Publ Finance, Campus Cantoblanco, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Santín, D (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Appl Econ 6, Campus Somosaguas 28223 Pozuelo de Alarcon, Madrid, Spain.",dsantin@ccee.ucm.es,"Sicilia, Gabriela/Y-4657-2019; Santín, Daniel/I-7784-2016","Santín, Daniel/0000-0002-1654-1659; Sicilia, Gabriela/0000-0002-1078-7762",Fundacion Ramon Areces; Agencia Nacional de Investigacion e Innovacion,Fundacion Ramon Areces; Agencia Nacional de Investigacion e Innovacion,We thank two anonymous referees for helpful discussions and suggestions.

Design/methodology/approach DSA was used as advanced segmentation procedure of hierarchy value maps (HVMs) produced by MEC analysis. Findings The findings suggest that there are two main segments of local food consumers in urban Indonesia: value-for-money and health benefits. The value-for-money segment is dominant when making local food purchasing. Research limitations/implications This study sample is not representative of local food consumers in urban Indonesia as only three urban cities were interviewed.

A Political Ecology Analysis,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,HYDROSOCIAL CYCLE; FOOTPRINT; POLICY; RESOURCES; SUSTAINABILITY; COOPERATION; DOMINATION; TRADE,"There is an exhaustive literature on Israel, Palestine and water, which has documented how the asymmetric power of Israel in the Oslo negotiations ensured its control of land and water over Palestine. Less attention however has been paid on the interface of water, trade and agriculture, and the ways in which controlling trade, Israel controlled the virtual flows of water too. The concept of virtual water makes the water-agriculture-trade relationship visible, shedding light on agricultural trade flows in terms of water. Applying a political ecology approach, this paper shows how socio-ecological conditions are sustained by and organised through both social and metabolic-ecological processes. A biophysical analysis - the agricultural flows of virtual water from and to Palestine in the Post-Oslo period - is combined with the examination of the power relations that governed these flows. The analysis reveals that virtual water flows are not static but instead evolve within the (geo)political-economic context in which they are embedded, bringing to light Israel's control over the flow of Palestinian agricultural virtual water. We argue that a political ecology approach to virtual water offers a theoretical basis to move beyond the currently techno-managerial emphasis in the virtual water literature, illuminating the link between the control of virtual flows and the consolidation of political and economic power.

Design/methodology/approach In total, 40 voluntarily written stakeholder responses to updated official dietary guidelines in Sweden were analysed thematically. The analysis explored the logics and arguments employed by authorities, interest organisations, industry and private stakeholders in attempting to influence the formulation of dietary guidelines. Findings Two main themes were identified: the centrality of anchoring advice scientifically and modes of getting the message across to the public. Stakeholders expressed a view of effective health communication as that which is nutritionally and quantitatively oriented and which optimises individuals' capacities to take action for their own health. Their responses did not offer alternative framings of how healthy eating could be practiced but rather conveyed an understanding of dietary guidelines as documents that provide simplified answers to complex questions. Practical implications Policymakers should be aware of industrial actors' potential vested interests and actively seek out other stakeholders representing communities and citizen interests. The next step should be to question the extent to which it is ethical to publish dietary advice that represents a simplified way of conceptualising behavioural change, and thereby places responsibility for health on the individual. Originality/value This research provides a stakeholder perspective on the concept of dietary advice and is among the first to investigate referral responses to dietary guidelines.","[Bergman, Karolin; Persson-Osowski, Christine; Lovestam, Elin; Elmstahl, Helena; Nowicka, Paulina] Uppsala Univ, Dept Food Nutr & Dietet, Uppsala, Sweden; [Eli, Karin] Univ Oxford, Inst Social & Cultural Anthropol, Oxford, England",Uppsala University; University of Oxford,"Bergman, K (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Dept Food Nutr & Dietet, Uppsala, Sweden.",Karolin.Bergman@ikv.uu.se; Christine.Persson-Osowski@ikv.uu.se; Karin.Eli@anthro.ox.ac.uk; Elin.Lovestam@ikv.uu.se; Helena.Elmstahl@ikv.uu.se; Paulina.Nowicka@ikv.uu.se,"Persson Osowski, Christine/HPZ-1139-2023","Nowicka, Paulina/0000-0001-9707-8768; Persson Osowski, Christine/0000-0003-1142-1495; Eli, Karin/0000-0001-9132-8404",Stiftelsen Kronprinsessan Margaretas minnesfond,Stiftelsen Kronprinsessan Margaretas minnesfond,"The authors acknowledge the financial support of the Stiftelsen Kronprinsessan Margaretas minnesfond, which has partially funded Karolin Bergman's PhD position.

The primary task of the managing director is not only to ensure a constant return on the capital invested but, albeit as a custodian of foreign assets, to run a business and to make the necessary entrepreneurial decisions. Entrepreneurial decisions always carry the risk of failure no matter how elaborately and meticulously are executed. Furthermore, in the majority of cases, there is not the right decision. An entrepreneurial discretion of the managing director exists as far as no instructions of the shareholders are present,. Therefore, directors are given a liability-free scope for entrepreneurial decisions based on the model of the Business Judgment Rule from the American Law. The Business Judgment Rule applies to business decisions only. An entrepreneurial decision is a decision of the management in matters of the management, which is not predetermined by the law, the statutes or instructions of the shareholders' meeting. Decision that is bound by the strict legal norm is not an entrepreneurial one. The entrepreneurial decision is characterized by the following: In the context of an entrepreneurial decision, the managing director, in the given situation, selects among various actually possible and legally permissible action alternatives. At the time of the decision, it is not yet clear whether the chosen alternative will be the most economically advantageous. The managing director is therefore required to make a prognosis. The subsequent assessment of the behaviour of the managing director also must be based on this ex-ante perspective. The decision of the managing director must be objectively comprehensible. In Croatia, the requirements of the liability of a member of the company for the obligations of the company are prescribed by the Croatian Companies Act in the provision of Art. 252. The Companies Act prescribes that the board members must conduct the business of the company with the care of an orderly and sound businessman and keep the business secret of the company. A member of the board of directors does not act in contravention of the obligation to conduct the business of a company if it can reasonably assume, when making an entrepreneurial decision, that it acts for the benefit of the company on the basis of appropriate information. This paper will shed some light on Croatian case law concerning the Institute of Business Judgment Rule.","[Brnabic, Ratko] Fac Law Split, Split, Croatia",,"Brnabic, R (通讯作者)，Fac Law Split, Split, Croatia.",rbrnabic@prayst.hr,"Brnabić, Ratko/H-2819-2017",,,,,,9,0,0,1,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,329,336,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Law",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies; Government & Law,BP1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540727600038,0

Natural attractions, bio-diversity, rich historical and cultural heritage, climate, gastronomic and oenological offer, and the level of security are certainly a significant potential of Croatian tourism, attracting more and more tourists every year. Cyclotourism, as one of the forms of selective tourism, both in Europe and in the World is one of the tourism products with the greatest prospect of development. Its rich historical and cultural heritage, attractive and diverse natural environment, favourable climate, the security of the country, a large number of roads with lower intensity of motor traffic and other paths suitable for cycling provide Slavonia and Baranja with numerous comparative advantages for the development of cyclotourism. Since Slavonia and Baranja, according to statistical data of the Ministry of Tourism, is a region with the lowest number of tourists and overnight stays in the Republic of Croatia, the primary objective of this paper is to set guidelines and define the steps for cyclotourism development in its area, i.e. key activities that will lead to increased consumption and increased number of overnight stays in the seasons from 2018 to 2020, and increased number of cyclotouristic arrivals by generating demand through the development and promotion of new products and services. The research methodology is based on the secondary, desk research, as well as on the primary research through an online survey.

This paper describes a preliminary attempt to create an adequate model and methodology, as well as its initial implementation. The pilot implementation study was conducted at the University's Faculty of Psychology and - after some adaptation - in two offices of the University's central administration (number of employees N=70). The authors' model of administrative staff performance appraisal consists of three pillars - (a) an auto-evaluation form filled by the employee, derived from the positive psychology theory of Martin Seligman, (b) a behavior-based employee evaluation form tailored by the manager and filled by him, and (c) a plans and goals form filled by the employee and the manager together, derived from Peter Drucker's management by objectives (MBO) theory. The implementation methodology was focused on a coaching and training process with the managers performing the staff evaluation. In order to assess the reception of the performance evaluation system some qualitative methods have been used (interview, N=2, survey, N=17). Based on the results of the pilot implementation study further research directions are presented for future studies and practical application.","[Cywinska, Maria] Univ Warsaw, Acad Subunit Org Sociol & Business Hist, Fac Management, Warsaw, Poland; [Zawadzki, Konrad] Univ Warsaw, Biol & Chem Res Ctr, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw; University of Warsaw,"Cywinska, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Acad Subunit Org Sociol & Business Hist, Fac Management, Warsaw, Poland.",maria.cywinska@psych.uw.edu.pl; vice-dyrektor@cnbc.uw.edu.pl,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,332,340,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540733700038,0

The estimates are based on extensive source material on literacy rates, number of primary and secondary schools and enrolment figures. An additional distinction is made on the basis of gender and of level of schooling. The trends in the data are indicative of significant increases in the level of educational attainment during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. This remarkable growth in schooling was followed by a strong decline in average years of education after ca. 1720. Whilst one in seven boys entered secondary schooling at the end of seventeenth century, this had decreased to one in thirty by the 1880s. Overall, the trends in the data suggest that education was beneficial to pre-industrial economic growth, but this was not sustained following the initial stage of the industrialisation process.","[de Pleijt, Alexandra M.] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"de Pleijt, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands.",sandradepleijt@gmail.com,,,,,,,94,21,23,0,3,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,JAN,2018,12.0,1,,,,,99,126,,10.1007/s11698-016-0156-3,0.0,,,28,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,FT0FA,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000422795900004,0

The monitoring of changes in the individual elements that fit into the broadly understood socio-economic development is used to verify the basic objectives of changes related to the improvement of the standard of living of people, and also constitutes an important premise for conducting socio-economic policy. The analysis of consumption indicators in Poland, beginning with the accession to European Union, confirms the improvement of standard of living, and thus the progressing socio-economic development of the country. From the value-related point of view, the consumption was growing real each year, but the pace of this increase was diversified.

Households still remain the main source of food waste (53 percent). The purpose of this paper is to estimate households' food waste and wastage-related losses of energy and nutrients among middle school students as well as assess educational intervention regarding food waste prevention. Design/methodology/approach - The study included 555 students from 11 schools in Poland. The study was conducted using the survey questionnaire and the three-day record of food waste. The interventional group filled a questionnaire before and after of education as well as after three months of intervention. Findings - Students waste 23 g of food per day. The most wasted products are: potatoes, bread, fruits and vegetable as well as meet and ham. Energy losses from leftovers are less than 1-10 percent. Losses of nutritional value along with wastages were the highest for vitamin C, but also for dietary fiber, potassium and folate. Food waste education was nearly twice as strong in study group with films intervention, than those who received only a leaflet for parents. Research limitations/implications - Middle school students are responsible for households' food waste and contribute to energy and nutrition losses. Educational intervention is more effective, while using multimedia methods and need to be continued. Practical implications - The paper is a scientific study and addressed to the scientific audience. However, due to the problem of households' food waste, general public could be also interested. Social implications - Food waste is an element of waste management. Studying the scale of food waste and waste related behavior can help to better understand causes of food waste. The search for ways to limit food waste, through education address to young people, can be an effective method of prevention of waste. The UN has established 17 new development goals for the years 2015-2030 (United Nations, 2015). One of them (Goal 12) is focused on ensuring sustainable consumption and production. It means halving food waste at the retail and consumer levels and food losses at the production and post-harvest stages by 2030. Originality/value - There are few publications available about food waste including energy and nutrients waste. This study shows the scale of household waste, the quantity and type of wasted products and causes of disposal. Also, the way of handling with food waste at homes was examined. It is also important to draw attention to the responsibility of young people in wasting food, which was examined in the paper.","[Kowalewska, Maria Teresa; Kollajtis-Dolowy, Anna] Szkola Glowna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego, Dept Fac Human Nutr & Consumer Sci, Warsaw, Poland; [Kowalewska, Maria Teresa] Federat Polish Food Banks, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Kowalewska, MT (通讯作者)，Szkola Glowna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego, Dept Fac Human Nutr & Consumer Sci, Warsaw, Poland.;Kowalewska, MT (通讯作者)，Federat Polish Food Banks, Warsaw, Poland.",marysiago@wp.pl,,"Kollajtis-Dolowy, Anna/0000-0001-5605-6888",,,,,47,17,18,2,35,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The most significant such mechanism in the Republic of Croatia is family mediation, but some other methods of amicable resolution of family disputes have a significant role. Family mediation as a mechanism of amicable resolution of family relationships considers not only divorce disputes and those disputes that are to be resolved with the divorce, but especially the disputes connected with exercising the right to parental care, personal relationship with the child, as well as all pecuniary and non-pecuniary disputes which are connected with the family relationships. In this paper, the author provides an overview of the legal framework of all models of peaceful resolution of family disputes in the positive Croatian legislation, with the special highlight on family mediation. That overview favours the efforts of the Croatian society encouraging and developing the institution of amicable resolution of family disputes and it thus contributes to modern and regulated society based on mutual respect and tolerance.","[Ledic, Senija] Cty Court Split, Gunduliceva 29a, Split 21000, Croatia",,"Ledic, S (通讯作者)，Cty Court Split, Gunduliceva 29a, Split 21000, Croatia.",sledic@yahoo.com,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,4,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,415,420,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Law",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies; Government & Law,BP1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540727600047,0

In this paper I investigate the relationship between protected area-based benefits and losses and the admission of illegal resource extraction in households neighbouring Kibale National Park, in Uganda. Using focus groups, a household survey, and member-checking interviews with local council chairpersons, binary logistic models were created for the admission of illegal resource extraction from the park. The desire for park resources and proximity to the park were the strongest factors predicting admitted extraction. Reciprocity and retribution in response to park-based benefits and losses were small or non-existent with only loss due to personal injury or livestock predation by wild animals increasing the likelihood of extraction. Lower wealth households were more likely to admit extraction, supporting the conservation narrative that poverty constrains conservation. Also, the inability of park-based benefits to reduce the probability of resource extraction implies that benefits need to be more targeted to livelihood needs. Compensation for losses should only be considered for personal injury, and to a lesser extent livestock predation, because only these losses demonstrated potential retaliation through resource extraction.","[MacKenzie, Catrina A.] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, 805 Rue Sherbrooke Ouest, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada; [MacKenzie, Catrina A.] Univ Vermont, Dept Geog, 200 Old Mill Bldg,94 Univ Pl, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",McGill University; University of Vermont,"MacKenzie, CA (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Dept Geog, 805 Rue Sherbrooke Ouest, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada.;MacKenzie, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Vermont, Dept Geog, 200 Old Mill Bldg,94 Univ Pl, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",catrina.mackenzie@mail.mcgill.ca,"Mackenzie, Catrina/M-7177-2019","Mackenzie, Catrina/0000-0002-7478-6486",Warren Development Geography Fund; McGill Faculty of Science Dean's African Field Work Award,Warren Development Geography Fund; McGill Faculty of Science Dean's African Field Work Award,"This work was supported by the Warren Development Geography Fund and the McGill Faculty of Science Dean's African Field Work Award.

Design/methodology/approach - A total of 60 restaurateurs located in a small Italian city and 100 owners of micro and small-sized farms, located within a 30 km radius from the city, have been interviewed. The collected data have been analysed through descriptive analysis and Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests for differences between gender, production type and business size. Findings - The results agree with existing literature: poor communication and an unstructured logistics limit the interaction among actors. However, significant for the purpose, the data show that producers are interested in expanding their market and restaurateurs are interested in a broader supply of local products, and they both open to a logistics service that improves the supply of local food. Research limitations/implications - The following exploratory study is based on a sample of farmers and restaurants in a specific area so the results could not be generalised in a national/international context. Practical implications - The logistics service objective is the promotion of a sustainable territory development in support of the social economy values. Originality/value - The study investigates this issue focussing on a practical solution of local food distribution system among restaurants. The logistics service tends to solve the logistics criticalities maintaining the principles of the short food supply chain.","[Paciarotti, Claudia; Torregiani, Francesco] Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Ind Engn & Math Sci, Ancona, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University,"Torregiani, F (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Ind Engn & Math Sci, Ancona, Italy.",f.torregiani@pm.univpm.it,,,,,,,43,34,35,3,48,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Sea water intrusion often happens in coastal areas. This study was conducted to determine the spread, levels of intrusion and factors that affect sea water intrusion in the research area. The sampling technique was carried out using interval random sampling, where 30 samples were taken with a distance of 2 km each, and then chemical analysis was carried out including the parameters of Cl-, HCO3-, CO3=, and electrical conductivity (EC). The method used to determine the level of seawater intrusion was the method of Chloride Bicarbonate Ratio and then the types of water were classified based on chloride content and electrical conductivity. The determination of the distribution of seawater intrusion was done by mapping analysis using the ArcGis application program. To determine the factors that affected sea water intrusion, multivariate regression analysis with the backward elimination method was used. The results showed that on several sample points the shallow aquifer had been intruded by sea water with a ratio of 1.02 to 102.16 which were included in the category of intrusion of slightly to high. Chloride concentrations ranged from 2 mg/L to 31,160 mg/L and were classified as fresh water to salt water. Electrical conductivity ranged from 186 mu mhos/cm to 26,400 mu mhos/cm and generally above 200 mu mhos/cm which meant that the sea water had been disturbed. Factors that significantly affected sea water intrusion were water usage debit and aquifer permeability with an adjusted coefficient R-2 of 0.797.","[Panjaitan, Delima] Univ Sumatera Utara, Dept Management Nat Resources, Medan, Indonesia; [Panjaitan, Delima] Univ Katolik Santo Thomas Sumatera Utara, Medan, Indonesia; [Tarigan, Johannes; Rauf, Abdul; Nababan, Esther S.

The value added, tax has been excluded from the analysis. The paper concludes that fuel taxes in Poland have not been designed for climate policy and are mostly revenue-generating taxes. Tax rules that contribute to carbon dioxide emissions reduction include lower tax rates for gaseous fuels and the use of fuel charge revenues to finance investments in railway infrastructure. Excise duty in Poland could be redesigned to better reflect climate policy objectives. The tax could be for example combined with a direct carbon tax based on carbon dioxide emissions.

Design/methodology/approach This is achieved by analysing a representative scanner panel data set for the period 2006-2013. The methodology consists of exploring the impact of promotions on food expenditure and allocation within households' food purchases, using expenditure regressions and estimations of the linear version the Almost Ideal Demand System. Findings The results indicate that whilst promotions have differentiated effects by category, they have similar results by SIMD. The effect of the promotions on the total expenditure is positive for all the quintiles. However, the effect of promotions on each food category is complex because of the cross-effects between categories. As regards the effect of prices, the results provide a picture that seems to indicate that typical economic measures such as specific taxes applied to substances which, e.g., encourage obesity, might have limited impact on the diet given the inelasticity of the demand to changes in prices. Originality/value A contribution of this paper has been to focus on the effect of promotions on all the food products consumed by Scottish households, instead of analysing promotional influences on a single or reduced number of products within a category.","[Revoredo-Giha, Cesar; Akaichi, Faical; Leat, Philip] Scotlands Rural Coll, Land Econ Environm & Soc Res Grp, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",Scotland's Rural College,"Akaichi, F (通讯作者)，Scotlands Rural Coll, Land Econ Environm & Soc Res Grp, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",cesar.revoredo@sruc.ac.uk; faical.akaichi@sruc.ac.uk; philip.leat@googlemail.com,,"Akaichi, Faical/0000-0003-0395-2368; Revoredo-Giha, Cesar/0000-0001-9890-4160","Scottish Government's Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services Division (RESAS), as part of the Strategic Research Programme on Food, Health and Wellbeing","Scottish Government's Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services Division (RESAS), as part of the Strategic Research Programme on Food, Health and Wellbeing","This study derives from work funded by the Scottish Government's Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services Division (RESAS), as part of the Strategic Research Programme (2016-2020) on Food, Health and Wellbeing (Theme 3).",,35,7,8,0,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Requirements of regulatory bodies towards corporations are increasing, in terms of the number of information that needs to be disclosed to the interested public. A major challenge lately discussed at great length by professional organizations pertains, among other things, to particularly important non-financial information about human capital or, for example, environmental protection. Although these are difficult to measure or display through financial reports, it is indisputable that they have a significant impact on creating capital and on companies' long-term success. These are topics directed towards ways of creating capital and actually show the interest in creating quality future for the generations to come. It is this fact which implies that the obligation of disclosing non-financial information needs to be legally regulated so that reporting is no longer optional but mandatory for all companies, and not only for the big ones. In that context, professional organizations play particularly significant role, and especially regulatory bodies that define the types of information and manner of their presentation to external users. The future of corporate reporting is related to integrated reporting. Hence, building a regulated system of integrated reporting that would include relevant financial and non-financial information should be an objective of all interested parties. The International Integrated Reporting Council, as well as other bodies, significantly contributes to the development of integrated reporting. This contribution reflects in providing solutions, but also in opening cutting-edge topics and issues related to implementation of efficient reporting system. The purpose of this paper is to point out the significance of regulatory bodies in creating efficient financial and non-financial integrated reporting system. The paper presents the most important international regulatory bodies and organizations which have a particularly significant impact on shaping a reporting system for external users, and especially an integrated reporting system, as well as the role and significance of national regulatory bodies which can contribute to efficient implementation of an integrated reporting system in the Republic of Croatia.","[Svigir, Andreja] Altius Savjetovanjedoo, IB Mazuranic 24, Zagreb, Croatia; [Zager, Katarina] Fac Econ Zagreb, Trg JF Kennedya 6, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Svigir, A (通讯作者)，Altius Savjetovanjedoo, IB Mazuranic 24, Zagreb, Croatia.",andreja.svigir@altius.hr; kzager@efzg.hr,"Žager, Katarina/H-7955-2018",,,,,,6,0,0,0,7,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,1123,1130,,,,,,8,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900118,0

This implies that the built environment as we know it must be improved. Thus, those responsible for addressing upcoming challenges, i.e. future universal design thinkers, must be adequately equipped with various methodological tools and valuable experience of interdisciplinary work. Both aspects are essential to preparing them for real-life problems and projects, regardless of complexity. What happens if architecture, interior architecture, engineering, and product design students spend a week together investigating the built environment from a critical design point of view? Can this upside-down way of thinking provide them with alternative starting points for the problem-solving process, and help them to identify and understand people's needs differently? This paper describes a critical design method and presents the results of and lessons learned from conducting a one-week workshop based on this method. The outcomes of the workshop (critical design examples) were created to illuminate the built environment and so provide the students with first-hand experience of what can happen if the dark side of design thinking is ignored.","[Torkildsby, Anne Britt] NTNU Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Norwegian Res Lab Universal Design, Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Torkildsby, AB (通讯作者)，NTNU Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Norwegian Res Lab Universal Design, Trondheim, Norway.",anne.torkildsby@ntnu.no,,,,,,,34,1,1,2,14,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-9630,1879-8365,978-1-61499-923-2; 978-1-61499-922-5,STUD HEALTH TECHNOL,,,2018,256.0,,,,,,760,770,,10.3233/978-1-61499-923-2-760,0.0,,,11,"Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7JT,30371440.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455118100074,0

Design/methodology/approach Data was collected from e-databases of the SVA from 1999-2016 and sorted into categories (game animals and fish; livestock; food and raw material of animal origin) and time periods (one before entry and two after entry of CR to the EU). Analyses of the samples were categorized as positive samples (any presence of contaminants) and samples above the MRL (presence of contaminants exceeding the maximum residue levels). Findings Results showed a significant decrease in the number of positive findings of contaminants during the monitored years 1999-2016, especially after CR entered the EU. Most encouragingly, the number of samples that exceeded the MRL was less than 1 percent from all the tested samples of animal origin and, after entry to the EU, in one category (food and raw materials of animal origin) it was even less than 0.1 percent. Findings of banned substances indicate continued environmental contamination in CR; however, this remains a problem in most of Europe due to their extensive use in the past and slow degradation.

Design/methodology/approach A conceptual model was proposed in which intention to purchase GM food is stimulated by the combination and complex effects of knowledge, risk perception, information need, information seeking and attitude. A face-to-face questionnaire survey was conducted in Jinan, Shandong Province. A total of 757 valid samples (55.6 percent of women vs men) were involved to conduct structural equation model analysis. Findings Results demonstrated that attitude is the most important predictor of intention to purchase GM food. Attitude, in turn, is predicted by risk perception and information seeking. Risk perception is a significant determinant of information need and information seeking. Moreover, information need influences information seeking. Finally, knowledge plays a critical role in risk perception and intention. Overall, the explained variance of the model is 66 percent. Originality/value The study provides new insights explaining intention to purchase GM food by constructing a conceptual model from the perspective of risk information. In this model, knowledge, risk perception, information need and information seeking are all based on information related to GM food, resulting in attitude and intention to purchase.","[Zhu, Weiwei] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Marxism, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Yao, Nengzhi (Chris)] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Management, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Ma, Ben] Shandong Univ, Sch Govt & Publ Adm, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Fangbin] Hefei Univ Technol, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China","Hefei University of Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS; Shandong University; Hefei University of Technology","Yao, NZ (通讯作者)，Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Management, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China.",zwwhfut@hfut.edu.cn; ynz@mail.ustc.edu.cn; maben@sdu.edu.cn; fbwang@mail.ustc.edu.cn,,,National Social Science Foundation of China [17CGL046],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),The authors acknowledge the financial support from the National Social Science Foundation of China (17CGL046).,,42,26,29,6,60,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

First, it introduces an exponential environmental productivity indicator and its ratio-based counterpart constructed through an exponential distance function. These innovative exponential environmental productivity index and indicator inherit the basic structure of both Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index and environmental Luenberger productivity indicator. Thereafter, an exponential version of the environmental Luenberger-Hicks-Moorsteen productivity indicator is proposed. Such a specification allows to overcome the special issue of infeasabilities. Second, looking from a dynamical viewpoint, we propose an exponential generalized dynamical distance function. This new efficiency measure shows the degree of efficiency of an observation, taking into consideration its technical efficiency and/or technological variation adjustment path. A sample of 11 representative French airports is considered over the period 2008-2011, in order to implement these new exponential environmental productivity index and indicators.","[Abad, A.; Ravelojaona, P.] Univ Perpignan, CAEPEM, IAE, Via Domitia,52 Ave Paul Alduy, F-66860 Perpignan, France",Universite Perpignan Via Domitia,"Abad, A (通讯作者)，Univ Perpignan, CAEPEM, IAE, Via Domitia,52 Ave Paul Alduy, F-66860 Perpignan, France.",arnaud.abad@univ-perp.fr,"Ravelojaona, Paola/AAG-7185-2021; Abad, Arnaud/AAA-4195-2021","Ravelojaona, Paola/0000-0001-5052-7132; Abad, Arnaud/0000-0002-7202-6088",,,,,49,5,5,2,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Local stakeholders are often affected by NNL biodiversity trades. But to what extent are NNL principles intuitive to stakeholders when they are not experts? We surveyed 691 students with limited or no knowledge of NNL policy across three countries, eliciting perceptions of what constitutes sufficient ecological compensation for forest habitat losses from infrastructure development. NNL policies assume that biodiversity compensation should be: close to development impacts; greater than losses; smaller, given a background trend of biodiversity decline; and, smaller when gains have co-benefits for biodiversity. However, survey participant proposals violated all four principles. Participants proposed substantial forest compensation abroad, did not always require commensurate compensation within their own country, and required more forest creation if background trends were for habitat decline or if forest creation had fauna co-benefits. Our findings suggest that, under certain circumstances, international biodiversity trades could deserve consideration. The findings also support proposals to incorporate social considerations into compensation ratios for NNL Wherever the rationale underlying NNL is discovered to be counterintuitive insofar as relevant stakeholders are concerned, careful communication of policy intentions is required.

With the arrival of democracy in 1931, the transition began from a traditional regime (with low levels of social spending) to a modern regime (with high levels of social spending). Franco's dictatorship, however, reversed this change in direction, retarding the positive growth in social spending. At the same time, the effect of left-wing parties was statistically significant only in the 1930s (prior to the Keynesian consensus) and in the period of the Bourbon Restoration (when the preferences of low-income groups were systematically ignored).","[Espuelas, Sergio] Univ Barcelona, Ctr Estudis Antoni de Capmany, Fac Econ & Empresa, Ave Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Espuelas, Sergio] Univ Barcelona, BEAT, Fac Econ & Empresa, Ave Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Espuelas, Sergio] Univ Barcelona, Dept Hist Econ Inst Polit & Econ Mundial, Fac Econ & Empresa, Ave Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona,"Espuelas, S (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Ctr Estudis Antoni de Capmany, Fac Econ & Empresa, Ave Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.;Espuelas, S (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, BEAT, Fac Econ & Empresa, Ave Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.;Espuelas, S (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Hist Econ Inst Polit & Econ Mundial, Fac Econ & Empresa, Ave Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",sergio.espuelas@ub.edu,,"Espuelas, Sergio/0000-0003-1771-6307","MINECO, FEDER, EU [ECO2015-65049-C2-2- P]; MINECO [HAR2013-41121-P]; Ramon Areces Foundation","MINECO, FEDER, EU(Spanish Government); MINECO(Spanish Government); Ramon Areces Foundation","Funding from the projects ECO2015-65049-C2-2- P (MINECO, FEDER, EU) and HAR2013-41121-P (MINECO) and the Ramon Areces Foundation is acknowledged.",,66,9,9,0,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

It is reaffirmed that therefore its statistical results should be treated with all due scepticism in terms of their historical significance and capacity to inform us about the relationship between changing reproductive behaviour and the complexities of social class relations.

Based on a 2007 Beijing household daily travel/activity survey, this paper attempts to calculate household daily travel carbon emissions and delineate the heterogeneous distribution within and across different neighborhoods. Using multilevel regression models, this paper confirms that socioeconomic variables (especially car availability) are the dominant contributing factors to household travel carbon emissions. Increasing the population density, land use mix and access to metro stations decreases emissions; whereas, household travel emissions increase along with the residential distance to the city center. Moreover, these effects vary across neighborhoods. Consequently, besides behavioral change policies aimed at high emitters, land use instruments should be targeted to different neighborhoods.

The framework is refined through analytic generalization of 20 cases from four industries and four cities in Jiangsu Province, and reveals two strategies: 1) firms with moderate institutional pressure seek incremental competitiveness by adopting energy-saving technologies, which is reinforced by their inforinational, organizational, and financing capabilities, and facilitated by voluntary policies and industrial competition; 2) firms with survival risk or development constraints under regulation seek a position favored by local governments by replacing old plant and equipment with larger, more efficient ones and contributing to the local community. The Chinese case studies reveal a strong institutional impact on firms' choice of business strategies and particularly the positioning strategy. The identified business strategies shed additional light on the effectiveness and implications of different policy instruments for energy efficiency. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents the estimation of a sea angling demand function for Irish waters. The negative binomial models also account for truncation and endogenous stratification; two issues that need to be controlled for when dealing with on-site sampled populations. Given the dispersed nature of sea angling activity, the chosen model does not focus on one specific site as is common in the literature for count data travel cost models but rather estimates the total demand for sea angling in the season, no matter where the angling takes place along the Irish coast. We use this empirical work to discuss the more general debate surrounding resource allocation between commercial fisheries and recreational anglers. The results indicate the high value of the Irish marine environment as a recreational angling resource. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Benefit transfers based on meta-analyses, which synthesize site and methodological characteristics from valuation studies of similar underlying amenities, generally outperform traditional site-to-site transfers. We build on earlier meta-analyses of willingness-to pay for tropical coral reef recreation by introducing a meta-regression model with threshold effects, with a goal of increasing transfer reliability. We estimate a threshold in coral reef quality and find that increases in live coral cover have a large impact on individuals' WTP for recreation at degraded coral reefs. Relaxing the assumption of users' constant valuation across the distribution of this characteristic improves the performance of coral reef benefit transfers in some instances: tests of convergent validity reveal that including the threshold effect reduces the mean transfer error and the interquartile range of transfer errors-in 5 out of 8 tests.

It addresses the widespread belief that Norwegian sheep farming is the best but is confronted with a meat industry that emphasises economic efficiency. A few years after a new Norwegian law on animal welfare acknowledged animals as sentient beings came into force in 2010 (LOVdata, 2009), the purpose of this paper is to better understand ongoing debates on the welfare of sheep by exploring how sheep welfare is understood and regulated in Norway. Design/methodology/approach - The theoretical framework draws on convention theory, especially referring to the four possible worlds of production (Salais and Storper, 1993). The authors argue that animal welfare may be analysed in parallel to product quality, focussing on three major perspectives of sheep welfare: animal treatment, product quality, and an abstract conceptualisation in public discourse. The empirical analysis is based on interviews with key players in the sector and central documents. Findings - Convention theory points to several general difficulties in reaching an agreement on what is good quality and welfare. First, the authors find difficulty in how to implement new regulatory conceptualisations with dominant ways of understanding welfare within the industry. Second, the idealised images of sheep welfare of an immaterial possible world dominating public discourse have very little interaction with the real world of farms and abattoirs. Originality/value - This paper suggests that rather than addressing and handling the potential tension between the legal recognition of animal as sentient being and the economic demands of the industry, key actors keep the potentially conflicting understandings apart in different worlds of production (Salais and Storper, 1993). Nevertheless, the authors observe that interactions between possible worlds, as well as translation from one possible world to another, not only could be promising but would be fundamental to concretise improvements in the real world.","[Amilien, Virginie; Kjaernes, Unni] Oslo & Akershus Univ Coll Appl Sci, Consumpt Res Norway SIFO, Oslo, Norway",Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet),"Amilien, V (通讯作者)，Oslo & Akershus Univ Coll Appl Sci, Consumpt Res Norway SIFO, Oslo, Norway.",virginie.amilien@sifo.hioa.no,"Amilien, Virginie/S-2602-2019","Amilien, Virginie/0000-0003-3472-0383",Norwegian Research Council,Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),"The paper is based on data from several projects or sub projects in which the authors have been involved as coordinators: The main project is Sheep Welfare (2006-2010 - Sauens velferd), funded by the Norwegian Research Council.

Design/methodology/approach - A total of 354 valid questionnaires were collected to assess the measurement and structural model for reflective latent constructs using the two steps of covariance-based structural equation modelling. Findings - The research findings suggest that while travellers' nationality moderates the path between physical quality, staff behaviour and brand image on food quality satisfaction, it does not moderate the relationship between brand quality and brand awareness on food quality satisfaction. This finding further suggests that towards enhancing service quality and brand equity on food quality satisfaction and brand loyalty, managers should understand the important distinctions between international and local travellers.

Design/methodology/approach - A survey was carried out among 243 Finnish travellers. The findings are based on univariate analysis (t-test, ANOVA and regression analysis). Findings - Pre-trip behaviour to ensure holiday well-being is based on travellers' interests in food, an emotional desire for a sense of safety and a functional desire for convenience, while they collect information from the internet and guidebooks about recommended food places and local food as well as food safety and price level. Travellers' place the highest importance on dinner for their holiday well-being, especially foodies - those travellers with a keen interest in food. Breakfast is the second most important meal contributing to holiday well-being. Practical implications - These findings inform destination marketing organisations about what food dimensions they should emphasise in destination gastronomy-related marketing communication for tour operators and hotel and local restaurants about the essence of dinner and breakfast for holiday well-being. Originality/value - The study provides insights into the role of destinations' gastronomy in holiday well-being, which deserves to be studied in the current era of experiences and food interest.","[Bjork, Peter] Hanken Sch Econ, CERS Ctr Relationship Mkt & Serv Management, Dept Mkt, Vaasa, Finland; [Kauppinen-Raisanen, Hannele] Univ Vaasa, Fac Business Studies, Dept Mkt, Vaasa, Finland",Hanken School of Economics; University of Vaasa,"Kauppinen-Räisänen, H (通讯作者)，Univ Vaasa, Fac Business Studies, Dept Mkt, Vaasa, Finland.",hannele.kauppinen-raisanen@uva.fi,"Kauppinen-Räisänen, Hannele/AAC-8806-2020","Kauppinen-Raisanen, Hannele/0000-0001-5341-2533",,,,,83,24,25,1,45,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - A large panel data set is compiled to facilitate assessment of the pattern, duration and country-level determinants of global agri-food export competitiveness using a revealed comparative advantage index. Findings - The results suggest that the duration of revealed comparative advantage is heterogeneous at the agri-food product level. Long-term survival rates as revealed by the comparative advantage indices are among the highest for the Netherlands, France, Belgium, the USA, Argentina and New Zealand. The level of economic development, the share of agricultural employment, subsidies to agriculture and differentiated consumer agri-food products increase the likelihood of failure in the duration of comparative advantage, while the abundance of agricultural land and export diversification reduce that likelihood. Originality/value - The framework is conceptually innovative in how it models the likelihood of failure in the duration of comparative advantage and assesses implications. Export competitiveness is a crucial factor in long-term global farm business survival as it fosters opportunities for business prosperity on global markets.","[Bojnec, Stefan] Univ Primorska, Fac Management, Dept Econ, Koper, Slovenia; [Ferto, Imre] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Ctr Econ & Reg Studies, Budapest, Hungary",University of Primorska; Hungarian Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies,"Bojnec, S (通讯作者)，Univ Primorska, Fac Management, Dept Econ, Koper, Slovenia.",stefan.bojnec@siol.net,"Ferto, Imre/A-7371-2009; Ferto, Imre/GPS-7523-2022; Bojnec, Stefan/AFG-8313-2022; Fertő, Imre/AAQ-4634-2021","Ferto, Imre/0000-0002-3742-5964; Bojnec, Stefan/0000-0002-1270-6372;",European Community under 7th Framework Programme [312029],European Community under 7th Framework Programme,"This publication was generated as part of the COMPETE Project, Grant Agreement No. 312029 (www.compete-project.eu/), with the financial support from the European Community under the 7th Framework Programme.

Three main trends emerge from this review, and they are focused on mutual impacts, culture as a form of tourism, namely cultural tourism, and the common objective of sustainable development. In order to maximize the benefits that the relation between tourism and culture may bring to the development of destinations and communities, this study highlights a need for a change of paradigm in tourism. The paradigm of integration adopted in this study comes from the application of Mode 2 to tourism by J. Tribe in the 1990s, and reinforced through the integrative frameworks created by Pearce (2012), as an instrument to improve the research of tourism in the future. The purpose of the study is to explain the application from theory to practice of the paradigm of integration. This has been carried out through the adaptation of the dimensions of integration of sustainability, created by Dovers (2005), to a case study where the relation between tourism and culture has a strong significance for the local development, such as in the capitals of culture. Through the identification of domains, which are common to the European Capital of Culture (EcoC), the Matrix Do-Di (Domains-Dimensions) composed by 111 indicators, has been created. The matrix, which has been tested in Valletta as European Capital of Culture 2018, is a tool for the assessment of the process of development that an EcoC, an EcoC candidate, or any city, can bring to its community, starting from the integration between tourism and culture.","[Cardia, Giusy] Univ Malta, Msida, Malta; [Pulido Fernandez, J.

In this regard, without prejudice in any way to the purpose and the environmental benefits of separate waste collection, this paper will attempt to answer the question could the users who separate waste on the doorstep expect economic benefit and thereby reduce the bill for the collection, removal and disposal of waste.","[Centa, Vesna] EKO FLOR PLUS Doo, Mokrice, Croatia; [Hascek, Andreja] Croatian Financial Serv Supervisory Agcy, Zagreb, Croatia",,"Centa, V (通讯作者)，EKO FLOR PLUS Doo, Mokrice, Croatia.",vesna.centa@gmail.com; andreja.hascek@gmail.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,5,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,608,617,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500058,0

The growing interest for the introduction of new tax regulations of the financial sector was triggered by the outbreak of the financial crisis. The idea of implementation of FTT is to generate significant fiscal revenues, to properly share the cost of the crisis with the financial sector, and to reduce the possibility of a new crisis. Therefore, nine European Union countries have agreed to adopt a unified FTT along with enhanced cooperation which should come into force during 2018. The aim of this paper is to investigate the possibilities of introduction FTT in EU, with special reference to the question of the potential application in the Republic of Croatia. Preliminary analysis suggests the conclusion that the economic and fiscal effects of the introduction of FTT in Croatia could not justify the cost of its implementation. Due to the underdeveloped, illiquid and highly concentrated capital market, introduction of the new tax burden might repel potential investors. Furthermore, tax base for the Croatian capital market is very narrow, because there is no trading in derivatives, which in the initial proposal for introduction of FTT, made up the largest part of the tax base in securities trading.","[Drazenovic, Bojana Olgic; Blazic, Helena; Maradin, Dario] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Drazenovic, BO (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",bolgic@inet.hr; helena@efri.hr; dmaradin@efri.hr,"Blažić, Helena/Q-3836-2018; Maradin, Dario/Q-9380-2018; Olgic Drazenovic, Bojana/R-4177-2018","Blažić, Helena/0000-0003-4602-3665; Maradin, Dario/0000-0001-9642-6038; Olgic Drazenovic, Bojana/0000-0002-5175-7439",Croatian Science Foundation [IP-2013-11-8174]; University of Rijeka [13.02.1.2.02],Croatian Science Foundation; University of Rijeka,This work has been supported in part by the Croatian Science Foundation under the project number IP-2013-11-8174 and by the University of Rijeka under a project number 13.02.1.2.02.,,20,0,0,0,1,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,1110,1118,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500108,0

This concept is in the focus of sharing economy that is still in its development and there is no generally accepted definition. It represents a business model based on sharing, rental and exchange of goods and services whose transactions are executed on online platforms and services. It relies on the principle of openness and it influences the changes of ownership dogma according to which resources have to be own in order to use them. As such it represents a challenge for the country, especially in the field of business legal regulations and taxation because it changes the standard, classic economic model based on production, distribution, exchange and consumption. Importance of sharing economy which strongly affects certain economic sectors such as tourism and transport, is recognized by the European Union, and its largest generator are young people through the development of social entrepreneurship. This work will analyze some of the most famous representatives of this model on a global level, such as Airbnb and Uber. The main objective of this work is to provide a holistic view of the sharing economy and the possibility of its implementation (business, legal and institutional), impacting the sustainability of resources, creating opportunities that will increase employment (especially youth) and promote the practices of sharing, collaboration and cooperation on all society levels.","[Freimann, Anita; Peric, Dora] Fac Econ Osijek, Trg Ljudevita Gaja 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Freimann, A (通讯作者)，Fac Econ Osijek, Trg Ljudevita Gaja 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",afreimann@efos.hr; dorap@efos.hr,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,11,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,717,725,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500069,0

The focus is on recent endeavours by the producers of the restaurant guide to represent local conditions by acknowledging the importance of street food and hawkers. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology is that of a case study based on analysis of published material about the inaugural Singapore Michelin Guide and its consequences. Findings - The Michelin Guide confronts challenges in retaining its authority and establishing itself in new Asian locations. The Singapore edition indicates attempts at responsiveness to distinctive circumstances through the recognition of street food and hawkers, but questions can be raised about the appropriateness of their inclusion and rating. Research limitations/implications - Despite the absence of primary data, important topics about food and dining landscapes and modes of restaurant reviewing and grading are explored. A research agenda for the future is also proposed. Practical implications - Attention is given to the impacts of the guide for individual enterprises, suggesting positive and negative outcomes of endorsement. Social implications - Findings enhance understanding of the place of food and dining within societies and the influence of restaurant guides. Originality/value - The paper offers an Asian perspective on and fresh insights into the role of local food cultures as well as the meanings and functions of the Michelin Guide.","[Henderson, Joan C.] Nanyang Technol Univ, Nanyang Business Sch, Singapore, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University,"Henderson, JC (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Nanyang Business Sch, Singapore, Singapore.",ahenderson@ntu.edu.sg,,,,,,,96,20,20,1,33,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The data are obtained from own researchcarried out through the questionnaire survey, furthermore, from the EU databases, as well as from the international organisations ILO and OECD. Women are less keen than men on starting their own business and female entrepreneurs continue to be in minority. The enterprises owned by women are significantly smaller and they are less represented in capital-intensive sectors. These and other factors tend to have negative impact on their sales, profits and labour productivity.

Mobile learning has started to be an approach used for competence development, but still not widespread on the desired level. Therefore, it is important to understand which factors influence the acceptance of m-learning by employees. The study presents a proposed conceptual model that is based on the Unified Theory of Technology Acceptance (UTAUT), to examine which determinants influence the acceptance by working adults of using mobile technologies for learning. A Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) approach was utilized to validate the proposed model on the basis of data collected via a survey from 411 employees from 21 sectors, both private and public. Use of SEM allowed to measure both the existence, and the level of influence of particular variables on employees' acceptance of m-learning. The findings showed that performance expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions are the factors that directly affect working adults' acceptance of using mobile learning for competence development. Effort expectancy occurred to have only indirect impact on the acceptance of using m-learning by employees for increasing skills and knowledge. More specifically, the study proved that facilitating conditions influence on technology acceptance and the perceived effort required to use it. Such relationships do not exist in UTAUT. Therefore, the obtained study results not only explain factors influencing the acceptance of employees using m-learning but also highlight valuable implications for the general technology acceptance research field.","[Kuciapski, Michal] Univ Gdansk, Dept Business Informat, Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; University of Gdansk,"Kuciapski, M (通讯作者)，Univ Gdansk, Dept Business Informat, Gdansk, Poland.",m.kuciapski@ug.edu.pl,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,2,UNIV WROCLAW,WROCLAW,"PL UNIWERSYTECKI 1, WROCLAW, 50-137, POLAND",,,978-83-64389-64-1,ICT MAN GLO COM EC G,,,2017,,,,,,,439,453,,,,,,15,Development Studies; Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BP9OZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000570154500038,0

The study further studied the effect of power alteration on dimensions of relationship development such as dominance, trust, effect, depth, formality, and task/social orientation. People in organizations exploit technology-based tools such as e-mail to complete a variety of communication tasks. The paper offers a test and expansion of SIP regarding the effects of time on relationship development by verifying the theory within a highly social process like organizational negotiation where there is mixed-channel exploitation. This paper also offers a test of e-mail's unique characteristics and its effects on the growth of relationships in an intra-organizational environment. The hypotheses were verified by means of a dyadic data analysis technique known as the Actor-Partner Independence Model (APIM) (Cook & Kenny, 2005; Kenny et al., 2006). One hundred participants (75 dyads) contributed to the study and negotiated three times. For the first negotiation, all participants employed FTF to create a baseline relationship measure and for the next two negotiations half of the participants employed e-mail and the other half FTF. For the last two negotiations, a power difference was also presented so that in half of the dyads in each group, the seller had greater power than the buyer. The study described the results in three main areas regarding negotiation and computer-mediated communication, namely: (1) interpersonal relationships progress over lean media like e-mail; (2) the features of e-mail influence relationship development when likened to FTF; and (3) the preference of exploiting e- mail for future negotiations is shaped by former e-mail negotiation experience with one's partner, computer-mediated communication comfort, and the level of supremacy one's partner displays in e-mail negotiations. Regarding interpersonal relationships and negotiation, the study recommends that people should study how to manage their interpersonal relationships via email since it can be a valuable tool for managing one's persona. Bargaining power and bargaining roles were only of restricted influence on the expansion of interpersonal relationships when e-mail was employed to negotiate.","[Kuzio, Anna; Sharp, Richard] Univ Zielona Gora, Zielona Gora, Poland",University of Zielona Gora,"Kuzio, A (通讯作者)，Univ Zielona Gora, Zielona Gora, Poland.",a.kuzio@in.uz.zgora.pl; r.sharp@in.uz.zgora.pl,"Kuzio, Anna/AAJ-3726-2021",,,,,,5,0,0,0,1,UNIV WROCLAW,WROCLAW,"PL UNIWERSYTECKI 1, WROCLAW, 50-137, POLAND",,,978-83-64389-64-1,ICT MAN GLO COM EC G,,,2017,,,,,,,470,471,,,,,,2,Development Studies; Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BP9OZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000570154500041,0

The use of geographical origin labels as quality signals to overcome asymmetric information problem plays an important role. The purpose of this paper is to compare consumers' perception and willingness to pay (WTP) for different levels of geographic origin labels to provide insights to the strategic use of origin labels in emerging markets. Design/methodology/approach - A consumer survey on geographic labeling for imported dairy products was carried out in Beijing, China in May 2015. Under the products of European Union (EU) range, the authors used  product of Ireland as a case study for the country-specific origin label. Information on consumer demographic, dairy consumption, safety perceptions, knowledge on Ireland and Irish products, as well as WTP for different geographic labeling and product attributes were collected from 307 face-to-face interviews. WTP was elicited using double-bounded contingent valuation method, and estimated with maximum log-likelihood function. Findings - The authors found that consumers are willing to pay premium prices for both of these geographical origin indicators, but the EU label had slightly higher WTP results. However, the controversial situation is that although the EU label has a better chance than the country-specific label in signaling premium quality to Chinese consumers, EU labeling at its best signals an average quality across the EU counties. For premium products with above average quality, using generic EU labeling has a potential drawback to the establishment of product differentiation. Originality/value - This study is the first to evaluate Chinese consumers' WTP for EU generic origin label for dairy products in comparison to country-specific origin label. Findings of the study have immediate policy and marketing implications in emerging markets.","[Li, Chenguang; Fu, Jiangyuan] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Dublin, Ireland; [Bai, Junfei] China Agr Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Gao, Zhifeng] Univ Florida, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",University College Dublin; China Agricultural University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Li, CG (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Dublin, Ireland.",chenguang.li@ucd.ie,"fu, jiangyuan/AAK-5153-2021; Gao, Zhifeng/AFD-7759-2022","Gao, Zhifeng/0000-0003-2984-8278",Science Foundation Ireland International Strategic Cooperation Award (SFI-ISCA) Program; Beijing Social Science Foundation [15JGA011]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71273009],Science Foundation Ireland International Strategic Cooperation Award (SFI-ISCA) Program(Science Foundation Ireland); Beijing Social Science Foundation; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors want to thank for the joint funding support from Science Foundation Ireland International Strategic Cooperation Award (SFI-ISCA) Program, the Beijing Social Science Foundation (15JGA011), and National Natural Science Foundation of China (71273009).

Although the separation of government and enterprise gives the self-management and self-operation of China Railway Corporation more liberation, the heavy debt burden and the sustained loss caused by the public welfare transportation expenditure severely restrict the rapid and sustainable development of China Railway Corporation. The solutions of these issues still need to be supported by the financial sector for railway public transport subsidies and railway construction funds.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors studied 42,750 distance learning Open University adults aged 23-96 years in 2013 residing nationwide and participating in an ongoing community-based prospective cohort study. The authors used multivariable logistic regression to relate nutrition label experiences (read, good understand, frequent use), socio-demographic factors, and consumption of four transitional foods. These foods included unhealthy instant foods, carbonated soft drinks, and sweet drinks, or healthy milk. Findings - Overall, two-thirds reported good understanding and frequent use of nutrition labels. Unhealthy transition-indicator processed foods were frequently consumed: instant foods (7 per cent), (carbonated) soft drinks (15 per cent), and sweet drinks (41 per cent). Frequent users of nutrition labels (e.g. females, older persons, professionals) were less likely to consume unhealthy indicator foods. Those with the most positive overall nutrition label experience (read + good understanding + frequent use) had the best indicator food profiles: instant foods (odds ratio (OR) 0.63; 95% CI, 0.56-0.70); soft drinks (OR 0.56; 95% CI, 0.52-0.61); sweet drinks (OR 0.79; 95% CI, 0.74-0.85); milk (OR 1.87; 95% CI, 1.74-2.00).

The complexity and heterogeneity of innovation, however, turn the one-fits-all approach questionable and unveil the need to address several and different settings and industries. The purpose of this paper is to address this demand by mapping the themes covered in the research under the collaborative innovation umbrella having specifically the food and drink sector as a context. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on secondary data sources, namely, a literature review of open innovation in the food and beverage (F&B) sector. Findings - This paper builds upon a framework to classify the extant research in open innovation in the food industry and position the advancements in comparison to the general literature in the field. The categorization of the publications shows that topics like the role of networks, innovation systems, user-innovation and research and development alliances have attracted mostly attention so far, but there is still a demand for deeper and more comprehensive investigations. The field would also profit from inquiries that deal with mindset and managerial capabilities, cross-industry partnerships, converging value chains and globalization of innovation, among others. Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, this is among the first papers to map research topics and research designs that have been covered to date on the field of open and collaborative innovation in the F&B industry.

Questions is: why students behave unethically and what factors influence on their unethical behaviour. In this research authors used theory of planned behaviour to predict intentions of students' unethical behaviour. The theory of planned behaviour explains how to predict planned and deliberate behaviour. For this purpose, it is necessary to investigate the attitudes towards specific behaviour, subjective norms (beliefs about how others look at this behaviour) and perceived behavioural control toward this behaviour. Knowledge of these three elements enables to predict the intentions of behaviour, which are highly correlated with the actual behaviour. Based on this, the goal of this paper is to validate the use of a modified Theory of Planned Behaviour for predicting students' unethical behaviour observing the influence of subjective norms on students' intentions for engaging in unethical behaviour in higher education. The study was conducted through a questionnaire among students of undergraduate and graduate studies. In data analysis, descriptive statistics analyse of variance (ANOVA), regression analysis and correlation analysis were used. Research results show statistically significant positive correlation between subjective norms (the influence of family and friends) and the student's intentions of engaging in unethical behaviour. Positive correlations are shown between subjective norms (family) and students' mother's and father's level of education and between subjective norms (friends) and students' year of study. Negative correlation is shown between both groups of subjective norms and students class attendance. Results from regression analysis reveal significant positive relationship between student's intentions of unethical behaviour in higher education and subjective norms relating to the impact of family and friends of respondents. Implications of research findings are discussed in the paper.","[Stimac, Helena; Pap, Ana; Milkovic, Anamaria] Fac Econ Osijek, Trg Ljudevita Gaja 7, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Stimac, H (通讯作者)，Fac Econ Osijek, Trg Ljudevita Gaja 7, Osijek, Croatia.",shelena@efos.hr; anapap@efos.hr; anamaria.milkovic@gmail.com,"Pap, Ana/X-4796-2019; Štimac, Helena/AAP-1248-2021; Pap, Ana/AAA-6356-2020","Pap, Ana/0000-0003-4927-5518; Štimac, Helena/0000-0003-3699-2112;",,,,,20,2,2,2,13,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,433,441,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500041,0

Important factors that influence light transmission are the structure of the greenhouse (construction elements, orientation, roof slope, symmetrical or asymmetrical design) and the greenhouse roof material (base material, coating(s), diffuse or clear). A project was started to maximize light transmission during winter by optimizing these factors. In the first phase of the project, a simulation model was used to analyze a number of promising new concepts. To validate the simulation model, a practical experiment with scale models in the open field was carried out. During winter, the transmission of these scale models was measured. Despite a number of factors that could not be controlled or modelled, such as rain and condensation, in general there was a good match between measured and calculated values. As an overall conclusion, the simulation model showed no consistent differences from the measurements. An asymmetric cover (saw tooth) in combination with diffuse glass did not contribute significantly to light transmission in comparison with a Venlo type cover. This supported the decisions made during the design of the final full-scale demonstration greenhouse in the follow-up project.","[Swinkels, G. L. A. M.; Kempkes, F. L.

The story evolves around the actions, tensions, and entanglement of two publics-the traditionalist and the environmentalist - and presents macroeconomic modelling as an instrument for issue articulation and the construction of energy policy imaginaries. The article concludes that macroeconomic modelling is an effective instrument for articulating the economic realities of energy policy, and that economic growth plays a key role in these articulations by determining the basic preconditions for collective imaginaries of energy system futures.

This synthetic approach raises an important question that whether the results from these two methods are always consistent in analyzing the same data. In this paper, we provide the theoretical justification that both the nonparametric Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon test and the score test of the proportional odds model depends on the proportion of pairs in which the response from one group is higher than that in another group and are equivalent.

Design/methodology/approach - The household survey data are drawn from the annual Urban Household Survey in a Chinese province from 2007 to 2009 by applying a three-stage budgeting approach with zero consumption. Findings - The major findings show that fluid milk is the most popular dairy product among urban households in Guangdong province, China. Demand for fresh milk is price elastic with the highest value being -1.043, indicating that price-cutting promotion programs could be carried out by dairy enterprises to increase dairy consumption. With improvements in the living standards, the demand for dairy will lead to an expansion in the size of the dairy market and will simultaneously open up new development opportunities for dairy enterprises.

We urgently need to assess human impacts on ecosystems which cause changes in structural feedbacks producing large, hard to reverse changes in state and functioning. System dynamics has proven to be a useful and versatile methodology for modelling complex systems given the comparative ease with which feedback loops can be modelled. However, a common issue arises when models become too large and structurally complex to understand the causal drivers of system behaviour. There is a need for an intermediate level of analysis capable of identifying causal driving structures and dynamics, regardless of model complexity. This study investigates Loop Eigenvalue Elasticity Analysis, a structural analysis technique commonly used in business and economic system dynamics models, and evaluates its utility for identifying feedback loop structures responsible for behavioural changes in complex ecological systems. The approach is demonstrated by analysing a simple lake system model that has been extensively studied in the past for its capacity to undertake critical transitions between alternative stable states. We show how the dominance of feedback loops can be tracked through time building influence over the system's behaviour decades prior to the actual collapse in the system.

While the cost of defaulting in a domestic financial system has been recognised as a main motive for repayment, the factors that cause sovereign states to refrain from debt repudiation are not fully understood. This article investigates the reasons behind the repayment decision and weak negotiating position of the Mexican government following the 1982 debt crisis. It shows that leading commercial banks had considerable amounts of external loans in their books, and that Mexican policymakers lacked the foreign exchange access they needed to secure the stability of the domestic banking system. The high exposure of domestic banks to Mexican debt and their heightened dependence on foreign capital worked as mechanisms that allowed international creditors to enforce their claims and deterred Mexico from declaring a unilateral default.","[Alvarez, Sebastian] Univ Geneva, Paul Bairoch Inst Econ Hist, Geneva, Switzerland",University of Geneva,"Alvarez, S (通讯作者)，Univ Geneva, Paul Bairoch Inst Econ Hist, Geneva, Switzerland.",sebastian.alvar-ez@unige.ch,,"Alvarez, Sebastian/0000-0003-1077-9882","H2020-EU.3.6-SOCIETAL CHALLENGES-Europe in a Changing World-Inclusive, Innovative and Reflective Societies [649307]; HERA Joint Research Programme; AHRC; AKA; PT-DLR; CAS; DASTI; ETAG; FCT; FNR; F.R.S.-FNRS; FWF; HAZU; IRC; LMT; MIZS; MINECO; NCN; NOW; RANNIS; RCN; SNF; VIAA; VR; European Community FP7 2016-2019, under the Socio-economic Sciences and Humanities programme","H2020-EU.3.6-SOCIETAL CHALLENGES-Europe in a Changing World-Inclusive, Innovative and Reflective Societies; HERA Joint Research Programme; AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); AKA; PT-DLR; CAS(Chinese Academy of Sciences); DASTI; ETAG; FCT(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FNR(Luxembourg National Research Fund); F.R.S.-FNRS(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS); FWF(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); HAZU; IRC(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology); LMT; MIZS; MINECO(Spanish Government); NCN; NOW; RANNIS; RCN; SNF; VIAA; VR(Swedish Research Council); European Community FP7 2016-2019, under the Socio-economic Sciences and Humanities programme","This project has received funding from the H2020-EU.3.6-SOCIETAL CHALLENGES-Europe in a Changing World-Inclusive, Innovative and Reflective Societies under grant agreement no. 649307.

In view of the growing popularity of the consumption-based emission accounting system in climate policy studies, analyzing the emission inequality from the consumption perspective can help policymakers design emission abatement scenarios that are fairer to all parties. Using a new approach based on the Theil index and the index decomposition analysis (IDA) technique, this paper examines global per capita consumption-based emission inequality in 1995-2009. The sources and determinants of both the status and evolution of the emission inequality are quantified. The empirical results show that the global emission inequality was sourced mainly from the emerging economies, particularly China and India. The global inequality decreased at an accelerating rate during the period studied. The narrowing disparity among countries in per capita consumption level drove, while the expanding disparity in consumption-based emission intensity largely hindered, the inequality reduction. Comparing the consumption-based emission inequality with that under the production-based principle reveals that the latter partly masked the inequality in the distribution of global CO2 emissions through production outsourcing. More detailed results and discussions are presented.","[Wang, H.; Zhou, P.] China Univ Petr, Sch Econ & Management, Qingdao 266580, Peoples R China; China Univ Petr, Inst Energy Econ & Policy, Qingdao 266580, Peoples R China",China University of Petroleum; China University of Petroleum,"Wang, H; Zhou, P (通讯作者)，China Univ Petr, Sch Econ & Management, Qingdao 266580, Peoples R China.",wh@upc.edu.cn; pzhou@upc.edu.cn,"Zhou, Peng/A-6527-2012","Zhou, Peng/0000-0003-4726-3054","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71804189, 71625005, 71573119, 71573186]; MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences [18YJC630176]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [18CX040018]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"We are grateful to the anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments on an earlier version of the paper.

In particular, precipitation is a key climatic factor for agriculture in this semi-arid region. Locality and diversity characterize the Sahel's climatic and economic system, with the coupled climate-economic patterns exhibiting substantial differences from country to country. Large-scale atmospheric patterns - like the El Nifio-Southern Oscillation and its quasi-biennial and quasi-quadrennial oscillatory modes - have quite limited influence on the economies, while more location-specific rainfall patterns play an important role.","[Garnot, Vivien Sainte Fare; Ghil, Michael] Ecole Normale Super, Geosci Dept, CNRS, 24 Rue Lhomond, F-75005 Paris, France; [Garnot, Vivien Sainte Fare; Ghil, Michael] Ecole Normale Super, Lab Meteorol Dynam, CNRS, 24 Rue Lhomond, F-75005 Paris, France; [Garnot, Vivien Sainte Fare; Ghil, Michael] Ecole Normale Super, IPSL, 24 Rue Lhomond, F-75005 Paris, France; [Garnot, Vivien Sainte Fare; Ghil, Michael] PSL Res Univ, 24 Rue Lhomond, F-75005 Paris, France; [Groth, Andreas; Ghil, Michael] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA USA",Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); Sorbonne Universite; Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); Universite Paris Cite; Universite PSL; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Garnot, VSF (通讯作者)，Ecole Normale Super, Geosci Dept, CNRS, 24 Rue Lhomond, F-75005 Paris, France.;Garnot, VSF (通讯作者)，Ecole Normale Super, Lab Meteorol Dynam, CNRS, 24 Rue Lhomond, F-75005 Paris, France.;Garnot, VSF (通讯作者)，Ecole Normale Super, IPSL, 24 Rue Lhomond, F-75005 Paris, France.;Garnot, VSF (通讯作者)，PSL Res Univ, 24 Rue Lhomond, F-75005 Paris, France.",vivien.sainte-fare-garnot@polytechnique.edu,"Groth, Andreas/I-5926-2019; Ghil, Michael/O-1433-2019","Groth, Andreas/0000-0002-6690-9327; Ghil, Michael/0000-0001-5177-7133; Sainte Fare Garnot, Vivien/0000-0002-5639-119X",,,,,39,5,5,2,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

It shows that the colonial era opened up new labour opportunities for these African converts, enabling them to take large steps up the social ladder regardless of their social origin. Contrary to the widespread belief that British indirect rule perpetuated the power of African political elites (chiefs), this article shows that a remarkably fluid colonial labour economy actually undermined their social advantages. Sons of chiefs gradually lost their high social-status monopoly to a new, commercially orientated, and well-educated class of Anglican Ugandans, who mostly came from non-elite and sometimes even lower-class backgrounds. The study also documents that the colonial administration and the Anglican mission functioned as key steps on the ladder to upward mobility. Mission education helped provide the skills and social reference needed to climb the ladder in exchange for compliance with the laws of the Anglican Church. These social mobility patterns persisted throughout the post-colonial era, despite rising levels of informal labour during Idi Amin's dictatorship.","[zu Selhausen, Felix Meier] Univ Sussex, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [van Leeuwen, Marco H.

I document this using two types of evidence-use of econometric language in articles appearing in academic journals of economic history and economics; and publication histories of successive cohorts of Ph.D.s in the first decade since receiving the doctorate. Over time, economic history became more like economics in its use of econometrics and in the likelihood of scholars publishing in economics, as opposed to, say, economic history journals. But the pace of change was slower in economic history than in labor economics, another subfield of economics that underwent profound intellectual change in the 1950s and 1960s, and there was also a structural break evident for post-2000 Ph.D. cohorts. To account for these features of the data, I sketch a simple, overlapping generations model of the academic labor market in which junior scholars have to convince senior scholars of the merits of their work in order to gain tenure. I argue that the early cliometricians-most notably, Robert Fogel and Douglass North-conceived of a scholarly identity for economic history that kept the field distinct from economics proper in various ways, until after 2000 when their influence had waned.","[Margo, Robert A.] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University,"Margo, RA (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",margora@bu.edu,"Margo, Robert/GZH-1183-2022","Margo, Robert/0000-0003-2709-7490",,,,,26,22,23,2,18,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,SEP,2018,12.0,3,,,,,377,406,,10.1007/s11698-018-0170-8,0.0,,,30,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,GR4XE,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000442623500001,0

A sensitive treatment of African realities in the evaluation of European colonial legacies and a critical stance towards the use of new sources and approaches is crucial. In this article, we engage with a recent article by Meier zu Selhausen and Weisdorf to show how selection biases in, and Eurocentric interpretations of, parish registers have provoked an overly optimistic account of European influences on the educational and occupational opportunities of African men and women. We confront their dataset, drawn from the marriage registers of the Anglican Cathedral in Kampala, with Uganda's 1991 census, and show that trends in the literacy and numeracy of men and women born in Kampala lagged half a century behind those who wedded in Namirembe Cathedral. We run a regression analysis showing that access to schooling during the colonial era was unequal along lines of gender and ethnicity. We foreground the role of Africans in the spread of education, and we argue that European influences were not just diffusive but also divisive, and that gender inequality was reconfigured rather than eliminated under colonial rule.","[De Haas, Michiel; Frankema, Ewout] Wageningen Univ, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"De Haas, M (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Wageningen, Netherlands.",michiel.dehaas@wur.nl,"de Haas, Michiel/ABB-4070-2020; frankema, ewout/B-4186-2015","de Haas, Michiel/0000-0002-0830-7803;",European Research Council under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (ERC) [313114]; European Research Council (ERC) [313114] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (ERC); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We thank Jutta Bolt, Selin Dilli, Dacil Juif, Leigh Gardner, Doreen Kembabazi, Elise van Nederveen Meerkerk, Pieter Woltjer, and three anonymous referees for valuable input.

We explore whether the individual extraction decision varies according to three non-binding recommended extraction levels originating from (1) a democratic process, (2) a group leader or (3) an external source. For the sample as a whole, we find a strong effect of the external treatment, with a weaker effect of the democratic treatment and no effect of the leadership treatment. Closer inspection reveals that the results are driven by one of the three sites where the experiment was conducted - that having the highest levels of ethnic and religious diversity. There we find that democratic decision-making as well as information originating from outside the community reduces the extraction level, a result that is robust to regressions controlling for individual and community attributes. The absence of effects in two of the three sites suggests that a non-binding recommendation may often be insufficient in promoting the cooperative behavior that underpins contemporary approaches to managing coral reefs.","[Gallier, Carlo] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, L7 1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany; [Langbein, Joerg; Vance, Colin] RWI Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Essen, Germany; [Vance, Colin] Jacobs Univ Bremen, Bremen, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Jacobs University,"Gallier, C (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, L7 1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany.",gallier@zew.de,,"Gallier, Carlo/0000-0001-9098-1807","Leibniz Association [SAW-2014-ZMT-1 317]; special grant (Sondertatbestand) from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy; Ministry of Innovation, Science, and Research of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia","Leibniz Association; special grant (Sondertatbestand) from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy; Ministry of Innovation, Science, and Research of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia","We thank Maximilian Huppertz and Sophie Wannemacher for excellent research assistance and are grateful for valuable comments by Manuel Frondel, Till Requate, Achim Schluter, Christoph M.

Using the case of Joseon, as Korea was known before being colonized by Japan in 1910, we investigate how the civil exam system and scholarly traditions, as well as the provision of public schools under Japanese colonial rule, influenced levels of literacy in the colony. We introduce novel data from Joseon's historical court examination archives, colonial education records, and censuses dating back to 1930. Our findings suggest that the spread of Korean literacy during the early colonial period was strongly correlated with the historical presence of civil exam passers from the Joseon Dynasty.

The Dystopian Schumpeter meeting Keynes (DSK) model is composed of heterogeneous firms belonging to capital-good, consumption-good and energy sectors. Production and energy generation lead to greenhouse gas emissions, which affect temperature dynamics. Climate damages are modelled at the individual level as stochastic shocks hitting workers' labour productivity, energy efficiency, capital stock and inventories of firms. In that, aggregate damages emerge from the aggregation of losses suffered by heterogeneous, interacting and boundedly rational agents. The model is run focusing on a business-as-usual carbon-intensive scenario consistent with a Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. We find that the DSK model is able to account for a wide ensemble of micro- and macro-empirical regularities concerning both economic and climate dynamics. Simulation experiments show a substantial lack of isomorphism between the effects of micro- and macro-level shocks, as it is typical in complex system models. In particular, different types of shocks have heterogeneous impact on output growth, unemployment rate, and the likelihood of economic crises, pointing to the importance of the different economic channel affected by the shock. Overall, we report much larger climate damages than those projected by standard IAMs under comparable scenarios, suggesting possible shifts in the growth dynamics, from a self-sustained pattern to stagnation and high volatility, and the need of urgent policy interventions.","[Lamperti, F.; Dosi, G.; Roventini, A.] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, Piazza Martiri Liberal 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy; [Napoletano, M.] SKEMA Business Sch, OFCE, Nice, France; [Napoletano, M.] Univ Cote Azur, Nice, France; [Roventini, A.] OFCE, Nice, France; [Sapio, A.] Parthenope Univ Naples, Naples, Italy",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; Universite Cote d'Azur; SKEMA Business School; Universite Cote d'Azur; Parthenope University Naples,"Lamperti, F (通讯作者)，Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, Piazza Martiri Liberal 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy.",f.lamperti@sssup.it; g.dosi@santannapisa.it; mauro.napoletano@sciencespo.fr; a.roventini@santannapisa.it; alessandro.sapio@uniparthenope.it,"ROVENTINI, Andrea/N-4699-2019; Roventini, Andrea/K-3314-2017","ROVENTINI, Andrea/0000-0001-5518-3084; Roventini, Andrea/0000-0001-5518-3084; Napoletano, Mauro/0000-0002-8128-6674; SAPIO, Alessandro/0000-0002-1221-5549; Lamperti, Francesco/0000-0003-4862-646X","European Union [603416, 640772, 649186]; Parthenope University of Naples Bando di sostegno alla ricerca individuale per it triennio 2015-2017, annualita 2016","European Union(European Union (EU)); Parthenope University of Naples Bando di sostegno alla ricerca individuale per it triennio 2015-2017, annualita 2016","FL, GD, AR and AS acknowledge financial support from the European Union FP7 grant agreement No. 603416 - Project IMPRESSIONS.

The analysis is based on the stated preference approach with an innovative choice experiment. The design includes questions to quantify both the direct and indirect rebounds. A series of easy discrete possible changes have been suggested to prime the respondents for deciding on potential actions impacting their heating service demand. Responses to these qualitative choices are moreover used to cross-validate the quantitative results. Overall, we find relatively low direct rebound effects. However, after accounting for the indirect rebound calculated using energy embodied in goods and services purchased by re-spending initial savings, we estimate an average total rebound of about one third. The econometric analysis points to substantial variations across individuals that are partly explained by observed characteristics. The results are consistent with the conjunction that heating is a basic need which calls for little rebound in high-income groups.","[Hediger, Cecile; Farsi, Mehdi; Weber, Sylvain] Univ Neuchatel, Inst Econ Res, Neuchatel, Switzerland",University of Neuchatel,"Hediger, C (通讯作者)，Univ Neuchatel, Inst Econ Res, Neuchatel, Switzerland.",cecile.hediger@unine.ch,"Weber, Sylvain/B-6305-2018","Weber, Sylvain/0000-0002-1598-0705; Farsi, Mehdi/0000-0001-6748-5207",Swiss National Science Foundation [100018-144310]; Swiss Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [100018_144310] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF),Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"This research is supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation Grant 100018-144310.

We present evidence for surprisingly constant levels of social mobility over the period 1550-1749, despite huge structural changes. Examining regional differences, we show that the North of England exhibited higher rates of social mobility than the South. We link this to the hypothesis that historically high levels of social mobility can lead to a culture of non-acceptance of redistribution and welfare provision. Taking advantage of the fact that welfare provision was determined at the local level at the time, we are able to compare social mobility rates and welfare spending within a single country. Consistent with the hypothesis, we find evidence for historically higher levels of social mobility as well as lower welfare spending and less acceptance of redistribution in the North.","[Boberg-Fazlic, Nina; Sharp, Paul] Univ Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark,"Sharp, P (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.",pauls@sam.sdu.dk,"Boberg-Fazlic, Nina/AAJ-8685-2021; Sharp, Paul/C-1027-2019","Boberg-Fazlic, Nina/0000-0002-9536-2332; Sharp, Paul/0000-0003-0679-0106",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,54,6,6,0,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,MAY,2018,12.0,2,,,,,251,276,,10.1007/s11698-017-0160-2,0.0,,,26,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,GD3BD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430376700003,0

Some specific features of the specialization in care, such as the care provisions for couples, point towards an underlying change in these relationships, which may have resulted from a combination of factors such as neolocality, high marriage ages for both men and women, and, related to this, the small spousal age gap and large numbers of singles. In the typical nuclear household society of early modern Holland, even when children lived close enough and were financially capable to provide help, parents often still relied on extra-familial elderly care provisions. This article also argues that this practice was embedded in a persistent moral culture accentuating independence, agency, self-help, investment in the younger generation, and community, instead of putting family responsibilities first.","[Boele, Anita; de Moor, Tine] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Boele, A (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands.",,,"De Moor, Tine/0000-0002-9462-6404",Dutch Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [VIDI - de Moor - 276-53-008],Dutch Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"This article is part of the VIDI-project 'Nature or nature?

With climate change, increasing frequency of extreme heat events and in some areas, episodic drought and flooding, present new challenges for urban areas. Green infrastructure holds potential as a cost-effective means of providing microclimate cooling and stormwater diversion. Further, green open spaces when combined with the provision of equipment and facilities have the potential to promote physical and emotional well-being. However successful implementation may be predicated on co-ordinated efforts of multiple agencies. The Institutional Analysis and Development framework developed by Crawford and Ostrom is used in a case study to understand the institutional impediments, transaction costs and gaps in responsibility associated with the delivery of green infrastructure. Lessons learned are potentially transferable to other urban settings. Our analysis reveals areas of high transaction costs as well as a gap in the polycentric decision-making of agencies. The local government council is concerned with the well-being of its residents but has limited financial capacity. None of the agencies who deliver green infrastructure have responsibility for facilitating the indirect or preventative health benefits. Thus, a co-ordination problem among agencies can lead to suboptimal investments in green infrastructure.","[Mekala, Gayathri Devi] Univ Melbourne, Parkville Campus, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [MacDonald, Darla Hatton] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Sch Business & Econ, Private Bag 84, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",University of Melbourne; University of Tasmania,"MacDonald, DH (通讯作者)，Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Sch Business & Econ, Private Bag 84, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",Gayathri.Mekala@unimelb.edu.au; Darla.HattonMacDonald@utas.edu.au,"; Hatton MacDonald, Darla/D-3344-2011","Mekala, Gayathri Devi/0000-0002-9236-0227; Hatton MacDonald, Darla/0000-0003-1374-9128",Australian Commonwealth; CSIRO; Victoria University Research Development Grant Scheme,Australian Commonwealth; CSIRO(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)); Victoria University Research Development Grant Scheme,"Support provided by the Australian Commonwealth-funded Collaborative Research Network Program, the CSIRO and Victoria University Research Development Grant Scheme.",,55,15,17,2,62,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

This has largely been interpreted as maximising the net economic yield (MEY) in fisheries. More recently, the influence of reducing yields to achieve MEY on prices and the transfer of consumer surplus to producers has been raised as a potential issue, Achieving fishery MEY may result in a reduction in net economic returns in a broader sense if the loss to consumers exceeds the gain to the industry. The transfer of consumer surplus to producers is also potentially undesirable, and may result in a dead weight loss. Similarly, the disutility associated with bycatch in fisheries may also affect our interpretation of optimal yields if non monetary values are considered. These externalities are generally not considered in determining MEY. In this paper, we develop a generic multispecies bioeconomic model that is used to estimate the impact of broadening the consideration of net economic returns to include changes in consumer surplus as well as the inclusion of non market values associated with bycatch. We find that traditional measures of MEY may not achieve maximum returns to society overall if these externalities exist.","[Pascoe, Sean; Hutton, Trevor] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, POB 2583, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Hoshino, Eriko] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, 1 Castray Esplanade, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Pascoe, S (通讯作者)，CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, POB 2583, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",sean.pascoe@csiro.au; trevor.hutton@csiro.au; eriko.hoshino@csiro.au,"Pascoe, Sean/D-9710-2011; Hoshino, Eriko/N-7557-2013","Hoshino, Eriko/0000-0001-7110-4251",Fisheries Research and Development Corporation [2015-202]; CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere,Fisheries Research and Development Corporation; CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere,The research was supported by the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation (project 2015-202) and CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere.

Overemphasis on the factors of a country's relative power, riparian position, and technological potential to exploit the resource has led to assumptions that the non-hegemon(s) is often unable to achieve their own positive outcomes and that the outcomes of interactions between hegemons and non-hegemons are predictable and detrimental. However, it appears that there are many examples that run counter to the power narrative that employs these factors. This study argues that this overemphasis neglects hegemonic vulnerabilities, which, when included with hegemonic capacities, are much more instructive in explaining transboundary water dynamics. The sources of the weakness of the strong of the alleged hegemon originates from several sources, including interlinkages between water and non-water issues, internal and external expectations, and consideration of whether the water-related issue at hand is crucial to each party's survival or whether the party has the luxury to survive the outcome of the resolution. These factors allow for non-hegemons to achieve more favorable outcomes and, when incorporated in analysis, provide a fuller picture of the true power balance in each transboundary water interaction. We therefore call for a reconceptualization of power dynamics in transboundary waters that accounts for structural weaknesses present within all parties.","[Petersen-Perlman, Jacob D.] Univ Arizona, Water Resources Res Ctr, 350 N Campbell Ave, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA; [Fischhendler, Itay] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Geog, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel",University of Arizona; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Petersen-Perlman, JD (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, Water Resources Res Ctr, 350 N Campbell Ave, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA.",Jacob.petersen@mail.huji.ac.il,"Petersen-Perlman, Jacob/AAG-2882-2019; Petersen-Perlman, Jacob/AGE-1823-2022","Petersen-Perlman, Jacob/0000-0001-9468-3567",Ken Alberman Fellowship,Ken Alberman Fellowship,"The authors are grateful to Samer Alatout, Shlomi Dinar, Gabriel Eckstein, Ashok Swain, and Erika Weinthal for their insightful feedback and suggestions.

The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of wild fauna and flora (CITES) restricts commercial trade in endangered species, however, enforcement of CITES trade restrictions is problematic due to errors in species identification. Emerging authenticity technologies, such as the International Barcode of Life (IBOL), can strengthen the enforcement of commercial trade restrictions in endangered species. Using a case study of an endangered species of Brazilian rosewood (Dalbergia nigra), the paper develops a graphical partial equilibrium trade model to explore three scenarios: adoption of IBOL authenticity technology by a major importing country, multilateral adoption, and adoption by an exporting country. The analysis suggests that a threat of multilateral testing for the authenticity of imported rosewood could significantly reduce cross border commercial trade in the endangered species. Further, upstream testing and certification of authenticity in an exporting country could increase importers' confidence and the demand for legally harvested certified rosewood. The results suggest that emerging technologies have the potential to address authenticity issues in international markets, reduce quality uncertainty, and act as a complement to regulatory enforcement under CITES.","[Ugochukwu, Albert I.; Phillips, Peter W.

We identify several important relationships in bilateral carbon flows, including China-EU, China-USA, Russia-EU, and China-Japan, which make China and Russia the largest carbon exporters and the EU and the USA the largest carbon importers. A further investigation of the sectors contributing to carbon flows shows that exports from the mineral, chemicals, metals, oil, transport, and other manufacturing sectors are the main cause of carbon outflows, while the intermediate inputs of the electricity and transport sectors are the primary cause of carbon outflows due to export production. Moreover, we propose an intensity-based shared responsibility strategy and find that China should take the most responsibility because it is responsible for nearly 32% of all embodied emissions, due to its less efficient and high carbon-intensive technologies. The USA and the EU follow China, with shares of 13.2% and 11.3%, respectively, owing to their heavy consumption. As a result, China and the USA contribute 31.8% and 20.6%, respectively, of the total global emissions, outweighing the aggregated contribution from all other countries/regions.","[Zhu, Yongbin; Wu, Jing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci & Dev, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Yongbin; Wu, Jing] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Shi, Yajuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Shi, Yajuan] Henan Univ Technol, Zhengzhou 450001, Henan, Peoples R China; [Wu, Leying] Henan Univ, Kaifeng 475001, Peoples R China; [Xiong, Wen] Beijing Technol & Business Univ, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Henan University of Technology; Henan University; Beijing Technology & Business University","Wu, J (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci & Dev, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",zhuyongbin@casipm.ac.cn; wujing@casipm.ac.cn,"Xiong, Wenbin/GQP-8667-2022",,"National Basic Research Program of China [2016YFA0602700, 2012CB955804]; National Social Science Foundation of China [14CGJ025]; National Science Foundation of China [41201594]",National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China [grant number 2016YFA0602700, 2012CB955804]; the National Social Science Foundation of China [grant number 14CGJ025]; and the National Science Foundation of China [grant number 41201594].",,44,63,66,17,119,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Exploiting data on corvee systems in French Africa, this is the first article to make these in-kind taxes visible by estimating a lower bound of how much they augmented governments' revenue base.

This article focuses specifically on Anglo-American trade, which was the largest bilateral flow of trade during the first era of globalization, and finds that tariffs were the sole intertemporal determinant of Anglo-American trade costs. However, the determinacy of tariffs for Anglo-American trade costs only becomes apparent when the tariff variable incorporates a measure of the bilateral American tariff toward Britain, which this article reconstructs. The article concludes by claiming that Anglo-American trade represents a major qualification to any emerging consensus that foreign tariffs were of minor significance to the trade of late nineteenth-century Britain.","[Varian, Brian D.] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Varian, BD (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England.",b.varian@lse.ac.uk,,"Varian, Brian/0000-0001-6369-591X",,,,,33,4,4,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Thus, this paper aims to test the application of POT as an exploitation of start-up financing of SMEs in Libya. Design/Methodology/Approach: The conclusions were drawn from desk research. A comprehensive literature search of published academic, peer reviewed professional literature using a variety of databases including journal articles, conference papers and thesis, both published and unpublished, was conducted. The main sources was the Internet. Findings: By reviewing the available literature on access to finance by SMEs in Libya, the Pecking Order Theory (POT) was supported. Research limitations: There are a number of stages in the SME life cycle. SMEs financing needs will vary depending on a number of variables, including the stage of development of a business. This study is limited to start-up stage. Moreover, The main limitation of the literature review, as a study methodology, is that it relies on information which has already been researched (secondary information). Thus, an empirical study is needed to provide more support to findings of this study. Originality/Value: This is the first review of this area and thus should help intending and existing scholars.

Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). Data were gathered in 2015 and 2016 via a quantitative written survey of 135 pedestrians in a structured questionnaire in Naumburg, East Germany. The authors use the variance-based, partial least squares subfamily of structural equation models for the analysis, allowing the authors to investigate the causes of the formation of attitudes, social norms and perceived behavioural control (PBC) related to buying from farm shops. Findings - Seen through the TPB prism, the most powerful explanatory construct in the model is PBC. This is followed by favourable attitudes towards buying at the farm gate. Interestingly, the injunctive norms construct is not significant, while the descriptive norms construct is. This means that the observed behaviour of relevant peers is more strongly linked to buying at the farm gate than what significant others want respondents to do. Originality/value - Farm shops are one of the innovative distribution channels used by farmers to sell regional products directly to consumers. Studies that analyse the factors that have an effect on consumer behaviour when buying food from farm shops are very scarce. This paper fills this gap and the findings have implications for communications to consumers and labelling.","[Bavorova, Miroslava] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Trop AgriSci, Prague, Czech Republic; [Traikova, Diana] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ, Dept Agr Policy, Halle, Germany; [Doms, Juliane] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Dept Agribusiness Management, Halle, Germany",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO); Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Bavorova, M (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Trop AgriSci, Prague, Czech Republic.",marka.bavorova@gmail.com,"Policy, Department Agricultural/X-9655-2019; , IAMO/G-2328-2012",,,,,,43,5,5,1,30,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach The methodology involves a web-based survey through using specialized online platforms (e.g. websites; Facebook groups; and Facebook pages), which provide content on sustainable and responsible consumption and crowd funding campaigns. Findings The research highlights the increasingly aware and attentive consumer attitudes towards collaborative economic practices compared to the past. In Italy, however, digital platforms for exchanging surplus food or goods are still poorly used. In fact, there is still a lack of knowledge, largely conditioned by recent experienced with some apps and by the poor development of this type of market. Research limitations/implications The research is a pilot of a small-scale study protocol conducted in January 2017 to ascertain the suitability of a wider project on social food sharing practices and environmental sustainability, by determining its feasibility or obtaining information for identification of the key indicators and analysis of the dimensions of the final study. Originality/value The research produces first empirical results that may provide new information, related to the role of digital media, on consumption habits.","[D'Ambrosi, Lucia] Univ Macerata, Mass Commun & Publ Commun, Macerata, Italy",University of Macerata,"D'Ambrosi, L (通讯作者)，Univ Macerata, Mass Commun & Publ Commun, Macerata, Italy.",lucia.dambrosi@unimc.it,,"D'AMBROSI, Lucia/0000-0002-2105-2366",,,,,54,9,10,2,35,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Likely driven by recent food crises, new bioenergy policies, and financial speculations, this phenomenon has been often investigated from the economic development, human right, land tenure and food security perspectives, while its hydrologic implications have remained understudied. It has been suggested that a major driver of large-scale land acquisitions (LSLAs) is the quest for water resources that can be used (locally) to sustain agricultural production in the acquired land. The appropriation of water resources associated with LSLAs has often been termed 'water grabbing', though to date a formal definition of such a normative and inherently pejorative term is missing. The intrinsic assumption is that the acquisition of water undergoes the same dynamics of unbalanced power relationships that underlie many LSLAs. Here we invoke hydrological theories of green and blue water flows to stress the extent to which water appropriations are inherently coupled to land acquisitions and specifically focus on blue water. We then propose a formal definition of blue water grabbing based both on biophysical conditions (water scarcity) and ethical implications (human right to food). Blue water grabs are appropriations of irrigation (i.e., blue) water in regions affected by undernourishment and where agricultural production is constrained by blue water availability. We use this framework to provide a global assessment of the likelihood that LSLAs entail blue water grabbing. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Although originally conceived for relatively modest habitat and/or short-duration injury, HEA is now widely used in service quantification and restoration scaling at large, complex NRDA sites. HEA can be viewed as a simplified alternative to a comprehensive ecosystem approach that requires more extensive primary data collection and differing assumptions. The basic premise of equivalency analysis uses relatively simple computations. However, the theoretical underpinnings are complex and include many economic and ecological assumptions that are crucial in methodology application. This review provides needed scrutiny to HEA applications and practices. We also consider global trends in applying etiuivalency analysis, including its use in environmental liability legislation in,the European Union and more novel applications, such as measuring damages from forest fires and calculating mitigation requirements in environmental impact assessments. Although the theoretical literature on the equivalency methods is relatively robust, more case studies of applications in actual applications are needed to help improve proper use of the methods and to encourage development of best practices by practitioners.

Design/methodology/approach - Carabeef cookies were prepared with incorporation of 50 percent carabeef powder in a pre-standardized formulation and then were baked at 150-160 degrees C for 35-40 minutes. Developed functional carabeef cookies were incorporated with 50 percent carabeef powder, 10 percent orange pulp fiber as natural fiber source, 1.5 percent guar gum as fat replacer and 20 percent of sodium caseinate as sugar replacer. Cookies were analyzed for various physical properties, proximate parameters physcio-chemical properties, instrumental textural properties, color values, sensory evaluation and complete profile estimation in terms of minerals and fatty acids analysis. Findings - Functional carabeef cookies had 4.48 times higher protein, 6.13 times higher IDF, 5.47 times higher SDF and 4.47 times higher TDF as compared to normal refined wheat flour (RWF) cookies. Functional carabeef cookies had 34.58 percent lower fat, 19.95 percent less cholesterol and 12.5 percent lower energy content as compared to normal RWF cookies. Social implications - Functional carabeef cookies had comparatively higher mineral content as well as saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in a desirable ratio. Health-promoting functional carabeef cookies might be a magnificent option to overcome the problem of malnutrition, quite prevalent among lower socio-economical strata people specifically children and women. Originality/value - Health-promoting functional carabeef cookies had higher nutritional content and acceptability, and thus could be commercialized to improve socio-economic status and health of consumers.","[Goswami, Meena] Coll Vet Sci & Anim Husb, Dept Livestock Prod Technol, Mathura, India; [Sharma, B.

Design/methodology/approach - The study included 1,634 male Korean workers aged between 19 and 64 years among 15,508 individuals who participated in a 24-hour dietary recall through the Sixth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2013 to 2014. The study participants were classified and analyzed according to the place where dinner had been prepared: out-of-home group (OHG) (n = 659) and at-home group (AHG) (n = 975). Findings - Young male white-collar workers who are unmarried with a higher level of education and income were more likely to eat OH at dinner. The OHG consumed more energy, fat, and sodium, but less carbohydrate at dinner than the AHG. The contribution of dinner to daily energy and macronutrient intakes, except for carbohydrate, was higher in the OHG. Additionally, the study results suggested that the OHG was less likely to consume a traditional Korean meal at dinner. Overall, the nutritional quality of dinnertime meals eaten OH had greater potential to lead to negative effects on nutrition and health.

These documents present the official position of UKE on regulatory issues. Sometimes they are also incorporated into the decision of this body, but in themselves they are not binding, so, in principle, cannot be appealed against neither in the administrative nor in the civil procedure. It arouses controversy among entrepreneurs who appeal against the provisions of these acts, using the procedure of appeal against the decision of the President of UKE, what is manifested by the cassation complaints that have been recently examined by the Polish Supreme Court. In this contxt arises a question, whether the possibility of appealing only against the decision of the President of UKE with the ever-increasing use of soft law acts by this body, provides the entrepreneur with a sufficient level of protection of their rights, in the context of the principle of legal certainty? A similar situation takes place in the activities of financial supervision institutions, especially Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF). It should be stated that the supervisory actions constitute very strong interference in the nature and in the system of capital companies, as in fact they are quasi provisions of the law and not instruments of the soft law. As a consequence of such supervisory actions the norms of the civil law are adjusted and corrected. The key instrument of influencing third parties are the indications and recommendations used by the financial supervision institutions. Those recommendations are addressed to the supervised entities, but many of them refer to the rights and obligations of other entities (by regulating, i.a. the process of establishing and paying the compensation for damages by insurers or the principles of remunerating employees).

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the influence of packaging and labeling of RequeijAo cheese on the purchasing behavior of different age groups of consumers in order to obtain marketing information that aid in increasing sales of RequeijAo cheese. Design/methodology/approach Three focus groups were created, each one composed of ten participants. The first group was aged 18-30 years old, the second group included people aged 31-50, and the third group participants were aged between 51 and 70 years old. RequeijAo cheese labeling and packaging was presented to all groups to facilitate a discussion. A moderator asked participants in the three groups about the factors on the packaging and labeling of RequeijAo cheese that influence their desire to purchase. Seven final themes were analyzed by thematic analysis: packaging, color and images on label, information, lid, price and brand. Findings The factors of greatest importance that influenced purchasing for the first and second group were glass packaging and color labels. Groups 2 and 3 preferred a packaging size of 250g, an aluminum cap protected with a plastic cap, information, and affordable prices. Group 1 demonstrated high interest in 220g packaging, metal lid and brands. Group 3 preferred plastic packaging. All groups were attracted by images on labels related to the product origin. The results from this study may be advantageous for creating marketing strategies to increase sales of RequeijAo cheese and similar milk products that are sold in comparable ways. Practical implications Concept and attitudes toward packaging and labeling have changed in modern times. The present study demonstrates how consumers of different age groups have divergent opinions about packaging and labeling of RequeijAo cheese, factors that have huge influences in the purchasing of this product. The results from this study will aid in creating marketing strategies to increase sales of RequeijAo cheese and similar milk products that are sold in similar conditions. The findings will also assist manufactures in creating bonds with costumers once packaging and labeling might be produced in accordance with the preference of each age group of consumers, and consequently makes the visual aspects of packaging more attractive to them. Originality/value This study collected information about the most features in packaging and labeling of RequeijAo cheese that attract consumers in the food buying process. There are many companies that sell RequeijAo cheese. Then, it is necessary to understand the needs of consumers in relation to packaging and labeling of similar products, to make it more competitive in the market and to meet the expectations of consumers in order to create bond with them.","[Lima Ribeiro, Ana Paula; Souza Carneiro, Joao de Deus; Pinto, Sandra Maria] Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Food Sci, Lavras, Brazil; [Ramos, Thais De Melo; Patterson, Laura] Univ Calif Davis, Davis Sch Vet Med, Dept Populat Hlth & Reprod, Davis, CA 95616 USA",Universidade Federal de Lavras; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Ribeiro, APL (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Food Sci, Lavras, Brazil.",anaplima.com@gmail.com; joaodedeus@dca.ufla.br; thaisramos85@yahoo.com.br; lpatters@ucdavis.edu; sandra@dca.ufla.br,"Pinto, Sandra Maria/IYJ-5660-2023; Ribeiro, Ana Cristina/HHN-7466-2022; SANTOS, ANA/JPK-6411-2023","Pinto, Sandra Maria/0000-0001-8431-6034; Ribeiro, Ana Cristina/0000-0002-0493-8376;",CAPES; CNPQ,CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); CNPQ(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),The authors would like to thank CAPES and CNPQ for the financial support.,,47,14,16,4,34,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach An online survey was distributed to participants who were 19 years of age or older and had dined at a full-service restaurant in the past month. A total of 413 valid surveys were collected. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the demographic information, satisfaction of restaurant attributes, revisit intention, and scores of importance-performance items. Path analysis was applied to group customer's perceived importance of restaurant attributes and was used to analyze relationships among five attribute dimensions, satisfaction and revisit intention. Findings Accurate guest check, prompt service, overall value of the dining experience, and lighting were very important to customers but the restaurants' performances in these areas were not satisfactory. Three attribute dimensions (food, service, and price and value) were positively and directly related to customer satisfaction and their effects are partially mediated. However, atmosphere and satisfaction are negatively and partially mediated in this study. Practical implications Food, service, price and value, and atmosphere dimensions have larger direct effects than indirect effect on revisit intentions. Their impacts on revisit intentions are partially mediated by satisfaction. Thus, great performance alone may not significantly improve revisit intentions. However, great performance can increase customer satisfaction, which has a stronger influence on revisit intentions. Originality/value This research explored the mediating effects of satisfaction between five restaurant dimensions and behavioral intentions.","[Liu, Pei; Tse, Eliza Ching-Yick] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Liu, P (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",lpei@missouri.edu,,,,,,,56,62,70,7,36,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

It is important to be able to see and follow your progress and win small victories often. Consider social applications and activities -being able to connect to others in the same situation can enable discussions and provide peer support.

Issues around migration and cultural diversity have gained less attention in the higher education sector in Ireland than at primary and post primary level with a few notable exceptions. Higher education is regarded as having a critical role to play in terms of enriching Ireland's cultural life, nurturing our understanding of our own national identity and that of other cultures and belief systems [1]. Influenced by developments at European Union level, the approach adopted to cultural diversity in Ireland is one of interculturalism. This paper aims in the first instance to analyse the application of interculturalism in the Irish higher education sector from a strategy and policy perspective. It briefly traces the promotion of interculturalism as a policy response to cultural diversity at a European level, before highlighting a number of the concept's salient characteristics. The second part of the paper analyses the implementation of interculturalism in the Irish context. While critically reflecting on the higher education setting as a site where interculturalism can be put into practice, the focus is placed specifically on the question of language and the need to take it into consideration.","[Ni Chonaill, Brid] Inst Technol Blanchardstown, Dublin, Ireland",Technological University Dublin,"Chonaill, BN (通讯作者)，Inst Technol Blanchardstown, Dublin, Ireland.",brid.nichonaill@itb.ie,,,,,,,36,1,2,0,2,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-9630,1879-8365,978-1-61499-923-2; 978-1-61499-922-5,STUD HEALTH TECHNOL,,,2018,256.0,,,,,,624,633,,10.3233/978-1-61499-923-2-624,0.0,,,10,"Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7JT,30371424.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455118100060,0

However, its terminological definition is still insufficiently defined as any other occurrences and terms that are related to it. The aim of the paper is to research the theoretical issues of rural tourism development and the role and significance of the elements important for entrepreneurs in the sustainable development of rural tourism in continental Croatia. The purpose of the research is to determine whether rural tourism entrepreneurs consider networking in clusters and the creation of an integrated tourist product for specific forms of tourism important. General scientific methods such as desk research, analysis, synthesis, compilation arev used in the paper, and for the primary research the method of descriptive statistics is used. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to test statistically significant correlations between the importance elements for entrepreneurs. Data collected through primary research were analysed by appropriate statistical methods using the software program for social sciences Minitab, Ver. 17, which provides various forms of statistical analysis such as descriptive statistics, factor analysis, regression analysis, variance analysis. The basic starting point for the hypothesis is that the long-term sustainable development of rural tourism in continental Croatia can be achieved through greater entrepreneurial engagement through networking of entrepreneurs in clusters and the creation of an integrated tourist offer of different types of tourism. The rural tourism offer is very scarce and highly oscillated in its quality, which is attributed to a bad entrepreneurial initiative and national policy of neglecting tourist development of this area. Investment projects are the basis for introducing the principle of sustainable development of rural tourism in continental tourist destinations. In order to apply the principles of sustainable development, existing and new projects should respect the ecological, socio-cultural and the economic principles of sustainable development of the destination. By integrating entrepreneurs dealing with rural tourism and providing assistance with financial programs, an integrated tourism product of rural tourism and complementary specific forms of tourism would be developed to achieve long-term sustainability of entrepreneurial projects. In the development of rural tourism, it is necessary to apply the concept of sustainable development based on the fundamental features on which it rests.","[Petracic, Mateja] Karlovac Univ Appl Sci, Trg JJ Strossmayera 9, Karlovac, Croatia; [Bartoluci, Mato] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Tourism, JF Kennedy Sq 6, HR-10000 Zagreb, Croatia; [Milohnic, Ines] Univ Rijeka, Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management, Primorska 42, Opatija 51410, Croatia",University of Zagreb; University of Rijeka,"Petracic, M (通讯作者)，Karlovac Univ Appl Sci, Trg JJ Strossmayera 9, Karlovac, Croatia.",mpetracic@vuka.hr; mbartoluci@efzg.hr; ines.milohnic@fthm.hr,"Alves, Juliano/GQO-7605-2022; MILOHNIĆ, INES/T-4982-2019","MILOHNIĆ, INES/0000-0001-7487-4286",,,,,16,0,0,0,7,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,888,896,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900093,0

During 2004-05 and 2007-08, person days of employment of rural women in public works increased around 4.4 times. There was no gender gap in the wages paid while average wages received in MGNREGS were significantly higher compared to other kinds of work. The impact is direct in terms of higher wages paid to women; indirect in terms of effects on women workers' reservation wages and bargaining power. The scheme had already positive effects on women workers in rural labour markets and resulted in real wages to rise, gender gaps to come down and open unemployment rates of women to decrease. Irrigation potential improved and the land brought under cultivation has been increased. Besides, the kapildhara wells and field bunding have resulted in improvement in micro irrigation, enabled changes in cropping pattern towards cash crops.

The development of economic, social and geographical inequalities is an important subject of society's interest. In the context of theory, two fundamental tendencies are related, in particular, to the role of the state in mitigating regional disparities. The first approach is based on the assumption that there are forces in the long run leading to balancing regional disparities and therefore the state should not interfere significantly. The second approach inversely highlights the role of the state in reducing regional disparities and thus supports the development of regional policy as a set of tools for economic and social cohesion. Differences in economic development and its dynamics, economic activity, the level of living, the level of unemployment, and the level of wage vary between regions. There is a tight link between wage levels and unemployment, the nature of which is the subject of frequent expert discussions. Both unemployment and wage rates show a considerable degree of regional differentiation in Slovakia, especially between the capital Bratislava and other regions of Slovakia, which is related to the status of the capital as an economically dominant region and, on the contrary, to the economic challenges of lagging regions, especially in Central and Eastern Slovakia. Monitoring regional disparities enables the less developed regions of a particular region to be targeted by regional aid. Regional development in Slovakia is largely provided through EU funds. Investment incentives also play an important role as one of the tools to motivate investors to place their new branch offices mainly in less developed regions, in areas with higher levels of unemployment. The main objective of the contribution, based on the analysis of the current situation of the labour market situation and wage inequalities, is to identify the impact of the main factors on the phenomena examined, i.e. unemployment and wage differences.","[Rievajova, Eva; Klimko, Roman] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dolnozemska 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Rievajova, E (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dolnozemska 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",eva.rievajova@euba.sk; roman.klimko@euba.sk,,,VEGA [1/0001/16],VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),The paper is the outcome of scientific project VEGA No. 1/0001/16 'Sucasnost a perspektivy zmien zamestnanosti a suvisiacich procesov v kontexte naplnania cielov Europskej strategie zamestnanosti'.,,7,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,146,151,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Law",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies; Government & Law,BP1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540727600016,0

The study has been conducted in several locations of integration in Indonesia. The conclusion of this research is the integration in Indonesia is carried out with intensive, semi-intensive, and extensive integration patterns. Bali Cattle is the most commonly used. There is no standard processing of cattle feed made from biomass of palm oil plantation industry. The issues encountered in the implementation integration by small-scale farmers are the difficulty of obtaining palm kernel cake, unfavourable feed processing technology, and the issue cattle destroying palm oil plantations. And large-scale are the issue cattle destroying palm oil plantations, marketing problem, and understanding of the principle of implementation integration.Business diversification carried out on integration activities is manufacture of solid organic fertilizer, liquid organic fertilizer, and the manufacture of biogas from cattle dung and urine.","[Silalahi, Firman R.

The adoption of the Strategy is mainly a result of external pressures and mostly conditioned by the conditionality rules of the EU structural and investment funds (ESI). The lack of authentic devotion of domestic actors to public administration reform is evident during implementation process as many of the proclaimed goals are attained with great difficulties and delays and some of them are not accomplished at all. After the introductory chapter paper proceeds as follows: second chapter describes and analyses political and economic context in which the Strategy was adopted as well as the state of public administration in Croatia at that time. Third chapter critically analyses the content of the Strategy, its individual objectives and measures, their coherence and appropriateness for addressing main challenges of public administration in Croatia. Fourth part of the paper is dedicated to the implementation process of the Strategy and to the identification of problems and shortcomings that severely jeopardize its proper implementation. Conclusive remarks and main insights of the analysis comprise the final chapter.

However, uncertainties in global land cover data and their impacts on ESV estimation have not been fully recognized. Considerably inflated estimates of land cover change and ESV change could be derived using a direct map comparison approach when classification uncertainties are not explicitly taken into account. This study collected all available global land cover datasets and applied an ensemble approach to derive the range and central tendency of terrestrial ESV estimates. Different input data caused ESV estimate varying between 35.0 and 56.5 trillion Ind/year. Wetland classes, albeit having the highest per unit value, were the most uncertain classes mapped using satellite data. To reduce uncertainty, a spatial data harmonization procedure was developed, which resulted in an improved ESV estimate at 49.4 trillion Ind/year. The study further illustrated the quantification of changes in forest ESV using a high-resolution global forest cover change dataset. An ESV loss of 716.0 billion Ind/year was estimated between 2000 and 2012 a result representing one fifth of previous estimates. These findings highlighted the importance of improving the characterization and monitoring of land cover for global ESV and change estimation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis also includes an element related to the development and situation of unit prices and the physical volume of AFT as well. The differences which exist in relation to long-term trade partners of the Czech AFT, are observed. From individual analyses, it's then possible to work on certain assumptions, necessary for the analysis of competitiveness, and more precisely the comparative advantages on the part of Czech AFT. These comparative advantages are primarily based on the ability of the Czech Republic to compete within the sector of product exporting with a lower rate of production, where the export strategies rely mainly on high volumes of exported mass and low export prices. This fact is then confirmed by analyses made possible through the LFI, RCA and TBI indices. The most noteworthy partners of the Czech AFT are the developed countries, particularly the member countries of the OECD and more significantly the EU28. It's possible to detect the deterioration of the coverage of unit prices of imports by the unit prices of exports. Due to the high growth dynamics of the export volume, it's possible to observe a noticeable and long lasting improvement, when it comes to the coverage of the value of imports by values of exports. In addition, this is visible in the relationship to the coverage of import volumes by export volumes.","[Steininger, Michal; Smutka, Lubos; Maitah, Mansoor] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Steininger, M (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.",steininger@pef.czu.cz; smutka@pef.czu.cz; maitah@pef.czu.cz,"Maitah, Mansoor/G-7556-2014; Smutka, Lubos/K-6401-2015; Steininger, Michal/H-3191-2018","Maitah, Mansoor/0000-0003-2797-3155; Smutka, Lubos/0000-0001-5385-1333; Steininger, Michal/0000-0002-8121-8567","Grant Agency of the Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague: Analyza komoditni struktury ceskeho agrarniho zahranicniho obchodu / Analysis of Czech agrarian foreign trade commodity structure [20171024]","Grant Agency of the Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague: Analyza komoditni struktury ceskeho agrarniho zahranicniho obchodu / Analysis of Czech agrarian foreign trade commodity structure","This paper was supported by Grant Agency of the Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague: Analyza komoditni struktury ceskeho agrarniho zahranicniho obchodu / Analysis of Czech agrarian foreign trade commodity structure [nr. 20171024].",,15,0,0,0,2,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-6059,2464-6067,978-80-7435-701-5,HRADEC ECON DAYS,,,2018,8.0,,2,,,,314,323,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL3AA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000449443600031,0

Our empirical results strongly suggest that unobserved heterogeneity is not only present in the U.S. banking industry, but also varies over time. Our results from the translog SDF model with time-varying heterogeneity show that the majority of large BHCs in the U.S. exhibit increasing returns to scale, a small percentage exhibit constant returns to scale, and an even smaller percentage exhibit decreasing returns to scale.

Impact of CON Law on ED competition remains an unanswered empirical question. Methods: We examine the impact of CON Law and its stringency on the intensity of competition (rivalry among competitors) between EDs measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). We then estimate the effects of CON Law on HHI by treating CON as an exogenous (endogenous) variable. Findings: On average the CON legislation enhances ED competition. A possible reason is that the law hinders predatory behavior, and therefore acts as an effective anti-trust tool. Other findings indicate that competition is found to be positively related to a state's population size and median income and negatively related with the prevalence of employer provided insurance and magnitude of illegal immigration in a state. Practical implications: This article sheds some light on how political regulations could affect healthcare market and hence may provide public policy makers some insights on reducing healthcare cost. Originality: Our analysis of the impact of CON regulation on ED competition significantly contributes to the healthcare and strategy literature. The law potentially serves as an anti-trust tool in the hands of the government. We extend the empirical literature by treating CON Law and its stringency as exogenous (endogenous).

J,"Chen, F",,,,"Chen, Frederick",,,The Economics of Synthetic Rhino Horns,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Conservation; Rhinos; Rhino horns; Poaching; Synthetic horns; Fake horns; Adverse selection,IVORY TRADE BAN; CONSERVATION,"To examine the potential impact of synthetic horns to reduce rhino poaching, a formal model of the rhino horn market in which there exist firms with the capability to produce high quality synthetic horns is presented and studied. The analysis shows that whether the availability of synthetic horns would decrease the equilibrium supply of wild horns-and how much the reduction would be-depends on market structure-i.e., how competitive the synthetic horn production sector is-and on how substitutable the synthetic horns are for wild horns. The implications of these results for conservation policies are derived and discussed. Synthetic horn producers would benefit more by promoting their products as being superior to wild horns, but this could increase horn prices and lead to more rhino poaching. For conservation purposes, it may be beneficial to incentivize firms to produce inferior fakes-synthetic horns that are engineered to be undesirable in some respect but difficult for buyers to distinguish from wild horns. The analysis also shows that promoting competition in the production of synthetic horns in general is desirable from a conservation standpoint as synthetic horn producers may prefer to keep prices at a high enough level that could still encourage significant amount of poaching.

These initiatives seek to bring about societal change. They do so, however, not through protest or interest-based lobbying, but by organising a protected space for learning and experimentation with lifestyle changes for sustainable food consumption and production practices. In particular, they aim to promote social learning on a broad set of sustainability values, beyond a focus on fresh and healthy food only, which characterizes many of the individual consumer oriented local food chain initiatives. This paper analyses the governance features of such local food buying groups by comparing 104 groups in five cities in Belgium. We find that the social networking activities of these groups, as compared to the social enterprise activities, have led to establish specific governance mechanisms. Whereas the main focus of the social enterprise activities is the organisation of the food provisioning logistics, the focus of the social network activities is the sharing of resources with other sustainable food initiatives, dissemination of information and broader discussion on sustain ability issues.

The holistic perspective and the determination of said relationships, synergies and/or trade-offs, are aspects that have been receiving close attention in the literature on the subject. This paper aims to develop an analysis that considers these topics regarding the farming system in Almeria, utilizing primary data obtained from surveys of a sampling of farmers and secondary data from the sector. A series of ecological, social and economic indicators are determined, following the framework of the Sustainability Assessment of Farming and the Environment (SAFE), and its subsequent aggregation using synthetic indexes. The estimation of interrelationships is carried out by means of a multivariate analysis, considering the endogeneity between the sustainability dimensions and the influence of several features of the agrifood system. The results reveal that the increase in the economic and social indicators reduces environmental pressures on the use of resources; in parallel, it can also be observed how social and environmental improvements reveal positive effects on the economic dimension of the farmers. Overall, this study presents an analytical study that combines indicators at farm level and the effects related to the productive activities surrounding agriculture. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

On each of these issues, accounting for heterogeneity, interactions and disequilibrium dynamics provides a complementary and novel perspective to the one of standard equilibrium models.

Estimating the magnitude of those increases is challenging due to substantial uncertainties about the amount by which climate change will alter the formation of hurricanes and increase sea levels in various locations; and the fact that future increases in property exposure are uncertain, reflecting local, regional and national trends as well as unforeseen circumstances. This paper assesses the potential increase in wind and storm surge damage caused by hurricanes making landfall in the U.S. between now and 2075 using a framework that addresses those challenges. We find that, in combination, climate change and coastal development will cause hurricane damage to increase faster than the U.S. economy is expected to grow. In addition, we find that the number of people facing substantial expected damage will, on average, increase more than eight-fold over the next 60 years. Understanding the concentration of damage may be particularly important in countries that lack policies or programs to provide federal support to hard-hit localities.

They range from neorealist theory, to hegemony theory, world society theory, and network embeddedness theory. Drawing on hegemonic transition theory, this paper provides evidence that prior to the fall of the Soviet Union, strong and weak countries ratified a treaty if the USA or the USSR ratified the treaty first. After the fall of the Soviet Union, countries' proximity to world society institutions increased the likelihood of ratifying a treaty, and only weaker countries emulated the ratifications of the USA and Russia. However, weaker countries also emulated economic, religious, and language peers, diplomatic ties, and neighbors as well. In contrast, more powerful countries ratified treaties more independently. We studied the ratifications of eight universal environmental treaties by 166 countries between 1981 and 2008 and showed that as the geopolitical context changed, the diffusion process changed. The paper argues that the hegemonic transition which took place in the late 1980s and early 1990s was an enabling event that helped to explain the new roles that major powers assumed in the 1990s and 2000s and opened the door to the ascendency of global institutions and broader participation in the environmental regime.","[Yamagata, Yoshiki] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Global Environm Res, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Yang, Jue] Fujitsu Res Inst, Tokyo, Japan; [Galaskiewicz, Joseph] Univ Arizona, Sch Sociol, Social Sci, Room 400, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Fujitsu Ltd; Fujitsu Laboratories Ltd; University of Arizona,"Galaskiewicz, J (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, Sch Sociol, Social Sci, Room 400, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",galaskie@email.arizona.edu,"Yamagata, Yoshiki/T-6489-2019; Yamagata, Yoshiki/H-7224-2018",,"Climate Risk Assessment Research Project at the National Institute for Environmental Studies in Tsukuba, Japan; International Studies Program at the University of Arizona","Climate Risk Assessment Research Project at the National Institute for Environmental Studies in Tsukuba, Japan; International Studies Program at the University of Arizona","We acknowledge the Climate Risk Assessment Research Project at the National Institute for Environmental Studies in Tsukuba, Japan for providing funding for this research, the International Studies Program at the University of Arizona for travel funds, and the Fulbright Program which enabled the third author to teach and do research at the University of Tsukuba in 2007.

Yet, the WTO agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures would at first sight seem to create possibilities to forestall environmentally harmful subsidization. In this article, we assess possible explanations for the skewed distribution of energy subsidies dispute settlement complaints at the WTO. We argue that differences in legally relevant characteristics of fossil fuel subsidies, on the one hand, and RE subsidies, on the other hand, largely explain this observation. In the case of RE subsidies, in particular, the disputes filed to date have targeted a much narrower set of measures than the whole range of RE subsidies currently in place, namely those incorporating a local content requirement component. Although this finding is not new, we have probed into this question more systematically, both by widening the scope of the empirical analysis from actual to potential WTO disputes on energy-related policies the European Union and the USA might have initiated, and by systematically assessing the plausibility of alternative explanations.","[De Bievre, Dirk] Univ Antwerp, Dept Polit Sci, Sint Jacobstr 2, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Espa, Ilaria] Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, Hallerstr 6, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Poletti, Arlo] Univ Trento, Dept Sociol & Social Res, Via Giuseppe Verdi 26, I-38122 Trento, Italy",University of Antwerp; University of Bern; University of Trento,"De Bièvre, D (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Dept Polit Sci, Sint Jacobstr 2, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",dirk.debievre@uantwerpen.be; ilaria.espa@wti.org; arlo.poletti@unitn.it,"De Bièvre, Dirk/G-2323-2018","De Bièvre, Dirk/0000-0003-3030-6492; Espa, Ilaria/0000-0002-6246-3137",,,,,52,27,27,3,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Departing from earlier studies, we focus on the ability of international organizations to assist national governments directly in the enactment and implementation of national reforms. While international organizations lack the capacity to directly enforce policy or force countries to abolish subsidies, they can increase the cost of reform reversal by governments that have a preference for reform but worry about the credibility and durability of their reforms. Moreover, international organizations can support learning from peers. In practice, governments interested in subsidy reform can announce a public commitment and submit progress reports to peer review by other countries under the auspices of an international organization. We characterize the institutional design of international organizations for success, discuss the role of the civil society in the process, and offer short illustrations from recent efforts by international organizations to promote fuel subsidy reform.","[Smith, Joel E.; Urpelainen, Johannes] Columbia Univ, 420 West 118th St,718 IAB, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Urpelainen, J (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, 420 West 118th St,718 IAB, New York, NY 10027 USA.",ju2178@columbia.edu,,,,,,,52,14,15,2,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

This paper distinguishes the physical aspects and implications of economic factors by asking what is demanded from physically based metrics if used for a specific policy objective. We study the aim of maximizing the welfare of emissions generated by consumption when there is a limit to the increase in global mean temperature. In that case, metrics ought to change over time, with increasing weight on short-living gases before the temperature limit is met. Metrics for short-living gases increase also with increasing uncertainty. Adjustments to new information spur higher metrics for short-living gases if it reduces the expected allowable emissions before the target is met, and lower metrics in the opposite case. Under a binding target, metrics refer to the instantaneous impact on radiative forcing multiplied by the lifetime of the respective gases, and adjusted by the attitude to risk. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, concerns regarding the validity of choice responses obtained in such surveys remain, particularly in surveys dealing with environmental goods remote from and unfamiliar to respondents. This study assesses behavioural determinants of preferences for conservation benefits of a marine protected area on the Dogger Bank, a shallow sandbank in the southern North Sea in an attempt to assess construct validity of survey responses. The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the Norm Activation Model (NAM) are employed to empirically measure constructs that predict stated choices. The study finds that identified protest respondents score significantly lower on most TPB and NAM components than non-protesters. Results further show that components of both the TPB and the NAM robustly predict choice behaviour. The inclusion of the TPB components improves the predictive power of the estimation model more than the NAM components. In an additional latent class logit model, TPB and NAM components plausibly explain different patterns of WTP for conservation benefits of an offshore marine protected area. These findings support construct validity of stated choice data regarding the valuation of remote and unfamiliar environmental goods. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - In total, 17 adults aged 60 and older living in two rural counties, who prepared at least three basic meals per week, were purposefully recruited to represent different living situations, perceived income level, and education level. Two retrospective in-depth interviews with each person collected biographical cooking narratives, analyzed using a life course perspective. Life course perspective concepts and emergent themes were identified. Timelines for each participant were prepared. Findings - All participants expressed interest and pleasure in eating but they described different patterns of skills, behaviors, and feelings regarding cooking. Four cooking trajectories emerged: resilient, expanding, contracting interest, and contracting capability. Cooking skills evolved for some only during older adulthood, and supported both contracting and expanding food preparation. When cooking declined, it decreased due to shifts in personal priorities or in physical capability to carry out cooking tasks. Practical implications - Recognizing the different patterns of cooking trajectories may help health care providers and the food industry better serve the diverse nutritional needs of older adults, including those not traditionally served: individuals who are actively seeking information as they increase their cooking and those who are avoiding cooking due to lack of interest. Originality/value - Trajectories are a useful tool for analyzing skills and practices over time, which can facilitate understanding of food choice activities. Trajectories have not been previously used to explicitly examine cooking skills.","[Bostic, Stephanie Marie] Cornell Univ, Div Nutr Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [McClain, Amanda C.] Harvard Univ, Dept Nutr, Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Cornell University; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

Protected areas are among the most important natural resources of the Republic of Croatia. Therefore, we think it is important to analyze from an administrative-law viewpoint the special administrative procedure for resolving administrative cases and adopting administrative laws related to protected areas and the use of natural resources. The paper will present and analyze the legal framework for managing protected areas in accordance with the Nature Protection Act. Competent authorities will be identified along with procedures for special administrative action pertaining to the use of natural resources and for issuing decisions regulating conditions of nature protection. The main central government authority responsible for issuing said decisions is the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Energy. By comparing two relevant laws, the General Administrative Procedure Act (lex generalis) and the Nature Protection Act (lex specialis) with respect to administrative proceedings, we will try to determine if there are, and to what extent, any discrepancies between the two laws. Once the central government authority responsible for nature protection issues a decision, further legal protection may be achieved only through initiating an administrative dispute before a competent administrative court. With this in mind, we will analyze the administrative court practices using the case method and in relation to disputes assessing the legality of decisions issued in procedures of protected areas management. Analysis of case-law from the chosen period will allow direct insight into the decision-making process of administrative courts and determine mistakes that happened during procedures before the competent Ministry. Special emphasis will be given to the role of first-instance administrative courts in the Republic of Croatia in providing court protection in the aforementioned special administrative area.","[Ceko, Ana Dani] Fac Law Osijek, Stjepana Radica 13, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Ceko, AD (通讯作者)，Fac Law Osijek, Stjepana Radica 13, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",adjanic@pravos.hr,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,463,472,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500044,0

Design/methodology/approach - In order to define the concept of global quality, the following parameters were considered: fruity, bitter, pungency, 1-penten-3-one, phenolic substances, tocopherols, peroxide value, free acidity, palmitic acid, stearic acid oleic acid linoleic acid, and the campesterol/stigmasterol ratio. The study was carried out on 143 commercial extra virgin olive oils. Findings - The Global Quality Index was calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual local indices, according to three different algorithms. The computation obtained was recognised by chemometric analysis. Social implications - A legislative amendment on the labelling could be proposed through an additional claim that safeguards the consumers on the health profile, inducing them to a more targeted purchase. Originality/value - Three different global quality levels excellent, good, and sufficient have been determined. This clustering has also been recognised with a statistical approach. Since in the market, consumers can find extra virgin olive oils of different overall quality levels, it is possible to guide the choice of customers through an additional claim on the label, able to give more information on the sensory profile and the nutritional and preservation features of the product.","[Giansante, Lucia; Di Loreto, Giuseppina; Di Serio, Maria Gabriella; Vito, Raffaella; Di Giacinto, Luciana] Olive Growing & Oil Ind Res Ctr CREA OLI, Council Agr Res & Econ, Citta S Angelo, Italy",Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA),"Giansante, L (通讯作者)，Olive Growing & Oil Ind Res Ctr CREA OLI, Council Agr Res & Econ, Citta S Angelo, Italy.",lucia.giansante@crea.gov.it,,"Giansante, Lucia/0000-0001-9426-1452; Di Giacinto, Luciana/0000-0003-0696-8410",,,,,30,3,3,1,6,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Regulation (EC) No. 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and the Council introduced a mandatory application of International Accounting Standards, and now known as International Financial Reporting Standards for all listed companies in the EU member states. The goal was to provide a high level of transparency and comparability of financial statements of listed companies through the introduction of the mandatory application of International Accounting Standards. However, national accounting framework is of great importance for financial reporting in every country. National accounting framework has an essential role in determining the major rules of keeping accounting records, defining chart of accounts, preparing annual financial statements and the application of national and/or international accounting standards. Accountants have a key role in recording of business transactions and preparing of financial statements. In performing these tasks accounting skills are essential. Professional associations have an important role in the promotion and development of the accounting theory and practice. The main purpose of this research was to investigate the regulatory framework of accounting and financial reporting and to examine the organization of the accounting profession in selected EU member states - Croatia, Slovakia and Czechia. The results indicate that there are differences and unevenly practice in the field of accounting regulations as well as in the organization of the accounting profession. The comparison of Croatian, Slovak and Czech accounting regulation focuses not only on differences but as well as on similarities, which can indicate better comprehension the national accounting rules.","[Hladika, Mirjana] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, JF Kennedy 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Mokosova, Dasa] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Econ Informat, Dept Accounting & Auditing, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia; [Molin, Jan] Univ Econ, Fac Finance & Accounting, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic",University of Zagreb; University of Economics Bratislava; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Hladika, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, JF Kennedy 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",mhladika@efzg.hr; dasa.mokosova@euba.sk; jan.molin@vse.cz,"Hladika, Mirjana/I-1152-2018",,,,,,12,0,0,1,5,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,1041,1057,,,,,,17,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500101,0

This paper empirically tests Gibrat's law on the panel data of Croatian firms during the period from 2006 to 2015. Moreover, we test for any structural differences between full sample and subsample of firms, the subsample comprising the firms that are registered in at least one of the five Slavonian counties. The aim of this paper is to show the importance of taking into consideration regions within countries when testing the Law. Our data comes from Bureau Van Dijk's Amadeus database and originally included more than 80,000 firms. We use panel data analysis to disentangle effects of various firm-level variables on the growth rate of the firms. We use sales of the firm and the number of employees as proxies for the size of the firm. Moreover, we include variables such as the age of the firm, growth opportunities (proxied by ratio of intangible fixed asset to total fixed asset) and solvency ratio, in order to control for variables other than the size that affect the growth rate of the firm. Simple statistics showed that average growth rate of the small firmsis almost2 p.p. higher than the one for medium andlarge firms, econometric model(fixed effects (FE) model) showed that there existsstatistically significant negative connection between size of the firms and their respective growth rates. That is, we reject Gibrat's law for the case of Croatian firms in general. Econometric analysis on subsample of firms from Eastern Croatia showed similar results (size of coefficients and significance) for all variables except the age of the firm. We find that there exist significant structural difference in age of the firm-growth rate link between firms in Eastern Croatia as opposed to of the rest of the firms in Croatia. While age of the firm is not significant at all when we estimate the FE model on the whole sample, it is highly significant and positive for the firms in Eastern Croatia. We offer several explanations for that puzzling finding.","[Host, Alen; Zaninovic, Vinko] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Host, A (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",alen.host@efri.hr; vinko.zaninovic@efri.hr,"Host, Alen/R-8180-2018; Zaninovic, Vinko/Q-5540-2018","Zaninovic, Vinko/0000-0002-2094-0687",,,,,21,0,0,0,6,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,825,843,,,,,,19,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500080,0

A rural entrepreneur is one of the great vital contributors in the economic development of a country. On the contrary, many rural entrepreneurs are facing various problems and challenges due to non-availability of essential amenities in the rural part of developing country like India. Such as lack of education, shortage of finance and raw material, insufficient technical and conceptual capacity it is too difficult for the rural entrepreneurs to start industries in the rural areas. The paper implemented a descriptive research design using 115 randomly selected registered entrepreneurs from Maharashtra state. Data collected were analysed using descriptive statistics the data analysis indicated that lack of finance, insufficient infrastructures, lack of managerial skills were major challenges for rural entrepreneurs. researchers think the government should make provision for entrepreneurs for the establishment of business by proving finance through funding agencies, public/private sector partnership in the infrastructural provision, capacity building and provision of tax incentives for entrepreneurs.","[Katekhaye, Dhanashree; Magda, Robert] Szent Istvan Univ, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Pater Karoly Str 1, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary",Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences,"Katekhaye, D (通讯作者)，Szent Istvan Univ, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Pater Karoly Str 1, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary.",dhanashree25389@gmail.com; magda.robert@gtk.szie.h,"Magda, Robert/HCH-0867-2022",,,,,,7,0,0,0,2,SLOVAK UNIV AGRICULTURE NITRA,NITRA,"TR A HLINKU2, NITRA, 94976, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-552-1739-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,136,145,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6FH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426613300015,0

Sience computer applications, like graphics software's,online videos,excel,PowerPoint,e learning materialsetc have important role in the economics teaching andlearning processes but still most of the teachers areusing the conventional methods. Computers and the Internet are constantly transforming the economy and society. The role of information and communication technologies in promoting development is increasingly recognized. ICT is becoming a powerful tool for mobilizing civil society and unused human resources. E-Learning plays a key role in modern education systems. E-learning has revolutionized the education industry. Information and communication technology is fast becoming today's educational requirement, because there is the need for increased in learning opportunities both for the teachers who implement the curriculum and students who are the recipients. This can only be effectively done through multiple and simultaneous actions: availability of computer facilities, computer classrooms will enhance e-learning. This implies that all stakeholders in education must work together tomake ICT accessible to teachers and students in the teaching and learning of all school subjects. The purpose of the study was to examine the use of information and communication technologies in the teaching of economics. The purpose of the study was to examine the use of information and communication technologies in the teaching of economics. ICTs are seen to be less effective when the goals for their use are not clear. While such a statement would appear to be self-evident, the specific goals for ICT use in education are, in practice, are often only very broadly defined. By specifying the purpose of the study, the following guiding questions were adopted: 1. How are ICTs actually being used in education? 2. What do we know about the impact of ICTs on student learning? 3. What do we know about the impact of ICTs on student motivation and engagement for learning? Drawing upon international research studies of ICT in education, this paper identifies and discusses the cognitive opportunities and limitations of ICT in addressing the challenges in learning and teaching economics. Research studies of information and communication technologies in economics education have shown that ICT facilitates the acquisition of important cognitive skills required for effective economic analysis and evaluation. It provides the cognitive scaffolding for students to acquire complex concepts and understand the connection between them, allows teachers and students to communicate both their thoughts and interests in the subject matter, and offers a better match to students' learning style. Moreover, it is a medium through which students can observe the real-life implications of economic theories. They also confirmed that information and communication technologies (ICTs) have impact on different levels of society, especially in terms of improving teaching and learning.","[Kocwin, Leslaw] Coll Management Edukacja, Wroclaw, Poland",,"Kocwin, L (通讯作者)，Coll Management Edukacja, Wroclaw, Poland.",leslaw.kocwin@gmail.com,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,UNIV WROCLAW,WROCLAW,"PL UNIWERSYTECKI 1, WROCLAW, 50-137, POLAND",,,978-83-64389-64-1,ICT MAN GLO COM EC G,,,2017,,,,,,,359,360,,,,,,2,Development Studies; Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BP9OZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000570154500029,0

Older adults in Poland have lower requirements than Swedes regarding aspects important for satisfying and independent ageing, but Poles reveal more positive attitudes towards development of various kinds of technologies supporting independent living.","[Kolkowska, Ella] Orebro Univ, Orebro, Sweden; [Soja, Ewa] Cracow Univ Econ, Krakow, Poland",Orebro University; Cracow University of Economics,"Kolkowska, E (通讯作者)，Orebro Univ, Orebro, Sweden.",ella.kolkowska@oru.se; ewa.soja@uek.krakow.pl,,,,,,,14,2,2,0,3,UNIV WROCLAW,WROCLAW,"PL UNIWERSYTECKI 1, WROCLAW, 50-137, POLAND",,,978-83-64389-64-1,ICT MAN GLO COM EC G,,,2017,,,,,,,36,46,,,,,,11,Development Studies; Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BP9OZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000570154500002,0

However, how organic food promotions outweigh the negative impacts of high prices has become a pressing issue scholars need to discuss. Hence, with the value perspective as the basis, the purpose of this paper is to attempt to understand whether or not organic food consumers have preferences for specific promotional programs as opposed to other promotional programs. Design/methodology/approach - The two-stage study design was adopted to explore these issues. In the first stage, 225 copies of promotional program documents were collected, and middle-ranking and high-ranking supervisors from seven organic food distributors were interviewed. According to the value perspective, the promotional programs were divided into four types: discount category, member category, free giveaway category, and limited time offer category, which were used to develop the questionnaire questions. In the second stage, 1,017 copies of valid questionnaires were recovered. Findings - The logistic regression analysis was adopted to discuss the impact of the various promotional program actions on consumers' choices. The empirical results indicate that the consumers preferred the programs in the discount category and the free giveaway category, while the programs in the member category and limited time offer category reduced the purchase intention. Originality/value - The stringent qualitative and quantitative design in this study shall serve as a reference for follow-up research. The important implications of the operators' promotion practices are covered in the discussion.","[Liang, Austin Rong-Da] Natl Kaohsiung Univ Hospitality & Tourism, Dept Leisure Recreat & Tourism Management, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Yang, Wan] Calif State Polytech Univ Pomona, Collins Coll Hospitality Management, Pomona, CA 91768 USA; [Chen, Dun-Ji] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Business Adm, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chung, Yu-Fang] Tunghai Univ, Taichung, Taiwan",National Kaohsiung University of Hospitality & Tourism; California State University System; California State Polytechnic University Pomona; National Taiwan Normal University; Tunghai University,"Liang, ARD (通讯作者)，Natl Kaohsiung Univ Hospitality & Tourism, Dept Leisure Recreat & Tourism Management, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",austra@ms53.url.com.tw,"Liang, Austin Rong-Da/AAI-8886-2020; Liang, Austin Rong-Da/AAE-9701-2021; Yang, Wan/N-9498-2015","Liang, Austin Rong-Da/0000-0002-9483-8503; Chung, Yu-Fang/0000-0002-7373-7201",,,,,67,7,8,5,40,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Based on the transaction cost economics theory, the paper focuses on the alignment between CMs and quality requirements. The results were obtained by means of interviews (n = 41) with public and private actors, including the main companies and other stakeholders in the Brazilian pork sector. The research addresses regulations, requirements of customers and supporting CMs used in different transaction contexts. Findings - In the Brazilian pork sector, five transaction contexts can be distinguished: spot market, mini integration, singular cooperative, central cooperative and investor-owned firm. The chain actors apply different CMs to support a set of quality requirements which presents little diversity. The main quality requirements are driven by baseline public regulations. Besides, there are, in particular international, customers with more specific requirements. To support transactions, chain actors use different contracts in terms of resource allocation and price incentives. Originality/value - Literature assumes alignment between governance structures (GSs) and quality standards. This paper further investigates this assumption by analyzing the relationships between CMs (underlying GSs) and quality requirements (underlying quality standards). The research findings show that similar quality requirements may well be supported by different CMs. It further gives indications on why different CMs are used to support a homogeneous set of requirements.","[Martins, Franco Muller; Trienekens, Jacques; Omta, Onno] Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, Management Studies Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Martins, Franco Muller] Brazilian Res Agr Corp EMBRAPA, Concordia, Brazil",Wageningen University & Research,"Martins, FM (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, Management Studies Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.;Martins, FM (通讯作者)，Brazilian Res Agr Corp EMBRAPA, Concordia, Brazil.",franco.martins@embrapa.br,"trienekens, jacques/JFA-0126-2023",,,,,,37,11,12,0,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

However, decision fatigue related to the time of day when respondents answer questionnaires has been largely overlooked in this literature even though time of day related fatigue effects are well known in the psychology literature. The purpose of this paper is to hypothesize that variations in the time of day when respondents answer an online food choice experiment will translate into observable fatigue effects in the food choices. Design/methodology/approach - An empirical SCE concerning food choices is conducted using a web-based questionnaire for interviews in a pre-recruited online panel of consumers. Timestamps collected during the online interviews provide knowledge about the time of day at which each respondent has answered the survey. This information is linked with knowledge from a food sociology survey on typical meal times as well as biophysical research linking food intake to blood sugar and mental energy in order to generate a proxy variable for each respondent's level of mental energy when answering the food choice tasks in the questionnaire. Findings - Results show evidence of a time of day effect on error variance in the stated food choices as well as the subsequently estimated market share predictions. Specifically, respondents provide less consistent answers during the afternoon than at other times of the day. Originality/value - The results indicate that time of day can affect responses to an online survey through increased fatigue and correspondingly less choice consistency. Thus, especially online surveys might account for this in data analysis or even restrict accessibility to the online survey for certain times of day.","[Olsen, Soren Boye; Bonnichsen, Ole] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Fac Life Sci, Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Meyerhoff, Juergen] Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Landscape Architecture & Environm Planning, Berlin, Germany; [Morkbak, Morten Raun] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, Odense, Denmark",University of Copenhagen; Technical University of Berlin; University of Southern Denmark,"Olsen, SB (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Fac Life Sci, Frederiksberg, Denmark.",sobo@ifro.ku.dk,"Olsen, Søren B/M-2949-2014; Meyerhoff, Juergen/M-5640-2019; Bonnichsen, Ole/D-9893-2015","Olsen, Søren B/0000-0002-1278-3749; Meyerhoff, Juergen/0000-0003-4333-8514;",,,,,37,6,6,3,34,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

I agree with,that statement. However, I reject Soderbaum's interpretation that my arguments foster mainstreamed ecological economics or dictatorship. In my critique of sustainability economics, I raised several issues that have remained unspecified and that potentially lead to unsustainable development patterns, once put into practice. Soderbaum does not reply to these conceptual challenges of sustainability economics. In this commentary, I argue that structured pluralism (Dow, 2004) is a constituent element of ecological economics. I welcome Peter Soderbaum's proposal for a discussion about the definition of economics and suggest to rely on Ronald Coase's proposal to define economics as a science that studies the working of the economic system. I conclude that sustainability economics in its current form is closer to neoclassical than ecological economics. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The importance of the change, it has become absolutely understandable especially in business world and especially in the tourism sector, since it is inextricably linked with the survival of the constantly changing competitive environment. The need for direct but effective changes, spurred scientific research, in shaping particularly timely administrative visa, change management.

Are local, organic and GMO-free foods important attributes in the choice of a restaurant? Design/methodology/approach - In order to answer the research questions, a discrete choice experiment was applied. In particular, the authors opted for the application of a latent class model to identify any differences in the behavioural structures of the various consumers. This approach is, in fact, based on the assumption that the choices of the subjects depend on observable and unobservable heterogeneity that vary with factors not directly detectable. Findings - People show different preferences when they choose a restaurant. Regarding the choice experiment, the analysis of the importance of the attributes for the final choice highlights how price and service quality are always considered as the most important ones. The presence of menu with local foods, organic foods and OGM-free products is never decisive for the final choice but it is a very appreciated attribute for almost 30 per cent of consumers. This group of consumers (named local oriented) show a willingness to pay (WTP) of 11 euro for local foods, eight euro for organic products and 3.5 euro for OGM-free ingredients. For the locavores, the likelihood of choosing a restaurant offering local products is three times higher than that of a restaurant not possessing this type of certification, all other conditions being equal. Research limitations/implications - Restaurant owners can differentiate their offerings also considering the local foods and organic products. On the other hand, the restaurants can become powerful marketing channels for local producers. The consumption of organic foods can be increased given the wide WTP displayed. This could positively impact in the promotion of healthier and sustainable diet. Practical implications - The conditions therefore exist for developing a restaurant offer consisting of a basic menu with local foods, capable of integrating in a virtuous manner with the organic farm productions, which keep an eye on sustainable development and the wholesomeness of foods. If this virtuous process takes root in the restaurant sector, it could certainly represent an important opportunity for the agricultural producers as well, especially in the tourist areas. In order for this opportunity to materially be implemented in a development process, it is, however, necessary to develop certifications and brands capable of constituting credible guarantees for the consumer, as well as strengthening the information and communication campaigns among the younger consumers. Social implications - The development of a segment of restaurants that support local foods and organic products would have positive impacts both from the social and territorial point of view. Originality/value - This is the first paper that considers and evaluate the impact of local foods, organic foods and GMO-free foods in the choice of a restaurant. Findings demonstrate how the probability of choosing restaurants that offer local products, compared to the other conditions, is always higher than those focussing on organic or GMO-free products. The choice probability of the restaurant with local products is three times greater than that of a restaurant without local products, all other variables being equal.","[Scozzafava, Gabriele; Casini, Leonardo] Univ Florence, GESAAF, Florence, Italy; [Contini, Caterina; Romano, Caterina] Univ Florence, Dipartimento Gest Sistemi Agr Alimentari & Forest, Florence, Italy",University of Florence; University of Florence,"Scozzafava, G (通讯作者)，Univ Florence, GESAAF, Florence, Italy.",gabriele.scozzafava@unifi.it,"CONTINI, CATERINA/IUO-1064-2023","CONTINI, CATERINA/0000-0003-0626-574X; Scozzafava, Gabriele/0000-0002-2381-9938",,,,,50,18,20,5,41,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

In fact, globalization and the rapid development of information and communication technologies have generated business conditions in which competitiveness is no longer based on traditional resources, such as land, labor and capital, but on intangible resources such as knowledge, ideas and creativity. In this context, the intellectual capital understood as an integrative organizational resource that combines human (individual), structural (organizational) and relational (consumer) capital, which is increasingly treated as a support for the construction and preservation of competitive advantage in the 21st century. Systemic and systematic management of the components of intellectual capital, which should be consistent interaction, allow the creation of synergy effects that acts to secure the necessary competitiveness of enterprises.

Yet, recent studies have shown that the path of dynamic technological changes that has been followed so far is not sufficient any longer. Despite elaborate IT tools and diverse, proven IT project management methodologies, the proportion of dissatisfied clients (organisations) and project failures is too high. These observations prompted the author to analyse the causes of this situation. The client, and his place and role in IT projects, has turned out to be a key element of any IT undertaking. The urge to look at this element in a new way involves the need to fill the gap in IT project management and introduce new processes and mechanisms that would enable the identification of clients' real problems and facilitate a pathway from the problem to the solution. This paper presents the next stage of the author's studies of IT project management. Long years of research work have resulted in an effective IT - business alignment model for IT projects. Its focus is on the client's role, client type identification and the correct selection of an IT project management methodology. Relevant tools and model solutions are proposed. Both the tools and the model have been verified in real-life IT projects. The module for defining and verifying a client's needs is the final element of the model. The aim of this paper is to present the author's proposal to apply a method from a different subject area, so as to achieve a better IT - business alignment, which should be the primary goal of any IT project. This is the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving method - TRIZ. It offers tools and rules that enable changes in the weakest spots of IT project management. With an approach like this, it will be possible to improve IT sector flexibility towards business and generate better IT project deliverables, thereby increasing the success rate of IT projects. Consequently, organisations - recipients and users of IT project deliverables - will be able to better cope with the growing demands and expectations of their environment and with dynamic changes on the market.","[Wozniak, Monika] Univ Gdansk, Fac Management, Dept Business Informat, Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; University of Gdansk,"Wozniak, M (通讯作者)，Univ Gdansk, Fac Management, Dept Business Informat, Gdansk, Poland.",monika.wozniak@ug.edu.pl,"Woźniak, Monika/AAR-5301-2021","Woźniak, Monika/0000-0002-7757-0410",,,,,29,0,0,0,0,UNIV WROCLAW,WROCLAW,"PL UNIWERSYTECKI 1, WROCLAW, 50-137, POLAND",,,978-83-64389-64-1,ICT MAN GLO COM EC G,,,2017,,,,,,,99,116,,,,,,18,Development Studies; Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BP9OZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000570154500007,0

It has been argued that the CF operates as a boundary object, a communication and organisation tool for those working across diverse knowledge systems, designed to help them reach shared goals. The paper focuses on this claim, exploring the three core characteristics of a boundary object: interpretive flexibility, material and organisational structure, and the recognition of dissention. We suggest that too much emphasis is placed within the CF upon interpretive flexibility, whilst meeting information needs and the work requirements of all individuals, groups and communities who use the CF are overlooked. By forcing consensus, the IPBES CF ignores the critical dimensions of a boundary object. We argue that embracing the full characteristics of a boundary object will enable the IPBES to support knowledge coproduction and translation across the knowledge systems, better achieving its goal of providing policy advice.","[Dunkley, Ria] Univ Glasgow, Coll Social Sci, Sch Educ, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Baker, Susan] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Sch Social Sci, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Baker, Susan; Constant, Natasha; Sanderson-Bellamy, Angelina] Cardiff Univ, Sustainable Pl Res Inst, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Constant, Natasha] Univ Venda, Sch Math & Nat Sci, South African Res Chair Biodivers & Value Change, Private Bag X5050, ZA-0950 Thohoyandou, South Africa",University of Glasgow; Cardiff University; Cardiff University; University of Venda,"Dunkley, R (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Coll Social Sci, Sch Educ, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",ria.dunkley@glasgow.ac.uk,"Constant, Natasha/JFK-5620-2023","Constant, Natasha/0000-0002-1910-6791; Sanderson Bellamy, Angelina/0000-0001-7081-3750; Dunkley, Ria/0000-0003-0238-7344",,,,,69,18,19,2,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

We modeled and analyzed the potential capacity of the GDS to sequester C under four management scenarios: no management, no management with catastrophic fire, current management, and increased management. The analysis uses the Land Use and Carbon Scenario Simulator developed for the GDS to estimate net ecosystem C balance. The model simulates net C gains and losses on an annual time-step from 2013 through 2062 which is converted to carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) and monetized using the Interagency Working Group's Social Cost of Carbon. Our analysis incorporates compounded uncertainty including variation in ecological processes, temporal and spatial heterogeneity, and uncertainty in the discount rate. The no management scenario results in 2.4 million tons of CO2 emissions with a Net Present Value (NPV) under a 3% discount rate of -$67 million. No management with catastrophic fires emits 6.5 million tons of CO2 with an NPV of - $232 million. Current management avoids 9.9 million tons of emissions (via sequestration) with an NPV of $326 million.

Since then the focus of academic attention has been on global forest governance by an international forest regime complex consisting of several forest-related regimes. This strong focus leaves a research gap regarding regional regimes addressing forests as an issue area, which recently greatly gained in empirical and academic relevance. It is particularly important to understand the institutional structures on the one hand, and the policies developed within such regimes on the other. In order to obtain a better understanding of this in the forest case, the aim of this article is to analyse the institutional design of three regional forest regimes and to develop fields and hypotheses for future research. We built upon the rational design of international institutions framework developed by Koremenos et al. (Int Organ 55(4):761-799, 2001), and based our findings on content analysis of key documents as well as participant observations and expert interviews in selected occasions. The regional regimes chosen for this study were Amazonian, the Central African and pan-European forest cooperation. The results indicate that the designs of the three regimes greatly differ regarding membership, scope, control, centralisation, and flexibility. This seems to be mainly due to differing degrees of formality of the regimes (from treaty to non-treaty to hybrid regimes) as well as different power structures amongst members and regional hegemons involved. Based on our findings, future research fields for the study of regional forest-related environmental, trade, commodity, and management regime structures as well as regime policies are identified. Such insights advance our understanding of international forest governance not only by global, but by regional forest regimes as well. This is particularly true for our understanding that similar issue-specific problems, such as sustainable forest management, in terms of regime structures and regime policies may be addressed quite differently, largely depending on the preferences of regional powers and hegemons and other potential region-specific factors.

This method assesses the positive and negative impacts of designations of protected areas. Economic assets and social goods are the two integrated variables used in analysing the method. The first includes economic impacts on the local gross domestic product of defining protected areas, and the second considers the benefits of this designation in the conservation of water resources, assigning a monetary value to the preserved resources. In addition, tools have been incorporated, such as payment for hydrological services and generation of permissible activities, which reduce negative social impacts through positive economic impacts. These tools can only be used when compliance with conservation requirements for protected areas is demonstrated. The conclusions of this study include an application of the proposed methodology and provide essential and specific assessments that show that this methodology fulfils the requirements of the European Water Framework Directive requirements and that it is an effective tool in the implementation and development of strategies for hydrological planning processes.","[Jimenez-Madrid, A.] Tech Univ Civil Engn Bucharest, Groundwater Engn Res Ctr, Bucharest, Romania; [Gomez, S.] Canal Isabel II, Santan Engracia 125, Madrid, Spain; [Gemar, G.] Univ Malaga, Campus Univ Teatinos, Malaga, Spain; [Martinez, C.] Geol Survey Spain, Calle Rios Rosas 19, Madrid, Spain",Technical University of Civil Engineering of Bucharest (UTCB); Universidad de Malaga,"Jiménez-Madrid, A (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Civil Engn Bucharest, Groundwater Engn Res Ctr, Bucharest, Romania.",gerencia@proamb.es,"Gemar, German/N-6650-2013; Gómez, Sergio/Z-1726-2019","Gemar, German/0000-0002-2900-3489; Gómez, Sergio/0000-0002-3064-9834",,,,,18,3,3,1,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

We conducted a case study of the flagship Chambok CBET program in Cambodia to quantify the contribution of CBET to household income and livelihood changes for CBET and non-CBET members. We conducted an interview survey of 173 households (77 CBET and 96 non-CBET members) that were selected systematically from every two households along roads within the same villages. There was no significant difference between the total income of member and non-member households; the median CBET income was 1.22 USD per month, which is only 1.65% of the total income. The inequality of income from CBET among the CBET members was higher than that from other income sources. The perceptions of livelihood changes differed considerably before and after the establishment of the Chambok CBET program, although this difference was not attributed to CBET but rather to general socioeconomic changes in the country. We conclude that it is challenging to employ CBET to achieve poverty reduction and livelihood improvement.","[Lonn, Pichdara] Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Bioresource & Bioenvironm Sci, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; [Mizoue, Nobuya; Yoshida, Shigejiro] Kyushu Univ, Fac Agr, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; [Ota, Tetsuji] Kyushu Univ, Inst Decis Sci Sustainable Soc, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; [Kajisa, Tsuyoshi] Kagoshima Univ, Fac Agr, Kagoshima 8908580, Japan",Kyushu University; Kyushu University; Kyushu University; Kagoshima University,"Mizoue, N (通讯作者)，Kyushu Univ, Fac Agr, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan.",mizoue@agr.kyushu-u.ac.jp,"Ota, Tetsuji/HTS-4236-2023; Mizoue, Nobuya/HOI-0737-2023; Alves, Juliano/GQO-7605-2022","Ota, Tetsuji/0000-0002-6274-5062;",JST-RISTEX for Future Earth,JST-RISTEX for Future Earth,This work was supported by a grant from JST-RISTEX for Future Earth.,,32,32,37,0,67,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

The pre-industrial period (1750-1850) is for the first time examined for Sweden at the national level. The study uses a random sample of probate inventories from urban and rural areas across the country, adjusted for age and social class. Estimates are provided for the years 1750, 1800, 1850, and 1900. The results show a gradual growth in inequality as early as the mid-eighteenth century, with the sharpest rise in the late nineteenth century. Whereas the early growth in inequality was connected to changes in the countryside and in agriculture, the later growth was related to industrialization encompassing both compositional effects and strong wealth accumulation among the richest. The level of inequality in Sweden in 1750 was lower than for other western European countries, but by 1900 Sweden was just as unequal.","[Bengtsson, Erik; Missiaia, Anna; Olsson, Mats; Svensson, Patrick] Lund Univ, Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Bengtsson, E (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Lund, Sweden.",erik.bengtsson@ekh.lu.se,,"Missiaia, Anna/0000-0002-4872-1865; Bengtsson, Erik/0000-0003-1523-0565; Svensson, Patrick/0000-0002-7143-416X",Swedish Research Council; Handelsbankens forskningsstiftelser,Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Handelsbankens forskningsstiftelser,"This article has been presented at conferences and workshops 2015-17 in Telford, Kyoto, Odense, Groningen, Milan, Oslo, and Canberra.

In South Asia, CT has spread dramatically over the last decade, a result of strong policy support and increasing availability of appropriate machinery. Although many studies have analyzed the yield and profitability of CT systems, the technical efficiency impacts accrued by farmers utilizing CT have received considerably less attention. Employing a DEA framework, we isolated bias-corrected meta-frontier technical efficiencies and meta-technology ratios of three CT options adopted by wheat farmers in Bangladesh, including bed planting (BP), power tiller operated seeding (PTOS), and strip tillage (ST), compared to a control group of farmers practicing traditional tillage (TT). Endogenous switching regression was subsequently employed to overcome potential self-selection bias in the choice of CT, in order to robustly estimate efficiency factors. Among the tillage options studied, PTOS was the most technically efficient, with an average meta-technology ratio of 0.90, followed by BP (0.88), ST (0.83), and TT (0.67). The average predicted meta-frontier technical efficiency for the CT non-adopters under a counterfactual scenario (0.80) was significantly greater (P = 0.00) than current TE scores (0.65), indicating the potential for sizeable profitability increases with CT adoption. Conversely, the counterfactual TE of non-adopters was 23% greater than their DEA efficiency, also indicating efficiency gains from CT adoption. Our results provide backing for agricultural development programs in South Asia that aim to increase smallholder farmers' income through the application of CT as a pathway towards poverty reduction.","[Aravindakshan, Sreejith] Wageningen Univ, Farming Syst Ecol Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Aravindakshan, Sreejith; Rossi, Frederick; Krupnik, Timothy J.] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Rossi, Frederick] Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL USA; [Amjath-Babu, T.

It utilizes a nationwide survey consisting of detailed questionnaires related to household welfare and employs instrumental variable (IV) approach to investigate the linkage between community-managed forests and food consumption in Nepal. Results show that households that use community managed forests for firewood spend significantly more on food consumption than those dependent on government-managed forests. The study further finds that community-managed forest users appear to be more participatory and are more likely to find their food consumption adequate. Together, these results provide compelling evidence that community-managed forests can be an effective means of addressing food insecurity in a developing country setting.","[Paudel, Jayash] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Resource Econ, 80 Campus Ctr Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Paudel, J (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Resource Econ, 80 Campus Ctr Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",jpaudel@umass.edu,,"Paudel, Jayash/0000-0003-3430-7943",,,,,71,22,23,1,25,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

In almost all scenarios GEST assessments underestimated emission reductions compared with direct measurements. Including direct measurements was lucrative in > 50%, of all vegetation scenario/rewetting cost combinations with net profits ranging from EUR 8.18 to 26.31 per certificate. Profitability was achieved at rewetting costs of EUR 5400 ha(-1) upward. More sophisticated GHG measurements became profitable at twice the rewetting costs.

In this paper we explore whether aggregate analyses are likely to mask different responses of the components (export and import, government consumption, investment and private consumption) of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). To this end, we assembled a panel data set of hurricane strikes and national income accounting data for 21 Caribbean countries for the period 1970-2011. We used a panel Vector Autoregressive (VARX) model to take account of the direct impact of the storm shocks and any feedback mechanisms. Our results suggest that the responses on each GDP component differ widely, where we find some effects on export, import, public consumption, investment and private consumption. However, the differences in timing and directions of these impacts demonstrate why it may be difficult to find any clear and large net aggregate impact of hurricanes and natural disasters in general on GDP.","[Mohan, Preeya S.] Univ West Indies, Sir Arthur Lewis Inst Social & Econ Studies, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago; [Ouattara, Bazoumana] Univ Manchester, Global Dev Inst, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Strobl, Eric] Univ Bern, Dept Econ, Bern, Switzerland; [Strobl, Eric] Univ Bern, OCCR, Bern, Switzerland",University West Indies Mona Jamaica; University West Indies Saint Augustine; University of Manchester; University of Bern; University of Bern,"Mohan, PS (通讯作者)，Univ West Indies, Sir Arthur Lewis Inst Social & Econ Studies, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago.",preeya.mohan@sta.uwi.edu,,"Mohan, Preeya/0000-0003-3333-7198",,,,,45,24,27,1,26,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

It directly addresses Sustainable Development Goal 15.9, in which countries have agreed to integrate ecosystem values into national planning. The community of practice for national ecosystem accounting includes not only the international and national researchers who develop such a framework, but also the national analysts who implement it and the decision makers who apply it. To foster convergence within this community on such a common measurement platform, it is first necessary to understand the issues of divergence of values and preferences among the diverse and international ethical perspectives, disciplines and roles involved. A cluster analysis of a survey of 131 expert stakeholders in national ecosystem accounting reveals agreement within this community on the need for broadening the scope, addressing multiple decision contexts and mainstreaming national ecosystem accounting in national planning. The most important sources of divergence in this community of practice are attributed to ethical positions regarding monetization of ecosystem services, differences in the interpretation of several core concepts, such as biodiversity and ecosystem services, and the role of spatial analysis.

Design/methodology/approach Primary data of 1,152 households were collected. The extent of food deficiency was measured using dietary intake assessment method (seven days). Value at Risk (VaR) and conditional Value at Risk (cVaR), a method widely used for risk analysis in financial institutes, were applied to assess the vulnerability to food insecurity. Findings In total, 23 percent of the sample households were measured as food deficient. The VaR and cVaR results identified that the lowest 3 percentiles (up to 30 percent) were at risk to become food deficient without any seasonal shortages. In case of shocks, up till sixth percentiles (60 percent) will be as at risk of food deficiency. This study suggests that multi-period data, at least quarterly, are required to predict vulnerability. It is suggested that a blanket policy is not a good approach. Once the most vulnerable households are identified, a targeted approach must be opted. Originality/value Generalizing the results of one week's calorie calculations may produce biased results that may mislead the policy process. A multi-period data collection is costly and cumbersome. The application of VaR and cVaR helps overcome this issue. Furthermore, this is one of the initial studies to apply these methods to food security analysis.","[Bashir, Muhammad Khalid; Ali, Ghaffar] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Inst Agr & Resource Econ, Faisalabad, Pakistan; [Schilizzi, Steven; Sadler, Rohan] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Environm, Perth, WA, Australia; [Ali, Ghaffar] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Urban Environm, Key Lab Urban Environm & Hlth, Xiamen, Peoples R China","University of Agriculture Faisalabad; University of Western Australia; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Urban Environment, CAS","Bashir, MK (通讯作者)，Univ Agr Faisalabad, Inst Agr & Resource Econ, Faisalabad, Pakistan.",khalid450@uaf.edu.pk; steven.schilizzi@uwa.edu.au; rohan.sadler@astron.com.au; dgali@uaf.edu.pk,"CAS, KLUEH/T-5743-2019; Bashir, Muhammad Khalid Khalid/H-9729-2014; Ali, Ghaffar/H-8088-2019","Bashir, Muhammad Khalid Khalid/0000-0001-5572-2666; Ali, Ghaffar/0000-0002-6055-2371; Schilizzi, Steven/0000-0002-4063-074X",,,,,62,4,4,3,23,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The excess refers to social sciences, in particular the field of economics. It should be noted that the notion of education in economics in the Republic of Croatia covers both macroeconomic and microeconomic areas. These programmes are carried out at business schools, faculties and departments of economics of Croatian universities. Along with this misperception, the general public disregards the fact that in practice many business operation tasks are frequently performed by people with non-economic backgrounds. One of the reasons for this situation is the failure of professional organisations to campaign for legal protection of their profession through well-defined educational frameworks and making the membership in the Chamber of Economists a precondition for working as an economist. On the other hand, there is a wide-spread view that the system of education in economics is of poor quality, and therefore graduates are incapable of performing a wide range of tasks in the economic/business domain. Looking only at higher education, this general view is reflected in the situation where other higher education institutions have started teaching traditionally economic courses (e.g. Agricultural Economics at faculties of agriculture or Financial and Actuarial Mathematics at mathematics departments). In addition to these direct encroachments, there are also indirect ones, such as when faculties of electrical engineering in their computer science programmes educate information managers. In the modern digital age, knowledge is more than ever the primary business resource. In these circumstances, the question is how to protect the dignity of both the economic profession and higher education in economics in the Republic of Croatia. It seems that the best and most urgently needed solution would be to change the quality paradigm of higher education in economics in the Republic of Croatia. To achieve this, we must strive to design and build a high-quality system of education in economics that will be capable of providing optimum education for the new digital age.","[Dukic, Branimir] Fac Econ Osijek, Trg Ljudevita Gaja 7, Osijek, Croatia; [Kozina, Goran] Univ North, 104 Brigade 1, Varazhdin, Croatia; [Dukic, Stojanka] duxMiss Doo Osijek, Dalmatinska 21, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek; University North - Croatia,"Dukic, B (通讯作者)，Fac Econ Osijek, Trg Ljudevita Gaja 7, Osijek, Croatia.",bdukic@efos.hr; gokozina@unin.hr; dux-mission@os.t-com.hr,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,2,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,280,289,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900029,0

Design/methodology/approach This paper uses the Decision Support System for food Security Strategy and Supply Management (DSS-ESSA) to simulate whether a country with as low a level of self-sufficiency (around 60 per cent) as Switzerland would theoretically be capable of supplying its own population with a sufficient quantity of domestically produced food. The authors try to estimate the short-term and long-term impacts of the missing imports of food and feed on the energy supply in Switzerland. Findings Findings are summarised as follows. Starting with the long-term impact, the results show that in the long-term an energy supply of 2,340kcal/person/day would be possible if the appropriate available cultivated area and optimised production existed. However, in the short-time, the potential and the time required to adapt and expand agricultural production depends primarily on the crop-rotation land available and on the existing infrastructure.

In order to achieve this aim, the results of our own surveys were carried out among 115 entrepreneurs associated in various types of associations operating in the rural areas of the eastern region. The motivations to start the agritourist activity of the respondents, the conditions of conducting such activity and the support or lack thereof in the entrepreneur's environment were assessed. According to the analysis, the desire to start and continue agritourism activity is largely driven by a favorable environment both in the social and natural sphere. Agritourism is perceived as a positive factor in the advertising and enrichment of a given region, so it should be supported not only by the neighboring agritourism owner but also by the regional authorities. It should be assumed that as a result of relatively more fmancial and educational assistance for farmers, there will be an increased interest in starting development initiatives for agribusiness activities among the inhabitants of the region.","[Golebiewska, Barbara; Stefanczyk, Joanna] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Golebiewska, B (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Warsaw, Poland.",barbara_golebiewska@sggw.pl; joanna_stefanczyk@sggw.pl,"Stefańczyk, Joanna/HLW-7375-2023; Gołębiewska, Barbara BG/F-3535-2019; Stefańczyk, Joanna/GON-8364-2022","Stefańczyk, Joanna/0000-0001-5258-4894; Golebiewska, Barbara/0000-0003-4073-5274",,,,,22,0,0,1,4,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-6059,2464-6067,978-80-7435-700-8,HRADEC ECON DAYS,,,2018,8.0,,1,,,,275,285,,,,,,11,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL2ZZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000449443500027,0

Parties can enter into an out-of-court settlement to resolve disputes between them, but only within a framework set forth by the state. A court or out-of-court settlement appears as a tool only in modern states which centralize the political power, keeping it away from other parties. One of the basic effects of a court settlement is effectiveness. Effectiveness is an instrument aimed at realizing a specific legal value - legal certainty. Furthermore, a court settlement is intended for the accomplishment of another legal goal - peace. While being an alternative to the mediation procedure itself, a court settlement is primarily an alternative way of dispute resolution. A court settlement (res judicaliter transacta) is based on an agreement that regulates the civil-law relations between the parties, implies the effects of an effective judgment and is concluded before the competent court in writing in either contentious or non-contentious proceedings. Due to the fact that a court settlement entails the effects of an effective court decision, it can be subject to some principles of ordinary court proceedings. However, one principle can be applied in its full scope - the principle of judicial efficiency. It requires from court proceedings to be as cost-effective and short as possible. If a court settlement is concluded prior to the initiation of ordinary court proceeding and the latter is thus prevented, it will come to the greatest possible cost- and timesaving. If the proceeding is initiated, but a court settlement is reached in the meanwhile, the costs and course of the proceedings will be reduced to a certain level. The paper has the following structure: after a brief introduction elaborating the concept, legal nature and scope of a court settlement, the main part analyses its effects, putting the emphasis both on effectiveness as an instrument for ensuring legal certainty and peace, and on the principle of judicial efficiency as a top priority principle incorporated in the court settlement concept.","[Harasic, Zaklina; Kersic, Marin] Univ Split, Fac Law, Split, Croatia",University of Split,"Harasic, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Fac Law, Split, Croatia.",zaklina.harasic@prayst.hr; marin.kersic@prayst.hr,,,,,,,14,0,0,3,4,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,544,551,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Law",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies; Government & Law,BP1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540727600062,0

The aim of this paper is to conduct research on maintenance of unclassified roads and expenses. The data was collected from individual reports on maintenance of unclassified roads that were prepared within the conducted performance audits for areas of individual counties. The collected data was consolidated, analysed and a conclusion about the efficiency of maintenance of unclassified roads in areas of all local self-government units was made. The assumption is that counties differ significantly by share of expenses for maintenance of unclassified roads in total expenses and expenditures, total length of unclassified roads and realised expenses for maintenance of unclassified roads per kilometre of road. This paper consolidates data from individual reports on county surface area, number of inhabitants, total length of unclassified roads, calculates the density of unclassified roads (in metres per square kilometre) and the length of unclassified roads (in metres per inhabitant), and performs comparison between counties. Total realised expenses for maintenance of unclassified roads in 2012 are shown, which include realisation of all local self-government units within counties. From the presented data, conclusions are made on different shares of expenses for maintenance of unclassified roads within the available budgetary resources, their relation to the length of unclassified roads, and the activities that need to be taken in order to increase the efficiency of maintenance of unclassified roads are indicated.

The aim of the paper is to highlight the challenges of inclusion asylum seekers and refugees face. The descriptive analysis is based on the literature review.

The paper conceptualises the terms of an asylum seeker and a refugee, gives insight into the dimensions and problems of social exclusion and inclusion, and analyses the experience of a Syrian family in case of inclusion into Latvian society. From the interview, it appears that the main problems faced by refugees are the lack of adequate financial resources, lack of awareness of their rights and legislative aspects, and insufficient Latvian language skills for adult family members. The integration of refugees into society is largely influenced by their own motivation as well as the available support.","[Millere, Jolanta; Dobelniece, Signe] Latvia Univ Life Sci & Technol, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Millere, J; Dobelniece, S (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Life Sci & Technol, Jelgava, Latvia.",Jolanta.Millere@llu.lv; Signe.Dobelniece@llu.lv,"Millere, Jolanta/AAC-5653-2020; Dobelniece, Signe/AAB-5820-2020","Millere, Jolanta/0000-0003-4713-9512; Dobelniece, Signe/0000-0001-8456-0440",,,,,10,0,2,1,10,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9984-48-294-1,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2018,49.0,,,,,,349,355,,10.22616/ESRD.2018.153,0.0,,,7,Development Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO1ZQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503493500041,0

The purpose of this paper is to provide estimates of the effects on trade of stockholding programs designed specifically to meet a food security objective. Design/methodology/approach A spatial-temporal trade model is developed and then the effects of stockholding policies which satisfy food security goals are simulated and compared to the case where stockholdings are not allowed. Findings The results suggest that if stockholding policies that satisfy food security goals are allowed in the case of all importing countries and all G-33 developing countries trade will increase significantly during the stock acquisition phase but will have a negative impact on trade during stock disposal. If stockholding policies are restricted to small high food security risk countries, however, the impacts on trade would not be large enough to be of international concern. Originality/value The results suggests that a permanent solution at the WTO might lie in exemptions for small high food security risk countries rather than a one size fits all rule applied to all developing countries. Trade policy makers have been charged with finding a permanent solution to the issue of subsidized public stockholdings for food security purposes but have been hampered, in part, by a dearth of empirical estimates of the effect of such stockholdings on trade.

According to the size ofthe property fund Croatia is one ofthe richest countries ofthe European Union, while according to the management and usage method within the poorer ones. All the state property is not registered at one place, its condition is unknown as well as its value and the way it can be put into function. The present state property register, the so called state register, is incomplete, for certain forms of property insufficient, and there is no registry for some forms of property at all. The state has been searching for the best model of a real estate management for already twenty years. In the meantime it sells (sells-off), with lots of problems its best real estate parts. If the aim ofthe state property activation is only the decrease of the public debt, then it is a short-term policy which results in the non-recurring flow of funds to the state budget. Croatia needs the best model ofan integral real estate management in order to put the real estate into function and fill the state budget, not nonrecurring, but for a long-term period. This requires certain institutional changes. The aim ofthe work is to indentify general preconditions for an effective state property management, such as establishing of a unique state property register, classification of state property and costs and income management, in order to fulfill the needs ofthe economic development to the best possible way. With the real estate management of a better quality through the establishment of aclosed state property fund from which the real estate would be given into a long-term concession, the state could achieve a long term income.","[Ozbolt, Vesna Skare] Fac Econ, Trg Ljudevita Gaja 7, Osijek, Croatia",,"Ozbolt, VS (通讯作者)，Fac Econ, Trg Ljudevita Gaja 7, Osijek, Croatia.",vesna.skareozbolt@gmail.com,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,481,488,,,,,,8,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900050,0

In this respect turbulent environment and the need to adjust to such conditions play a decisive role. Often changes are triggered by internal factors. The purpose of changes is to obtain better results on a competitive market and increase operational effectiveness in the areas the change concerns. Irrespective of the main area it affects, each change sparks off internal relations. Consequently it impacts on interrelations among various areas and thus complicates the evaluation of the change management course and effectiveness. Difficulties are also observable in the selection and application of measures that are used to evaluate change management, thus change effectiveness is often evaluated intuitively. The aim of this paper is to identify main main change areas in big enterprises and evaluate their effectiveness. In management practice managers in detail define change areas, while the evaluation of the progress and efficiency level of change management is relatively high. Conclusions drawn in this paper are based on the analysis of results of the research conducted in 2017 on a representative sample of 37 big industrial enterprises.

The purpose of this paper is to explore which consumer groups exist based on both their fruit and vegetable consumption level and their health-related motive orientations (HRMO), and to compare the revealed consumer clusters regarding their fruit and vegetable product attribute importance. Design/methodology/approach - In the Netherlands an online panel survey was carried out resulting in 1,296 respondents. The clusters based on HRMO and fruit and vegetable intake are profiled with respect to demographics and product attribute importance. Findings - Cluster analysis revealed six homogeneous consumer clusters with different HRMO and fruit and vegetable consumption levels. In addition, these clusters show a different socio-demographic profile and differ in their importance ratings of fruit and vegetable product attributes. Practical implications - The results show that health is a multidimensional construct suggesting that there is a need for addressing health in interventions and campaigns in a more tailored approach. Originality/value - This study shows that the combination of both usage- and psychographic segmentation variables provide valuable and interesting information that give insights in addressing different target groups. Moreover, this study elaborates on previous research by showing that health is a multidimensional construct and that Dutch consumers differ in their HRMO.","[Raaijmakers, Ireen; Sijtsema, Siet; Snoek, Harriette] Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen Econ Res, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Labrie, Caroline] Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen Plant Res, Bleiswijk, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"Raaijmakers, I (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen Econ Res, Wageningen, Netherlands.",ireen.raaijmakers@wur.nl,"Snoek, Harriette M./E-8080-2013","Snoek, Harriette/0000-0002-7636-3700; Sijtsema, Siet/0000-0001-7599-559X",Top Sector Horticultural and Starting Materials (TU) programme; Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs,"Top Sector Horticultural and Starting Materials (TU) programme; Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs(Ministry of Economic Affairs, Netherlands)",There were no conflicts of interest.

The society today expects proven efficacy and safety of drugs and medical treatments. Thus, clinical trials are viewed as a corner stone of evidence-based medicine. General public is still insufficiently informed about the importance and methodology regarding clinical trials, so the potential of this branch of medicine is still not sufficiently exploited and directed at the growth of the national economy, although state and hospitals can greatly benefit from involvement in clinical trials. Clinical trials are not only a new revenue stream for the state and hospitals but also the opportunity to provide new medicine to patients and save their lives. Recruiting patients for clinical trials is an exceptional area within the life sciences industry, however, the current methodologies employed are inefficient to the point that the appearance of new products on the market is seriously impeded, a fact which leads to significant reduction in state and corporate profits. We examined the factors that could affect public awareness and thus influence individuals to participate in clinical trials. Many studies have already assessed why respondents agree or decline to participate in clinical trials. Using a paper-based questionnaire, the present study investigated general knowledge about clinical trials in a group of patients being treated at the Unit of Clinical Pharmacology of the University Hospital Center Zagreb, and compared it to a group of healthyindividuals, using the same questionnaire publicly available in electronic format, to better understand the attitudes of Croatian general public regarding conduct of and participation in clinical trials. Croatian physicians and patients have been participating in international clinical trials for more than twenty years, but the capacity for clinical trial participation and related economic benefits have not reached their full potential.","[Sataic, Ivana] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Trg Lj Gaja 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia; [Likic, Robert] Univ Zagreb, Sch Med, Salata3, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Vranesevic, Tihomir] Univ Zagreb, Sch Business & Econ, Trg JF Kennedyja 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek; University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb,"Sataic, I (通讯作者)，JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Trg Lj Gaja 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",ivana.sataic@gmail.com; robert.likic@mef.hr; tvranesevic@efzg.hr,"Likic, Robert/J-6401-2019","Likic, Robert/0000-0003-1413-4862",,,,,12,0,0,1,8,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,169,177,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900017,0

The public procurement procedure implemented in compliance with all the principles of public procurement, in particular the principles of transparency and cost-efficiency, in current circumstances in the Republic of Croatia, can restore the public confidence in the system, i.e in fair and rational spending system of budget funds. The unified procurement system is increasingly developing, which is also important in terms of saving and enhancement of good practice. Recently, the quality management in the public procurement system becomes a key element of the anticorruption segment. It is necessary to r implement the quality management system as better as possible through self-control and correction of errors in the system in order to make the public procurement system at universities more transparent and quality and to make the end users more satisfied with the procurements.

Some label ES as boundary objects that help integrate diverse forms of knowledge across social groups and organizational scales. However, this classification masks complexities that arise from unique characteristics of ES types (i.e., provisioning, regulating, and cultural), which influence their ability to function as boundary objects. We argue that interpretive flexibility and material structures interact in distinct ways across ES types throughout a boundary object life cycle. Viewing a 2015 U.S. federal memorandum as a catalyst, we critically evaluate the evolution of ES and its role as a boundary object. We propose that provisioning and regulating services are transitioning out of boundary object status, moving into a more standardized state. However, we anticipate that cultural services may continue to behave as boundary objects if collaborators maintain them as such. This shift in the functionality of ES as boundary objects is an important consideration for future research that attempts to reach across social worlds and disciplinary perspectives. We urge collaborations to rely on the most relevant disciplinary knowledge, rather than allowing the ease of standardized solutions to dictate the boundary of a given problem. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The format relates to how the food parcels are distributed, the content to the usability of the food products and whether additional products currently not offered are required by the beneficiaries. Design/methodology/approach The research is based on a qualitative study at a selected food charity in Ghent, using a semi-structured in-depth interview with 30 respondents who receive food parcels. Findings The food parcel beneficiaries report the need for freedom of choice regarding the offered food products (format). Fixed food parcels should be avoided. Also a need for more vegetables, milk, fresh (halal) meat and meat products was expressed (content), even though the charity purchased a great deal of additional standard food products to provide nutritious and varied food parcels. It should be further investigated whether other donation systems such as social groceries or restaurants meet the needs of the beneficiaries to a greater extent, or whether certain adjustments such as purchasing even more standard food products are possible to uphold. Originality/value To the authors' knowledge this research is one of the first scientific studies addressing the needs of food parcel receivers in Belgium. It forms a basis for investigating which type of food donation answers best to the needs of the beneficiaries in Belgium or in other countries.","[Stepman, Elif; Uyttendaele, Mieke; De Boeck, Elien; Jacxsens, Liesbeth] Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Food Safety & Food Qual, Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Stepman, E (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Food Safety & Food Qual, Ghent, Belgium.",elif.stepman@gmail.com; mieke.uyttendaele@ugent.be; Elien.DeBoeck@ugent.be; Liesbeth.Jacxsens@Ugent.be,"JACXSENS, LIESBETH JAN ARLETTE/JQI-7501-2023","JACXSENS, LIESBETH JAN ARLETTE/0000-0003-2545-1441",,,,,30,3,3,0,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The years considered are 1995 and 2007 and the socio-economic and environmental data included in the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) are used to provide consistent comparisons between countries. The analyses are performed by considering the entire society (Level N), the household and the paid sectors (Level N-1) and the different economic sectors (Level N-2). The main results show that, despite the differences existing between countries, the increasing energy throughput and per capita consumption contributed to change the metabolic profile of the countries considered in this paper.

Due to inter temporal nature of fisheries extraction activities, standard economic theory suggests that an individual's time preference can play a major role in determining the gear choice decision. Based on earlier theoretical work we identify two ways in which individual time preferences can impact the adoption of destructive extraction methods; (i) the conservation effect which posits that patient individuals (as indicated by relatively high discount factor) are less likely to use destructive extraction methods since they are more likely to account for the loss of future income that is accompanied by using these methods, (ii) the disinvestment effect which argues that patient individuals are more likely to use destructive extraction methods since they have greater investment capability. Using an agent-based model we clarify the conditions under which one of these effects is more dominant than the other one. Our model suggests that the nature of destructive gear along with the level of social dilemma determines whether patient or impatient individuals (relatively lower discount factor) are more likely to adopt such a gear. Additionally agent's beliefs regarding future resource condition and other agent's extraction level can have a major influence in some cases. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Fragmentation of multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) has challenged implementation due to disconnects and inconsistencies between regimes that causes inefficiencies, overlapping norms, and duplication. Since the late 1990s, there have been proposals to cluster MEAs organizationally and functionally to create synergies between them. This paper evaluates whether the proposition on clustering of MEAs has worked in practice through an empirical case study of the MEA Regional Enforcement Network (REN). MEA REN sought to cluster at the organizational and functional elements of the Basel Convention, the Rotterdam Convention, the Stockholm Convention, and the Montreal Protocol in South and Southeast Asia. Regarding organizational clustering, through co-organizing regional network meetings cross-MEA learning was enhanced and costs were saved, but co-locating regional offices proved more challenging. For the clustering of functional elements, MEA enforcement was ultimately strengthened through several joint initiatives across MEAs. However, not all functions could be clustered as anticipated, including data reporting due to incompatibility between the conventions and overall workloads. The paper concludes with recommendations for future environmental enforcement.","[Liu, Ning] United Nations Environm Programme, Northwest Pacifi Act Plan NOWPAP, Reg Coordinating Unit, 216 Gijanghaean Ro, Busan 619705, South Korea; [Middleton, Carl] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Polit Sci, Ctr Social Dev Studies, Henri Dunant Rd, Bangkok, Thailand",Chulalongkorn University,"Liu, N (通讯作者)，United Nations Environm Programme, Northwest Pacifi Act Plan NOWPAP, Reg Coordinating Unit, 216 Gijanghaean Ro, Busan 619705, South Korea.",liuning_rilo@yahoo.com; Carl.Chulalongkorn@gmail.com,,"Liu, Ning/0000-0003-2029-1311; Middleton, Carl/0000-0001-5327-3748",,,,,38,2,2,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Such payments are offered by a conservation agency to landowners subject to the condition that the conserved land is sufficiently connected to other conserved land. Facing this connectivity condition, landowners with conservation costs below the payment may need to offer some of their surplus through side payments to other landowners with high costs so that these conserve their land and the connectivity condition is met. Previous papers that modelled side payments in agglomeration payment schemes ignored that landowners may be sensitive to fairness and distributional issues. To incorporate fairness issues I relate a model of an agglomeration payment scheme to the well-known ultimatum game and show that if landowners are concerned about fairness and distribution the agency must offer higher payments and has to expect lower levels of cost-effectiveness.

In order to make proper causal inference, we rely on historical instruments and control for all other transportation modes that could be complement or substitute to the RER. Our results show that proximity to an RER station increases employment and population density and, in particular, employment and population growth. The latter effects are higher in municipalities located near RER stations and close to employment (sub)centers. They are also found to be particularly strong for jobs in the service sector, for factory workers, and for highly educated population. We find no impact of the RER expansion on employment growth during the first part of the period, while the effect on population growth appears earlier but declines over time.","[Garcia-Lopez, Miquel-Angel] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain; [Garcia-Lopez, Miquel-Angel] Fac Econ & Empresa, Inst Econ Barcelona, Dept Appl Econ, Edifici B, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain; [Hemet, Camille] Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France; [Hemet, Camille] Inst Econ Barcelona, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France; [Hemet, Camille] CEPR, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France; [Viladecans-Marsal, Elisabet] Univ Barcelona, John M Keynes 1-11, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Viladecans-Marsal, Elisabet] Inst Econ Barcelona, John M Keynes 1-11, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Viladecans-Marsal, Elisabet] CEPR, Dept Econ, John M Keynes 1-11, Barcelona 08034, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Paris School of Economics; University of Barcelona,"Garcia-López, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain.;Garcia-López, MA (通讯作者)，Fac Econ & Empresa, Inst Econ Barcelona, Dept Appl Econ, Edifici B, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain.",miquelangel.garcia@uab.cat,"Garcia-López, Miquel-Àngel/K-4603-2014","Garcia-López, Miquel-Àngel/0000-0002-0515-2922; Viladecans-Marsal, Elisabet/0000-0003-3722-2371","Societe du Grand Paris; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [ECO2010-20718, ECO2014-52999-R, ECO2010-16934, ECO2013-41310-R]; Generalitat de Catalunya [2014SGR1326, 2014SGR420]; Xarxa de Referencia d'R+D+I en Economia Aplicada",Societe du Grand Paris; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya); Xarxa de Referencia d'R+D+I en Economia Aplicada,"We are very grateful to Gilles Duranton, Laurent Gobillon, Miren Lafourcade, Daniel McMillen, Henry Overman, Jacques-Francois Thisse, and Jean-Claude Prager, as well as seminar and conference participants and two anonymous referees for their comments and suggestions.

With the case of the Valley of the Monkeys in France, the only European park welcoming monkeys in total freedom, this research statistically explores emotional determinants of loyalty, satisfaction and word-of-mouth behaviour from single to family visitors in order to identify which marketing angles the park should highlight to reach a sustainable development logic. After anchoring our research in the tourism paradigm, we introduce the theoretical framework of loyalty, we define eight research hypotheses, including six sub-hypotheses, and we propose a conceptual model. Then we present our methodology, including a detailed empirical study. Results are displayed consecutively to the research hypotheses' test, which inform our suggestions for marketing directions for the park to increase its touristic performance. Results mainly highlight that in such a paradigm, satisfaction is not emotion-based but cognitive-dissonance linked, that an ecosystem-based philosophy is clearly a sustainable source of loyalty, and that the main targets for such parks are families who seek strong positive emotions such as joy and delight, the latter further supporting loyalty development (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In developing countries in particular this process is driven by small-scale agriculture. At the same time, many African governments aim to increase agricultural productivity. Empirical evidence suggests, however, that win-win relationships between agricultural intensification and forest conservation are the exception. Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) could be linked to agriculture support programmes to simultaneously achieve both goals. Due to potentially higher profits from intensified agriculture than from pure cash transfers, potential payment recipients may prefer in-kind over conventional cash payments. Nevertheless, little scientific evidence exists regarding the preferences of potential PES recipients for such instruments. We report from a discrete choice experiment in Zambia that elicited preferences of smallholder farmers for PES contracts. Our results suggest that potential PES recipients in Zambia value in-kind agricultural inputs more highly than cash payments (even when the monetary value of the inputs is lower than the cash payment), highlighting that PES could potentially succeed in conserving forests and intensifying smallholder agriculture. Respondents who intended to clear forest within the next three years were found to require higher payments, but could be motivated to enrol in appropriately designed PES. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Based on survey-evidence from Germany, we analyze consumer preferences for two product categories, a food-staple and a non-food staple, labeled for carbon and water footprints. Latent class analysis is employed to identify and characterize distinct consumer segments as a function of consumersecological worldview', consumer involvement, motivation to attend to product label information, personal values, as well as consumers' environmental group membership and donation behavior. Results suggest that latent segments of ecologically-oriented consumers can be differentiated from price-sensitive segments, with the former appearing less prone to certain evolved psychological biases compared to the latter segments. In contrast to previous work on self-reported ecologically conscious behavior, our results highlight the role of personal values, in particular that of personal health. This is found to be valued less by ecologically-oriented consumers, indicating that such individuals may have a strong communal focus in their value orientation. In terms of policy implications, our findings suggest that sustainability labels can provide valuable and interpretable information to consumers, yet more effective intervention efforts may require a stronger focus on targeted information provision with regard to carbon rather than water footprints.

The period since 1975 has witnessed an increase in per capita health spending in Canada along with improvements in health outcomes. This paper is an economic evaluation of health spending in Canada-an analysis of the cost-effectiveness of aggregate health spending. Estimates of the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) are made for the whole 1980-2012 period and for four sub-periods of time-1980-1989; 1989-1998; 1998-2007 and 2007-2012. This is done for both the general population as well as Canadian seniors. Under a medium contribution of health spending to life expectancy scenario for the 1980-2012 period, the costs per QALY gained averaged $16,977 and $14,968, respectively for the general population and the seniors. This suggests that the Canadian health system produces relatively good value for money, especially for the seniors. After applying separate adjustments to match total health spending in the US and NHS health spending in the UK, we found that costs per QALY gained in Canada were generally lower than those found for the US, but not for the UK.","[Ariste, Ruolz] Univ Laval, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Ariste, Ruolz] UQO, Hull Div, 283 Blvd Alexandre Tach,Local C3700,POB 1250, Gatineau, PQ J8X 3X7, Canada; [Di Matteo, Livio] Lakehead Univ, Thunder Bay, ON, Canada",Laval University; University of Quebec; University Quebec Outaouais; Lakehead University,"Ariste, R (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.;Ariste, R (通讯作者)，UQO, Hull Div, 283 Blvd Alexandre Tach,Local C3700,POB 1250, Gatineau, PQ J8X 3X7, Canada.",arir03@uqo.ca,,"Ariste, Ruolz/0000-0002-5387-5455",,,,,60,7,7,5,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

The result was heterogeneous pricing of colonial and sovereign debt, and different market microstructures and clienteles, themselves influenced by political, institutional, and financial arrangements. We find that sovereign spreads mainly reflected credit risks, while colonial spreads mainly reflected liquidity risks. Liquidity premia were economically large and significant, contributing between 10 percent and 39 percent of colonial spreads. These findings help understanding why the seemingly dry subject of colonial illiquidity inspired passionate disputes and ground-breaking reforms of financial imperial institutions.","[Chavaz, Matthieu] Bank England, 20 Moorgate, London EC2R 6DA, England; [Flandreau, Marc] Univ Penn, Dept Hist, Econ Hist, Coll Hall, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Bank of England; University of Pennsylvania,"Chavaz, M (通讯作者)，Bank England, 20 Moorgate, London EC2R 6DA, England.",matthieu.chavaz@bankofengland.co.uk; mfl@sas.upenn.edu,,,"Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF); Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies and Development, Geneva","Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies and Development, Geneva","We both acknowledge financial support from the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)-supported Sinergia project Macroeconomics of Financial Crises.

Free in-network pricing may deter entry since it creates network externality that intensifies competition. One may expect that a particular entrydeterrent strategy adopted by all incumbents would have more entry-deterring power than when it is adopted by some incumbents only. However, we show that when free-in network plan has entry-deterrence power with two incumbent firms, sometimes one incumbent offering free in-network plan may have more entry deterrence power than both firms offering free in-network plans. In other words, we find that an asymmetric adoption of entry-deterrence strategies by the incumbent firms may be the best for entry deterrence. This result highlights the importance of the strategic choice of the pricing plan as a function of not only the likelihood/ cost of entry but also of the plan choices of other firms, and may partially explain the asymmetric strategies used by competing firms.","[He, Tingting] St Anselm Coll, 100 St Anselm Dr, Manchester, NH 03102 USA; [Kuksov, Dmitri] Univ Texas Dallas, 800 West Campbell Rd,SM 32, Richardson, TX 75080 USA; [Narasimhan, Chakravarthi] Washington Univ, Campus Box 1133, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas; Washington University (WUSTL),"He, TT (通讯作者)，St Anselm Coll, 100 St Anselm Dr, Manchester, NH 03102 USA.;Kuksov, D (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Dallas, 800 West Campbell Rd,SM 32, Richardson, TX 75080 USA.",the@anselm.edu; Dmitri.Kuksov@utdallas.edu; Narasimhan@wustl.edu,,,,,,,26,2,4,3,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

The uptake and outcomes of PES schemes cannot be fully explained from a rational choice perspective. The notion of 'institutional -bricolage' is needed to analyse how actors assemble or reshape their actions by combining new institutions such as a PES scheme within other locally embedded institutions. A case study from Japan is used to illustrate how a PES scheme designed to conserve the habitat of a charismatic and endangered flagship species, the Oriental White Stork, has been reshaped by social actors to fit the locally dominant 'institutional logic'. We also show how the resulting institutional change is not only able to subvert policy makers' original assumptions, for instance about how to target and distribute the payments, but can also contribute to the reproduction of unequal power relations.

We choose households that received housing vouchers from 2008 to 2010 in the twin cities of Champaign-Urbana in Illinois and track their residential locations using restricted-use administrative data. We adopt the Mixed Logit (ML) approach to model voucher holders' locational choices accounting for heterogeneous preferences over costs of moving factors and dwelling and neighborhood attributes. Our main findings show that the HCV households are responsive to costs of moving indicating that there is a strong disincentive for the moves. The ML model results reveal a high level of statistical significance of heterogeneity in preferences among the HCV households providing empirical evidence to support previous literature that recipients would face different levels of costs of moving based on their socio-economic characteristics. The estimates also suggest that geographically targeted rental subsidies exert a larger relocation effect, moving 22.87% of high -poverty residents into low-and mid poverty neighborhoods, when they are combined with a local housing authority's housing search counseling and supportive services.

This study helps to fill this gap in the literature by investigating the drivers of forest-to-agriculture conversion in one of the largest metropolitan areas and its surrounding peri-urban regions in Canada, focusing on the effect of farmland losses to development. A unique contribution of this study is that we take into account the heterogeneous forestland availability in the empirical investigation, which makes the estimation more realistic and accurate. Generalized spatial two-stage least square (GS2SLS) models are adopted to control for spillover effects from deforestation activities in neighboring areas and also to solve the potential endogeneity problem resulted from simultaneous land-use changes. Key findings include the following: agricultural land losses are an important driver for deforestation, and the magnitude of impact increases as the availability of forest-cover increases; population growth hinders the process of deforestation; high road density encourages forestland conversion to agriculture. Future policy-design shall find it helpful to incorporate the agricultural land expansion onto forestland due to land development when evaluating the social, economic, and environmental consequences of urbanization.

This article argues that relatively declining powers and private domestic actors play an important role in preserving the status quo because they are eager to retain advantages that existing institutions afford them. This effort to block change affects fisheries negotiations, in particular, by allowing powerful actors to avoid new rules once an institution is in place. I hypothesize, first, that relatively declining fishing powers attempt to retain past institutional successes, while emerging fishing powers seek to alter the status quo. Second, negotiating positions reflect not only a country's position in the world, but also the access provided to domestic stakeholders who wish to gain, or fear losses, from new agreements. Therefore, I hypothesize that powerful beneficiaries in domestic politics push relatively declining powers to support the status quo when those private actors benefit from highly legalized past agreements and participate in foreign policy decisions. I test these hypotheses by exploring US and EU approaches to fisheries treaty negotiations through archival research and interviews with fisheries negotiators. The evidence supports hypotheses that status quo powers seek to protect earlier deals more intensely when they negotiate with rising fishing powers, and when private parties are most influential. As hypothesized, both governments are particularly protective of the most complex earlier agreements under these conditions.","[Axelrod, Mark] Michigan State Univ, James Madison Coll, 842 Chestnut Rd,Room S 369L, E Lansing, MI 48825 USA",Michigan State University,"Axelrod, M (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, James Madison Coll, 842 Chestnut Rd,Room S 369L, E Lansing, MI 48825 USA.",axelrod3@msu.edu,"Axelrod, Mark/L-6384-2016","Axelrod, Mark/0000-0003-1734-0434",,,,,60,3,4,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

The Paris Agreement, adopted in December 2015 and applicable to all for the post-2020 period, raises the possibility of unprecedented reliance on land-based mitigation. This has significant consequences for furthering both ambition and equity in global climate mitigation efforts. Yet, what are these consequences, and how have they manifested themselves in the existing (pre-2020) multilateral climate regime? What role do accounting rules for land-based mitigation play herein? In addressing these questions, we identify key dimensions of what we term the governance by expertise approach taken to land-based mitigation to date, which has served to reduce the environmental integrity of existing (developed country) mitigation efforts. Specifically, we analyze land-use accounting rules as a site of politics and highlight the technicalization of politics underway in this realm, which obscures the political implications of how land has been included to date. We conclude by considering whether the Paris Agreement institutionalizes similar dynamics, and the environmental integrity and equity implications of doing so.","[Dooley, Kate] Univ Melbourne, Australian German Climate & Energy Coll, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Dooley, Kate] Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Gupta, Aarti] Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, Environm Policy Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne; Wageningen University & Research,"Gupta, A (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, Environm Policy Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",kate.dooley@climate-energy-college.org; aarti.gupta@wur.nl,"; Dooley, Kate/J-8024-2016","Gupta, Aarti/0000-0003-4908-7453; Dooley, Kate/0000-0001-5636-6691",,,,,39,31,34,1,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

To control fires in Amazon, it is currently unclear whether policy-makers should prioritize command-and-control or incentive-based instruments such as REDD+. Aiming to generate knowledge about the relative merits of the two policy approaches, this paper presents a spatially-explicit agent-based model that simulates the causal effects of four policy instruments on intended and unintended fires. All instruments proved effective in overturning the predominance of highly profitable but risky fire-use and decreasing accidental fires, but none were free from imperfections. The performance of command-and-control proved highly sensitive to the spatial and social reach of enforcement. Side-effects of incentive-based instruments included a disproportionate increase in controlled fires and a reduced acceptance of conservation subsidies, caused by the prohibition of reckless fires, and also indirect deforestation. The instruments that were most effective in reducing deforestation were not the most effective in reducing fires and vice versa, which suggests that the two goals cannot be achieved with a single policy intervention.

We look at different lengths-of-stay (LOS) and types of doctor visits-general practitioners (GP) and specialists-and investigate heterogeneous effects by age groups and informal care availability. Two-part generalized linear models are estimated, using data from Switzerland. In this federal country, home care policy is decentralized into 26 cantons. Home care is measured at the canton level and its endogeneity is addressed by using an instrumental variable strategy combined with canton and time fixedeffects. We instrument home care use with the introduction of patient cost sharing for home care in some cantons in 2011. Overall, home care significantly increases the likelihoods of having a hospitalization, any doctor visit, or a GP visit. In addition, home care significantly reduces LOS up to 30 days, but has no effect on the number of doctor visits. These results are driven by the effects on persons 65 years and older. The effects are small, suggesting that the potential of formal home care to limit the growth in inpatient care and doctor visits may be limited.","[Goncalves, Judite] Univ Nova Lisboa, Nova Sch Business & Econ SBE, Campus Campolide, P-1099085 Lisbon, Portugal; [Weaver, France] James Madison Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA",Universidade Nova de Lisboa; James Madison University,"Gonçalves, J (通讯作者)，Univ Nova Lisboa, Nova Sch Business & Econ SBE, Campus Campolide, P-1099085 Lisbon, Portugal.",judite.goncalves@novasbe.pt,"Weaver, France/L-8612-2019","Goncalves, Judite/0000-0002-5563-9974",Swiss National Science Foundation [PDFMP1_134899]; Swiss School of Public Health+; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [PDFMP1_134899] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF),Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss School of Public Health+; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"This study was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant PDFMP1_134899) and the Swiss School of Public Health+.

These techniques allow taking into account location bias, contextual bias and the dependence of spatial units. Our results show that the hierarchical structure of the database matters and should be considered in the assessment of protected areas effectiveness. Our results also suggest that protected areas have slowed down deforestation between 2005 and 2009, whatever the type of governance. The effectiveness of protected areas differs according to socioeconomic and environmental variables measured at municipal level. For instance, indigenous protected areas are found to be marginally more efficient than sustainable use areas and integral use areas. Protected Areas that were more recently implemented are also found to avoid more deforestation than older ones. This corroborates the idea that recently created protected areas in the Brazilian Amazon have a greater agricultural potential. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Quantifying the economic value of coastal water quality would inform policy decisions that impact the coast and help justify expenditures in water quality improvements. We conducted a non-market valuation of beach recreationalists' preferences and willingness to pay for water quality and associated attributes at Oahu beaches. Using a discrete choice experiment analyzed by a conditional logit model, results suggest individuals were willing to pay $11.43 per day at the beach to reduce days of bacterial exceedance from 11 to 5 per year, a further $30.72 to reduce it to no bacterial exceedances at all. WTP to move from 15 ft to 30 ft of underwater visibility was $35.71, a further $14.80 to increase from 30 ft to 60 ft. Respondents were also willing to pay $15.33 to improve coral reef cover from 10% to 25%, a further $4.89 to improve to 45% cover. WTP for moving from 9 fish species to 18 species was $7.14, a further $2.47 to increase that to 27 fish species. These environmental improvements can improve Oahu recreationalists' welfare by $205 million, $550 million, $639 million, $265 million, $274 million, $88 million, $128 million, and $44 million per year, respectively. Welfare gains may justify increased spending in management and restoration of coastal ecosystems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Peng, Marcus; Oleson, Kirsten L.

The two organizations have differed significantly in how they define fossil fuel subsidies. The IMF's definition constitutes a radical break with previous definitions by including environmental externalities, while the OECD's is more conventional. The article explores the factors that explain why these international economic organizations have approached fossil fuel subsidies so differently. The exact definition of fossil fuel subsidies is contested. Furthermore, fossil fuels subsidies can be framed in ways that emphasize, respectively, their macroeconomic, fiscal, environmental, and distributive consequences. The article finds that institutional interaction lifted OECD involvement in fossil fuel subsidies to a new level, whereas the impetus to address fossil fuel subsidies within the IMF came largely from the IMF staff. In both cases, the organization's bureaucracy constituted the most important factor shaping how the organizations addressed such subsidies and hence the main reason why they differ in how they approach fossil fuel subsidies.","[Skovgaard, Jakob] Lund Univ, Dept Polit Sci, POB 52, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Skovgaard, J (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Polit Sci, POB 52, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",jakob.skovgaard@svet.lu.se,,,,,,,52,22,23,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

This article investigates how urban housing markets reacted to these far-reaching changes, which increased demand for dwellings. To this end, this study employs a new hedonic index of real housing prices and constructs a cross-regional panel dataset of rents and housing price fundamentals. This new evidence indicates that rents were not a significant financial burden on low-income families and, hence, housing was affordable for the working classes. The article also shows that families' access to new homes was facilitated by a sizeable growth in the housing supply. Substantial investments in urban infrastructure and the institutional framework enabled the construction of new homes at affordable prices. Our results suggest that housing problems were not as pervasive during the urban transition as the literature often seems to claim.","[Carmona, Juan] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Lampe, Markus] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria; [Roses, Joan] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England; [Roses, Joan] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Vienna University of Economics & Business; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Carmona, J (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Madrid, Spain.",,"Roses, Joan/K-5475-2013; carmona, juan/AAA-6428-2019; LAMPE, MARKUS/A-3308-2012","Roses, Joan/0000-0003-0661-3134; carmona, juan/0000-0002-1447-2178; LAMPE, MARKUS/0000-0002-0859-5091","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [2013/00066/001, ECO2011-25713, ECO2012-39169-C03-01]",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"Earlier versions of this article with a different title were presented in seminars at University of Warwick and University of Cologne, at the Iberometrics IV Conference in Barcelona and the 2012 Annual Conference of the Economic History Society in Oxford.

By including linkages between production-based emissions in one country and final consumption in another (via cross-border value chains), we focus on the entire carbon chain. We estimate polynomial and threshold models, accounting for reverse causality and identification problems. We find that the income-elasticity for both inventories is regime-dependent and reflects small carbon efficiency gains from economic development. Carbon footprints show larger income-elasticities, while national policy instruments targeting production can clearly be circumvented by carbon embodied in intermediate trade.

Research has also demonstrated that the failure to include environmental impacts in prices of traded goods concealed an ecologically unequal exchange. This paper contributes to the discussion with the newly coined concept of caloric unequal exchange that defines the deterioration of terms of trade in food in units of calories. Exports and imports to and from Latin America and the Caribbean are analysed for the period 1961 through 2011 in volume, value, and calories, for different groups of products. The study concludes that although calories exported by the region to the rest of the world are more expensive than those imported, the ratio is deteriorating over time. This trend is found to be dependent of the trading partner involved. The region is helping the rest of the world in supplying their diets at a lower cost. A side result is that globalisation is homogenising diets over time, concentrating most food consumption in a reduced number of products, and therefore increasing interdependency among countries and affecting food security.

Our thesis is that the land most responsive to these drivers is at the economic margin between grass-based production and cropping. Much of the eastern Dakotas is such an area, primarily under crop-based agriculture although grass remains an important land use. We surveyed land operators in the area on their views about motivators for land use choices. Their views are largely consistent with the economic margin viewpoint. The importance of crop output prices, crop input prices, innovations in cropping equipment and weather patterns on land use decisions grow as one moves north toward the economic margin. Land in more highly sloped areas is more sensitive to crop prices and crop.insurance policies. Consistent with human capital theory, older operators are generally less responsive to factors that affect land use. Those renting more land, being more exposed to market forces, are more responsive. As farm size increases, respondents declared higher land use sensitivity to policy issues and technological innovations, suggesting that scale effects render land units more sensitive to land use change drivers.

The current paper contributes to this nascent stream of literature by studying the relationship between risk attitudes, trust propensity and energy consumption at the household level. Drawing on the British Household Panel Survey, a well-known data set in the context of energy studies, I show that trust is negatively correlated with household energy demand, while higher risk tolerance leads to increases in residential energy use. Potential explanations for these findings are investigated, suggesting that risk preferences may be related with overall appliance stock and the size of the rebound effect. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It reports a new dataset of revised estimates for investment rates in eastern European countries between 1950 and 1989. Complemented with data on other growth determinants, this evidence is used to re-evaluate the socialist growth record in a conditional convergence framework with a panel of 24 European countries. After controlling for relative backwardness, investment rates, and improvements in human capital, the findings show that centrally planned economies underperformed due to their relative inefficiency only after the postwar golden age. In the 1950s and 1960s, eastern Europe was falling behind mainly due to relatively low levels of investment and weak reconstruction dynamics. Both are explained, in part, by the lack of labour-supply flexibility that, in turn, resulted from the comparatively much larger negative impact of the war on population growth in eastern Europe.","[Vonyo, Tamas] Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy",Bocconi University,"Vonyó, T (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy.",,,,Economic History Department at the London School of Economics,Economic History Department at the London School of Economics,"This article could not have been written without the support of the Economic History Department at the London School of Economics, which provided financial assistance for data collection, and the Dondena Centre for Research on Social Dynamics and Public Policy at Bocconi University.

Here, we link comprehensive data on fisher's information exchange networks and economic productivity to test hypotheses about when it pays to cooperate by exchanging different types of strategic information. We find that being well connected locally in information exchange networks about both short-term topics (e.g., the location of species) and long-term topics (e.g., technical innovations) is positively associated with productivity in both the short-term (within fishing trips) and long-term (annually). In contrast, we findthat exchanging both types of information across distinct social divides - a form of brokerage - is negatively associated with productivity. Our results therefore suggest that while there appears to be an economic benefit associated with cooperation across temporal scales in the harvest of common-pool fishery resources, exchanging strategic information across social divides may come at a cost particularly under conditions of competition. We discuss our results in light of emerging research at the nexus of sociology and economics, providing key insight into the social-structural dynamics that help form the foundation for fisher decision-making and behavior.

It is one of a series research papers and case studies that study approaches to improve compliance with public and private regulations through cooperative and collaborative approaches. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - It is a grounded qualitative study of what a number of individuals said in the course of a number of interviews. The aim and objectives being to obtain, from the key actors, their personal viewpoints, attitudes to and experiences of the partnership. Unlike some grounded approaches the research was based on the priori themes of cooperation and collaboration using semi structured interviews. At one stage, because of difficulty of access to the key actors caused by major re-development of the company, questionnaires replaced interviews. Findings - The authors found that barriers to achieving a successful partnership included an initial reluctance, by all parties concerned, to cede some of their management autonomy to others and experiences of uncooperative behaviour between the public and private sectors in the past. They were largely overcome as the implementation of the project progressed resulting in improved food safety compliance management based on mutual trust. Other benefits for Preston City Council were immediate cost savings for Preston City Council in their use of human resources. For E.H. Booths, Ltd no initial cost saving was made, but there is potential longer term savings to be made through better risk based targeting of resources. These benefits only being made possible by the collaborative effort and support from all parties and individuals involved. Originality/value - On its own this case study research is limited by its size and scope but the emerging topics and findings highlight the difficulties and barriers faced in setting up partnerships between public regulators and businesses. Therefore, the results can be of value to similar studies and other areas where cooperation, collaboration, partnership, and co-regulation are significant contributory factors to successful compliance strategies.","[Bradford-Knox, Richard] RBK Consultants, Preston, Lancs, England; [Neighbour, Simon] Preston City Council, Dept Environm Hlth, Preston, Lancs, England",,"Bradford-Knox, R (通讯作者)，RBK Consultants, Preston, Lancs, England.",rbkconsultants@uwclub.net,,"Bradford-Knox, Richard/0000-0003-2271-0065",Angela Towers Regional Co-ordinator of the Food Standards Agency,Angela Towers Regional Co-ordinator of the Food Standards Agency,"The authors acknowledge Waheed Hussan of E.H.

Actual management practices aggravate pollution issues due to overdosing and untimely applications, even more if farmers are reluctant to change their practices. The application of crop modeling coupled to environmental impact tools offers an alternative to analyze improved production scenarios. The objective of this study was to estimate the environmental savings due to optimized agrochemicals management for tomato production in Colombia. For this purpose, we calibrated a generic growth model for greenhouse tomatoes. The environmental performance of the current and optimized schemes was evaluated through a life-cycle assessment (LCA) approach. Data for current practices were collected through detailed follow-ups of 38 growing cycles. The optimized scenario was constructed by simulating crop growth based on the climate for each cycle. These scenarios also considered optimized nitrogen fertilization and restricted use of pesticides. All resource consumption and emissions referred to a functional unit of 1 t tomatoes with boundaries defined from raw material extraction to farm gate. The assessment considered the manufacture and emissions to water and soil of nitrogen fertilizers and pesticides. Average observed and simulated yield were 83.3 and 178.5 t ha(-1), respectively. Most of the reductions due to the optimal strategy were above 90% for most of the impact categories. Under the actual production strategy, the manufacture of N fertilizers was the main contributor to the environmental impact for most categories. The impact of N field emissions was more relevant under the optimal model, since the shares of this component were 26.1, 74.7, and 95.1% for acidification potential, eutrophication potential, and global warming potential, respectively. The optimized scenario showed that there is huge room to improve Colombian tomato production technically and environmentally.","[Gil, R.; Bojaca, C.

HL emerges as a key component for the Halal industry to succeed, and the same is required to extend the integrity of the Halal products from the farm to the fork. That's to develop Halal as an intrinsic characteristic. Thus, organisations should have support from specific CSFs. The paper provides managerial implications, recommendations for effective implementation of HL and further in identifying the pull effect of HL. Research limitations/implications - The model so developed is contextual and based on the perception of qualified experts, and they can have biasness of Halal meat supply chain. Originality/value - An academic research taking views from different stakeholders with findings valuable to researchers and the policy planners.","[Haleem, Abid; Khan, Mohd Imran] Jamia Millia Islamia, Fac Engn & Technol, Dept Mech Engn, New Delhi, India",Jamia Millia Islamia,"Haleem, A (通讯作者)，Jamia Millia Islamia, Fac Engn & Technol, Dept Mech Engn, New Delhi, India.",ahaleem@jmi.ac.in,"HALEEM, ABID/G-4761-2012; Khan, Mohd Imran/S-9155-2016","HALEEM, ABID/0000-0002-3487-0229; Khan, Mohd Imran/0000-0002-2822-7245",,,,,80,50,51,0,24,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The default probabilities of each obligor in each time period depend upon common as well as firm specific factors. The time movement of these factors is modelled as a vector autoregressive process. The conditional default probabilities are modelled using a general representation that subsumes popular default intensity models, logit-based models as well as threshold based Gaussian copula models. We develop an asymptotic regime where the portfolio size increases to infinity. In this regime, we conduct large deviations analysis of the portfolio losses. Specifically, we observe that the associated large deviations rate function is a solution to a quadratic program with linear constraints. Importantly, this rate function is independent of the specific modelling structure of conditional default probabilities. This rate function may be useful in identifying and controlling the underlying factors that contribute to large losses, as well as in designing fast simulation techniques for efficiently measuring portfolio tail risk.","[Juneja, Sandeep] TIER, Bombay, Maharashtra, India",,"Juneja, S (通讯作者)，TIER, Bombay, Maharashtra, India.",juneja@tifr.res.in,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-319-47705-3; 978-3-319-47704-6,NEW ECON WINDOWS,,,2017,,,,,,,41,58,,10.1007/978-3-319-47705-3_3,0.0,,,18,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Sociology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences; Sociology,BI7KJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000414315200003,0

One of the key aspects in the process of achieving the aforementioned competitiveness, are the prices of production inputs, which determine the costs of final products, goods or services. The problem arises when companies purchase the production inputs from the state-owned monopolies which largely participate in the final price of the product. In this case, the high cost inefficiency is mirrored in the high price levels of final goods and services for the customers. The article aims to examine whether the destimulating monopolistic prices of key production inputs tend to diminish competitiveness of manufacturing firms on local, regional and european markets. Moreover, the overall objective of the work is to determine whether and to what extent the factors of production purchased from the monopolistic suppliers affect the market competitiveness of manufacturing firms. The research results identified primarily how much absolute and relative monopolistic inputs participate in the formation of the final product price, moreover, what are the negative effects of such pricing policies in the observed time interval, and the exact consequences it has on the competitivness and market position of the observed company. Finally, a model was developed which can be used for computing costs and applied to other companies of similar activities or industries, whose procurement market largely relies on monopolistic suppliers.","[Kasumovic, Merim] Univ Tuzla, Fac Econ, Univ 8, Tuzla 75000, Bosnia & Herceg; [Piric, Adnan] Solana DD, Soli 3, Tuzla 75000, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Tuzla,"Kasumovic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Tuzla, Fac Econ, Univ 8, Tuzla 75000, Bosnia & Herceg.",merim78@hotmail.com; adnanpiric@yahoo.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,2,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,1058,1066,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500102,0

However the basis for functioning of the microenterprises is still their relationship with their closest environment, which is usually the local community. This is particularly important in the tourism industry, especially in the case of agrotouristic companies. The specificity of this type of business requires building trust not limited to the relation: service provider - consumer, but also connected with building customer's confidence to the social space in which he resides. As a consequence, there is the need to maintain neighborly relations by the owners of tourism microenterprises. These types of companies are usually family businesses, often operating in the rural areas. For this reason, they are supported in various forms by extended family members who live in a close proximity. It can be assumed that such configuration of social relations facilitates building strong and sustainable social capital. The authors of the paper present the results of pilot studies, which attempt to answer the question of the form of a network of relationships created around the tourism microenterprises.

Consequently, it can conclude that cost reduction does not necessarily mean the business improvement, but to the opposite leads to a reduction business activities and poorer business results. This implies changing of approach on the costs optimizations and respectively considering the fact that every business activities cause the costs, the focus should be on the business activities and the incurred costs. Respectively, the economic subjects have to determine relationship between certain businesses activities with achieved business result, according to which they can predict which business activities or which costs are significantly contribute to achieving to the business result. Business policies which includes the selling policy, purchasing policy, human resourcing policy, financial policy and the public relation policy determine the business activities which are measurable by the level of the caused costs and with which the economic subjects tries to ensure business prosperities. Business policies and arising business activities determine the company business according to those business areas from which expects the most significant benefits. Accurately from the business cost structure can be determined the business focus on the corresponding activities, because the level of realized costs indicates the business activities. The impact of cost structure on the business results is measuring on the correlation basis between cost level which represent correspond business policies and the realized business results.

In this paper, we study the acquisition of supplemental irrigation water rights as an adaptation strategy undertaken by irrigation-dependent farmers in response to historical climate change. By exploiting the panel structure of a unique dataset of farm-level supplemental right adoption decisions in the state of Oregon, we establish a relationship between climate conditions, competition for local water resources, and the acquisition of supplemental rights. Our results indicate that a warmer, drier climate increases the likelihood that irrigated farms acquire supplemental rights, suggesting that farmers in Oregon have used supplemental rights to adapt to historical climate change. We also find evidence of heterogeneous effects suggesting that junior irrigators, groundwater-dependent irrigators, and farmers with access to a relatively lower volume of water have been most affected by historical climate change with respect to their supplemental water right acquisition decisions.","[Bigelow, Daniel P.] USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Zhang, Hongliang] Univ Neuchatel, Dept Econ & Business, Neuchatel, Switzerland",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); University of Neuchatel,"Bigelow, DP (通讯作者)，USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20250 USA.",Daniel.bigelow@ers.usda.gov,,"Bigelow, Daniel/0000-0002-1154-2302","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA))","The authors thank seminar and conference participants at the 2015 Southern Economic Association Annual Meetings, Oregon State University, and Economic Research Service for valuable feedback on earlier versions of this paper.

We used data from 30,966 households that participated in the 2016 National Household Survey (Encuesta Nacional de Hogares, ENAHO). Participants reported household characteristics and expenditure on ten healthcare services. CHE was defined as healthcare spending equal to or higher than 40% of the household's capacity to pay. The associations of various household characteristics and OOP payments for specific healthcare services with CHE were assessed in logistic regression models. Poorer, rural and smaller households as well as those with older adults and individuals with chronic conditions had greater odds of facing CHE. According to the estimates from the adjusted regression model, healthcare services could be grouped into three groups. Medical tests, surgery and medication were in the first group with odds ratios (ORs) between 6.43 and 4.72.

The theoretical literature on land reform argues that legal threats to the status quo determine agrarian organization, with owners selling land and moving to other asset classes or engaging in large-scale substitution of sharecroppers and tenants with wage labourers. This study, which uses municipal data on tenant evictions in Catalonia in 1934-5, does not find that uncertainty over property rights in the 1930s meant that owners tried to substitute tenants with wage labourers, especially in the case of the controversial rabassa morta contracts on vineyards. Here it is argued that after 40 years of organizational adjustment to shocks related to phylloxera infestations, legal changes, urbanization, and changes in relative prices, by the 1930s the margin for adjustment was small.","[Domenech, Jordi] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Getafe, Spain; [Herreros, Francisco] CSIC, Inst Polit & Bienes Publ, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Politicas y Bienes Publicos (IPP),"Domenech, J (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Getafe, Spain.",jdomenec@clio.uc3m.es,"Domenech, Jordi/L-1581-2014; Herreros, Francisco/I-5482-2014","Domenech, Jordi/0000-0001-7937-9444;",Fundacion Ramon Areces and Herreros from Spain's Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [CSO2015-65969-P],Fundacion Ramon Areces and Herreros from Spain's Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad,"The authors wish to thank the editor Jaime Reis and two anonymous referees for constructive comments and criticism.

Agrarian capitalism, poor taxes, and village conflict in eighteenth-century coastal Flanders",ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,LIVING STANDARDS; LABOR-MARKET; ENGLAND; WELFARE; RELIEF; MIGRANTS,"Poor relief provisions in early modern Europe are often considered to have been characterized by a divide between a uniform, compulsory, tax-based, and relatively secure and generous poor law system' in England, and the more haphazard, voluntary, relatively parsimonious, insecure, and predominantly urban relief practices on the Continent. In this article we challenge these assumptions by arguing that the spread of agrarian capitalism in coastal Flanders fostered a reorganization of poor relief that displayed many features considered unique to the English old poor law, including the levying of poor taxes. By exploring the introduction, diffusion, and effects of poor taxes in the rural district of Furnes in the second half of the eighteenth century, we demonstrate that poor taxes were not unique to England, and sharpen our comparative understanding of the causes, implications, and conflicts associated with this particular way of raising revenue for the poor. This supports our more general contention that the influence of the normative framework should not be overstated: more than differences in legislation, similarities in socio-economic development can explain variations in relief practices in preindustrial Europe.","[Lambrecht, Thijs] Univ Ghent, Ghent, Belgium; [Winter, Anne] Vrije Univ Brussel, Brussels, Belgium",Ghent University; Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Lambrecht, T (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.",,"Winter, Anne/K-5479-2012","Winter, Anne/0000-0002-9139-8282",,,,,79,4,4,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

We derive approximate posterior distributions and point estimates for parameters and inefficiency effects for (a) time invariant models with several alternative inefficiency distributions, (b) models with time varying effects, (c) models incorporating environmental effects, and (d) models with more flexible forms for the regression function and error terms. Despite the abundance of stochastic frontier models, there have been few attempts to test the various models against each other, probably due to the difficulty of performing such tests. One advantage of the variational Bayes approximation is that it facilitates the computation of marginal likelihoods that can be used to compare models. We apply this idea to test stochastic frontier models with different inefficiency distributions. Estimation and testing is illustrated using three examples.","[Hajargasht, Gholamreza] Swinburne Univ Technol, Swinburne Business Sch, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Griffiths, William E.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Swinburne University of Technology; University of Melbourne,"Griffiths, WE (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",wegrif@unimelb.edu.au,"Griffiths, William E/J-4406-2014; Hajargasht, Gholamreza/E-7936-2015","Hajargasht, Gholamreza/0000-0002-9281-3855",,,,,44,2,2,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

This paper finds that education causes statistically significant impacts on health care utilization, although the signs of the impacts change with specific types of health care services examined. In particular, education increases the inpatient utilization of the public health sector, but it reduces the outpatient utilization of both the public and private health sectors. The estimates are strongly robust to various windows of the sample choice. The paper also discovers that the links between education and the probability of health insurance and income play essential roles as potential mechanisms to explain the causal impact of education on health care utilization in Vietnam.","[Dang, Thang] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Dang, Thang] Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City UEH, Sch Econ, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",University of York - UK; Ho Chi Minh City University Economics,"Dang, T (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York, N Yorkshire, England.;Dang, T (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City UEH, Sch Econ, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",thang.dang@thangdang.org,,"Dang, Thang/0000-0002-9736-8447",,,,,53,9,9,3,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

Transport prices in particular are crucial missing pieces of the puzzle. Sources rarely reveal information that meets the standards of reliable price history. However, it is possible to create a reliable transport price series on the basis of the transport of millstones to ducal mills in Brabant. Assessing the impact of the transport productivity changes' that can be inferred from this transport price series is a hazardous exercise. Moreover, as Masschaele has observed, land transport prices closely match general agricultural price trends. Land transport was essentially an agricultural service, determined both by cost (especially horse provender) and income effects. Transport price inflation was not demand-led. However, while transport did not impede urbanization and economic growth, conversely, in sixteenth-century Brabanta highly urbanized region that experienced considerable growth in the volume of land transportno significant land transport productivity gains were achieved.","[Ballaux, Bart] Vrije Univ Brussel, Onderzoeksctr Archivist & Hedendaags Documentbehe, Brussels, Belgium; [Blonde, Bruno] Univ Antwerp, Ctr Urban Hist, Urban Studies Inst, Antwerp, Belgium",Vrije Universiteit Brussel; University of Antwerp,"Ballaux, B (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Brussel, Onderzoeksctr Archivist & Hedendaags Documentbehe, Brussels, Belgium.",Bart.Ballaux@vub.ac.be; Bruno.blonde@uantwerpen.be,,"Blonde, Bruno/0000-0002-2118-799X",,,,,62,4,4,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

In this article, we develop a new methodological approach (composite indices) to assess and compare the strength of competing voluntary sustainability standards (VSS). We apply this approach to all major VSS in global coffee production. In detail, we identify 92 regulatory topics relating to sustainability improvements in global coffee production through VSS. We weight these indicators and develop a coding system to evaluate how strongly each VSS addresses each of the 92 regulatory topics. The results show four sub-indices that compare the strength of the different VSS within the four main regulatory areas of sustainable development: (I) environmental sustainability (II), social sustainability, (III) economic sustainability and (IV) compliance enforcement. Aggregating these sub-indices build the Voluntary Coffee Standards Index (VOCSI) that compares the strength of VSS across the four main regulatory areas. We evaluate the robustness of the index and correlate the VOCSI with the amount of coffee certified to examine the relationship between the strengths of a standard and its proliferation.","[Dietz, Thomas; Chong, Andrea Estrella; Grabs, Janina] Westfalische Wilhelms Univ Munster, Inst Polit Sci, Schamhorststr 100, D-48151 Munster, Germany; [Auffenberg, Jennie] Univ Bremen, Bremen Int Grad Sch Social Sci, Mary Somerville Str 9, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Kilian, Bernard] INCAE Business Sch, POB 960-4050, La Garita, Alajuela, Costa Rica",University of Munster; University of Bremen; INCAE Business School,"Dietz, T (通讯作者)，Westfalische Wilhelms Univ Munster, Inst Polit Sci, Schamhorststr 100, D-48151 Munster, Germany.",thomas.dietz@uni-muenster.de; auffenberg@bigsss.uni-bremen.de; andrea.estrella@uni-muenster.de; janina.grabs@uni-muenster.de; bernard.kilian@incae.edu,,"Grabs, Janina/0000-0002-1630-5672; Auffenberg, Jennie/0000-0002-0639-1060","Land Nordrhein-Westfalen, Ministerium fur Innovation, Wissenschaft and Forschung through its junior research group TRANSSUSTAIN [005-1503-0008]","Land Nordrhein-Westfalen, Ministerium fur Innovation, Wissenschaft and Forschung through its junior research group TRANSSUSTAIN","This work was supported by the Land Nordrhein-Westfalen, Ministerium fur Innovation, Wissenschaft and Forschung (005-1503-0008) through its financial support of the junior research group TRANSSUSTAIN.",,59,32,33,1,36,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

The results indicate that local levels of particulate matter are negatively associated with the frequency with which individuals undertake both of these activities, that engagement in these behaviours wholly mediates the association between air pollution and how worthwhile individuals consider their activities to be, and that the frequency of visits to the outdoors partially mediates the negative association between local air pollution and life satisfaction. From a policy perspective, these findings highlight the need to understand the behavioural pathways through which environmental conditions relate to SWB, in order to know how to best promote it.","[Laffan, Kate] Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England; [Laffan, Kate] Dept Psychol & Behav Sci, London, England; [Laffan, Kate] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Laffan, K (通讯作者)，Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England.;Laffan, K (通讯作者)，Dept Psychol & Behav Sci, London, England.;Laffan, K (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England.",k.m.laffan@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,98,18,20,3,62,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

In this paper, we study how land use adaptation to climate change impacts land use competition in the agriculture, forest and other land use (AFOLU) sector and how a mitigation policy in agriculture might affect this competition. We use for this purpose two sector-specific bio-economic models of agriculture and forest combined with an econometric land use shares model to simulate the impacts of two climate change scenarios (A2 and B1, 2100 horizon), and a greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture policy consisting of a tax of between 0 and 200 (sic)/tCO(2) equivalent. Our results show that both climate change scenarios lead to an increase in the area devoted to agriculture at the expense of forest which could have a negative impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change. The mitigation policy would curtail agricultural expansion, and thus could counteract the effects of land use adaptation to climate change. In other words, accounting for land use competition results in a reduction of the abatement costs of the mitigation policy in the agricultural sector.","[Lungarska, Anna; Chakir, Raja] Univ Paris Saclay, AgroParisTech, INRA, Econ Publ, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France",INRAE; AgroParisTech; Universite Paris Saclay,"Lungarska, A (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Saclay, AgroParisTech, INRA, Econ Publ, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France.",Anna.Lungarska@inra.fr; Raja.Chakir@inra.fr,"CHAKIR, RAJA/X-1414-2019","CHAKIR, RAJA/0000-0002-6980-0343; Lungarska, Anna/0000-0002-6236-0701; CHAKIR, RAJA/0000-0003-3821-092X",European Union within the European Commission [235175 TRUSTEE (ANR-13-RURA-0001-01)]; French Agence Nationale de la Recherche through the ModULand project [ANR-11-BSH1-005]; ORACLE project [ANR-10-CEPL-011]; STIMUL (Scenarios Towards integrating multi-scale land use tools) flagship project as part of the Investments d'Avenir Programme (LabEx BASC) [ANR-11-LABX-0034],European Union within the European Commission; French Agence Nationale de la Recherche through the ModULand project(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); ORACLE project; STIMUL (Scenarios Towards integrating multi-scale land use tools) flagship project as part of the Investments d'Avenir Programme (LabEx BASC),"We thank Pierre-Alain Jayet for providing us with the results from the AROPAj model, and Antonello Lobianco and Sylvain Caurla for giving us access to the results of the FFSM+ + model.

All three narratives present a pathway of change in which standard-setting as a form of regulatory governance is likely to remain relevant for the politics of sustainable production. This commentary proposes a fourth narrative of change. It argues that in some prominent sectors firms develop new policy instruments that strip sustainability interventions in supply chains from their regulatory governance qualities. Standard-setting organizations themselves meanwhile expand functions that are not of a regulatory governance nature. In this pathway, standard-setting organizations move in a different direction than the other three: away from certification and regulatory governance as core business.","[Fransen, Luc] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, Nieuwe Achtergracht 166, NL-1018 WV Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Fransen, L (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, Nieuwe Achtergracht 166, NL-1018 WV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",l.w.fransen@uva.nl,,,Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study (NIAS),Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study (NIAS),"An early draft of this paper was presented at the Disclosing Sustainability Conference at Wageningen University, June 2016.

Economics has in general emphasised prices. This theoretical bias results from the axiomatic-deductive methodology centring on equilibrium. Without equilibrium, quantity constraints are more important than prices in determining market outcomes. In disequilibrium, interest rates should be far less useful as policy variable, and economics should be more concerned with quantities (including resource constraints). To investigate, we test the received belief that lower interest rates result in higher growth and higher rates result in lower growth. Examining the relationship between 3-month and 10-year benchmark rates and nominal GDP growth over half a century in four of the five largest economies we find that interest rates follow GDP growth and are consistently positively correlated with growth. If policy-makers really aimed at setting rates consistent with a recovery, they would need to raise them. We conclude that conventional monetary policy as operated by central banks for the past half-century is fundamentally flawed. Policy-makers had better focus on the quantity variables that cause growth.","[Lee, Kang-Soek; Werner, Richard A.] Univ Southampton, Southampton Business Sch, Ctr Banking Finance & Sustainable Dev, Southampton, Hants, England; [Werner, Richard A.] Univ Oxford, Linacre Coll, Oxford, England; [Lee, Kang-Soek] Chamber Commerce & Ind Paris IDF, Novancia Business Sch, Paris, France",Solent University; University of Southampton; University of Oxford,"Werner, RA (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Southampton Business Sch, Ctr Banking Finance & Sustainable Dev, Southampton, Hants, England.;Werner, RA (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Linacre Coll, Oxford, England.",richard.werner@linacre.ox.ac.uk,,"LEE, Kang-Soek/0000-0001-9753-8883",,,,,80,28,34,3,24,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

This article contributes to research on 'rebound effects', which focus on how energy efficiency improvements (EEI) increase energy service demand. Most of 35 years of rebound research has been analyzed from micro- and macro-economic perspectives. Yet, micro-economic rebound research has so far investigated human behavior only on grounds of simple rational choice models and static assumptions about consumer preferences. This article exposes the existing rebound discourse to psychological theories. Building on considerations of how EEI can interfere with processes of decision-making, it develops a model of how EEI - via psychological processes - may lead to 'motivational rebound effects' as well as to 'beneficial effects', which countervail rebounds. The article then advances a typology of such rebound and beneficial effects that not only integrates the typology currently used in the micro-economic rebound literature, but goes beyond it. Model and typology explain how economic rebound research could benefit from psychological theory, provide the basis for empirically investigating rebound effects on more solid theoretical grounds, and empower a comprehensive discussion about policies and measures that aim at a sustainable use of technologies.","[Santarius, Tilman] Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Vocat Educ & Work Studies, Marchstr 23, D-10587 Berlin, Germany; [Soland, Martin] Univ Appl Sci Northwestern Switzerland, Sch Appl Psychol, Riggenbachstr 16, CH-4600 Olten, Switzerland",Technical University of Berlin; FHNW University of Applied Sciences & Arts Northwestern Switzerland,"Santarius, T (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Vocat Educ & Work Studies, Marchstr 23, D-10587 Berlin, Germany.",santarius@tu-berlin.de,,,,,,,129,59,61,3,66,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

The aim of this paper is to contribute to this debate by analysing evidence regarding the different factors helping and hampering the development of a CE. Specifically, this paper focuses on the eco-innovation (EI) pathway towards a CE, and tries to coordinate available but fragmented findings regarding how transformative innovation can foster this transition while removing obstacles to sustainability. Drawing upon a new corpus of both academic and non-academic literature, this work offers a framework for analysis, as well as an evidence-based survey of the challenges, for a green structural change of the economy. We argue that the combination of the innovation systems' view with the more recent transformation turn in innovation studies may provide an appropriate perspective for understanding the transition to a CE. Ultimately, the paper aims to capitalise on these insights to contribute to the design of policy guidelines and organisational strategies.","[de Jesus, Ana] Univ Nova Lisboa, CENSE, Lisbon, Portugal; [Mendonca, Sandro] Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, Business Res Unit BRU IUL, Lisbon, Portugal; [Mendonca, Sandro] UECE ISEG, Res Unit Complex & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal; [Mendonca, Sandro] Univ Sussex, Business SPRU, Brighton, E Sussex, England",Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa; University of Sussex,"de Jesus, A (通讯作者)，Univ Nova Lisboa, CENSE, Lisbon, Portugal.",aij.silva@fct.unl.pt; smfm@iscte.pt,"Johannesdottir, Solveig L/U-2219-2017","Johannesdottir, Solveig L/0000-0002-4402-6830; Mendonca, Sandro/0000-0001-7276-9626; de Jesus, Ana/0000-0002-6468-0039","Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation [Pest-OE/AMB/UI4085/2013, UID/GES/00315/2013, SFRH/BD/52295/2013]",Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"This work was supported by the Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation Grant Ref: SFRH/BD/52295/2013.

A firm that is a monopolist in a primary market can utilize such contracts to exclude a more efficient rival in a secondary market. When the firms sell through competing retailers, the leveraging firm may offer tie-in contracts to the retailers inducing them to purchase both primary and secondary products entirely from it such that the rival is excluded. We examine whether such tie-in contracts are profitable for an incumbent firm under different conditions of (i) the ability to commit to prices by the upstream firms and (ii) downstream competition among the retailers. We show that when retailers compete in prices, then regardless of whether the entrant is able to commit to its own prices, an exclusionary tie-in strategy is profitable (not profitable) for the incumbent when it is able (unable) to commit to prices. However, when retailers compete in quantities, the entrant's commitment ability does matter. Specifically, an exclusionary tie-in strategy (i) may be unprofitable for an incumbent when both upstream firms are able to commit to their prices, depending on the degree of cost advantage of the entrant; (ii) is always profitable when it alone can commit to its price; and (iii) is unprofitable when both upstream firms cannot commit to their prices.

In this paper, we propose a new CMPI that combines both procedures. The resulting methodology provides group-specific indexes for each output separately, and therefore offers the option to identify the sources of cost performance change. We also define our index when input prices are not observed and establish, in that case, a duality with a new technical productivity index, which takes the form of a Malmquist productivity index.

Consumers in Chinese restaurants of international tourist hotels located in Taipei, Taiwan, were targeted as research objects. After deleting questionnaires with incomplete answers, the researchers obtained 818 valid questionnaires for data analysis. Findings The analysis results indicate that the gender, style of dress and degree of color coordination of a waitperson's clothing can significantly influence consumer perceptions and feelings. Originality/value The analysis of this study implies that restaurant management should stress professional attendant training. By strengthening training and regulating attendant style, a management team can effectively improve upon their customers' recognition of a business.

In line with this research stream, the purpose of this paper is to understand how family food firms with long-standing traditions can implement innovative productions while remaining anchored to the past. Design/methodology/approach By adopting a qualitative research methodology, mainly based on a multiple case study, this paper seeks to cover some unexplored areas regarding the opportunity of combining tradition and innovation to achieve success in the highly competitive international arena in which family food firms operate. The authors analyze the cases of La Torrente, Cioccolatitaliani and La Fabbrica della Pasta di Gragnano. Findings Successful family food firms leverage their deep-rooted knowledge of both family and local traditions to innovate. At same time, they establish continuous info exchange flows with all of the firm's stakeholders by adopting an open innovation approach. Research limitations/implications From a theoretical perspective, there is a need for an in-depth study of how an effective blend of tradition and innovation is formalized, above all, in family firms. As for the practical implications, all the three case studies represent a best practice, especially for family firms with a long-standing history and strong local connections. Practical implications The paper shows how important it is to keep traditional factors in food industry and offers hints and suggestions to decision makers of family firms on how to valorize, in terms of competitiveness, their traditional resources - almost bound to their territory with innovation tools and processes. Social implications The paper is interesting because it offers an analysis of a specific group of firms - family firms - that characterize many industries in Italy and in Europe. Although often small, these firms can show dynamism and creativity. The paper offers hints on how to approach innovation in the sector while keeping the value of tradition. Originality/value The originality of the proposed conceptual model stems from the need to overcome the previous theoretical models, which deal separately with sources of past knowledge and sources of new and/or external knowledge.","[Della Corte, Valentina; Sepe, Fabiana] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Econ Management & Inst, Naples, Italy; [Del Gaudio, Giovanna] Univ Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II; University of Naples Federico II,"Della Corte, V (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Econ Management & Inst, Naples, Italy.",valentina.dellacorte@unina.it; giovanna.delgaudio@unina.it; fabiana.sepe@unina.it,"Pineda, Diana/K-6241-2012; Sepe, Fabiana/ABD-5248-2020; Della Corte, Valentina/T-2877-2018","Della Corte, Valentina/0000-0001-7113-3167",,,,,62,16,17,2,35,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The approach uses threshold autoregressive models, asymmetric error correction models and autoregressive moving average models to examine the price transmission using monthly pig and pork prices from 1994 to 2016. Findings - While a symmetric price transmission between pork and pig prices was identified for the period between June 1994 and June 2007, an asymmetric price transmission response between pork and pig prices was found for the period July 2007 to June 2016. Key factors behind the asymmetric price transmission include the chicken price and China's provisional purchasing and stockpiling policy which is having a counter-productive impact on prices. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the literature by examining price transmission in two different periods: 1994 to 2007 where prices are lower and more stable; and 2007 to 2016 where prices are higher and volatile. The paper examines the impact of production and market policies on price transmission in the Chinese pork and pig market, with several policy implications.","[Dong, Xiaoxia] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Agr Informat Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Brown, Colin; Waldron, Scott; Zhang, Jing] Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Agriculture Information Institute, CAAS; University of Queensland","Brown, C (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",colin.brown@uq.edu.au,"Zhang, Jing/GXZ-8055-2022","Zhang, Jing/0000-0002-8406-8250; Brown, Colin/0000-0001-7805-3303","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71373284, 71203221]; China Scholarship Council (CSC)",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council),This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71373284 and 71203221) and the China Scholarship Council (CSC).

The EziSmart solution consists of Ezi-Pad and EziSmart Apps. The Ezi-Pad is a flip-casing with a receptacle for the smartphone. When the casing is flipped open it reveals an integrated keyboard with large ergonomic physical keys. The smartphone and the Ezi-Pad keyboard communicate via Bluetooth. The Ezi-Smart Apps is a set of Android applications including a start-page (launcher), an app organizer and several other features. Six visually impaired adults, aged 63 to 80 years received a five day course in using a smartphone together with the EziSmart solution. The participants were observed during the course. They were then followed up during a two month period. The participants and their relatives were interviewed about their smartphone use, experiences and expectations before the training started, and after the follow up period ended.

An architectural policy is an acknowledged tool for enhancing the quality of buildings and their surroundings. An important quality of architecture is the ability to include everybody, regardless of gender, sexuality, ethnicity, culture or disability. In 1994, 2004 and again in 2014, Denmark published a national architectural policy. Inclusion as an architectural quality was included, but the focus and terminology changed with every new policy. Based on a desk study about architectural policies, this paper presents how Universal Design is included in Danish municipal architectural policies. On a local level, 34 of 98 Danish municipalities have formulated an architectural policy. None of the architectural policies applies Universal Design, but a few operate with the concept of accessibility, primarily focusing on accessibility for all. This paper discusses how the absence of Universal Design in the architectural policies can be interpreted and how Universal Design can be introduced into future policies.","[Grangaard, Sidse] Aalborg Univ, Danish Bldg Res Inst SBi, Aalborg, Denmark",Aalborg University,"Grangaard, S (通讯作者)，Aalborg Univ, Danish Bldg Res Inst, AC Meyers Vaenge 15, DK-2450 Kobenhavn Sv, Denmark.",sig@sbi.aau.dk,,"Grangaard, Sidse/0000-0003-3814-6614",,,,,24,3,3,1,8,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-9630,1879-8365,978-1-61499-923-2; 978-1-61499-922-5,STUD HEALTH TECHNOL,,,2018,256.0,,,,,,696,705,,10.3233/978-1-61499-923-2-696,0.0,,,10,"Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7JT,30371433.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455118100067,0

This is particularly timely in the Asia-Pacific region, where economies continue to show massive expansion of their built environments. This imperative to future-proof any development therefore is vital, especially considering the growing percentile of older people with their needs for safe and accessible living. Achieving these ends clearly implies a need both to educate professionals and to enact appropriate codes and standards, which in turn require the training of personnel to carry them out. Anticipating this need, Goal 3 of the United Nations Incheon Strategy (UNESCAP 2012) optimistically calls for civil society involvement in conducting accessibility audits, creating guidelines and advocacy work to promote universal design and to enhance mechanisms for tracking its progress. While such good intentions are admirable, they will require radical steps to be achieved. The paper describes examples, including those from the writers' own experiences, outlining a range of practical methods which academics and teachers involved in inculcating universal design principles in both European and Asian centres, through their teaching, training and technology transfer, can positively support continued cooperation towards a more inclusive World for everyone.","[Harrison, Jim; Busby, Kevin] Cork Ctr Architectural Educ, Cork, Ireland; [O'Shaughnessy, Tessa] Univ Coll Cork, Cork, Ireland",University College Cork,"Harrison, J (通讯作者)，Cork Ctr Architectural Educ, Cork, Ireland.",,,,,,,,6,0,0,2,8,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-9630,1879-8365,978-1-61499-923-2; 978-1-61499-922-5,STUD HEALTH TECHNOL,,,2018,256.0,,,,,,594,601,,10.3233/978-1-61499-923-2-594,0.0,,,8,"Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7JT,30371420.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455118100057,0

Respondents from eight countries across North America, Europe and East Asia were recruited from online panels. A total usable sample of 7,793 respondents was collected. Findings Respondents can be clustered in three segments: low-frequency consumer, common fruit consumer and high-frequency consumer. These consumer segments are heterogeneous in socioeconomics and shopping behavior across regions. Overall, the high-frequency consumer cluster had more individuals who were older, married, not single/never married, self-reported healthy and physically active. The low-frequency consumer group had a larger number of individuals who were younger, living alone, single/never married, self-reported unhealthy and not active.

This is reflected in the scope of the public administration, or to be more precise, in its widening due to the incorporation of new kinds of human activities, methods of legal regulation, e.g. in employing various mathematical criteria (impact indicators) in normative provisions, legal language, for example, in terms (notions) used in law making and applying the law, as well as in the ways of representing legal prescripts, for example, in the use of charts, columns, graphs and other non-standard technical legal instruments of representing legal norms. The efficiency and effectiveness public administration is largely determined by its systemic nature, based on systems approach principles ranged from achieving practical objectives in biology to the analysis of systemic human impact on nature to modelling global development to organizing a space program to shipping and transport management. Public administration should comprise today the issues connected with administrating the behavior of the subjects' of law with regard to public relations in the industrial sphere and environmental control (ecosystems). In the 21st century anthropogenic impact, admittedly, is coming into the lime light. Its results and consequences, particularly in the long term, are rather difficult to forecast with scientific precision, forestall and eliminate. So the prognosis principles to measure the technology related impact on a human is one of the urgent issues for effective, good faith and responsibility public administration.","[Kapustina, Mariia] St Petersburg State Univ, Fac Law, VO 22nd Line,7, St Petersburg 199026, Russia",Saint Petersburg State University,"Kapustina, M (通讯作者)，St Petersburg State Univ, Fac Law, VO 22nd Line,7, St Petersburg 199026, Russia.",m.kapustina@spbu.ru,,,Saint-Petersburg State University [26520757],Saint-Petersburg State University,The author acknowledges Saint-Petersburg State University for a research grant 26520757.,,19,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,244,253,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Law",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies; Government & Law,BP1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540727600029,0

Currently, the only treatment for CD is the complete avoidance of gluten, a protein commonly found in wheat, rye and barley. The use of alternative grains (AG) is highly recommended to individuals with CD to improve and diversify their diet. The purpose of this paper is to determine the current knowledge of the gluten-free diet (GFD), consumption rates of AG and awareness of AG, for individuals diagnosed with CD. Design/methodology/approach A total of 100 participants were recruited via local coeliac support groups as well as an Allergy and Free From Show, to participate in a survey. Consent was obtained from all organisations and all individual participants, prior to collecting data. The questionnaire consists of ten questions, related to participants' demographic characteristics, knowledge of gluten-free food (GFF) and AG and consumption rate of AG. (2) analyses were conducted to compare the variables between gender and time of diagnosis. Findings Overall, both genders possessed good knowledge of the GFD. Yogurt, vinegar and oats resulted in the highest incorrect responses. It was found that females possessed better knowledge of both GFF and AG. Rice, quinoa and corn were amongst the most popular AG consumed whilst job's tears, fonio and sorghum were the least consumed grains. Females reported a higher consumption rate of AG than males. Additionally, those more recently diagnosed had poorer knowledge of the GFD, reduced consumption rates of AG and poor awareness of AG. Originality/value It can be suggested that the incorporation of AG into the diet can prove beneficial for coeliacs and that both knowledge and education play a fundamental role in determining consumption rates amongst individuals.","[Laheri, Zainab] Univ Cent Lancashire, Fac Hlth & Wellbeing, Preston, Lancs, England; [Soon, Jan Mei] Univ Cent Lancashire, Int Inst Nutr Sci & Appl Food Safety Studies, Preston, Lancs, England",University of Central Lancashire; University of Central Lancashire,"Soon, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Lancashire, Int Inst Nutr Sci & Appl Food Safety Studies, Preston, Lancs, England.",zlaheri@uclan.ac.uk; jmsoon@uclan.ac.uk,,"Laheri, Zainab/0000-0002-6826-6468; Soon-Sinclair, Jan Mei/0000-0003-0488-1434",,,,,45,5,5,0,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The stigma of a long unemployment spell made reentering employment difficult even during the brisk economic recovery, which lead to unemployment hysteresis and persistently high joblessness. Unemployment figures disaggregated by duration confirm the importance of hysteresis for the Great Depression, as the long-term unemployed were less likely to return to gainful employment until the war. Using the theoretical framework of the Beveridge Curve, I find that hysteresis was a significant problem during the 1930s, but that the essentially unlimited labor demand during the World War II provided jobs even to the long-term unemployed. As a result, labor market conditions in the 1950s resembled those of the 1920s prior to the Depression and so the labor market scars of the Great Depression were healed.","[Mathy, Gabriel P.] Amer Univ, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Mathy, GP (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",mathy@american.edu,,,Institute for New Economic Thinking; ALL-UC Economic History Association,Institute for New Economic Thinking; ALL-UC Economic History Association,The support of the Institute for New Economic Thinking and the ALL-UC Economic History Association is much appreciated.

Inflation rate measured in terms of CPI and four major sector indices of Bombay Stock Exchange such as S&P BSE Fast Moving Consumer Goods, S&P BSE Healthcare, S&P BSE Information Technology and S&P BSE Bankex were taken for industry specific analysis. In view of the fact that CPI numbers are measured monthly, the study used monthly data of inflation rate and BSE Sectoral Indices from January 2012 to October 2017. Econometric techniques such as Augmented Dickey Fuller test, Johansen Co-integration test, VECM and VAR models were applied to the time series data.

In this paper an article about the influence of banking automation on unemployment was chosen and analyzed as a case study. Analysis showed that there is a correlation between the government expenditure on information and knowledge systems with unemployment. The government expenditure on information and knowledge systems can be considered as a contributing factor to the unemployment rate, as the study showed that banking automation increased the disguised unemployment by 17%.

The success of a revitalization program depends on the correct selection of tools and methods designed to solve the problems of the local community. Concentration of crisis phenomena and the developmental potential of the port in Kolobrzeg were the reasons behind the decision to prepare a plan of revitalization of the port premises. The purpose of the article is to indicate a model of economic activity which would increase the impact of the port on the local economy. The authors of the article put forward a hypothesis that the current way of operating the business prevented the full use of the port's development potential. Both primary and secondary sources of information were used in the article. To this end, the literature on the subject and numerous publications and scientific studies were reviewed. Research was conducted in the form of in-depth interviews with selected representatives of the Kolobrzeg municipality and the seaport. The article proposes basing local development on the polarization-diffusion model and creating a tourism cluster. Using different concepts of local development results from the presence of endogenous resources. In the case of transshipment operations, the port's economic base includes peripheral areas incapable of self-development. Therefore, the most essential element of the polarization-diffusion model is a key enterprise which creates a network of mutual connections with local business operators. In the conceptual framework of a tourism cluster, endogenous resources of the city of Kolobrzeg are more important. The implementation of the revitalization program will require an intervention of public authorities in the direction of improving the investment climate and mobilizing the endogenous resources.","[Nowaczyk, Piotr; Malkowski, Arkadiusz] West Pomeranian Univ Technol Szczecin, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt, Szczecin, Poland",West Pomeranian University of Technology,"Nowaczyk, P (通讯作者)，West Pomeranian Univ Technol Szczecin, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt, Szczecin, Poland.",piotr.nowaczyk@zut.edu.pl; arkadiusz.malkowski@zut.edu.pl,"Malkowski, Arkadiusz/AAG-6232-2021; Nowaczyk, Piotr/AAG-8427-2021","Malkowski, Arkadiusz/0000-0003-2769-245X; Nowaczyk, Piotr/0000-0001-8625-1959",,,,,39,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,579,588,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540733700064,0

Experiencing overload can be problematic from an organizational perspective diminishing the accuracy of decision-making, personal well-being, levels of experienced stress, job satisfaction, but also decision making, innovation, productivity, and fulfillment of job responsibilities. Two studies investigated the effect of overflow induced by email segregating task on cognitive performance and physiological markers of stress and cognitive load: heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV). In Study # 1. 134 participants were assigned to the overflow or control conditions and their subjective feeling of overload and cognitive performance were measured. In the overload condition participants reported higher levels of overload and exhibited lower levels of cognitive performance in a subsequent task as measured by mean response time and number of errors in the Stroop task. In Study #2. Twelve participants completed 3 sessions consisting of 3 tasks each. HRV was lower during the overflow task than during baseline indicating a greater cognitive load during the overflow condition. This effect did not diminish with repeated exposure to the overflow task. HR decreased during subsequent overflow tasks relative to baseline indicating the within-session habituation of stress in response to repeated exposures to the overflow task. Participants' self-response regarding core affect showed no difference between the overflow tasks relative to baseline. This indicates that physiological measurement of overflow may provide insight into monitoring overflow not available with questionnaire methods. Negative consequences of overloading are very important from the point of view of the organization, because impairment of cognitive tasks can translate into worse decision making and more mistakes made by employees, while a decrease in heart rate variability can lead to health consequences.","[Nowak, Krzysztof; Kuzminska, Anna Olga; Kowalczyk, Katarzyna Kinga] Univ Warsaw, Fac Management, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Nowak, K (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Management, Warsaw, Poland.",knowak@wz.uw.edu.pl; akuzminska@wz.uw.edu.pl; kkowalczyk@wz.uw.edu.pl,"Kowalczyk, Katarzyna/JOZ-8584-2023; Kuzminska, Anna/AAG-8771-2021","Kuzminska, Anna/0000-0002-6060-4549",National Science Center [2017/25/N/HS4/02137],"National Science Center(National Science Centre, Poland)",This research was partially supported by National Science Center grant nr. 2017/25/N/HS4/02137,,32,2,2,2,8,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,322,331,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540733700037,0

The analysis covers seven Asian (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Timor-Leste) and eight African (Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia) LDCs and is based on the Doing Business data. To study regulations affecting business activity in the considered LDCs the following ten indicators are used: starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts, and resolving insolvency. The Wroclaw taxonomy method is applied to establish similarities and differences in the evaluation of progress in doing business achieved by the studied countries. The most favourable environment for business start-ups and entrepreneurs has been created in Rwanda, Bhutan, and Zambia. The remaining LDCs were low ranked in the Doing Business 2018. In general, the fastest growing LDCs are doing the best in the areas of getting credit and paying taxes. On the other hand, they have the biggest problem in the areas of opening a business and getting electricity. Between 2008 and 2017, the greatest progress in improving business environment was made by Rwanda, Bhutan, Uganda, DRC, and Zambia. The biggest changes in the evaluation of doing business were observed in Rwanda, Bhutan, Tanzania, and Cambodia.

In this work, we measure the extent to which poor households engaging in illegal environmental activities underreport income in Laos. We use a two year panel data and apply the Engel curve to detect and estimate the reporting gap. We further use a switching probit regression to identify the factors of income underreporting and its impact on income poverty outcomes. Results show that on an average, rural households who earn at least a quarter of their income from the environment underreport by over 50% in household surveys resulting in overestimation of income poverty. Moreover, we find that a perceived threat to food security drives rural poor to engage in illegal environmental extraction. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of the article was to find out how the individual factors of industry and services contribute to total production and economic growth. We used the method of growth accounting: a dual approach that allowed us to track the contribution of individual inputs to production and economic growth. We wanted to prove that if one factor had at least a 5% greater share of overall growth than other factors for the whole economy, then this factor would be the main one for the individual sectors of the economy as well. Verification was carried out for two countries - Slovakia and Czechia in the crisis and the post-crisis period (2008-2016). We note that there was only one country whose main factor of economic growth was identical in both sectors (industry and services) and for the economy as a whole.

The purpose of this paper is to assess the patterns of snacking, meal consumption and fast food consumption among adolescents in private schools in Kolkata, India. Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional, paper-based, self-administered dietary and lifestyle survey was completed by 1,026 year-nine students aged 14-16 years. Cross-tabulation analyses were performed to compare the frequencies of various dietary behaviours across gender. Findings The two most common episodes for snacking among respondents were while watching television (57.9 per cent) and while interacting with peers (54.1 per cent). In contrast, snacking throughout the day (8.7 per cent) and in the middle of the night (7.8 per cent) were minimally practiced by the adolescents. The most regularly consumed meal was lunch (94.6 per cent), whereas the most frequently missed meal was breakfast (14.0 per cent). Fast food was most frequently consumed as snacks (26.8 per cent) but least frequently consumed for lunch (9.2 per cent). Overall, boys exhibited more unhealthy dietary behaviours than girls. Practical implications These findings highlight the need to develop nutrition education programmes for nutritionally vulnerable adolescents which communicate the importance of regular meal consumption, reduced intake of fast food and less snacking on energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods. Originality/value This is the first cross-sectional survey to investigate patterns of snacking, meal consumption and fast food consumption amongst urban Indian adolescents.","[Rathi, Neha; Riddell, Lynn; Worsley, Anthony] Deakin Univ, Sch Exercise & Nutr Sci, Geelong, Vic, Australia",Deakin University,"Rathi, N (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Sch Exercise & Nutr Sci, Geelong, Vic, Australia.",nrathi@deakin.edu.au,"Rathi, Neha/J-8684-2019","Rathi, Neha/0000-0002-6098-1723",,,,,41,19,19,0,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach Western (European) food advertisements published in Belgian food magazines were content analyzed to identify informational and transformational advertising appeals. Belgian food advertising was selected as an adequate representation of Western (European) food advertising because marketing in Belgium is permeated by international influences (cf. Belgian Federal Government). Advertisements were sampled from three magazines over a period of five years, from January 2009 to December 2013. The sample comprised 325 unique advertisements, including 159 for healthy foods and 166 for unhealthy foods. Findings The results of the content analysis indicated that healthy food advertisements in Belgium are mainly informational, whereas unhealthy food advertisements are mainly transformational. Originality/value This preliminary examination of informational and transformational advertising appeals in contemporary healthy food and unhealthy food advertisements shows that healthy food advertisements in Belgium are mainly informational, whereas the segment of consumers which is precarious - people low-involved with healthy food - are mainly attracted by transformational advertising appeals. The contrasting transformational strategy of unhealthy-food advertisements can provide inspiration for healthy food advertisers to help increase healthy food consumption.","[Roose, Gudrun; Geuens, Maggie; Vermeir, Iris] Univ Ghent, Dept Mkt, Ghent, Belgium; [Geuens, Maggie] Vlerick Business Sch, Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University; Vlerick Business School,"Roose, G (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Mkt, Ghent, Belgium.",gudrun.roose@ugent.be; maggie.geuens@ugent.be; Iris.Vermeir@Ugent.be,"Roose, Gudrun Thérèse Mia/AAH-1353-2020; Vermeir, Iris/L-6711-2018","Roose, Gudrun Thérèse Mia/0000-0002-2577-7735; Vermeir, Iris/0000-0003-0440-1381",Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology [IWT.141416],Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology,This work was supported by the Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology under Grant IWT.141416.,,56,9,9,5,44,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The research methodology includes the Delphi technique and incorporates interviews with three types of experts: instructors from culinary departments at a university, seasoned teppanyaki professionals and owners of teppanyaki establishments. An analysis of the responses provided by these industry experts led to identification of four dimensions of competences needed by teppanyaki chefs: knowledge, technique, affect and attitude. The K-S test involves using a z-test on ordinal variables for single samples to determine whether the sample distribution diverges from the frequency distribution. The z-score is greater than 1.96 which implies significance and consistency. Findings - This study analyzed the responses provided by the interviewed experts to identify and extract competences for teppanyaki chefs. The extracted competences comprise four dimensions (knowledge, technique, affect and attitude), 16 work-related tasks and 74 skills items. Originality/value - This study includes 16 work-related tasks, and 74 competences.

Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 455 specialty food customers in Bandung, Indonesia. Variance-based structural equation modeling (partial least squares (PLS)) was used to examine the relationship between the drivers (perceived quality, satisfaction and motivation) and loyalty according to the data presented by tourists and residents. Findings This study indicates that the perception of quality is an important factor affecting tourists' and residents' satisfaction with, and loyalty to, a product. Furthermore, this study suggests that motivation factors are important for tourists and residents in regard to developing loyalty to specialty foods. Practical implications This study provides a venue for retail managers and producers to improve their business performance by developing specialty foods of high quality. To improve their quality, this research suggests that managers and retailers focus on innovation based on exotic and unique traditional food reflecting the richness of local culture. To ensure their loyalty, customers of specialty foods need to be motivated by internal and external factors. Originality/value This study is one of the first to examine the formation of specialty food loyalty in two distinct groups of customers: tourists and residents.","[Suhartanto, Dwi; Sosianika, Adila] Politekn Negeri Bandung, Dept Business Adm, Bandung, Indonesia; [Chen, Brendan T.] Natl Chin Yi Univ Technol, Dept Leisure Ind Management, Taichung, Taiwan; [Mohi, Zurinawati] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Hotel & Tourism Management, Dept Hotel Management, Bandar Puncak Alam, Malaysia",Bandung State Polytechnic; National Chin-Yi University of Technology,"Chen, BT (通讯作者)，Natl Chin Yi Univ Technol, Dept Leisure Ind Management, Taichung, Taiwan.",dwi.suhartanto@polban.ac.id; brendan@ncut.edu.tw; zurin979@salam.uitm.edu.my; adila.sosianika@polban.ac.id,"Sosianika, Adila/CAF-9801-2022; suhartanto, dwi/A-7272-2018; Mohi, Zurinawati/J-8486-2015; Sosianika, Adila/ABG-9336-2020; Mohi, Zurinawati/U-3251-2019","Sosianika, Adila/0000-0003-4006-3711; Mohi, Zurinawati/0000-0003-2785-5669",,,,,44,24,25,1,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Meat anti-consumption is a central topic in nutrition, and a relevant issue for consumer studies. The purpose of this paper is to understand why and how consumers avoid meat consumption. Design/methodology/approach A content analysis of web forums was conducted. Findings Meat avoiders think that meat is unhealthy and expensive. Other reasons for meat anti-consumption include concerns associated with lifestyle and sustainability, but the prevalence of these factors is considerably lower than health and economic concerns. Research limitations/implications Attitudes toward all kinds of meat were evaluated in the forum data. Further studies can be conducted on separate preferences for red or white meat. Since these data were collected from web forums in Turkey, research can also be extended to other countries. Practical implications Regarding health and sustainability concerns, consumer trust in producers and consumer consciousness about the environment may be improved by social marketing. To address lifestyle concerns, marketers can provide meatless offerings in convenient servings. Originality/value This study provides a coherent four-dimensional conceptual framework about the motives for meat anti-consumption, focusing on sustainability, personal health, economic concerns and lifestyle.","[Tosun, Petek] Istanbul Bilgi Univ, Inst Social Sci, Istanbul, Turkey; [Gurce, Merve Yanar] Gedik Univ, Fac Econ Adm & Social Sci, Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Bilgi University; Gedik University,"Tosun, P (通讯作者)，Istanbul Bilgi Univ, Inst Social Sci, Istanbul, Turkey.",petektosun@yahoo.com,"Tosun, Petek/AAM-9761-2021","Tosun, Petek/0000-0002-9228-8907",,,,,56,8,9,2,25,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

One of the main goals of organizing and developing an internal control system is to provide reasonable assurance on the reliability of financial reporting. In this context, internal controls are designed to provide the comprehensiveness and accuracy of accounting records that result from appropriate recording of business transactions, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, standards and law regulations. This also reflects the role of internal control in preparing and presenting positions in financial statements. Reliable financial statements are of utmost importance not only for management and its responsibility in the context of financial reporting but also for numerous external users who make certain business decisions based on information presented in financial statements. The existence of effective internal controls in the company should therefore increase the quality of financial reporting. Disadvantages or material weaknesses of internal controls in this context may adversely affect the reliability of the information presented in financial statements. Certain accounting categories are particularly vulnerable to irregularities and weaknesses of internal controls. For example, revenue recognition is a particularly important area in financial reporting which is often associated with weaknesses of internal controls, primarily because of insufficient revenue recognition policies. Development and implementation of new accounting standards requires adaptation of internal controls to support new requirements and ensure reliable financial reporting. Therefore, this paper will analyse the importance of internal controls for the quality of financial reporting with special emphasis on possibilities for adapting and upgrading internal controls as a result of changes in accounting regulation in order to assure reliable financial reporting.","[Tusek, Boris; Novak, Ana; Barisic, Ivana] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, JF Kennedy 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Tusek, B (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, JF Kennedy 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",btusek@efzg.hr; anovak@efzg.hr; ibarisic@efzg.hr,"Novak, Ana/H-8588-2018; Barišić, Ivana/Y-3493-2019; Tusek, Boris/H-9445-2018","Novak, Ana/0000-0002-5264-6482; Barišić, Ivana/0000-0003-2635-1063;",,,,,29,0,0,0,7,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,1155,1164,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900121,0

Companies that can prove their programs and documents comply to the high level of quality requirements, have capable human potential with experience and knowledge, financial strength, innovation, creativity potential can be accredited to compete in Nuclear Quality Assurance (NQA)(2) Standards. Quality, environmental, occupational health and safety management systems are part of an Integrated Management System (IMS)(3) and also includes employee training as a decisive element of promoting corporate sustainability of a socially responsible organization. Various industries suchas Nuclear Power Generation have stringent certifications which are barriers to entry for potential suppliers. For companies operating under the nuclear program there are strictly prescribed quality standards that must be adhered to. These programs and procedures conform to a high level of workmanship and quality assurance therefore they require experienced and knowledgeable personnel and financial strength to be able to maintain these NQA standards. Hence, the sustainability or survival of a company in the present and the future depends, inter alia, on obtaining and maintaining necessary certifications in order to be accepted as part of the Nuclear supply chain. This requires constant engagement and investing in educating employees to achieve innovativeness and creativity to pursue the highest production standards to successfully compete regionally and globally. Once a company receives NQA's regulatory body qualification approval, they are given the opportunity to compete as contractors and suppliers within the nuclear and power generation industry. One of the most important components of company success is training and development program of existing employees and new talents. Labor force expertise and competence are important components in global competitiveness. Additionally, a significant component of the program is research and development, as well as planned upgrades of future development in the company itself. Those are considered key drivers of technological innovation and economic advancement, especially in regional economies. A planned upgrade could be to obtain a more stringent quality certification which in turn would raise a company's competitiveness. The ability to stay above other lower quality suppliers especially when vying for work in the Nuclear market. Nuclear Quality Standards such as CSA N299 which is a recognized Canadian Nuclear Standard in which EU companies have attained this standard as suppliers to the Canadian nuclear industry. This paper outlines the strategic guidelines for achieving the status of an authorized company to be part of the supply chain in accordance with the most stringent NQA Standards. Work on the program requires a good analysis of the current state of the company's financial, competence, ability to innovate, and successful previous projects. The aim of the paper is to analyze the economic impact of IMS and how the implementation of quality standards contributes to sustainable development in competitive global business. At the same time this work could be initiated by suppliers from the Republic of Croatia in order to estimate the possibility of access to exclusive suppliers for the Canadian nuclear market.

Because of the inherent characteristics that distinguish them from other entrepreneurial ventures (e.g. scalability, growth rates, funding sources, business model innovations, etc.), startups require special research attention. Although there is a large number of scientific and professional researches in the world that study this issue more thoroughly, studies that analyze the current state of affairs and specifics of Croatian startups as well as the key issues that they are facing are still missing. For these reasons, authors conducted a primary research whose main goal was to gain a clear insight into the current state of Croatian startups, the industries in which they operate, the sources of financing they use, their ownership structure, financial indicators, specifics of the internationalization process, investments in research and development, and other business specifics and management expectations. Based on the results obtained, it is possible to compare the state of the startup scene in Croatia with the situation in other countries and propose appropriate measures for its improvement. The research was conducted through a questionnaire that was distributed to a random sample of 100 startup companies. The results of the research have shown a weak interaction of domestic startups with foreign entities, weak focus on foreign sources of funding, and poor differentiation of the sources of funding used, especially when it comes to exploiting opportunities offered by venture capital funds, crowdfunding etc. Approximately half of the Croatian startup companies make their first sales revenues in the first year of existence and most of them make a positive financial result already within the first two years of doing business, which are specificities that indicate a clear distinction between ways of doing business and the expected time frame for return on investments among Croatian and global startups. Approximately 40% of Croatian startups make less than 5% of their total revenues on foreign markets, which may indicate a lack of ambition of the owners or company executives, but may implicitly point to the lack of innovation in business models in the global context.","[Wittine, Zoran; Bosnjak, Mile; Bedekovic, Helena] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Trg JF Kennedyja 6, HR-10000 Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Wittine, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Trg JF Kennedyja 6, HR-10000 Zagreb, Croatia.",zwittine@efzg.hr; mbosnjak1@net.efzg.hr; hbedekovi@net.efzg.hr,"Bošnjak, Mile/T-3085-2018; Bošnjak, Mile/K-7237-2019","Bošnjak, Mile/0000-0002-7663-198X; Bošnjak, Mile/0000-0002-7663-198X",,,,,17,0,0,0,8,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,207,215,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900021,0

HakeSim, an agent-based model of this fishing industry, is used to explore these interactions, how companies could cope with increased fuel prices, and to provide insight into profit-risk trade-offs and vulnerabilities of companies. Apart from increasing catch per unit effort (CPUE), which is often detrimental to fish stocks, fuel price increases could be offset by increasing hake market value, achieved by processing fish to higher value end products with a lower catch cost per tonne. Industry's present fleet size and composition is demonstrated to result from profit risk trade-offs: the flexibility to respond to mismatches between total allowable catch and CPUE, market demands for frozen and fresh product types, and environmental variability. Smaller companies have less risk-averse strategies and are more vulnerable to uncertainty in catches than larger companies, which may explain ongoing trends in consolidation in the industry. Increasing the proxy for environmental uncertainty increased risk to all companies without increasing profits. Incorporating more realistic environmental effects and feedbacks with industry in HakeSim could be an exciting future direction. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This articlemaps the change in infant mortality rate (IMR) between the 1850s and the 1900s at registration district (RD) level. Latent trajectory analysis, a longitudinal model-based clustering method, is used to identify the clusters into which rural RDs fell, based on their IMR trajectories. Relationships between IMR and population density, fertility, female tuberculosis mortality, female illiteracy, male agricultural wages, and distance from London are examined in a longitudinal study. The tuberculosis (maternal health), illiteracy (education), and distance variables had the most effect. IMR responded most strongly to improving health and education in the east, less in the central area, and least in the north and west. The eastern zone's higher-than-average mid-century infant mortality therefore declined faster than the national average. A central and southern zone had slightly lower IMR in mid-century but did not keep up with the rate of decline in the east. The peripheral north and west had the lowest mid-century rates but their decline was overtaken by the other zones. The interpretation of these findings and their relevance to the wider study of infant mortality are discussed.","[Atkinson, Paul; Francis, Brian; Gregory, Ian; Porter, Catherine] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster, England",Lancaster University,"Atkinson, P (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Lancaster, England.",,"Francis, Brian J/A-1953-2011; Porter, Catherine/AAA-8203-2022","Porter, Catherine/0000-0002-4541-064X; Atkinson, Paul/0000-0001-8740-6561; Gregory, Ian/0000-0001-8745-2242; Francis, Brian/0000-0001-7926-9085",European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union [283850]; European Research Council (ERC) [283850] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)/ERC grant 'Spatial humanities: texts, GIS, places' (agreement no. 283850).

Prior research has shown that making monetary value salient fosters self-interested behavior in experimental settings (Vohs, Mead, and Goode, 2006), reduces the intrinsic value ascribed to pro-social activities such as volunteering (Pfeffer and DeVoe, 2009), and reduces the efficacy of environmentally relevant interventions (Steinhorst, Klockner, and Matthies, 2015). These findings raise concern that ecosystem service Valuation information might adversely impact individual's pro-environmental behaviors. This study uses an experimental framework to determine whether ordinary citizens' exposure to valuation information, such as one might encounter in a news article or fundraising materials, might influence an individual's contribution to a natural resource conservation fund. The study is implemented with 250 participants from across the United States. We find that participants who receive a natural resource description plus valuation treatment donate a statistically significant lower dollar amount of their experimental earnings on average than those who read the narrative alone. Based upon this evidence, we assert that ecosystem service valuation information has the potential to negatively impact financial support for the exact resources the information is designed to promote.

It uses a large sample of nearly 30,000 shareholders based on 197 sets of share records, a large and representative database of the investor population across sectors and time. It investigates the structure and the evolution of local investment preference between shareholders and the companies in which they invested, as measured by the distance between where they lived and corporate headquarters. The study offers evidence of strong initial local investment preference, which declined over time for non-Londoners, but remained strong for Londoners until the 1930s. Local investment preference of security holders was related to the size of the board of directors and, for wealthy investors, was related to the age of the firm. For large firms, local networks between investors and directors appear stronger when director shareholdings and voting rights were important. This study supports the analytical hypothesis of local informal trust networks between investors and directors as a means to overcome informational asymmetries and weak legal protection, and provides evidence that local preference was a means to curb insider opportunism and private benefits of control.","[Rutterford, Janette; Sotiropoulos, Dimitris P.] Open Univ, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England; [van Lieshout, Carry] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England",Open University - UK; University of Cambridge,"Rutterford, J (通讯作者)，Open Univ, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England.",,,"Rutterford, Janette/0000-0001-6517-1781; Sotiropoulos, Dimitris/0000-0002-0585-9426; van Lieshout, Carry/0000-0002-3856-3701",UK's Economic and Social Research Council [RES-000-23-1435]; Economic and Social Research Council [RES-000-23-1435] Funding Source: researchfish,UK's Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We would like to thank the three anonymous referees for their suggestions and critical comments on the first version of this article.

Specifically, the economic rationale behind world-wide wind power deployment is to mitigate negative externalities of conventional electricity technologies, notably emissions from fossil fuels. However, wind power entails externalities itself. Wind turbines can lower quality of human life through noise and visual impacts, and threaten wildlife. Variable wind electricity can impose additional costs within the electricity system. Locally and nationally, employment, output, and security of electricity supply can be affected. Assembling evidence from diverse strands of research, this literature review provides a structured account of external and indirect costs, both mitigated and imposed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A major challenge is overcoming the associated costs to agricultural producers. We integrate spatially-explicit models of ecosystem processes with agricultural commodity production models to analyze the biophysical and economic consequences of alternative land use and land management patterns to achieve Total Maximum Daily Loads targets in a proto-typical agricultural watershed. We apply these models to find patterns that maximize water quality objectives for given levels of foregone agricultural profit. We find it is possible to reduce baseline watershed phosphorus loads by similar to 20% and sediment loads by similar to 18% without any reduction in agricultural profits. Our results indicate that meeting more stringent targets will result in substantial economic loss. However, when we add the social benefits from water quality improvement and carbon sequestration to private agricultural net returns we find that water quality improvements up to 50% can be obtained at no loss to societal returns. The cost of meeting water quality targets will vary over time as commodity and ecosystem service, prices fluctuate. If crop prices drop or the value of ecosystem services increase, then achieving higher water quality goals will be less costly. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In order to account for commensurability, weighting and aggregation issues of the performance indicators in regional waste and materials' management, this paper advocates a conditional directional distance version of the Benefit-of-the-Doubt weighting technique. In addition, the waste management hierarchy defined by the EU is strongly embedded in the construction of our composite indicator. The results reveal considerable differences in the aggregate performance of the regions, even within Member States. In general, waste sectors of the NUTS 2-regions in Austria, Belgium, and Germany generally do well in terms of MSW management. Our results also reveal that some differences in the operating environment of the regions, such as the number of tourist overnight stays, are related to the aggregate performance of the regions. However, the observation that other conditions are not significantly related to the performance on a regional level is interesting as many policy makers frequently argue that the level of performance in their regions cannot be compared to that in other regions precisely due to this difference in operating conditions.

These results reinforce the idea that advocates of cost-effective conservation need to address concerns about fairness and transparency and remedy gaps in the knowledge and expertise of professionals involved.

Scientific developments for collecting information necessary to informed consent far outpace the development of inter-Korean regulatory frameworks. This paper seeks to identify how the intersection of legal and technological disciplines can foster informed consent, through the responsible application of satellite data. The permanent record of standard satellite remote-sensing systems demonstrates its capability of presenting area-wide visual evidence of forest conditions. Such data are essential to initiating informed consent, establishing a carbon stock baseline, detecting and quantifying rates of land-cover change, and quantifying above-ground biomass stocks as specified in the Kyoto Protocol. This research could be a valuable reference for utilizing the capabilities of satellites with informed consent obligations in North Korea by suggesting the provision of realistic informed consent mechanisms.","[Um, Dan-Bi] Korea Univ, Sch Law, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 136701, South Korea; [Um, Jung-Sup] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Dept Geog, 80 Univ Rd, Daegu 702701, South Korea",Korea University; Kyungpook National University,"Um, JS (通讯作者)，Kyungpook Natl Univ, Dept Geog, 80 Univ Rd, Daegu 702701, South Korea.",jsaeom@knu.ac.kr,"Um, Jung-Sup/AAE-7721-2019; Um, Jung-Sup/F-5351-2018","Um, Jung-Sup/0000-0002-3123-3515;",Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [NRF-2015R1D1A1A01056801],Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education,"This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF-2015R1D1A1A01056801).

Within this nexus, one area, labelled 'Corporate Sustainability', emphasizes the interactions between economic, environmental and social values. The need to consider multiple values has contributed to a blur in the conceptual landscape. This is partly due to the fact that authors often address epistemological challenges,on an implicit level. Moreover, hidden ideologies, e.g. the profit maximization paradigm, can explain the conceptual obscurity. The contribution of this article is twofold. Firstly, a conceptual framework is developed based on the dichotomy of positivism and constructivism. A relation is established between these epistemological positions and the analytic treatment of environmental and social values. The framework can be applied to increase transparency on epistemological challenges and thereby strengthening construct validity in the field. Secondly, an analysis of the most influential literature from the last 50 years shows that,there is a trend of clustering theoretical positions and value constructs without any critical awareness of their philosophical assumptions. The authors hope that acknowledgement of a multi-paradigmatic approach can help to clarify the epistemology of the research area by establishing pluralism as an explicit position.

We used a range of variables to construct indices of risk taking, risk perception and risk management. These indices were then included as arguments in an input distance function which represents the production technology. Our results show that these risk indices did affect productivity. Regional differences in productivity, though small, were also found to exist, suggesting that unobserved edaphic factors that differ between regions also affected productivity.","[Lien, Gudbrand; Kumbhakar, Subal C.] Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res, Oslo, Norway; [Lien, Gudbrand] Lillehammer Univ Coll, Fac Econ & Org Sci, Lillehammer, Norway; [Kumbhakar, Subal C.] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, Binghamton, NY USA; [Hardaker, J.

Equity perceptions are powerful determinants of human behaviour and, consequently, many environmental conflicts arise from contested visions of what constitutes as 'equitable' environmental management Therefore, equity can play an instrumental role in shaping outcomes of PFES schemes. This paper analyzes how contextual, procedural and distributive equity considerations are reflected in national PFES legislation and implementation, how equity outcomes are perceived locally, and whether local perceptions match legislative considerations. We reviewed national legislation and government reports, conducted expert interviews on the national and provincial level, as well as surveys, focus group discussions, and in-depth interviews on the local level. Our findings reveal that equity outcomes are very much affected by contextual factors, such as how the Forest Land Allocation regulation determines the distribution of use rights. In the implementation of PFES national aspirations and rationales of equity as outlined in legislation were not met due to technical constraints, financial costs, and social and institutional conflicts. The implemdntation on the ground contrasts with local interests. Our results show that on the local level the preference for a distributive equity principle is very much influenced by the degree of transparency of the payment distribution process. The prevailing perceptions of equitable benefit distribution by local PFES participants correspond to a merit-based principle of compensation for the effort of forest protection.

The not-for-profit food rescue organizations, aid in alleviating hunger, by rescuing the surplus food from different food providers and re-distributing to people in need. However, surplus food donation is a random process which varies with regard to quantity, time and place. Understanding the dynamics of food recovery and forecasting food donations using historical information has significant importance in inventory management and redistribution, particularly in reducing operational costs and achieving a sustainable and equitable distribution of inventory incorporating uncertainties in supply. This paper uses different modelling techniques including multiple linear regression, structural equation modelling and neural networks to explore the patterns and dynamics of food donation and distribution process for one of the largest food rescue organization in Australia. A set of significant indicators has been identified to describe the current food donation process, to predict daily average food donated by different food providers and also to anticipate the potential donation from a new donor which may appear in the network in the future. Results suggest that structural equation modelling and neural networks provide improved demand estimation when compared to conventional multiple linear regression. We also discuss the usefulness of these models in sustainable and equitable management of food recovery and redistribution. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach - A total of 80 samples were collected in two batches of 40 samples each in January and June, 2015 from eight major markets from Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. The samples were analyzed for the proximate components, quality indices (total soluble nitrogen, TSN and volatile fatty acid, VFA), and for the presence of pathogenic bacteria, Campylobacter jejuni (CJ), Listeria monocytogenes (LM), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MT), Salmonella spp. (SS), Escherichia coli (EC), and Yersinia enterocolitica (YE), and heavy metals such as (lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), and chromium (Cr) concentrations. Findings - The results revealed that the values of moisture, protein, fat, crude fiber, and ash contents (%) of warankasi samples were in the range 46.26 +/- 1.41-51.24 +/- 1.61, 33.92 +/- 1.18-37.26 +/- 1.42, 6.74 +/- 0.64-8.33 +/- 0.96, 1.27 +/- 0.02-1.73 +/- 0.09, 1.31 +/- 0.03-1.78 +/- 0.08, respectively. The values of TSN (mgN/kg) and VFA (%) were in the range of 1.19+0.10-2.54+0.18, and 5.79+0.19-9.12+0.30, respectively. The results further revealed the presence of CJ and SS and the absence of LM, MT, EC, and YE from the warankasi samples. Heavy metals detected in all the warankasi samples were generally below the maximum acceptable limits set by the World Health Organization for Pb (0.3 ppm), Cd (0.2 ppm), Hg (0.2 ppm), and Cr (0.5 ppm) with the exemption of samples from Iwo Road and Ojoo which were higher than other samples. Research limitations/implications - This research work was conducted between January and June, 2015 and better results could be obtained if the study had been done for a longer period of time. Practical implications - The paper helps in showing the quality and microbial safety of street-vended warankasi and this may bring imperative information and general consciousness on the microbiological safety of warankasi. Originality/value - Much has been done concerning warankasi processing but little work has been done concerning street-vended warankasi.

Finally, we 'calibrate' Democratic Valuation against another alternative to conventional stated preference approaches, namely Deliberative Monetary Valuation (DMV).

Europe has the largest share in world on the market of river cruising where the most frequent cruises are on the Danube River and its tributaries and the canal of Rhein - Maine - Danube. Considering the aforementioned and the fact that the Croatian tourism product of river cruising is almost exclusively related to the Danube River, an opportunity is opened up for river cruises to be a significant contributor to the economic development of eastern Croatia. This is also supported by the current forecasts of ship and passenger traffic on cruises on the Danube in Croatia, which indicate a likely continued and accelerated increase in demand. Thus arises the problem of how to appropriately prepare to make the positive effects of this type of tourism for the region as large as possible. When considering the tourist product of river cruises and its specificities it is necessary to highlight the role of destination ports of call for shipping companies whose attractiveness plays a decisive role in the selection of destinations that will be included in companies itineraries. Ports or destinations with authentic and generally more attractive offers with greater availability of the med itineraries tailored to specific interests of tourists generate greater benefits from river cruising. By intensifying marketing activities towards the shipping companies and with the usage of marketing concept an increase can be achieved in the number of dockings of river ships in Croatian ports and harbors or the representation of Croatian destination ports of call in the itineraries of shipping companies. The aim of this paper is to determine the role played by the destination ports of call as part of the tourism product of river cruising and to suggest a marketing mix for destination ports of call that they have to effectively manage if they are to survive in the competitive environment on the dynamic international market of river cruising. For the purposes of collecting the primary data, the method of critical analysis was used on collected documents and interviewing method with key stakeholders of river cruising.","[Bosnic, Irena] Virovitica Coll, Matije Gupca 78, Virovitica 33000, Croatia",,"Bosnic, I (通讯作者)，Virovitica Coll, Matije Gupca 78, Virovitica 33000, Croatia.",irena.bosnic@vsmti.hr,"Bosnić, Irena/JHS-4977-2023",,,,,,12,0,0,0,2,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,778,786,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500075,0

More clarity is vital for informed decision making, especially as water scarcity continues to increase in many regions across the globe. The objective of this study is to estimate the volume of freshwater yield saved per dollar invested in forest restoration at several sites on Hawai'i Island. Using budget information and publicly available land cover and evapotranspiration data, we find that under baseline conditions-a 3% discount rate and 10% rate of spread for existing non-native plant species-1487 l are saved on average across management sites per dollar invested. In other words, $0.67 in present value terms is required to protect every 1000 l of freshwater over a 50-year time horizon. Annual benefits increase continuously as the avoided loss of freshwater yield rises over time, while conservation costs tend to be front-loaded, as a result of high fence installation and ungulate removal costs. Thus, it is important to consider the long run when comparing the benefits and costs of conservation activities. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Examples include our societal addiction to inequitable over-consumption fueled by fossil energy and a growth at all costs economic model. This paper explores the potential to learn from successful therapies at the individual level. In particular, Motivational Interviewing (MI) is one of the most effective therapies. It is based on engaging addicts in a positive discussion of their goals, motives, and futures. We suggest that one analogy to MI at the societal level is a modified version of scenario planning (SP) that has been extended to engage the entire community (CSP) in thinking about goals and alternative futures via public opinion surveys and forums. Both MI and CSP are about exploring alternative futures in positive, non-confrontational ways and building commitment or consensus about preferred futures. We conclude that effective therapies for societal addictions may be possible, but, as we learn from MI, they will require a rebalancing of effort away from only pointing out the dire consequences of current behavior (without denying those consequences) and toward building a shared vision of a positive future and the means to get there.

Athens has been always considered among the most attractive tourist destinations given the fact that is known for its abundant historical and cultural inheritance and significant philosophers, historians and scientists. In recent years has been developed a different, mostly negative image. Therefore, the current study will examine those negative aspects of Athens that led to its degradation as a tourist destination and it will present the point of view not only that of experienced tourism professionals, but also that of tourists; The research aims to investigate the attractiveness and the competitiveness of Athens as a City Break destination. A survey through questionnaires has been conducted among actual international visitors of Athens, in order to explore tourists' preferences and their perception regarding Athens image, as a City Break destination. The methodology, that was adopted, consists of two concrete phases. During the first phase, questionnaires were created and submitted. During the second phase, the data set were collected, preprocessed and analyzed based on Data Mining techniques evaluating the results. More specifically, classification algorithms were utilized so as to manage to describe hidden patterns. Also, the parameters of the algorithms were set, depending on the application cases, and the results were correlated with the demographic characteristics of the respondents, in order to evaluate and assess the significance of exported rules/conclusions. The study's major contribution is that to identify Athens' perceived image as a City Break Destination, and pinpoints to critical factors for achieving higher level of satisfaction in future tourists.","[Panas, Gerasimos; Heliades, Georgios; Tsavalia, Dimitra; Bougioura, Argyro] Technol Educ Inst Ionian Isl, Dept Digital Media & Commun, Argostoli, Kefalonia, Greece; [Halkiopoulos, Constantinos] Univ Patras, Artificial Intelligence Res Ctr, Dept Math, Patras, Greece",University of Patras,"Panas, G (通讯作者)，Technol Educ Inst Ionian Isl, Dept Digital Media & Commun, Argostoli, Kefalonia, Greece.",gpanas75@gmail.com,"Halkiopoulos, Constantinos/AAM-6206-2021; Halkiopoulos, Constantinos/O-7266-2017","Halkiopoulos, Constantinos/0000-0001-7924-5075",,,,,20,1,1,1,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,,978-3-319-47732-9; 978-3-319-47731-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,85,103,,10.1007/978-3-319-47732-9_6,0.0,,,19,"Business; Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BI3AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000410645700006,0

The purpose of this study is to determine whether condiments placed on tables at dining facilities can affect consumers' cuisine selection. Design/methodology/approach - Four individual booths were set up with four different condiment configurations: 1) branded ketchup and mustard, 2) unbranded ketchup and mustard, 3) unbranded soy sauce and chili-garlic sauce, and 4) no condiment. In all, 68 participants were assigned in random sequence to all booths, with each given a menu listing nine different cuisines (three North American, three Asian, and three Hispanic cuisines) in a random order, and asked to identify their top three preferred cuisines at each booth. Findings - Participants chose Asian cuisines with higher priority than Mexican and North American selections when Asian condiments were placed on the table. Interestingly, this effect occurred only when the participants had noticed the condiment setting, but not when they had unnoticed it. Such Asian condiment availability-induced cuisine selection was also more pronounced for external eaters. Originality/value - This study provides new empirical evidence that consumers are more likely to select cuisines congruent to the choice of condiment setting placed on their dining table.","[Pellegrino, Robert] Tech Univ Dresden, Smell & Taste Clin, Dresden, Germany; [Frederick, Brittany; Venzel, Ana H. da Silveira; Rios, Alisson A.; Seo, Han-Seok] Univ Arkansas, Dept Food Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72703 USA; [Tijare, Vishwesh] Columbus Foods, San Francisco, CA USA; [Gomes, Thais M.

Design/methodology/approach -Based on the literature, three food taxation schemes were developed (sugar tax, saturated fat tax and a nutrient profiling tax) and implemented in the three-dimensional virtual supermarket. A randomized control trial was conducted to determine the differences in the amount of energy (kcal), saturated fat (gram) and sugar (gram) purchased for a one-week food basket. Findings -In total, 191 Dutch adults were randomly assigned to a sugar-tax condition (n = 48), a saturated fat-tax condition (n = 37), a nutrient profiling-tax condition (n = 62) and a control (no-tax) condition (n = 44). Fully adjusted models indicated that compared to the no-tax condition, no significant effects of a sugar-tax condition (B: -2,041 kcal (95% CI -5,350 to 1,914)), saturated fat-tax condition (B: -2,717 kcal (95% CI -6,596 to 1,163)) or nutrient profiling-tax condition (B: -1,124 kcal (95% CI -4,538 to 2,292)) were found on the amount of energy purchased. Also, none of the taxation schemes showed significant effects on saturated fat or sugar purchased.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper introduces the concept of ROO-COO distance, defined as the importance attributed to a product-specific ROO as compared to its COO. In order to better understand whether the construct ROO-COO distance influences the willingness to pay a premium price, the paper considers consumers' cross-national differences and their knowledge, distinguishing among three types of knowledge: consumers' subjective general product knowledge, consumers' subjective country product knowledge and consumers' regional product experience (PE). Four hypotheses were tested focussing on Chianti Classico-a premium wine-as related to its ROO and COO (Tuscany, Italy). The authors employed a sample of 4,254 consumers originating from New World countries (Australia, USA and Canada) and Old World countries (Germany, UK, Sweden and Belgium). Findings - The findings confirm that a place-of-origin influence on price-related product evaluations is country specific. Furthermore, the moderating role of consumers' subjective product knowledge and consumers' region-related PEs differ across countries. The ROO-COO distance was found to positively affect only Old World consumers. It was established that respondents' subjective country/product knowledge and consumers' regional knowledge or PEs positively moderate this relationship. Originality/value - The paper links the COO and ROO effects in a single framework and analyses it at the cross-national level, while also considering the moderating effect of consumer's knowledge.","[Pucci, Tommaso; Zanni, Lorenzo] Univ Siena, Dept Business & Law, Siena, Italy; [Casprini, Elena] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Management, Pisa, Italy; [Rabino, Samuel] Northeastern Univ, Damore McKim Sch Business, Boston, MA 02115 USA",University of Siena; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; Northeastern University,"Zanni, L (通讯作者)，Univ Siena, Dept Business & Law, Siena, Italy.",lorenzo.zanni@unisi.it,"Casprini, Elena/GRS-9508-2022",,,,,,68,13,13,2,23,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Ignoring the other scale may potentially change the interpretation of resilience in socio-ecological systems (SES). Thus, this paper argues that the co-evolution of both resiliencies must be studied to capture multi-scale complexity. We attempt to close this gap by assessing resilience at both scales of a village community in Thaba Nchu, South Africa. Villagers use a commonly managed rangeland for beef cattle production. An agent based model of household interaction coupled with a biophysical model of the rangeland measures the resiliencies of the SES towards a shock, a stress and a policy intervention. Currently, the SES remains in a stable attractor in terms of SES resilience. Household resilience, however, degrades in a process of structural change. A drought scenario shows improved SES resilience but structural change at household level accelerated. An increase in the number absentee herders increases the likelihood for SES collapse by eroding social embededdness. Finally, an introduced basic income grant demonstrates that the SES is able to cope with an increased number of appropriators. However, interaction of the policy intervention with an exogenous stress translates into an increased probability of SES decoupling. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The results show a significant negative relation between the real effective exchange rate rise and import and export trade, but the time of the influence on the import is shorter than the export, therefore, in the long term, the increase of the RMB real effective exchange rate may cause a decline in net exports. The real effective exchange rate volatility has a negative impact on FDI both in the short term and long term, but the effect is not significant. Above all, the increase of the RMB real effective exchange rate may have a positive impact on economic growth in the short term, but in the long run, it will have a significant negative effect on economic growth. Therefore, we should pay more attention to the continued appreciation of the RMB brought about by the increase in international demand and establish relate measures to stable real exchange rate and maintain sustained economic growth on the basis of preventing the RMB exchange crisis.","[Wang, Shujuan; Ye, Shujun; Li, Xinyang] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Jiaotong University,"Wang, SJ (通讯作者)，Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",15113188@bjtu.edu.cn,"N, A/JUF-6197-2023; Li, Zilong/JEZ-8642-2023",,,,,,15,0,0,0,6,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-5386-0995-8,,,,2017,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7,Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BJ6EQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426596000004,0

This model is applied to cases with less effective (diluted) incentives, in two ways: the sponsor must compensate all farmers in a group instead of only the single farmer targeted (group incentives); and a fraction of REDD+ payments is captured by an elite not directly involved in forest protection, and not worthy of support by a benevolent sponsor (elite capture). I extend the traditional REDD + literature by including benevolent sponsors who are fully concerned with the welfare of the target (farmer) group. Payments are then increased, perhaps dramatically; but reduced by a selfish sponsor. An efficient solution can then be attained by a benevolent sponsor, albeit only for a high PES payment. With elite capture, payments are reduced for all sponsors, and full efficiency never attained. With selfish sponsors no viable PES scheme may exist. When the group incentive scheme rewards only farmers who save their forests, incentives are not eroded by the scheme.","[Strand, Jon] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Strand, J (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",jstrand1344@gmail.com,,"Strand, Jon/0000-0001-8620-8504",,,,,20,2,2,0,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Coping with weather risk through credit and insurance markets is almost inexistent as these markets are imperfect in the African economies. Even though land fragmentation is often considered as a barrier to agricultural productivity, this article aims at analyzing whether land fragmentation, as an insurance alternative, is able to reduce farmers' exposure to weather variability. In order to address this research question, I use the Living Standards Measurement Study-Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) data on Uganda. After dealing with the endogeneity of land fragmentation, I find that higher land fragmentation decreases the loss of crop yield when households experience rainfall anomalies, but remains detrimental for those households that are not exposed to such irregularities. Therefore, policy makers should be cautious while implementing uniform land consolidation programs.","[Veljanoska, Stefanija] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, RITM Univ Paris Sud, Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France",Paris School of Economics,"Veljanoska, S (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, RITM Univ Paris Sud, Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France.",veljanoska.stefanija@gmail.com,"Veljanoska, Stefanija/ABH-2645-2021",,,,,,22,19,20,6,60,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Material footprints are defined as the amount of biomass, minerals, and fossil fuels extracted to produce the goods that households consume. Combining input-output data with households' consumption expenditures from the German sample survey of income and expenditure (EVS), we present the first comprehensive study on the distribution of material footprints among households, highlighting hot spots of unsustainable consumption patterns by household groups. Households in the quartile with the highest consumption expenditures have material footprints three times as large as those in the quartile with the lowest expenditures. We use a microeconomic model to study households' consumption behavior using EVS data. The results suggest that price-based instruments can reduce material footprints of luxury consumption such as leisure and private transport without imposing large burdens on less affluent households. The material footprints caused by energy consumption do not react sensitively to price changes, which suggests that non-price policies are more effective to reduce them.","[Pothen, Frank] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Environm Econ & World Trade, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Pothen, Frank] Fraunhofer Inst Microstruct Mat & Syst IMWS, Ctr Econ Mat, D-06108 Halle, Germany; [Renos, Miguel Angel Tovar] Ctr European Econ Res Environm & Resource Econ, Environm Management, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover; Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Pothen, F (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Environm Econ & World Trade, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.;Pothen, F (通讯作者)，Fraunhofer Inst Microstruct Mat & Syst IMWS, Ctr Econ Mat, D-06108 Halle, Germany.",frank.pothen@imws.fraunhofer.de; tovar@zew.de,,"Pothen, Frank/0000-0003-4078-7074",Ministry of Science and Culture of Lower Saxony through the 'Niedersachsisches Vorab' grant programme [ZN3043]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [FKZ 01UT1411A],Ministry of Science and Culture of Lower Saxony through the 'Niedersachsisches Vorab' grant programme; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"We thank Tomer Fishman, Heinz Welsch, Christiane Reif, Dirk Rubbelke, Michael Hubler, Florian Flachenecker, Tamar Lichtman, Marlene Helmer as well as participants the participants of the seminars in Hannover, Freiberg, and Heidelberg for their valuable feedback on earlier versions of this study.

CBAs are usually applied in a top-down approach, in the sense that a decision-making body first decides on which policies or projects are to be considered, and then applies a set of uniform criteria to identifying and valuing relevant cost and benefit flows. This paper investigates the possible advantages, prerequisites and limitations of applying CBA in what may be considered an alternative, bottom-up manner. Instead of starting out with a pre-defined policy option, the suggested approach begins with the underlying environmental problem, and then assesses costs and benefits of strategies and solutions as identified by local and directly affected stakeholders. For empirical case studies concerning two river catchments in Sweden and Latvia, the bottom-up CBA approach utilises local knowledge, assesses plans which are not only developed for local conditions but are also likely to be more acceptable to local society, and sheds additional light on possible distributional effects. By not only benefitting from, but also supporting participatory environmental planning, bottom-up CBA is in line with the growing trend of embedding stakeholder participation within environmental policy and decision-making.","[Carolus, Johannes Friedrich; Olsen, Soren Boye; Pedersen, Soren Marcus] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Hanley, Nick] Univ Glasgow, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of Copenhagen; University of Glasgow,"Carolus, JF (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",jfc@ifro.ku.dk,"Carolus, Johannes Friedrich/AAG-1351-2020; Olsen, Søren B/M-2949-2014; Hanley, Nick/C-1759-2012; Carolus, Johannes Friedrich/O-6001-2015","Olsen, Søren B/0000-0002-1278-3749; Hanley, Nick/0000-0002-1362-3499; Carolus, Johannes Friedrich/0000-0003-4617-0286","BONUS MIRACLE project [2014-73]; BONUS, the joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme - European Union [Art 185, 4114-00005B]; BONUS, the joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme - Innovation Fund Denmark [Art 185, 4114-00005B]; Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH; Latvian Ministry of Education and Science; Polish National Centre for Research and Development; Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS)","BONUS MIRACLE project; BONUS, the joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme - European Union; BONUS, the joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme - Innovation Fund Denmark; Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH; Latvian Ministry of Education and Science(Latvian Ministry of Education and Science); Polish National Centre for Research and Development; Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS)(Swedish Research Council Formas)","This work was partly carried out in the BONUS MIRACLE project (Call 2014-73) and has therefore received funding from BONUS, the joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme (Art 185), funded jointly by the European Union and the Innovation Fund Denmark (4114-00005B), Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH, Latvian Ministry of Education and Science, Polish National Centre for Research and Development, Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, and Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS).",,75,32,34,3,64,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Different than most typically discussed climate policies, degrowth not only aims at reducing the fossil fuel use in an economy, but rather (besides other social and political goals) at a reduction of all factor inputs, which may lead to different leakage implications. We conduct the first investigation of degrowth in a multi-country setting in order to (i) compare the leakage effects of national pure emission reduction policies to degrowth scenarios, (ii) identify underlying channels by decomposing the implied emission changes into scale, composition, and technique effects, and (iii) investigate which country characteristics determine degrowth's relative effectiveness to overcome the leakage problem. Using a structural gravity model, we find that degrowth indeed significantly reduces leakage by keeping the sectoral composition of the country more stable and reducing uncommitted countries' incentives to shift towards more energy-intensive production techniques.

Yet diverse approaches to institutional analysis are available, encompassing different ontological and epistemological assumptions, and thus yielding insights on very different aspects of institutions in adaptation. Therefore, efforts to expand knowledge in this domain can be usefully informed by an assessment of approaches to institutional analysis in the adaptation literature, which is to date lacking. We address this gap by conducting a systematic review of the adaptation literature addressing institutions. Our review characterises approaches to institutional analysis by identifying methodological choices and the philosophy of science underpinning them. We then analyze the distribution of approaches to institutional analysis across different adaptation situations, contextualizing our results within methodological debates in adaptation research regarding the appropriateness of positivist, interpretative, or post-normal approaches. We find that institutional analysis of adaptation is now engaging with 'how' and 'why' questions, beyond descriptive questions that characterise the adaptation 'barriers' literature, that diverse philosophies of science drive methodological choice, and that post-normal approaches, e.g. co-design approaches, hardly address institutions. We conclude that support for interpretative approaches, and for institutional analysis in post-normal approaches is needed. The latter is important for adaptation planning processes in developing countries under the UNFCCC.","[Bisaro, Alexander] Global Climate Forum, Neue Promenade 6, D-10178 Berlin, Germany; [Roggero, Matteo] Humboldt Univ, Resource Econ Grp, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Villannayor-Tomas, Sergio] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol ICTA, Edifici Z,Campus UAB, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",Humboldt University of Berlin; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Bisaro, A (通讯作者)，Global Climate Forum, Neue Promenade 6, D-10178 Berlin, Germany.",sandy.bisaro@globalclimatefonun.org,,"Bisaro, Alexander/0000-0003-4281-0012",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program through the project GREEN-WIN [642018]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [FKZ 03EK3523C]; European Commission [660089-COMOVE],European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program through the project GREEN-WIN; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),This research has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program through the project GREEN-WIN (Grant agreement No 642018) and from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) (Grant agreement FKZ 03EK3523C).

Noncore areas lost 3-6 percent population; service employment declined 7 percent, whereas manufacturing employment increased by 21 percent.

From a sustainability perspective, economic valuation should not only seek to determine a society's willingness to pay for environmental goods to devise an efficient allocation of scarce resources, but should also account for distributional effects to ensure justice. Yet, how economic inequality affects the value of non-market environmental goods remains understudied. Combining recently developed theoretical results with empirical evidence, this Commentary shows that more equal societies have a higher valuation for environmental public goods and that non-market benefits of environmental policy accrue over-proportionally to poorer households. On this ground, we discuss implications for environmental valuation, management and policy-making and identify a number of fruitful areas for future research. We conclude that environmental valuation should explicitly account for economic inequality, and that encompassing assessments of the distributional effects of environmental policies must consider the distribution of non-market environmental benefits.","[Drupp, Moritz A.] Univ Hamburg, Dept Econ, Von Melle Pk 5, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Drupp, Moritz A.; Quaas, Martin F.] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Meya, Jasper N.] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ, Oldenburg, Germany; [Meya, Jasper N.] Humboldt Univ, Resource Econ Grp, Berlin, Germany; [Baumgaertner, Stefan] Univ Freiburg, Dept Environm & Nat Resources, Freiburg, Germany",University of Hamburg; University of Kiel; Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; Humboldt University of Berlin; University of Freiburg,"Drupp, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Dept Econ, Von Melle Pk 5, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",Moritz.Drupp@uni-hamburg.de,"Quaas, Martin/C-4220-2012; Baumgärtner, Stefan/A-9597-2012","Quaas, Martin/0000-0003-0812-8829; Baumgärtner, Stefan/0000-0001-8314-8462; Drupp, Moritz/0000-0001-8981-0496; Meya, Jasper/0000-0003-1598-3014",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01UT1410]; Ministry for Science and Culture of Lower Saxony (Germany); Volkswagen Foundation under the program Science for Sustainable Development [VWZN3045],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Ministry for Science and Culture of Lower Saxony (Germany); Volkswagen Foundation under the program Science for Sustainable Development,We are grateful to two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments.

Using spatial aggregation to link risks ecological fallacy, since surveys are usually representative for areas larger than the spatial scale of decision-making units. This paper uses survey-to-census imputation to estimate welfare indicators for small areas to study the effect of deforestation on subsequent inequality in the rural Solomon Islands. This country depends on logging for almost half of foreign exchange and one-sixth of government revenue, and most forested land remains under customary ownership. A sharp increase in log exports, to seven times the sustainable yield, and a major shift in export destinations as other countries withdrew from the tropical log trade represents an exogenous shock that helps to identify effects of deforestation on inequality rather than the reverse relationship. A standard deviation increase in the rate of forest loss over 2000 to 2012 raises the Gini index of inequality in 2013 by one-third of a standard deviation. Mean incomes and poverty rates are also higher, implying that deforestation makes some households richer while others become poorer. These precisely estimated effects would be obscured using more spatially aggregated data.","[Gibson, John] Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand",University of Waikato,"Gibson, J (通讯作者)，Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand.",jkgibson@waikato.ac.nz,,,,,,,37,14,14,0,37,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

This variance bears directly on whether budget constrained states whether budget constrained states benefit from managed care in the form of stabilized spending, leading to improved budget predictability. Capitated payments stabilize spending at the margin, but the effects may be unobservable in aggregate due to variation in enrollment, which is directly measured in the analysis, or selection bias, which is unobserved. Although the majority of Medicaid enrollees are in managed care, the study shows that managed care use has been concentrated among the enrollees with the most stable spending, resulting in only small gains to budget predictability.

Thus, the management of complex socio-economic systems to effectively provide these essential services has become a global priority policy and academic research area. Understanding how underlying processes and functions contribute towards the provision of final ecosystem services can facilitate improved dissemination of credible, legitimate and salient information to decision-makers. This paper presents an ecosystem service value chain analysis framework that applies basic system dynamics modelling in the form of causal loop diagrams to facilitate an alternative analysis of ecosystem service value chains. A scoping application of the framework is applied to a case study for flood attenuation services in the Baviaanskloof catchment in South Africa. The framework enables the identification of forward linkages and ripple effects in individual value chains of final ecosystem services as well as the identification and assessment of challenges and opportunities within individual causal pathways. Ultimately, providing the potential to advance strategies for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of final ecosystem service provision.","[Rawlins, Jonathan M.; Fraser, Gavin C.

Embarking on a pathway that assumes unrealistically large amounts of future NETs could lead society to set near-term targets that are too lenient and thus greatly overshoot the carbon budget, without a way to undo the damage. Pathways consistent with 1.5 A degrees C that rely on smaller amounts of NETs, however, could prove viable. This paper presents a framework for assessing the risks associated with negative emissions in the context of equity and sustainable development. To do this, we identify three types of risks in counting on NETs: (1) that NETs will not ultimately prove feasible; (2) that their large-scale deployment involves unacceptable ecological and social impacts; and (3) that NETs prove less effective than hoped, due to irreversible climate impacts, or reversal of stored carbon. We highlight the technical issues that need to be resolved and-more importantly-the value judgements that need to be made, to identify the realistic potential for land-based NETs consistent with social and environmental goals. Given the critical normative issues at stake, these are decisions that should be made within an open, transparent, democratic process. As input, we offer here an indicative assessment of the realistic potential for land-based NETs, based on a precautionary assessment of the risks to their future effectiveness and a provisional assessment of the extent to which they are in conflict with sustainable development goals related to land, food and climate.","[Dooley, Kate] Univ Melbourne, Australian German Climate & Energy Coll, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Dooley, Kate] Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Kartha, Sivan] Stockholm Environm Inst, Somerville, MA USA",University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne,"Dooley, K (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Australian German Climate & Energy Coll, Parkville, Vic, Australia.;Dooley, K (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, Parkville, Vic, Australia.",kate.dooley@climate-energy-college.org,"; Dooley, Kate/J-8024-2016","Kartha, Sivan/0000-0002-6014-2161; Dooley, Kate/0000-0001-5636-6691",,,,,55,66,68,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Collaboration becomes a strategic initiative for business entities focusing on the increase of productivity and cross-functional capability within their workforce. Smart companies make use of employees networks and their ability to work together. However, in order to take the advantages of employees collaboration within a company, in particular within working teams, managers have to monitor this collaboration. They can do it through implementing the organizational climate fostering employees cooperation, applying several tools dedicated to managing employees collaboration, rewarding employees collaboration outcomes as well as being sensitive to the problem of collaboration overload. The paper is an attempt to contribute to the research in the field of teamwork management, in particular by examining the problem of employees collaboration monitoring preventing collaboration overload. The paper addresses two following tasks. The first part of the paper provides an theoretical overview of the issues regarding employees collaboration in teams, collaborative leadership as well as the ways and tools for monitoring employees collaboration in teams. The second, empirical part of the paper, explores the problem of employee collaboration monitoring. particularly. The aim of the paper is to assess the scope and importance of employees collaboration monitoring within working teams in a company.

The most important advantage of mediation is parties' participation in the organization of future relationship. On the other hand, in the modern world, people like to have somebody to manage their property. Building management has been increased these days, but expectations have been increased together with the market. Good building manager has to balance between co-owners, their individual interests, and collective interest, usually, it includes resolving disputes and being a mediator in a community. Austria is one of the most successful countries when mediation is in question. They have the full system of education of mediators, as well as very good system offered to their citizens when it comes to the real property dispute. Local authorities provide different types of resolving disputes, including mediation and arbitration in some cases. Croatian system meets advantages of mediation on daily basis, but it could be said that we are at the start of the journey. At some point, Croatian building managers will have to consider how to resolve co-owners' disputes cheaper, faster and more effective.

However, there is uncertainty over the optimal means of convincing consumers to buy a product. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effectiveness of advertising content comprising text (sensory, functional and symbolic messages) and pictures (product image) on food product evaluation. Design/methodology/approach - Two online experiments investigating strawberry advertisements were performed. Study 1 incorporated only text, whereas study 2 investigated combinations of text and pictures. Analyses of variance were conducted to determine any significant differences among the three texts (sensory, functional and symbolic) and among the combinations of text and pictures. Findings - Study 1 revealed no significant differences. All three texts were well received, which shows the relevance of all the product benefits - sensory, functional and symbolic - for food products. In contrast, study 2 identified significant differences. The data analysis indicated that advertising effectiveness increases with the complementarity of the text and picture. Notably, the combination of the product picture and symbolic text was scored the highest for effectiveness. Originality/value - The findings provide new insights into advertising design that food firms can use to enhance consumer product evaluations in terms of expected taste, perceived experience and quality, overall attitude and purchase intention. Further, the results contribute to the research stream of food product benefits by highlighting the relevance of sensory, functional and symbolic design elements.","[Haase, Janina; Wiedmann, Klaus-Peter; Bettels, Jannick; Labenz, Franziska] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Mkt & Management, Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover,"Haase, J (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Mkt & Management, Hannover, Germany.",haase@m2.uni-hannover.de,,,,,,,77,9,9,11,63,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The SEM estimating model yielded positive verification of the model hypothesis, according to which, the trust in banks is built by the normative, performative, altruistic and axiological determinants.

In this way, differences about life conditions in macro-regions, including several countries of similar economic development and traditions are important; another important aspect is the regional differentiation of the standard of living within the state, including the processes of urbanization. Complete measuring well-being and quality of life can be represented by taking in consideration the peculiarities of a person's perception of their situation; moreover, is necessary to take into account the conditions created by public environment and infrastructure. Method In the article, based on an analysis of various approaches to measuring social welfare, we suggest a methodology that allows us to appreciate the well-being and quality of life of people. For this reason, we are considering the possibility to make a comparative assessment of the well-being of macro-regions and micro-regions, with a new criterion, which reflected comfort and life satisfaction. Findings Looking at studies of various approaches to assessing of standard's life, it is revealed that financial performance does not fully and not always correctly reflect the real perception of their well-being by people. The inaccurate reflection of this information may distort many decisions and recommend measures about the government regulation; an examination of migration movements can also provide an opportunity to better assess the perception of the level of well-being and potential opportunities. Improvements Representatives of different regions base the consideration of criterion in assessing the quality of life on the study on the contribution of the level of comfort to the perception of well-being, so the formation of a system of indicators of comfort may assess level of well-being and its impact on the quality of life.","[Inner, Kapkaev; Vera, Leshinina] Chelyabinsk State Univ, Chelyabinsk, Russia",Chelyabinsk State University,"Inner, K (通讯作者)，Chelyabinsk State Univ, Chelyabinsk, Russia.",zam@csu.ru; leshinina-vera@mail.ru,"Kapkaev, Iuner/GLR-2434-2022",,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,219,226,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Law",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies; Government & Law,BP1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540727600026,0

Design/methodology/approach - The questionnaire consisted of constructs taken from the existing literature such as perceived ease of use (PEU), perceived usefulness (PU), behavioral intentions, technology anxiety (TA), perceived risk (PR), need for interaction (NI), and situational factors (SF). Before preparing the questionnaire, the focus group studies were organized to gain deeper insights regarding customers' views about self-checkouts. Based on the results of the focus groups, some items in the constructs were adapted, and the questionnaire was generated. The field study was conducted via face-to-face survey with 500 customers chosen by stratified random sampling. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling were used to validate the relationships hypothesized in the conceptual model among constructs. Findings - Out of the 16 hypotheses, 10 were found to be significant. The hypotheses related to the effects of PR, PEU, PU, intentions, while the effects of NI on PU and intentions; the effects of SF on intentions were not accepted in the study. According to the findings, PEU, PU, and TA affected intentions whereas PR, NI, and SF did not. Research limitations/implications - There were some limitations related to demographics, attitudes, SF, and actual usage of self-checkouts. Practical implications - To avoid queues, retailers should install a sufficient number of user-friendly and simple interfaced self-checkouts with well-trained employees to encourage usage and reduce the perceived risk and anxiety. Originality/value - The main contribution of this study was that the effects of different constructs were measured on Turkish customers' intentions to use self-checkouts, which could be used in formulating marketing strategies as well as considering future research directions. The paper also provided additional insights into the effects of SF, TA, NI, and PR, all of which were added to the TAM in this study.","[Kazancoglu, Ipek] Ege Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Business Adm, Izmir, Turkey; [Yarimoglu, Emel Kursunluoglu] Yasar Univ, Fac Business, Dept Business Adm, Izmir, Turkey",Ege University; Yasar University,"Kazancoglu, I (通讯作者)，Ege Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Business Adm, Izmir, Turkey.",ipeksavasci@gmail.com,"Yarimoglu, Emel/Y-8488-2018","Yarimoglu, Emel/0000-0002-0484-5006; Kazancoglu, Ipek/0000-0001-8251-5451",,,,,100,10,12,5,33,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Organizational ambidexterity is an example of a strategy based on capability of exploiting the existing competencies while simultaneously exploring new opportunities. The main goal of the article is to review contemporary definitions of the ambidexterity and its usage in current organization theory. The author's goal was to review the definitions and systematics of the concept and identify gaps in this area. The contribution of the research is to highlight implementation dilemmas present in provided literature overview. The element combining the definitions of organizational ambidexterity is the presence of two opposite activities that must be simultaneously or sequentially combined. Exploitation focuses on what the company already has and knows and is associated with such concepts as efficiency, repeatability, stability, reliability, low level of uncertainty and high level of success. Exploration focuses on what is to be discovered and is associated with low efficiency, experimentation, flexibility, tolerance for errors, high uncertainty and low level of success. The analysis shows that there is inevitable friction within the organization resulting from the combination of conflicting processes. In particular, three areas of the most persistent tensions are distinguished: around the strategic goal, around the customer orientation and around personal motivation. Even if there is a consensus that organizational ambidexterity is necessary several implementation issues remain unsettled.","[Kozakowska-Kedzierska, Marta] Univ Warsaw, Fac Management, Acad Subunit Org Sociol & Business Hist, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Kozakowska-Kedzierska, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Management, Acad Subunit Org Sociol & Business Hist, Warsaw, Poland.",martaakk@gmail.com,,,,,,,30,1,1,0,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,241,249,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540733700028,0

Design/methodology/approach Using data from a three-stage blind wine tasting experiment, the authors examine how an average consumer's WTP for a bottle of wine changes as a result of knowing prior to tasting extrinsic information such as the country of origin or grape variety of an otherwise identical product. Findings The findings of this study align with previous research that finds subjective utility experienced by tasters can be significantly influenced by the belief or information given prior to the tasting. Sub-group analysis using a stratified sample based on the frequency of wine consumption and the wine taster's prior experience with wine (grouped into expert and novice categories) suggests that it is the novice consumers that have a stronger response to the pre-tasting knowledge when evaluating wine. Experienced wine consumers, on the other hand, do not seem to respond strongly to the pre-tasting knowledge of the extrinsic attributes in their evaluation of wine. Originality/value The studies of taste preference and role of extrinsic characteristics in wine evaluation and consumption in the rapidly growing Asian market is increasingly important for the wine industry. The evidence from this study suggests the importance for producers and marketers to consider consumer heterogeneity and product differentiation when pricing and distributing their wine.","[Lee, Won Fy; Gartner, William C.; Jamiyansuren, Bolormaa] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Song, Haiyan] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Sch Hotel & Tourism Management, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Marlowe, Byron] Washington State Univ, Sch Hospitality Business Management, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Choi, Jong Woo] Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Jinju, South Korea",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Washington State University; Gyeongsang National University,"Lee, WF (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",leex5089@umn.edu; wcg@umn.edu; haiyan.song@polyu.edu.hk; byron.marlowe@wsu.edu; peacejchoi@gmail.com; jamiy001@umn.edu,"Song, Haiyan/AAD-3283-2022; Choi, Jong-Woo/AAL-8045-2021; Lee, Won/AAC-6162-2021; Lee, Won Fy/CAG-4964-2022; Marlowe, Byron/E-8785-2016","Song, Haiyan/0000-0001-6158-1222; Lee, Won/0000-0002-5094-5227; Lee, Won Fy/0000-0002-5094-5227; Marlowe, Byron/0000-0003-1255-8020",,,,,46,11,12,6,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

By analyzing the quantitative and qualitative data it could identify a number of relevant aspects regarding the impact of the measures on the Romanian farmers and agriculture. The two measures have had positive effects, but at country level, a single program addressed to young farmers is insufficient to revitalize rural areas where young people are almost absent. Accessing European funds for agriculture has played and continues to play an extremely important role in the development of agricultural holdings and rural areas. One of the measures highly appreciated by farmers was represented by the young farmers, whose financing was a useful one in the context of their cash availability being reduced relative to the investments that can be made in agriculture so that the farm either cost-effective.

Design/methodology/approach In total, 12 purposively selected post graduate students majoring in Food Science conducted descriptive sensory analysis after being trained for 18h in sensory analysis, while 75 untrained students conducted consumer acceptability test of soymilk prepared by roasting soybeans at a temperature of 110 degrees C for 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100min and at 120 degrees C for 20min. Findings Results have revealed that roasting soybeans improved sensory properties by significantly (p<0.05) decreasing the objectionable green, beany flavours and increasing sweet taste, viscosity and roasted flavour. Furthermore, results from the principal component analysis revealed that aroma and sweet taste were the most critical sensory attributes. In addition, it was found out that soymilk samples prepared by roasting soybeans at 110 degrees C for 40 and 60min and at 120 degrees C for 20min were significantly more acceptable than the control soymilk. Research limitations/implications The participants in this study were from one locality and predominantly soybean consuming community and therefore there is need to conduct the study in a different locality in order to validate the study findings. Practical implications The study can assist small scale processors that might not have access to lipoxygenase-free soybeans and other technologies for improving the quality of soymilk. Social implications The study can be used as a guide for connecting the food processers with the external world of consumption. Originality/value For the first time, the study findings have demonstrated that controlled soybean roasting can be a useful strategy for improving soymilk sensory properties and consumer acceptability. The findings in this study can be usefully used in the quality control of soy bean-based products.","[Navicha, Willard; Hua, Yufei; Kong, Xiangzhen; Zhang, Caimeng] Jiangnan Univ, Wuxi, Peoples R China; [Navicha, Willard] Domasi Coll Educ, Zomba, Malawi; [Masamba, Kingsley George] Lilongwe Univ Agr & Nat Resources, Lilongwe, Malawi",Jiangnan University; Lilongwe University of Agriculture & Natural Resources,"Hua, YF (通讯作者)，Jiangnan Univ, Wuxi, Peoples R China.",wbnavicha@yahoo.com; yfhua@jiangnan.edu.cn; kmasamba@yahoo.com; xzkong@jiangnan.edu.cn; cmzhang@jiangnan.edu.cn,,,,,,,33,15,16,8,53,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The operating lease is based on the assumption that all risks and benefits deriving from the leasehold subject remain with the lessor and that, accordingly, the subject of lease is recorded in the lessee's accounting records and recognized in its financial statements. In the operating lease, the lessee records in his accounting records only the rent relating to the current reporting period. The finance lease is based on the assumption that all the risks and benefits deriving from the ownership of the lease object are transferred from the lessor to the lessee, and accordingly, the subject of the lease is recorded in the accounting records of the lessee and is recognized in its financial statements. The lessee, in addition to the lease subject, credits a financial lease obligation in its financial statements, while the lessor recognizes the receivable on the basis of a finance lease. Many of the financial statements users have highlighted the negativeness of the operating lease accounting model, primarily because of the fact that the total liability on the basis of operating lease is not recognized in the statement of financial position, but only the part of the liability that relates to the current reporting period. Therefore, the financial statements of a business entity that use a particular asset on the basis of active operating leases do not faithfully display their financial position. In other words, the currently used accounting model of operating lease provides a covert indebtedness of a business entity holding certain assets under operating lease. In order to eliminate the deficiencies of the existing accounting model of lease, the IASB has developed a new accounting model of lease under which all rental contracts would be treated equally. A new accounting model of lease requires that the lessee recognizes the asset that is object of lease and the total lease liability in their financial statements, while the lessor retains the existing accounting model of lease which is based on the division of leases on operating and financial leases. This paper explores and analyses the potential effects of changes in the accounting model of lease on the financial position of business entities on the example of the listed companies in the Republic of Croatia.","[Percevic, Hrvoje; Micin, Marina] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, JF Kennedy 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Percevic, H (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, JF Kennedy 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",hpercevic@efzg.hr; mmicin@efzg.hr,"Mićin, Marina/H-8303-2018; Perčević, Hrvoje/JXR-7488-2024","Perčević, Hrvoje/0000-0001-9410-0755",,,,,10,0,0,0,12,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,1095,1103,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900115,0

Design/methodology/approach Primary data in the form of 147 questionnaire responses were been collected from a variety of quick service fast food restaurants in the UK. Likert seven-point rating scales were used to structure the questionnaire. Data were collected from the customers at two KFC restaurants, two McDonald's restaurants, and one Burger King Restaurant. Findings The results of the analysis indicate that tangibles, responsiveness and assurance play the most important role in driving customer satisfaction in the UK fast food industry, followed by reliability and empathy. Results of correlation and regression analysis show that physical attributes (tangible) of service quality are key to customer satisfaction. In a nutshell, the tangibles variable is the most important factor driving customer satisfaction in the context of the UK fast food market. Originality/value This research incorporates unique and original insights in relation to the British fast food restaurants market and the results constitute novel findings pertaining to the importance of physical facilities and attributes. This account of the relative importance of service quality dimensions in fast food restaurants in the UK adds value to the field. The findings of this research have contributed to a better understanding of the main factors that influence service quality and customer satisfaction and have implications from a managerial point of view in the highly competitive UK fast food and wider foodservice industry.","[Quang Nguyen; Prabhakar, Guru Prakash] Univ West England, Bristol Business Sch, Bristol, Avon, England; [Nisar, Tahir M.] Univ Southampton, Sch Business, Fac Business & Law, Southampton, Hants, England; [Knox, Dan] Univ West England, Dept Mkt Events & Tourism, Bristol Business Sch, Bristol, Avon, England",University of West England; University of Southampton; University of West England,"Prabhakar, GP (通讯作者)，Univ West England, Bristol Business Sch, Bristol, Avon, England.",nguyennhutquang999@gmail.com; t.m.nisar@soton.ac.uk; Dan.Knox@uwe.ac.uk; guru.prabhakar@uwe.ac.uk,,"Prabhakar, Guru/0000-0001-5516-9434; Knox, Dan/0000-0002-8959-5279",,,,,53,30,37,5,53,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Based on Gains' model (1994), the study focuses on the dimensions: consumer, food and context, and investigates these consumers' heterogeneities through the identification of possible market segments. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative study was conducted with 401 respondents in Brazil. The data were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis and cluster analysis. Findings The results highlighted four factors related to characteristics of food (appearance, price, packaging and quality), and four related to characteristics of the context/environment of the store (staff characteristics, external shopping environment, internal store environment and ease of access). The results also showed that older consumers liked to make food purchases, even though their options were restricted by health issues. Two segments were identified. Older with a restricted diet comprised consumers with lower education levels. They had fewer daily meals (three) and chose food with more regard to health. The second segment Younger and better educated comprised respondents with higher education levels and higher income. They had more daily meals, and health was less of a restriction on food choice than it was for the first cluster. Originality/value This study applies Gains' three dimensions' food choice model, with the variables adjusted in detail to enable a description of the purchasing behaviors of older adults in Brazil.","[Quevedo-Silva, Filipe; Lima-Filho, Dario de Oliveira; Bitencourt Fagundes, Mayra Batista] Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Sch Business & Adm, Campo Grande, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul,"Quevedo-Silva, F (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Sch Business & Adm, Campo Grande, Brazil.",filquevedo@gmail.com; dariolimafilho@gmail.com; bitencourtmayra@gmail.com,"Bitencourt, Mayra/M-2482-2017","Bitencourt, Mayra/0000-0003-3961-2330",,,,,43,6,6,1,18,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - In order to explore what attracts customers to informal retail markets, a survey conducted on the sample of Croatian consumers was carried out. Findings - The results show that consumers point out fresh, affordable, and healthy products and relationships with vendors as the main advantages, while weather conditions, unattractive food, and crowds are the disadvantages and barriers of purchasing at informal markets. Practical implications - The results presented give directions for various subjects on how to increase the popularity of informal markets.

In large companies, the procurement function is also of great importance, and when acquiring and merging large companies, the procurement department is integrated with special attention and is left to experts with extensive experience in that area.

The present paper aims at achieving a multi-criteria hierarchy of Romanian development regions from the tourist perspective. For this purpose, we have used the real rank method which is based on a number of specific tourism activity indicators and their relative importance. The analysis of regions' ranking for the two reference years 2001 and 2016 has emphasized the following situation: two regions have retained their rankings (the North-West and the South Muntenia regions), whereas the other six regions have either got on top of the rankings or lower. The status of the South-Eastern region (having been in the top ranking for a long time) is surprising as it has been surpassed by the Center region, which originally ranked fourth. The explanation for this improvement is given by better indicators such as: the total number of tourists, the number of overnight stays, the number of tourist structures, modernized roads.","[Steliac, Nela] Babes Bolyai Univ, Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Steliac, Dumitru] Taras Sevcenko Highsch, Sighetu Marmatiei, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Steliac, N (通讯作者)，Babes Bolyai Univ, Cluj Napoca, Romania.",nela.steliac@econ.ubbcluj.ro; steliacdumitru@yahoo.com,"Steliac, Nela/ABA-2530-2020","Steliac, Nela/0000-0003-4661-836X",,,,,16,0,0,0,4,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,201,211,,,,,,11,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540733700024,0

The paper combined literature on frames with literature on meat consumption. It showed that meat eating was connected to the frames that guide consumer choices through sensory-based associations (savory, satisfying) and conceptual interpretations of meals and social situations. It also showed that the science-based health and sustainability arguments in favor of a diet change do not sufficiently reach consumers or are too difficult for them to comprehend. To reach consumers, therefore, it is crucial to develop bridging frames that work as push factors away from routine meat eating, or pull factors that encourage the consumption of primarily plant-based protein and special meat types. These frames (recipes, point-of-sale information) should build on the familiar culinary principles of variety, balance, and moderation, offer a moderate amount of novelty, and enable consumers to make positive sensory associations and coherent interpretations of healthy and sustainable protein dishes. A potential limitation of a frame-based approach is that it requires much attention to detail and context. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Drawing on the theory of motivated reasoning, three interrelated experiments assess the strength and temporal persistence of framing effects in the context of an energy conservation program. In the first experiment (N = 183), the delivery mechanism of the policy is described as either a tax rebate or a subsidy. Party identification of potential beneficiaries moderates the existence and magnitude of framing effects. The second experiment (N = 603) presents alternative frames of communication, which focus on either the economic or environmental benefits associated with the policy. Effects of the communication frames on policy support in comparison to a neutral text are significant, but only when the policy is consistent with respondents' pre-existing views on economic individualism and government spending. The third experiment (N = 603) investigates the temporal stability of framing effects after cognitive deliberation and finds that no change in policy support occurs over time. A key implication is that tailoring frames to the target audience increases effectiveness in policy design and communication. Considering the persistence of framing effects, early frames may have a disproportionate impact in public discourse. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We show through numerical simulations that loyalty (inertia) to the parent brand can decrease prices and reduce profits, as well as mitigate or even reverse the benefits of joint profit maximization relative to sub-brand profit maximization. These effects are mediated by brand asymmetries and the relative magnitude of sub-brand state dependence effects. Empirically, we focus on the Yogurt category, where we consider parent brands with several sub-brands. Using household level scanner data, we estimate the parameters that characterize consumer demand while flexibly accounting for consumer heterogeneity. We also estimate unobserved product costs based on a forward looking price setting game. Through counterfactual analysis, we study the overall effect of parent brand state dependence on prices and profits, as well as the empirical impact of joint profit maximization and changes in firms' beliefs regarding consumer inertia. Our findings have implications for markets where demand is likely characterized by parent brand dynamics.","[Pavlidis, Polykarpos] Nielsen, Evanston, IL USA; [Ellickson, Paul B.] Univ Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",University of Rochester,"Ellickson, PB (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",polis.pavlidis@gmail.com; paul.ellickson@simon.rochester.edu,,,,,,,28,7,7,1,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

Results confirm other studies that climate change concerns positively influence specific mitigation actions. However we also find evidence that this relationship may be more complex in the sense that adoption of mitigation behaviour may negatively feedback on households' climate change concerns. This effect more likely occurs in 'environmentally-motivated' households. Conversely, economic incentives in driving energy and water mitigation work better in non-environmentally-motivated households. This highlights that a portfolio of policies is needed to drive mitigation behaviour. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In a second stage, a Bootstrap Truncated Regression was used to test the significance of exogenous variables on concessionaire performance: main type of cargo, track gauge, railway operation type (shared infrastructure or monopoly), in order to address an important gap in the literature. Secondary data came from the National Land Transport Agency (ANTI). The findings have significance for broad-gauge track commodities transport, while shared-infrastructure operations had no significance on efficiency, despite regulator incentives. Well directed regulations must encourage concessionaires to increase efficiency, particularly through incentives for agricultural and mineral commodities carried on the broad-gauge track characteristic of North and Center-West Brazil. Public policies designed to boost cluster efficiency are presented, addressing options such as upsizing, downsizing and resizing inputs, restructuring, best management practices and infrastructure upgrades.

However, data is seldom available at the required scale. This study overcomes this hurdle by gathering data via an expert elicitation protocol. We report experts' judgements about two topics: i) the impacts from climate change on crop yields in three communities located in the Bolivian Altiplano; and ii) the effectiveness of specific irrigation techniques in mitigating the impacts from climate change in the communities under study. Our gathered data allow us to document heterogeneity of expected impacts across communities with one community expected to experience an increase in yields under wet climate change scenarios. Experts judge irrigation as an effective mitigation tool under most of the dry climate change scenarios presented to them. We believe that our data collection strategy represents a promising decision support tool for a wide range of public policy issues. Particularly, when monetary and time constraints converge with the lack of scientific information. In addition, the information gathered with this methodology can be incorporated into participatory methodologies gathering information from local social-ecological systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Using data from Dun and Bradstreet linked to the 1860 census and slave schedules in Maryland, we find that slaveowners were more likely to start businesses prior to the uncompensated 1864 emancipation, even conditional on total wealth and human capital, and this advantage disappears after emancipation. We assess a number of potential explanations, and find suggestive evidence that this is due to the superiority of slave wealth as a source of collateral for credit rather than any advantage in production.

Government worker relocation programs are being employed with policy debate over what should be an ideal urban structure including in terms of travel behaviour. The paper explores research approaches to explore transport impacts of employment decentralization. A review shows the results of: surveys of workers moved to suburban locations; longitudinal analyses of transport and land use changes in city-regions using cross-sectional census or HTS data; comparative analysis of urban structure variables across cities using similar datasets; combinations of longitudinal and comparative research; and, scenario-based modelling approaches. A modelling framework is then developed to appraise the possible transport impacts of decentralization in Brisbane. To test the possibilities further, two decentralization scenarios modelled and compared. Decentralization mostly to middle-suburban locations better addresses jobs-housing balance and maximises proposed new public transport services, producing good transport outcomes. However, decentralization to outer suburban locations in Brisbane exacerbates the propensity for decentralization to increase travel distances, especially by car. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

There are differences examined in the approach of the management of individual airports, and the causes of lower efficiency of marketing management tools analyzed that have impact on the performance of regional airports.

However, researchers are struggling with very low response rates in business web surveys. The aim of this paper is to investigate the situation considering willingness of enterprises in Eastern Croatia to participate in a web survey. The analysis is based on the results of conducted business web survey which topic was use of statistical methods in enterprises. The web survey took all limited liability enterprises in Croatia into account, but for the purpose of this research, only enterprises from following five counties are observed: County of Osijek-Baranja, County of Pozega-Slavonia, County of Slavonski Brod-Posavina, County of Virovitica-Podravina, and County of Vukovar-Sirmium. The research results have shown that among the enterprises included in this research in Eastern Croatia, nearly one half of them have provided an e-mail address to contact, and around 2/5 of them have received the invitation to participate in the web survey by e-mail, but they did not perform any, positive or negative, action. Finally, less than 1% of enterprises in Eastern Croatia have completely filled the questionnaire. The identified main reasons of such a low response rate are that an enterprise does not have an e-mail address, and that an enterprise does not perform any action. These two reasons should be more inspected in closely and possible solutions for solving these problems should be given in the future research.","[Dumicic, Ksenija; Zmuk, Berislav] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Trg JF Kennedyja 6, HR-10000 Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Dumicic, K (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Trg JF Kennedyja 6, HR-10000 Zagreb, Croatia.",kdumicic@efzg.hr; bzmuk@efzg.hr,"Dumičić, Ksenija/H-9217-2018",,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,548,557,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500052,0

The main goal is to investigate whether there is a decoupling of consumption expenditures and the environmental impact as we move up the income ladder. By combining a 2007 Norwegian consumer expenditure survey with emission coefficients from an environmental input-output model, reflecting emissions embodied in both domestically produced and imported goods and services, we calculate the per capita carbon footprint. The results from the analysis suggest that the per capita carbon footprint is directly proportional to expenditure with an estimated elasticity close to unity, implying no decoupling. The finding is partly driven by a near zero-emission power sector, which leads to comparatively low emissions embodied in domestically-produced goods and services. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Thanks to the development of science and technology the creation of new economical activities in Europe is possible. They can help to create new possibilities for both, the solving of the ecological problems and to create jobs in many sectors of economy. The contemporary management should play a very important role in this process.

We assume that a high level of spiritual sensitivity will correlate with a higher sense of quality of life - global, and in realms (psychophysical, psychosocial, subjective and spiritual) (Stras-Romanowska, 1992). The importance of not only traditional but also spiritual abilities for effective, creative and holistic leadership or company management becomes more and more obvious for researchers and practicians psychologist, the interest in raising these competences has increased fast, and many training programs or workshops for liders and stuff nowdays are created (Wingrove and Rock 1997; Delbecq, 1994, 2000; Reave 2005; Katz 2006; Bradbery, 2011; Van Hauen, 2011).

We constructed a model of relationships between leadership competencies self-esteem and life satisfaction. Our independent variable was a chosen set of leadership competencies: 1) effectiveness in project management, 2) leadership, 3) organizational visibility and 4) integration of IT knowledge in business. This variable was measured on the basis of an adapted tool - a questionnaire of Business Competencies by Baseller and Benbasat (2004). The dependent variable was the life satisfaction of IT professionals as measured by a Polish adaptation of the Questionnaire of Life Satisfaction LiSAT-9, elaborated first by Anke, and Fugl-Meyer (2003). Our study is innovative because, to the best of our knowledge, there is no research on the relationship between leadership competency, self-assessment and life satisfaction among IT professionals in transition economies. The study was conducted online via the LABSEE website in Olsztyn. Between October 2015 and May 2016, a survey of 391 IT professionals from small regional enterprises in Lower Silesia was conducted. The sample was selected by network-interpersonal random sampling, in combination with sequential drawing and passive experiment planning methods. The contact information for potential respondents was collected from two databases: the Center for Scientific Research of the School of Management Education and the data of the Lower Silesian Statistical Office. The databases contain several thousands representative addresses from companies throughout the region. The sample representation was controlled by variables such as age of respondent, sex, income level and firm size. The average age was 33.5 years. We employed the methods of descriptive and inductive statistics, correlation analyses and structural modeling (SEM). Our most important findings have shown that IT professionals value their business skills positively, but at an average level above the midpoint. IT professionals subjectively declare a fairly high level of satisfaction in life, in obesity problems, satisfaction from family life and relationships, love and intimacy. The lowest scores were recorded in the areas of financial satisfaction, social life and fun. The highest correlation with self-esteem of leadership competencies concerned global life satisfaction, family life and relationships, love, intimacy and finances. The weaker positive correlations related to the satisfaction of professional life, leisure and ways of spending spare time. The data confirmed the impact of the self-assessment of leadership competencies on the level of life satisfaction of IT professionals. People who are sure of the high level of their own leadership competence seem to be more satisfied with their lives. Thus, professional development has a positive effect on employee life satisfaction. Our research can help to develop motivational systems, prepare training for employees and, in particular, shape the subjective aspects of human capital development. We observed the low level of correlation between professional life satisfaction and the assessment of leadership competence. We interpret this result in terms of utilitarianism and pragmatism. This means that in the research group, the important premise in action is that we work to live (Jeremy Bentham, 1961-79). Well-assessed family life is more correlated with the assessment of leadership competencies than well-judged professional life.","[Kowal, Jolanta; Keplinger, Alicja] Univ Wroclaw, Inst Psychol, Wroclaw, Poland",University of Wroclaw,"Kowal, J (通讯作者)，Univ Wroclaw, Inst Psychol, Wroclaw, Poland.",jolanta.kowal@uwr.edu.pl; alicja.keplinger@uwr.edu.pl,"Keplinger, Alicja/N-9645-2016",,,,,,0,0,0,0,4,UNIV WROCLAW,WROCLAW,"PL UNIWERSYTECKI 1, WROCLAW, 50-137, POLAND",,,978-83-64389-64-1,ICT MAN GLO COM EC G,,,2017,,,,,,,395,396,,,,,,2,Development Studies; Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BP9OZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000570154500033,0

Bacteria growth inhibition was tested in E.coli and S. aureus by disk diffusion method. Efficiency of antimicrobial activities were compared among the extracted solution. Design/methodology/approach - Soybean (Glycine max) isoflavones contain the ability to inhibit the growth of many strains of microorganisms. The solid-liquid extraction, ethanol-hexane extraction, was modified to isolate the inhibitory compounds from the three different types of soybean materials. All crude extracts at various concentrations performed under different extracted solutions (75, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25 and 3.125 percent) were tested with E. coli. and S. aureus to determine the antimicrobial activities and the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC). Disk diffusion method was chosen to study the antimicrobial activity of isoflavones. Findings - Soybean flour extract inhibited the growth of E. coli and S. aureus more effective than roasted soybean and raw soybean, respectively. The MIC of inhibitory compounds extracted from soybean flour was 6.25 percent (0.031 mg/ml), roasted soybean was 25 percent (0.125 mg/ml) and raw soybean was 50 percent (0.250 mg/ml). Crude extracts of soybean flour and roasted soybean showed better results than raw soybean. All the three of extracted soybeans inhibited the growth of E. coli better than S. aureus. Originality/value - Ethanol-hexane extraction was successfully used to isolate the antimicrobial compounds from raw soybean, soybean flour and roasted soybean. Comparison of antimicrobial activity showed that soybean flour contained the highest inhibition activity.","[Laodheerasiri, Sireerat] Assumption Univ, Dept Agroind, Bangkok, Thailand; [Pathirage, Nirasha Horana] Assumption Univ, Dept Food Technol, Bangkok, Thailand",,"Laodheerasiri, S (通讯作者)，Assumption Univ, Dept Agroind, Bangkok, Thailand.",nighty7222@yahoo.com,,,,,,,20,6,6,1,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

As far as the cost of green power production, or the power generated from renewable resources, is not approximately equalized to the cost of fossil energy resources, or until the renewable energy technologies become competitive, it is necessary to make a considerable effort in the form of financial incentives and support towards the renewable energy sector. This implies further improvement and application of renewable energy technologies, which should stimulate the development of domestic production of energy equipment and services, the creation of new jobs and development of entrepreneurship in the energy sector and other related industries, the creation of new, innovative technologies and ultimately development of economy in general. The purpose of this study is to determine the significance and the role of measures, or public authorities' incentives to stimulate production and greater use of green electricity. Thereby the paper analyzes various systems of stimulation, such as preferential purchase prices, or feedin tariffs for generated energy, models of market premiums, systems of mandatory quotas, certificates, models of direct subsidies for renewable resources installation, support for research and development, and other. The paper confirms the hypothesis about the impact of incentives on the increased use of renewable energy resources in EU Member States.

In 1956, Lintner has set postulations regarding dividend behaviour according to which dividends are a function of long-term sustainable earnings. According to Lintner (1956), managers try to manage the dividends. By managing the dividends, they try to lower their volatility (dividend smoothing) in comparison to earnings volatility that companies achieve. Companies have target dividend payout ratios. Changes in dividends follow a shift in earnings with managers being reluctant to cut dividend payments except when they are forced to do so. This represents the basis of research. The authors will conduct a research trying to prove that joint stock companies listed on the Zagreb Stock Exchange (ZSE) implement a managed dividend policy with a higher degree of dividend smoothing relative to the earnings. Previous research on dividend behaviour can be divided in two directions. One that deals with questionnaires and interviews with corporate managers and the other one based on empirical research set on Lintner's theory. Methodology applied in this paper is based on concepts of Lintner's research conducted with the use of regression analysis that will be conducted in STATA. The sample is consisted of joint stock companies listed on the ZSE that in the period 2003 to 2016 at least seven consecutive years pay out a dividend.","[Miletic, Marko; Kramaric, Tomislava Pavic; Pepur, Petar] Univ Split, Univ Dept Profess Studies, Kopilica 5, Split 21000, Croatia",University of Split,"Miletic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Univ Dept Profess Studies, Kopilica 5, Split 21000, Croatia.",mamiletic@oss.unist.hr; tpavic@oss.unist.hr; ppepur@oss.unist.hr,"Pavic Kramaric, Tomislava/ITU-6477-2023; Miletić, Marko/F-9102-2017; Pavic Kramaric, Tomislava/D-4873-2017","Pavic Kramaric, Tomislava/0000-0002-0974-4423; Pavic Kramaric, Tomislava/0000-0002-0974-4423",,,,,7,2,2,0,0,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,1093,1099,,,,,,7,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500106,0

The developed model was also used for determining the optimum numbers and allocations of farms and abattoirs that need to be established and the optimal quantity flow of livestock from farms to abattoirs and meat products from abattoirs to retailers. Design/methodology/approach - A multi-objective possibilistic programming model was formulated with a focus on minimizing the total cost of transportation, the number of transportation vehicles and the delivery time of meat products. Three sets of Pareto solutions were obtained using the three different solution methods. These methods are the LP-metrics method, the epsilon-constraint method and the weighted Tchebycheff method, respectively. The TOPSIS method was used for seeking a best Pareto solution as a trade-off decision when optimizing the three conflicting objectives. Findings - A case study was also applied for examining the effectiveness and applicability of the developed multi-objective model and the proposed solution methods. The research concludes that the.-constraint method has the superiority over the other two proposed methods as it offers a better solution outcome. Research limitations/implications - This work addresses as interesting avenues for further research on exploring the delivery planner under different types of uncertainties and transportation means. Also, environmentalism has been increasingly becoming a significant global problem in the present century. Thus, the presented model could be extended to include the environmental aspects as an objective function. Practical implications - The developed design methodology can be utilized for food supply chain designers. Also, it could be applied to realistic problems in the field of supply chain management. Practical implications - The developed design methodology can be utilized for food supply chain designers. Also, it could be applied to realistic problems in the field of supply chain management. Originality/value - The paper presents a methodology that can be used for tackling a multi-objective optimization problem of a meat supply chain network design. The proposed optimization method has the potential in solving the similar issue providing a compromising solution due to conflicting objectives in which each needs to be achieved toward an optimum outcome to survive in the competitive sector of food supply chains network.","[Mohammed, Ahmed; Wang, Qian] Univ Portsmouth, Sch Engn, Portsmouth, Hants, England",University of Portsmouth,"Mohammed, A (通讯作者)，Univ Portsmouth, Sch Engn, Portsmouth, Hants, England.",ahmed.mohammed@port.ac.uk,"Mohammed, Ahmed/U-3258-2019","Mohammed, Ahmed/0000-0002-8474-9208",,,,,39,30,30,2,27,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

They are an important information source for travelers, allowing destination makers to ` socialize' and share information and comments with users and possible visitors. Leveraging off social media to market destinations has proven to be an excellent strategy as largely recognized in several studies focused on the comprehension of importance of social media in the online tourism market (Chung and Buhalis, 2008; Inversini and Buhalis 2009; Xiang and Gretzel 2010). Following these developments, tourism managers have started to put in practice new strategies that exploit social media tools in order to promote and incentive tourism in the area. Therefore, the primary purpose of the study is to show how digital strategies and, especially, the use of social media tools, may be critical to enable tourism destination competitiveness. The main objective is to analyse a destination digital strategy aimed to define the best features to perform a winning digital strategy that allows to promote and market a tourist destination on the web. Framed in the above premises, a benchmark of some Italian e-destinations best practice examples [ENIT 2015 Blogmeter 2015 have been conducted with the aim to comprehend trends and main features of the use of technologies and applications. The chosen cases are, then, analysed more in depth, through a qualitative online exploratory survey.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors propose a conceptual model comprising five latent variables and 26 manifest variables. A questionnaire with questions relating to pasta and coffee was given to an Italian consumer sample (n = 400). The model was tested using structural equation modelling of the resulting data to examine the research hypotheses. Findings - The empirical study confirms the predictive role of the two selected drivers of brand value. Both consumer-brand engagement and brand experience influenced behavioural intentions, but these brand constructs had different roles in the two product categories examined in the study, pasta and coffee. Research limitations/implications - This study does have limitations. First, the generalisability of the findings should be considered. The study refers to only two product categories in a specific country. It would be interesting to investigate the issue of food brand engagement and brand experience in different countries, and to compare the results. Furthermore, it would be valuable to investigate the impact of brand engagement and brand experience in other product categories. Practical implications - The results have an important implication for marketing managers: they should develop long-term and strong brand relationships. Such consumer engagement and/or experiential actions can be key competitive advantages for food companies. Originality/value - The study provides empirical support for the effect of consumer-brand engagement and brand experience on consumers' behavioural intentions in the food industry.","[Risitano, Marcello; Sorrentino, Annarita] Univ Napoli Parthenope, Naples, Italy; [Romano, Rosaria] Univ Calabria, Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy; [Quintano, Michele] ESADE Business Sch, Madrid, Spain",Parthenope University Naples; University of Calabria; Universitat Ramon Llull; Escuela Superior de Administracion y Direccion de Empresas (ESADE),"Risitano, M (通讯作者)，Univ Napoli Parthenope, Naples, Italy.",marcello.risitano@uniparthenope.it,,"Romano, Rosaria/0000-0002-9708-1753; Risitano, Marcello/0000-0001-9579-5931; Sorrentino, Annarita/0000-0002-5245-1407",,,,,71,20,21,3,57,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

With the aim to identify relevant associations with different urban patterns, the present study compares the socioeconomic profile of districts with respectively continuous and discontinuous settlements along the urban gradient in Rome, Italy, during building boom (early 1970s) and economic stagnation (late 2000s). Non-parametric correlation statistics and multivariate techniques were used to investigate the spatio-temporal evolution of 24 indicators (population, settlement, labor market, economic structure) and 14 land-use, environmental and topographic indicators at the municipal scale. The socioeconomic context discriminating discontinuous from continuous settlements in the early 1970s was significantly different from what was observed in the late 2000s. In the early 1970s, economic structure and labor market indicators have played a major role, while demographic variables and heterogeneity in the natural landscape surrounding discontinuous settlements were particularly important in the late 2000s. Policies oriented to urban sustainability and sprawl containment may benefit from an in-depth understanding of the different socioeconomic contexts associated with scattered settlements in expansion and recession times.

Critics often highlight how specific water governance scenarios fail to deliver socially desirable outcomes, such as social justice or environmental sustainability. While water governance is often perceived as a technical matter, its conceptual and practical components are in fact based on multiple values that, nonetheless, often remain implicit. The present paper seeks to uncover this value base and discusses existing research on values from multiple perspectives, using material from economics, philosophy, psychology, and other social sciences. In different disciplines, values can be understood as fundamental guiding principles, governance-related values or as values assigned to water resources. Together, they shape complex relationships with water governance, which from an analytical perspective is understood as a combination of policy, politics, and polity. Introducing a new conceptual framework, this study seeks to provide a theoretical foundation for empirical research on water governance processes and conflicts. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Processed meat is not a homogeneous food category. The purpose of this paper is to explore consumer perception of the healthier reformulation of different processed meat products using two approaches: salt and fat reduction; and enrichment with healthy ingredients. Design/methodology/approach - Seven focus group interviews were carried out with 40 Irish regular meat consumers (30 female, ten male) who were solely or jointly responsible for food shopping. Two rounds of card sorting procedures were employed to reveal perceptions on reformulation of 20 different processed meat products. Thematic analysis was used for analysing transcripts. Findings - Health and flavour concerns and product popularity were the main factors influencing participants' perceptions. Some participants were unsure or had misconceptions about the healthiness of certain meat products. Participants suggested reducing salt and fat content in processed meat products they perceived as the least healthy ones (theme 1) and improving the healthiness of products which were favoured by children (theme 2) and those meat products which people consumed regularly as a source of protein (theme 3). Participants were not in favour of any reformulation of speciality-type products (theme 4).

Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire based on the Food Choice Questionnaire was applied to a 656 consumers. A multivariate factor analysis and cluster analysis was performed to the data. Findings - Seven factors were identified: ecological concern; nutritional content; availability of natural products; sensory aspects; certifications, health and confidence; and economic aspects. Resulting clusters were named as: conscious and interested in certification; conscious with no interest in certification; opportunist in transition; unconscious opportunist. There are signs of different consumers. The consumers of these products are characterised by an interaction between hedonic and ethical motivations, where the most important motivation is environmental concern and the least important are the economic aspects. Research limitations/implications - The reduced number of alternative markets in Mexico limits the amplitude of the research. Practical implications - The work herein reported is pioneer and contributes to reduce the lack of studies on the motivations and characteristics of consumers of organic foods in Mexico. Findings may set a path for new research in other cultural contexts; as well as for more specific work in Mexico as of consumers of industrialised organic products. Social implications - Characterising consumers of organic foods will enable the development of these markets. Originality/value - Social studies of eating habits have taken place in European countries; and several works have been developed in other areas of the world to determine the way in which consumers build their preferences and food choice patterns. In Mexico, specifically in organic foods, studies have focussed in agrarian economics, but the analysis of motivations for choice has not been addressed. Therefore, it is important to research this issue given the relevance for consumers.","[Yenitza Escobar-Lopez, Sttefanie; Espinoza-Ortega, Angelica; Vizcarra-Bordi, Ivonne; Thome-Ortiz, Humberto] Univ Autonoma Estado Mexico, Inst Agr & Rural Sci, Toluca, Mexico",,"Espinoza-Ortega, A (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Estado Mexico, Inst Agr & Rural Sci, Toluca, Mexico.",angelica.cihuatl@gmail.com,"Escobar-López, Sttefanie/AAV-6546-2020; Thome Ortiz, Humberto/B-5869-2015; Espinoza-Ortega, Angelica/D-7453-2016","Escobar-López, Sttefanie/0000-0001-7912-4812; Thome Ortiz, Humberto/0000-0002-6714-3490; Espinoza-Ortega, Angelica/0000-0002-5968-0587",Mexican National Council for Science and Technology (Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia - CONACYT) [220531CB-2013],Mexican National Council for Science and Technology (Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia - CONACYT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)),This work was undertaken thanks to funding by the Mexican National Council for Science and Technology (Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia - CONACYT) through Grant Number 220531CB-2013.,,71,41,43,6,45,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Developed framework combines business model conceptualization with institutional theorization to understand how institutions influence on business conduct. Business model concept is used to describe organizational activities and managerial cognition in a structured manner and institutional theory is used to identify features that may facilitate or hamper particular activities in a particular operational environment. Countries' institutional environments related to the advancement of circular economy differ from each other and therefore comparison between the situations provides an interesting context to study the dynamics between companies' business models and the institutional features. We apply our analytical framework to a case study of two recycling companies operating in Finland and Chile to explore links between the firm-level activities and developments outside the firm. The results highlight the interdependent nature of the relationship between the business models and context-specific institutions, the logics between positive and negative value materials, and the differences between countries in the promotion of circular economy.","[Levanen, Jarkko; Lyytinen, Tatu] Aalto Univ, Sch Business, POB 21230, FIN-00076 Helsinki, Finland; [Gatica, Sebastian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Management, Av Libertador Bdo OHiggins 440, Santiago 8331010, Chile",Aalto University; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Levänen, J (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Sch Business, POB 21230, FIN-00076 Helsinki, Finland.",jarkko.levanen@aalto.fi; tatu.lyytinen@aalto.fi; sgatica@uc.cl,"Levänen, Jarkko/AAM-6501-2020","Levänen, Jarkko/0000-0002-4420-7359",Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation (TEKES) through the New Global project,Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation (TEKES) through the New Global project,We wish to thank Macarena Farfas for her assistance with the research and Minna Halme and Samuli Patala for their valuable comments on earlier drafts of this article.

In addition to a general analysis of properties required by a ray production function for StoNED to be applicable, we conduct a Monte Carlo simulation in order to evaluate the quality of the frontier and efficiencies estimated by StoNED.

These values represent the satisfaction derived from the protection or restoration of species, habitats and wilderness areas, even if people never use them in any tangible way. The shunting of nonuse values to the background of ecosystem service analysis appears, in part, to be an attempt to avoid the perceived elitism of environmental values. To examine whether such values are the purview of the elite, we explore three types of evidence of who holds nonuse values. We find that when people are asked to 1) commit money via stated preference instruments, 2) respond to tweets, or 3) express opinions via surveys they demonstrate a significant willingness to protect and restore natural resources, regardless of their own use of those resources. Such values are represented in all socio-demographic groups that encompass race, ethnicity, immigration status, income, political affiliation, geographic location, age or gender, although the magnitude can vary among groups. The implications are that omitting nonuse values in ecosystem service analysis will tend to underestimate values, particularly for remote sites with limited use, and fail to represent important tradeoffs.","[Wainger, Lisa A.] Univ Maryland, Chesapeake Biol Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, Solomons, MD 20688 USA; [Helcoski, Ryan; Farge, Kevin W.; Espinola, Brandy A.] Univ Maryland, Sustainable Dev & Conservat Biol Grad Program, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Green, Gary T.] Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Helcoski, Ryan] Smithsonian Conservat Biol Inst, Conservat Ecol Ctr, Front Royal, VA 22630 USA; [Farge, Kevin W.] Nature Conservancy, Legal Data Resource Ctr, Arlington, VA 22203 USA; [Espinola, Brandy A.] Univ Maryland, Environm Finance Ctr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Zoological Park & Conservation Biology Institute; Nature Conservancy; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Wainger, LA (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Chesapeake Biol Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, Solomons, MD 20688 USA.",wainger@umces.edu; helcoskir@si.edu; kevin.farge@tnc.org; bespinol@umd.edu; gtgreen@uga.edu,"Wainger, Lisa A/H-7640-2012","Farge, Kevin/0000-0003-4068-0138; Helcoski, Ryan/0000-0003-3579-0121",Conservation Biology program of the University of Maryland,Conservation Biology program of the University of Maryland,"We are grateful to John Loomis and Matthew Weber for helpful reviews of the manuscript and we thank (without implicating) James Boyd, Kevin Boyle, Gretchen Cappio, Lara Fowler, Robert Johnston, and J.B.

In return, they benefit from scheduled deliveries but with unknown content. The shorter channels for seafood products are valued by consumers because they often include more sustainable fishing practices and avoid food miles. However, consumers may join these systems for many other reasons linked to lower prices or higher quality of fish, the support to the local economy, and social or political reasons. Who is, if ever existing, the typical CSF buyer, and what makes CSFs appealing to fish consumers? With an original survey of 556 French seafood consumers belonging to the Yeu Island CSF, this research aims at disentangling the various motives for joining and purchasing fish exclusively from CSFs. Among a large range of motivations, the analysis reveals the existence of three factors: credence attributes (environment and local support), relational aspects (meet people), and economic incentives. We show through a simultaneous equation model that exclusive CSF consumers are positively influenced by the relational dimension but negatively by credence attributes.","[Salladarre, Frederic] IUT Univ Rennes, CREM CNRS, LEMNA, Campus Beaulieu,Ave Gen Leclerc,CS 44202, F-35042 Rennes, France; [Guillotreau, Patrice] Univ Nantes, LEMNA, Chemin Censive Tertre,BP 52231, F-44322 Nantes 3, France; [Debucquet, Gervaise] AUDENCIA Business Sch, 8 Route Joneliere, F-44300 Nantes 3, France; [Lazuech, Gilles] Univ Nantes, CENS, UFR Sociol, 340 Rue Fresche Blanc, F-44300 Nantes, France",Nantes Universite; Nantes Universite,"Salladarré, F (通讯作者)，IUT Univ Rennes, CREM CNRS, LEMNA, Campus Beaulieu,Ave Gen Leclerc,CS 44202, F-35042 Rennes, France.",frederic.salladarre@univ-rennes1.fr,"Guillotreau, Patrice/AAL-7482-2020","Guillotreau, Patrice/0000-0002-3083-1230",Coselmar project - Regional Council of Pays de la Loire,Coselmar project - Regional Council of Pays de la Loire,"This work is supported by the Coselmar project funded by the Regional Council of Pays de la Loire.

The First 5-Year Plan meant the complete victory of one of these positions. Unfortunately, all discussions were banned subsequently, the leading figures of these two factions were expelled from the Party and many of them executed. Yet, this problem was of the utmost importance for underdeveloped countries, as Development Economics was to discover 25 years later. This new branch of Economics would have benefitted greatly from the lessons of the Soviet experience regarding industrialisation, as well as from the theoretical discussions surrounding it.","[Azqueta, Diego] Univ Alcala de Henares, Dept Econ, Alcala De Henares, Spain",Universidad de Alcala,"Azqueta, D (通讯作者)，Univ Alcala de Henares, Dept Econ, Alcala De Henares, Spain.",diego.azqueta@uah.es,"azqueta, diego/AAB-5824-2021","azqueta, diego/0000-0003-1052-4521",,,,,42,0,0,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

In other words, a link has network value. One prominent mechanism behind this network value is a hubbing effect: adding one single link to a hub creates many connecting routes. This paper studies a different and less explored mechanism of network value. It relies on the observation that passengers generally prefer a higher flight frequency (mainly because it provides more flexible options for travel times). Specifically, when a carrier adds a link, the created connecting routes will increase the traffic densities on adjacent links. As the carrier raises flight frequencies to meet the higher densities, there creates a positive effect on demand. By structurally estimating a model that incorporates this mechanism, I am able to quantify the density effect. It is found to be about 3.8 times as large as the hubbing effect. Furthermore, the model shows that the competitive impact of an airline entry (i.e., adding a new link) goes greatly beyond the local city-pair market where the entry happens.","[Wei, Yanhao] Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA",University of Southern California,"Wei, YH (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA.",yanhaowe@usc.edu,,,,,,,41,4,5,2,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

Based on data of 580 firms in the Top-1000 Enterprise Energy Saving Program during 2006 and 2009, we differentiate between technological change embodied in new production capital and disembodied technological change. We find that both types of changes clearly led to energy efficiency. Firms of domestic ownership and higher profit were more prone to making investment with embodied technological changes. Energy efficiency rates associated with embodied technological change were higher among younger firms and those with more intensive use of energy. Energy saving associated with disembodied technological change was higher in firms of state or foreign ownership, larger scale, orientation toward domestic market, and more intensive use of energy. The findings call for the need to carefully consider the effect of different policy instruments in energy saving, and to track long-term energy statistics at the micro-level.","[Zhu, Junming] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Niu, Limin; Shi, Lei] Tsinghua Univ, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Sch Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ruth, Matthias] Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB, Canada",Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University; University of Alberta,"Zhu, JM (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.;Shi, L (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Sch Environm, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",junming@tsinghua.edu.cn; slone@tsinghua.edu.cn,,"Zhu, Junming/0000-0002-6160-1323","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71704092]; US National Science Foundation through its Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grants [1303113]; Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program [20121088096]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [1303113] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); US National Science Foundation through its Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grants(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",The authors would like to thank Lin Hou for geocoding and mapping the top-1000 enterprises and Xiao Li and Da Zhang for their helpful comments on earlier versions of the research.

Improving the livelihoods of environmental services (ES) suppliers is not only seen as a side benefit but is often considered a prerequisite for the viability of PES. Yet, the ability to draw 'overview lessons' over the impacts of PES on livelihoods from literature review studies remains limited. To overcome these shortcomings, we undertake a meta-analysis of causal statistical studies on the effects of PES on the livelihoods of ES suppliers in the developing world. The set-up of our meta-analysis allows us to draw more conservative but more reliable and generalisable overview lessons. Our findings suggest that PES programmes are likely to have positive but modest livelihood impacts on ES suppliers. Further, several institutional characteristics of PES are found to be correlated with more favourable livelihood impacts, such as high payments, high degree of voluntary participation, low transaction costs and better access to alternative income sources. Lastly, our results highlight the importance of controlling for unobservable confounders when undertaking original evaluation studies on the impacts of PES. These factors should be incorporated in the design, implementation and evaluation of PES.","[Liu, Zhaoyang] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Kontoleon, Andreas] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, 19 Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England",Peking University; University of Cambridge,"Kontoleon, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, 19 Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England.",ak219@cam.ac.uk,"LIU, Z/AAD-2255-2020","LIU, Z/0000-0003-0124-0113",,,,,104,38,40,4,92,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

International environmental agreements (IEAs) have been around for decades yet achievements and outcomes have not met expectations. While international relations scholars have primarily focused on the effectiveness of agreements between states, public policy scholars have been interested in outcomes at a variety of scales including international, national, sub-national, and local across various environmental policy domains and at the instrument and program levels. This article presents findings from a case study of environmental regime effectiveness that uses a modified version of the Oslo-Postdam solution to assess the effectiveness of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, a long-standing, bilateral international environmental agreement between Canada and the USA. The findings indicate that there is a need to more broadly define international environmental agreements in complex transboundary systems to include both formal and informal regime features and multilevel governance efforts and to focus on specific policy goals and ecological outcomes associated with IEAs. This case also illustrates the potential to modify the Oslo-Postdam approach by combining expert assessment and data collection methods with traditional policy analysis and program evaluation methods in assessments of environmental regime effectiveness.","[Johns, Carolyn; Thorn, Adam] Ryerson Univ, Dept Polit & Publ Adm, Toronto, ON, Canada; [VanNijnatten, Debora] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Waterloo, ON, Canada",Toronto Metropolitan University; Wilfrid Laurier University,"Johns, C (通讯作者)，Ryerson Univ, Dept Polit & Publ Adm, Toronto, ON, Canada.",cjohns@ryerson.ca; adam.thorn@ryerson.ca; dvannijnatten@wlu.ca,,,,,,,53,4,4,1,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

The approach by Fare et al. (J Econom 126: 469-492, 2005) to computing point estimates of the marginal abatement costs (MACs) of reducing pollution by estimating the directional output distance function has been gaining popularity in recent years. The contribution of this study is to compute MACs as slopes of the iterated parametric production possibilities frontier (PPF) estimated on the basis of the set of efficient projections of observable output combinations obtained from the parameters of directional output distance function. Policy makers are thus provided with the general shape of the production possibilities set for a polluting technology rather than with a set of point estimates of the MACs. We apply our methodology to a balanced panel of seven Korean manufacturing sectors spanning the period between 1999 and 2009, obtaining theoretically consistent concave PPFs based on a large set of directional output distance vectors. Finally, we estimate the parameters of a directional output distance function corresponding to the iterated PPF.","[Repkine, Alexandre; Min, Dongki] Konkuk Univ, Dept Econ, 120 Neungdong Ro, Seoul 143701, South Korea",Konkuk University,"Min, D (通讯作者)，Konkuk Univ, Dept Econ, 120 Neungdong Ro, Seoul 143701, South Korea.",dkm2@konkuk.ac.kr,,"Repkine, Alexandre/0000-0002-7831-3846",,,,,15,3,3,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

The processes of selecting sustainability indices with which to correlate localisation indices, and incorporating ecological footprint results to convert Bhutan's Gross National Happiness Index to a sustainability index that includes environmental impact measures, are described. Correlation analysis was then used to explore whether the most sustainable places are also the most localised, at regional and national levels. A strongly positive regional result for Bhutan indicates that as localisation increases in the districts there so does sustainability. At the national level global localisation and sustainability correlations were not significant, however due to the inability of national level measurement to capture important sustainability dimensions this result is unreliable. As localisation and sustainability are ideally measured in the same way everywhere according to global principles with cultural adjustments, the Bhutanese result adds weight to suggestions that localisation be explored to inform sustainability planning, as an important alternative to current unsuccessful sustainability strategies based on economic globalisation. Interviews carried out to explore the causality of the positive correlation results in Bhutan, confirmed that localisation is an important aspect of sustainability planning there.","[Olivier, Michelle M.] Southern Cross Univ, Lismore, NSW, Australia; [Howard, Johnathon L.; Wilson, Ben P.; Robinson, Wayne A.] Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Environm Sci, POB 789, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia",Southern Cross University; Charles Sturt University,"Olivier, MM (通讯作者)，55 Bullgarra Rd, Wilsons Creek, NSW 2482, Australia.",molivier5024@lycos.com; jhoward@csu.edu.au; bwilson@csu.edu.au,,"ROBINSON, WAYNE/0000-0002-8793-7466; Howard, Jonathon/0000-0002-9566-0700",,,,,112,2,3,0,18,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Based on data from six villages in Zimbabwe, we present a novel method of calculating HANPP at community and household scales, and explore to what extent household wealth is related to NPP appropriation. HANPP at the village scale was higher than expected from previous studies, ranging from 48% to 113% of potential NPP. Loss of NPP through land use change accounted for the greater proportion of HANPP in four of the six villages, but NPP embodied in livestock feed, firewood and construction materials also contributed significantly to total appropriation. Increasing household wealth was associated with increasing appropriation of NPP in harvested resources, but not with loss of potential NPP through land use change. Our results indicate that land use intensity is currently underestimated in smallholder farming areas of southern Africa.

The impacts of mosquitoes on humans are intensifying in many regions as several factors such as climate change and increased transport create favorable conditions for the entry of invasive mosquitoes. At the same time budget constraints limit public prevention measures and demand clear justification of additional costs for controlling invasive mosquitoes. Consequently, the benefits arising from preventive policies should be clearly articulated and included in the evaluation process. The present study evaluates the potential benefits of alternative prevention measures in the metropolitan area of Athens, Greece, representative of the geographically and climatically vulnerable Mediterranean cities. The study differentiates the health and nuisance costs associated with invasive mosquito species from those associated with native mosquito species. In contrast to other findings in the literature, the benefits from controlling health impacts were found to be higher than those of avoiding nuisance. This is mainly related to the high health risk induced by new invasive species. Another important finding is that the expected benefits of mosquito control programs clearly outweigh the respective costs.","[Bithas, Kostas; Kolimenakis, Antonis; Richardson, Clive] Panteion Univ, Dept Econ & Reg Dev, Inst Urban Environm & Human Resources, 14 Aristotelous St, GR-17671 Athens, Greece; [Latinopoulos, Dionysis] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Spatial Planning & Dev, GR-54124 Thessaloniki, Greece",Panteion University; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Latinopoulos, D (通讯作者)，Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Spatial Planning & Dev, GR-54124 Thessaloniki, Greece.",kbithas@eesd.gr; dlatinop@plandevel.auth.gr; crichard@panteion.gr,,"Latinopoulos, DIONYSIS/0000-0003-2184-9268; BITHAS, KOSTAS/0000-0001-6544-7557",European Union (EU Environmental Funding Programme LIFE + Environment Policy and Governance); Greek national funds through the LIFE CONOPS project 'Development & demonstration of management plans against the climate change enhanced invasive mosquitoes in S.

In particular, the obtained results may be consistently included in the long-standing debate on the municipal size, proving that the bigger the municipality, the greater its level of public expenditure efficiency.

Rural electrification led to substantial reductions in infant mortality but had little effect on women's fertility. The increase in electricity access between 1930 and 1960 can account for 15 to 19 percent of the decline in rural infant mortality during this period.","[Lewis, Joshua] Univ Montreal, Dept Econ, 3150,Rue Jean Brillant 6032, Montreal, PQ H38 1N8, Canada",Universite de Montreal,"Lewis, J (通讯作者)，Univ Montreal, Dept Econ, 3150,Rue Jean Brillant 6032, Montreal, PQ H38 1N8, Canada.",joshua.lewis@umontreal.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"I am very grateful to my PhD advisors Dwayne Benjamin, Robert McMillan, Aloysius Siow, and Mark Stabile for their support and guidance.

This paper gauges evidence on the support of citizens for climate change mitigation programmes at the local level, analysing voting behaviour. A quasi-experimental set-up is offered by the EU Covenant of Mayors (CoM) initiative, which is the mainstream European movement for local authorities voluntarily committing to meet and exceed the European Union 20% GHG emission reduction target by 2020. The electoral impact of the participation of Italian municipalities to the CoM is estimated, using an instrumental variable (IV) approach. Mayors committing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in their municipality appear not to lose electoral support at subsequent elections; this is contrary to what would be implied by a simple (biased) ordinary least squares regression. Moreover, IV point estimates are positive, albeit insignificant at standard levels; this could be due to the possibility of some support of citizens for emission reduction commitments. Finally, strong heterogeneity in socio-economic and demographic characteristics is found, with support of the CoM being more pronounced in wealthier and younger cities. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This undermines a claim on the return on the employer's investments in recruiting and training a worker, making them vulnerable to possible infringement from a bystander. Accordingly, employers' investment in recruiting and training might become deficient. Therefore, protecting an employer's investment, balanced against the mobility of the labour market for better employer/employee matches, has emerged as an issue during the transition towards a market-based economy. This article explores how the Japanese state court in its early period addressed this issue in the tight labour market of the silk-reeling industry, which was the leading industry at that time. Initially, the court directly protected the interests of employers whose employees were poached, at the expense of workers' mobility. Then, it seemed to govern transactions between employers indirectly as a shadow off-the-equilibrium path. Thus, an employer whose employee was poached and an employer who carried out the poaching would privately negotiate to settle the dispute, using a possible suit as a threat against the poacher. An examination of the suits that were actually filed supports this hypothesis. This indirect governance facilitated labour market mobility with some protection of the original employer's claim.","[Nakabayashi, Masaki] Univ Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Nakabayashi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.",,"Nakabayashi, Masaki/AAM-4041-2020","Nakabayashi, Masaki/0000-0003-1096-1350","JSPS [JP22243022, JP25245001]","JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)","This research has been supported by JSPS KAKENHI grant no.

They provide information on appliances' energy consumption and aim at increasing consumers' attention to this characteristic. A well-known example is the EU Energy Label, which is required by law to be displayed on most energy-using durables in the EU as well as in Switzerland. In cooperation with a large online retailer in Switzerland we assess the impact of the EU Energy Label and of a newly designed monetary lifetime-oriented energy label in the field. We analyze private purchases of household appliances, especially freezers, vacuum cleaners and tumble dryers. We find that the display of any of the two energy labels increases the sales proportion of energy-efficient appliances compared to the absence of any energy label. At the same time, we observe a volume-effect for freezers: The average size of purchased freezers is larger when any of the two energy labels is displayed compared to the absence of any energy label. The influence of the two different energy labels is similar except for vacuum cleaners, for which monetary information might have an adverse effect.","[Stadelmann, Marcel; Schubert, Renate] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Chair Econ, IED, Clausiusstr 37, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Stadelmann, M (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Chair Econ, IED, Clausiusstr 37, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",marcel.stadelmann@econ.gess.ethz.ch,"Stadelmann, Marcel/AAV-5717-2021",,Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) [SI/500790-01],Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE),"This research was partially funded by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) as part of its research program Energy-Economy-Society (EES) [grant number SI/500790-01].

The authors claim that focusing attention on the micro-politics of PES design and implementation fails to expose an underlying neoliberal governmentality, and therefore only reinforces neoliberal capitalism as both the problem and solution of ecological crises. In response, we argue that a focus on the actions of local actors is key to understanding how and why such governmentality fails or succeeds in performing as theorized. Grand generalizations fixated on a particular hegemonic and neoliberal PES ontology overlook how actors intertwine theory and practice in ways which cannot be explained by a dominant structural theory:Such generalizations risk obscuring the complexity and situational history, practice and scale of the processes involved. Rather than relegating variegated and hybrid forms of what actually emerges from PES interventions as neoliberal conceit, we argue that an actor-oriented, 'weak theory' approach permits PES praxis to inform knowledge generation. This would open up a more inclusive and politically engaging space for thinking about and realizing political change.","[Van Hecken, Gert; Windey, Catherine; Huybrechs, Frederic; Bastiaensen, Johan] Univ Antwerp, Inst Dev Policy & Management IOB, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Van Hecken, Gert; Bastiaensen, Johan] Cent Amer Univ, Res & Dev Inst Nitlapan, Managua 14003, Nicaragua; [Kolinjivadi, Vijay] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Inst Temperate Forest Sci ISFORT, 58 Rue Principale, Ripon, PQ J0V 1V0, Canada; [McElwee, Pamela] Rutgers State Univ, Sch Environm & Biol Sci, 55 Dudley Rd, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Shapiro-Garza, Elizabeth] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Box 90328, Durham, NC 27708 USA",University of Antwerp; University of Quebec; University Quebec Outaouais; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Duke University,"Van Hecken, G (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Inst Dev Policy & Management IOB, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",gert.vanhecken@uantwerpen.be,"Windey, Catherine/K-3862-2015; McElwee, Pamela/AAP-1695-2020; Huybrechs, Frederic/I-8059-2015","McElwee, Pamela/0000-0003-3525-9285; Huybrechs, Frederic/0000-0002-6430-3444; Bastiaensen, Johan/0000-0002-1369-8570","Genome Canada; Genome Quebec under the ATRAPP project [10512]; Ministere de l'Agriculture, des Pecheries et de l'Alimentation du Quebec under the Innov'action Programme [IA116637]; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [435-2017-1078]; National Science Foundation from the Geography & Regional Sciences directorate [11028793]","Genome Canada(Genome Canada); Genome Quebec under the ATRAPP project; Ministere de l'Agriculture, des Pecheries et de l'Alimentation du Quebec under the Innov'action Programme; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); National Science Foundation from the Geography & Regional Sciences directorate","We thank the four anonymous reviewers for their detailed and constructive comments on an earlier draft of this manuscript.

Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is a research-based set of principles intended to guide the design of learning environments that are accessible and effective for all. First articulated by CAST (Center for Applied Science and Technology) in the 1990s and now the leading framework in an international reform movement, UDL informs all of our work in educational research and development, capacity building, and professional learning. UDL is based on cognitive neuroscience and is intended to guide the development of flexible learning environments that can accommodate individual learning differences [2]. UDL asks educators to create curricula that provide: multiple means of representation, multiple means of expression and multiple means of engagement, while motivating all students to learn and succeed [3]. Greensboro College is unique in higher education in that it has committed to fully embracing UDL. Greensboro College uses UDL as a framework for successful academic and student development at a small, private, Methodist-affiliated, liberal arts college. Greensboro College has initiated its transformation to an institution that values and facilitates UDL across its curriculum. As The Mission Statement of Greensboro College points out, we as a college believe Universal Design for Learning, at its core is a comprehensive educational framework that removes barriers to student learning and academic success.

However, a review of relevant literature indicates that there is a lack of research reported and written in English on the importance of food in Chinese local regional development. The purpose of this paper is to assess the potential of local food to act as a destination attraction, and contribute to the development of local regions in China, by examining the food-related motivation, involvement, satisfaction, and behavioural intentions of Chinese domestic tourists. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected using interviewer-completed questionnaire from a sample of 1,353 domestic tourists at eight destinations geographically spread or in one region in China. Findings - The results reveal three types of food-related behaviour (which are described and evaluated below). While gender is seen to be significant, other demographical factors, such as ages and educational levels, do not appear to influence the level of interests and involvement in local food for Chinese domestic tourists. Originality/value - This study is a contribution towards assessing the potential for using local food as a tool to develop local regions in China, and to obtain a better understanding of the market segmentation of Chinese local food tourists. It assists in identifying potential food tourists towards whom marketing should be addressed.","[Chen, Qian] Yangzhou Univ, Sch Tourism & Culinary Sci Food Sci & Engn, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Huang, Rong] Plymouth Univ, Sch Tourism & Hospitality, Plymouth, Devon, England",Yangzhou University; University of Plymouth,"Chen, Q (通讯作者)，Yangzhou Univ, Sch Tourism & Culinary Sci Food Sci & Engn, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",qianchen0303@outlook.com,"CHEN, QIAN/AAR-9779-2020; Huang, Rong/O-4328-2019","CHEN, QIAN/0000-0003-0050-835X; Huang, Rong/0000-0002-6061-9329",,,,,55,19,19,5,28,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach This paper provides an insight into seafood export through ten case studies of seafood exporters from Norway and a freight forwarder working with most of these companies. Findings The international seafood business is characterised by coordination, interactions, and exchange such that economic and social interactions among network members transcend national boundaries into international/global markets. The findings reveal how studied seafood exports are in line with the learning-based Uppsala internationalisation model, embedded in international buyer-seller relationship structures and networks, which is also a particularity of this food-producing industry. To secure long-term business in distant markets, small- and medium-sized (SME) seafood exporters have shifted the focus from transactional approaches to relationships and networking as a means of improving export performance. This paper suggests how logistics and marketing have become closely and strategically interconnected, and so marketing strategies depend on logistics strategies and the two cannot be separated in a typical global seafood supply network. Practical implications Purposeful collaborative interaction between exporter and importer helps in risk mitigation. Increased interactions in distant markets by SMEs can also be achieved using social media networking.

This paper will show the way of online marketing analytics presentation that was conducted in one Slavonian informative internet portal. In addition, it will show the issues arising from creating an analytics of running campaign that would be more transparent, clearer and simpler to measure. The research methodology consists of: (1) analysing the collected transactional data from an ad server, and (2) analysing the amount of data transferred regarding the displayed ads. This analysis is designed to study the proportion of useful content for a user with respect to marketing related content and the content that reduces the quality of overall user experience. Conclusion of data analysis shows that the current technology on which the advertising industry is based, faces increasing problems. Tosolve these problems, it is necessary to significantly change the way the user perceives advertising and to take advantage of other technologies and manage user attention.

In this case we revisit endogenous growth theory which points out FDI as an important determinant of the longterm growth rate of income, through examining FDI as a main technology transfer channel and a human capital development driver with positive spillover effects on the rest of the economy. We investigate whether FDI has served as a way of taking resources out of the host country through repatriated profits/dividends and we point out the role of transfer prices within multinational companies. Furthermore this paper argues on several economic distortions that might jeopardise the positive effect of FDI and lead foreign investors to make use of profit opportunities and not to follow higher efficiency.

The available literature proofs that many review papers on BPAMMs, in particular those issued before 2010 lacks an extensive set of systematic literature review or analysis criteria. For example, the authors didn't pay attention whether the analysed models focused on a single process, a specific group of processes or all organisational processes. Often, there was also no distinction between organisational and process maturity, which appeared in the analysed models as separate concepts, or different types of maturity (e.g. process, project, supply chain, etc.).

Black Slavonian pig was the most important and numerous breed in Slavonia until the first half of 20th century. It is included in the National program of preservation of autochthonous and protected breeds of domestic animals in Croatia, since its population drastically decreased and reached the critical survival level after WWII. In order to provide relevant information from the agricultural, historical, economic, cultural and ethnological point of view, a research team was assembled with researchers from different scientific fields (biotechnical sciences and social sciences and humanities). The unusual combination bridges the gap between agriculture, history, art, and informatology. An application was submitted and consequently funds for the Virtual Museum of Black Slavonian Pig were allocated through calls for project proposals (interdisciplinary project proposal, in this case) at the University of J. J. Strossmayer in Osijek (IZIP 2016). The Virtual Museum of Black Slavonian Pig provides a way for scholars, students, tourists and others to learn more about history of the breed itself and its perseverance. The website includes an interactive virtual tour of Fajferica's history, a database of primary sources, i.e. links to relevant resources. Moreover, the website is a place where tradition and art meet agriculture (from acorn grazing to naive art, sculpture and literature). Digitalization enables the promotion of this segment of cultural heritage and makes it more accessible to the interested users, which has already been the case in similar projects in numerous museums, libraries, galleries and archives all over the world.","[Margeta, Vladimir; Kuharic, Darija] Poljoprivredni Fak Osijeku, V Preloga 1, HR-31000 Osijek, Croatia; [Jakopec, Tomislav; Ranogajec, Mirna Gilman] Filozofski Fak Osijeku, L Jagera 9, HR-31000 Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Margeta, V (通讯作者)，Poljoprivredni Fak Osijeku, V Preloga 1, HR-31000 Osijek, Croatia.",vladimir.margeta@pfos.hr; tjakopec@ffos.hr; dkuharic@pfos.hr; mgilman@ffos.hr,"Ranogajec, Mirna Gilman/AAC-6073-2020; KUHARIC, DARIJA/AAC-2203-2022",,,,,,6,0,0,2,4,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,48,55,,,,,,8,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900003,0

Design/methodology/approach Histamine content was tested on 80 fresh fish samples of 11 species collected from various local stores in Fez region, from February to March 2016. The analyses were performed using a competitive ELISA assay to measure histamine in fish samples. Findings ELISA results showed that 80 percent of 80 fish samples analyzed was found to contain much lower levels of histamine (<1mg/kg) and can be considered to be safe for human consumption. However, 20 percent of the samples (16/80) had histamine level higher than the tolerance limit of 200mg/kg established by Moroccan and International regulations, which the maximum level reached up to 7,331mg/kg in horse mackerel. Concerning the effect of heating and enzymatic treatments on fish-histamine levels, results have shown a low reduction in histamine contents in the majority of fish samples under these treatments. Originality/value In conclusion, good quality of the fish product, demonstrated by histamine levels, was found in the most of fish samples analyzed, while 20 percent of the samples are non-compliant and exceed the tolerance limit established by the national and international regulatory limit.","[Mejrhit, Najlae; Azdad, Yousra; Azdad, Ouarda] Fac Sci & Tech, Fes, Morocco; [Aarab, Lotfi] Fac Sci & Tech, Dept Biol, Fes, Morocco",Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University of Fez; Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University of Fez,"Aarab, L (通讯作者)，Fac Sci & Tech, Dept Biol, Fes, Morocco.",aarablmbsf@gmail.com,,,,,,,31,4,4,2,22,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The economic impoverishment of the region is presented through the striking fact that the gross domestic product is 8.5% of the European average! The analysis of the macroeconomic profile of the region confirms the thesis that contemporary tendencies are increasingly being explored within the development model of center- periphery. The degree of peripheralization of the region is a logical derivation of the unified matrix for entering the global market within International and European policies. In the modern geopolitical perspective the divergent tendencies in the region in relation to European processes have again revitalized the interest of European policies that resulted in a new strategy for economic integration. The strategy supports the processes of progressive EU integration through the inclusion of this region in the convergence machine. The dilemmas and controversies regarding the innovative elements of the strategy for economic integration are seen from the point of view of new theories of economic growth and the possibilities for them to be realized in the direction of policies that will support the integrative and cooperative processes in the region Thus, the strategy becomes the ground of re-examination of the mix of the national and EU policies in Western Balkan countries as highly fragmented economic spaces that will require multiple efforts and resources in the future. As a result, the shift of policy focus from stabilization to development must have a clear spatial dimension and should be characterized by the formulation and implementation of active policies toward Western Balkans. Finally it can support political cooperation and contribution to political stabilization in the region.","[Nikolovska, Natalija] Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ Skopje, Fac Econ, Skopje, North Macedonia; [Boshkovska, Nadica Jovanovska] Univ Amer Coll Skopje, Sch Business Econ & Management, Skopje, North Macedonia",Saints Cyril & Methodius University of Skopje; Institute of Economics Skopje,"Nikolovska, N (通讯作者)，Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ Skopje, Fac Econ, Skopje, North Macedonia.",natalijan@eccf.ukim.edu.mk; nadica.j.boshkovska@uacs.edu.mk,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,337,346,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Law",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies; Government & Law,BP1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540727600039,0

In particular, the monetary valuation and commodification of ecosystem services in form of payments for ecosystem services schemes and the development of new markets for ecosystem services has appreciated large popularity. However, who is behind this strong momentum towards ecosystem services and especially why is less well known. In this paper I aim to shed light on this by looking specifically at advocates of the concept of ecosystem services, using forestry in the United Kingdom (UK) as an example. I explore the motivations for accommodating or actively pursuing ecosystem services thinking in this important sector through interviews with forestry and conservation experts. Four prominent groups with a specific interest in the ecosystem services concept in the context of UK forestry are governmental organisations, non-governmental conservation organisations, private forest owners, and the timber and forest industry. These stakeholder groups are interested in this new perspective, chiefly, but not exclusively, because (1) it is required under international obligations; (2) it is in line with dominant market political philosophy; (3) it holds the promise to include the environment more fully into prevailing economic decision -making processes; (4) it can help to draw more attention to biodiversity conservation; (5) it holds the promise of new sources of income from both public and private sources; and (6) it can be used as a convenient argument to promote further tree planting. However, these groups have different, but frequently overlapping reasons for pursuing this new perspective. The results provide a baseline and important insights into who was embracing ecosystem services thinking and why during the early years of the adoption of this approach in the UK.

Coastal states and ports are directly responsible for monitoring and controlling the ships' compliance with national and international laws. Compliance monitoring and control is carried out by ship inspections and fuel sampling, especially for ships that do not use air emission abatement technologies. Although progress has been made towards reducing sulfur emissions in the Baltic Sea, a work has still to be done to achieve effective and consistent monitoring and enforcement. This issue will become even more important when further nitrogen oxide emission limit values in the region are introduced. Emissions of nitrogen oxides strongly affect air pollution, and together with carbon dioxide emissions they facilitate acidification of seawater. Nitrogen emissions from ships are the result of nitrogen deposition, which contributes to eutrophication - one of the major problems in the Baltic Sea. The aim of the study is to research the ship-generated air emissions and their impact on environment, to analyse the situation in the Baltic Sea region, and to develop proposals for reducing ship-generated emissions. The potential for reduction of ship-generated emissions in the Baltic Sea is based on compliance with international and regional requirements as well as integration of strategic solutions.

Controlling for demographic characteristics and perceptions of ecological threat, more frequent engagement in pro-environmental behaviors predicted higher life satisfaction. All but 2 of 39 PEBs were positively related to life satisfaction, suggesting that the relationship generalizes across behaviors. However, life satisfaction was more strongly predicted by behaviors that involved more social interaction, behaviors that were more easily observed, and by behaviors that involved direct costs in terms of money, time, and effort. Evidence for the role of direct costs was stronger than that for socialness or observability. In addition, perceptions of ecological threat negatively predicted life satisfaction, but this effect was partially suppressed by higher engagement in pro-environmental behavior. Results suggest that lifestyle changes that might be part of a sustainable society need not represent threats to well-being, and might even provide a means of enhancing well-being.

Individual contributions of amateur artists are essential for sustaining the tradition because of several reasons. Firstly, amateur arts in its essence are oriented at self-initiative. Therefore, certain financial responsibility should be taken at the lowest, individual level. Secondly, as amateur art in Latvia is strongly supported by the public authorities, stronger emphasis on individual contributions is a way to share risks and strengthen diversity of funding sources, which is especially significant in the context of negative demographic tendencies and uncertainty of economic developments. Quantitative survey of amateur artists in 11 municipalities and 4 focus group discussions were conducted. The survey results confirm the opinions expressed in the focus group discussions that the amateur art community in Latvia is not ready to increase their financial contributions for participatory activities. In their opinion, public funding should cover costs for rehearsal venue, salary of the leader of the amateur art group, transport costs for the tours in Latvia and costs for concert costumes. The key argument is the public responsibility for safeguarding the tradition of the Song and Dance Celebration. The participants are willing to finance by themselves informal events and participation fee that covers small everyday expenses. The authors can assume that participants feel comfortable with and can justify such expenditure that increases their social capital and strengthens their belonging to the community (amateur choir or dance group).","[Tjarve, Baiba; Zemite, Ieva; Freiberga, Kristine] Latvian Acad Culture, Riga, Latvia",Latvian Academy of Culture,"Tjarve, B; Zemite, I; Freiberga, K (通讯作者)，Latvian Acad Culture, Riga, Latvia.",baibatj@gmail.com; ieva.zemite@lka.edu.lv; k.freiberga@gmail.com,"Tjarve, Baiba/HGB-3286-2022","Tjarve, Baiba/0000-0003-0770-3377; Zemite, Ieva/0000-0003-4431-8603",,,,,17,0,0,0,1,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9984-48-294-1,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2018,49.0,,,,,,419,426,,10.22616/ESRD.2018.161,0.0,,,8,Development Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO1ZQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503493500049,0

Design/methodology/approach Data used in this study came from a questionnaire survey conducted in Shandong Province, China. The 642 qualified samples were analysed through structural equation model based on the expanded theory of planned behaviour to study public food safety reporting behaviour and its influencing factors. Findings Results indicated that participation attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control (PBC) and moral norm had significantly positive effects on public reporting intention, which had a direct effect on behaviour. Among subjective norm, descriptive norm had a more significant influence on the intention to report than injunctive norm. PBC indirectly affected reporting behaviour through participation intention, and directly affected participation behaviour. Socio-demographic variables had significant influence on participation attitude, injunctive norm and PBC, whereas these variables had no influence on descriptive norm and moral norm. Originality/value This research is of academic value and of value to policy makers. To promote public participation in food safety reporting, the government should consider influencing factors of food safety reporting.","[Yin, Shijiu; Li, Ying; Wu, Linhai] Qufu Normal Univ, Sch Econ, Rizhao, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yusheng] Ocean Univ China, Sch Management, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Wu, Linhai] Jiangnan Univ, Sch Business, Wuxi, Peoples R China; [Yan, Jiang] China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Management, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Qufu Normal University; Ocean University of China; Jiangnan University; China University of Mining & Technology,"Wu, LH (通讯作者)，Qufu Normal Univ, Sch Econ, Rizhao, Peoples R China.;Wu, LH (通讯作者)，Jiangnan Univ, Sch Business, Wuxi, Peoples R China.",ysjtougao@163.com; 15163339519@139.com; 939145611@qq.com; wlh6799@126.com; xin1anvip@163.com,,,,,,,87,10,10,2,39,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The strategy of education institutions, especially higher education, may be more important than ever because of the above mentioned impacts, but also due to the growing foreign competition in the field of education. A large number of papers have been written on the importance of introducing elearning into higher education systems, however insufficient attention has been devoted to the strategies and plans for implementation and realization of electronic learning systems. The neglect of the plan to apply modern methods of education can cause long-term major challenges in their realization. Similarly, many direct and indirect variables affect the operations of modern companies, which an entity must successfully balance to achieve optimum management. Every company is inevitably obliged to define its own strategy when trying to predict trends in business, rises and downfalls, but also pursue the desired mission or vision of a company. It is quite clear that the plan, strategy, and then realization are extremely important in both of these environments. Therefore, the principal objective is to identify which elements of business strategy development are adequate in the preparation of strategic documents for e-learning in higher education. In this paper, authors have endeavoured to link the theoretical concept of strategic planning and decision making to practical implementation of e-learning system. The research at the level of Croatian higher education institutions will include a review of the existence of such strategies, their analysis elaboration and their potential developmenttoo. Likewise, depending on the options, a comparison of similar strategies in the EU and the world will be made. As a desired final result, a survey of the current state of the e-learning strategy as well as guidelines for the better preparation of such materials will bepresented.","[Zdrilic, Ivica; Rajko, Mladen] Univ Zadar, Dept Econ, Splitska 1, HR-23000 Zadar, Croatia; [Puvaca, Milan] Ofir Ltd, Ramska 20, HR-31000 Osijek, Croatia",University of Zadar,"Zdrilic, I (通讯作者)，Univ Zadar, Dept Econ, Splitska 1, HR-23000 Zadar, Croatia.",izdrilic@unizd.hr; milan@ofir.hr; mrajko@unizd.hr,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,1,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,432,440,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900045,0

The aim of this paper is to find out the difference between the impacts that adoption of Industry 4.0 has on the labor markets in developing countries and advanced countries, and for this purpose Iran and Japan were selected for comparison. For a country like Iran that struggles with heavy unemployment, adopting Industry 4.0 is not wise, because the essence of industrial revolutions and specially the 4th one, is to reduce costs of production by eliminating or reducing the human interaction, in other words, automation; which would significantly affect the labor force, especially those occupied in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors. Iran has lots of problems with basic infrastructure, education, research and technologies that are needed for Industry 4.0. Adopting Industry 4.0 would have devastating effects on the Iranian labor market and specifically on the unemployment rate. It will be years before Iran could implement Industry 4.0. Japan has a much lower unemployment rate comparing to Iran, and unlike Iran has the needed infrastructure and science and technology for implementing Industry 4.0. Therefore, adopting Industry 4.0 by Japan would have some effects on the Japanese labor market but those effects wouldn't be as challenging as they are for Iran.","[Ziaei Nafchi, Majid; Mohelska, Hana] Univ Hradec Kralove, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove,"Ziaei Nafchi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.",majid.ziaeinafchi@uhk.cz; hana.mohelska@uhk.cz,"Mohelska, Hana/F-9896-2019","Mohelska, Hana/0000-0003-0441-0712",,,,,5,1,1,0,7,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-6059,2464-6067,978-80-7435-701-5,HRADEC ECON DAYS,,,2018,8.0,,2,,,,550,561,,,,,,12,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL3AA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000449443600053,0

Drawing insight from the literature on multi-criteria analysis, the objective of this paper is to extend the MBP framework to new measures of cross-constrained cost and environmental allocative efficiency using data envelopment analysis (DEA). Cross-constrained measures seek for efficiency improvement in one of the two relevant criteria, cost and environment, consistent with given levels of both production and the outcome of the other criteria. The incorporation of these measures into the MBP framework provides an extra decomposition of allocative efficiency in efficiency gains that involve an economic - environmental trade-off and those that do not. The proposed approach is illustrated with an application geared to assessing the efficiency of a sample of greenhouse horticultural production units in Almeria, Spain. The results for this case show that it is possible to increase environmental allocative efficiency by up to 34% on average without incurring additional costs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Is saving the environment a 'luxury' reserved for wealthy countries, with less affluent countries being too poor to be green? We seek to address this important and timely question using fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) to analyse the causal relationship between economic growth and stability, and the expansion of renewable electricity shares among the European Union's (EU) 28 member states during the recent economic recession (2008-2013). Our paper, analyses the recent economic and financial crisis and its effects on sustainability transitions, and establishes a new indicator for progress in renewable electricity transitions in the context of Europe's 2020 targets. It therefore extends the 'sustainability as a luxury' debate to include renewable energy. The analysis reveals an ambivalent picture of the role of wealth in renewable energy transitions (RET) in Europe. Indeed, driven by the EU's common renewable energy targets, the findings suggest that RETs are promoted both because, and in spite of the means. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Modelling provides a means to assist in understanding the dynamics of the economic system of this fishery and identify potential links to the ecological system in future, which can inform management. This study develops and describes a novel agent-based model of the South African offshore hake trawl industry, HakeSim, which captures drivers such as fuel price, catch per unit effort, export markets, exchange rate, industrial organization and uncertainty in catches as a proxy for environmental uncertainty. It allows identification of key drivers and their relative importance to the industry to be assessed. It has desirable and realistic sensitivities and it can successfully reproduce profitability scenarios for the industry under different fuel prices. Fuel prices above ZAR18.783 per litre, which could result from increased prices or reduced subsidies, are demonstrated to push the modelled fishing companies to making losses, which could potentially reduce employment. This model represents a strategic tool for management and significant advancements over existing bio-economic and agent-based models of fisheries. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The 1031 sites inscribed on World Heritage List are a source of prestige for the countries where they occur. However, conflicts between protection of Outstanding Universal Value and resource extraction can arise within large-scale natural landscapes. The tall-eucalypt forests of the Australian island of Tasmania have been at the heart of such a conflict for over 30 years. The aim of this paper is to analyse how the processes of the Convention respond to contrasting approaches by a State Party. The paper traces the history of the dispute over Tasmania's tall-eucalypt forests through the Convention's processes of evaluation, inscription and boundary modification. In particular, it considers the processes and outcomes pertaining to two diametrically opposed proposals for minor modification to the boundaries of the Tasmanian Wilderness made by consecutive Australian governments in 2013 and 2014: the first was for the purpose of protecting the forests, and the second for opening them to logging in order to fulfil a domestic election promise. In each case, criteria weighted in favour of long-term heritage protection played a critical role. The application of these criteria, combined with strong domestic concern and the ability of UNESCO's World Heritage Committee to prioritize heritage protection, has resulted in the protection of these forests and the enhancement of the ecological resilience of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area. The paper concludes that the power of an international treaty can transcend the vicissitudes of domestic politics and provide enduring protection of Outstanding Universal Value, particularly when backed by strong domestic scrutiny and community support.","[Law, Geoff; Kriwoken, Lorne] Univ Tasmania, Sch Land & Food, Discipline Geog & Spatial Sci, Private Bag 78, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",University of Tasmania,"Kriwoken, L (通讯作者)，Univ Tasmania, Sch Land & Food, Discipline Geog & Spatial Sci, Private Bag 78, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",L.K.Kriwoken@utas.edu.au,,,,,,,61,3,3,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

A program which contributes to an increase of environmental quality can be perceived differently from a program designed to bring back the environmental quality to its original level, after it was damaged by human intervention. How does it impact participation rates and contribution levels? This paper addresses this issue in the context of agri-environmental schemes for biodiversity conservation. It compares farmers' willingness to participate in two contracts, one being framed as part of a biodiversity offset program, the other one as part of a biodiversity conservation program. We demonstrate with a discrete choice experiment that biodiversity-offsets programs need to offer a higher payment to enroll farmers compared to biodiversity conservation programs. This result is essentially driven by farmers who declare to have organic practices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A longitudinal comparative study of three cases from the Ferghana Valley, each with a distinct degree of path dependency, is presented to understand how riparian parties responded when they faced pressure to reallocate. Therewith we distinguish (a) drivers of pressure pushing toward a change from (b) sources of path dependency resisting a change. Establishing similarity in drivers of pressure across all three cases, we systematically study the varying impact of established institutional arrangements leading to strong, moderate, and weak resistance to a change. The analysis reveals three key sources of path dependency explaining the strength of resistance: (i) vested interests, (ii) infrastructure control, and (iii) network effects that form the so-called baggage in riparian relationships. We discuss the interplay among these sources and their corresponding impact on the short- and long-term outcomes. Overall, the study brings forward the importance of dealing with baggage in riparian relationships to be able to effectively respond to new challenges and implement reforms in a sustainable way.

With the prospect of a future slowing down of the demand for organic products, specific demand-side policy measures are called for. Building on interdisciplinary research on the determinants of organic food purchases, we argue that cultural capital is a relevant, so far overlooked driver of organic food purchase. We apply a Heckman two-step selection strategy approach to microdata from the latest sample annual survey by the Italian National Institute of Statistics. We find that participation in cultural activities has a positive impact on the inclination to purchase organic products, to an extent that depends on the social orientation of each cultural activity.

We used the theory of planned behavior to determine factors that influenced a farmer's decision to adopt organic production methods and identify key social psychological barriers. We focused on strawberry production as a model, and surveyed 83 conventional strawberry farmers (response rate 90.2%), and found that attitudes and perceived behavioral control (PBC) predicted intent to adopt organic production (r(2) = 37.2%). For farmers interested in conversion, beliefs about the improved social/financial status from conversion were positively related to their attitude toward conversion, and the lack of control over informational and physical resources was negatively related to PBC. For farmers disinterested in conversion, the influence of their social norms was stronger than for interested farmers, and PBC most strongly influenced their intention to convert. These results suggest that different strategies should be pursued for encouraging conversion to organic strawberry production. For interested farmers, their interest may be enhanced by addressing their attitudinal beliefs, and allaying concerns over access to technical assistance. For disinterested producers, it may be important to raise the salience of their positive attitudinal beliefs, involve people whose opinions they value, and enhance their perceived control over information and risks.

Isard's (1968) model has been the only exception. He entered interactions occurring within the ecosystem into IO. Nevertheless, given the linearity of IO, he could only analyze environmental issues in a linear fashion. We propose an alternative that reverses Isard's model types: the economic system is modelled within the ecosystem (not the contrary), as one of the ecosystem's components. To demonstrate its feasibility, we develop an ecological-economic model by integrating conventional economic IO within system dynamics (SD). After describing the methodological issues, we test the IO/SD model on ecological and economic data by applying it to the destruction and restoration of the Seine Estuary, France, where Common soles live. Our model brings insight into the consideration of feedback loops in the modelling of interactions between the ecosystem and the economic system. We believe such a tool may be of help to decision makers in mixing economic and environmental issues like, in our application case, fish habitat and harbour development. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we investigate the construction of the 2 A degrees C climate target, one of the best known targets in global environmental governance. Our paper examines this target through a historical reconstruction that identifies four different phases: framing, consolidation and diffusion, adoption, and disembeddedness. Our analysis shows that, initially, the target was science-driven and predominantly EU-based; it then became progressively accepted at the international level, despite a lack of broader debate among governments on the policy implications and required measures for implementation. Once the 2 A degrees C target was endorsed at the level of the United Nations, the nature of the target changed from being policy-prescriptive to being largely symbolic. In this phase, the target became a disembedded object in global governance not linked to a shared agenda nor to coordinated and mutually binding mitigation efforts. The 2015 Paris Agreement marks the last stage in this development and may have further solidified the target as a disembedded object. In the final part of the paper, we suggest ways to overcome the current situation and to develop the 2 A degrees C target into a fully fledged global environmental governance target.","[Morseletto, Piero; Pattberg, Philipp] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, Fac Earth & Life Sci, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Biermann, Frank] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Fac Geosci, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Utrecht University,"Morseletto, P (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, Fac Earth & Life Sci, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",piero.morseletto@vu.nl,"Morseletto, Piero/N-2142-2019; Biermann, Frank/D-4175-2013; Pattberg, Philipp/J-4141-2012","Morseletto, Piero/0000-0002-5921-4471; Biermann, Frank/0000-0002-0292-0703; Pattberg, Philipp/0000-0003-1136-7791",,,,,128,47,49,3,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Aside of the formal negotiations some Parties to the UNFCCC have started an informal dialogue and discuss how to merge the fragmented accounting rules for mitigation relevant land use activities, in particular those concerning forest-sector emissions. Stressing that 'history matters', we use a historical institutionalist perspective to assess the institutional pathways of the different accounting rules for developed and developing countries, their mutual relationship, and in how far they are supportive or counterproductive for this endeavour. Our empirical analysis shows that Parties tend to use any modification phase in the negotiation process to water down already achieved agreements, and that negotiating modalities after targets have been agreed is not conducive either. In the efforts of specifying the Paris agreement, merging existing rules into a common accounting framework is likely to further compromise the exisiting weak rules and modalities, and potentially what negotiators consider as 'environmental integrity'. With this, a formal negotiation of common rules for the accounting of the land use sector may yield an outcome below what has been achieved since the negotiations on a post-2020 agreement started in 2005. We conclude that politically acceptable approaches for the land use sector that also contribute to the overall objective of raising ambition should avoid reopening already agreed decisions on rules and modalities.","[Pistorius, Till] Unique Forestry & Land Use GmbH, Schnewlinstr 10, D-79098 Freiburg, Germany; [Reinecke, Sabine] Univ Freiburg, Chair Forest & Environm Policy, Tennenbacher Str 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Carrapatoso, Astrid] Univ Freiburg, Seminar Wissensch Polit, Rempartstr 15, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg; University of Freiburg,"Pistorius, T (通讯作者)，Unique Forestry & Land Use GmbH, Schnewlinstr 10, D-79098 Freiburg, Germany.",till.pistorius@unique-landuse.de; sabine.reinecke@ifp.uni-freiburg.de; astrid.carrapatoso@politik.uni-freiburg.de,,,"German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (BfN); German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMUB)","German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (BfN); German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMUB)","This study is an outcome of the research project Integration of REDD+ into a post-2020 climate agreement and linkages to the CBD''.

It is based on a social table for the Voivodeship of Cracow in 1578. Our evidence indicates that income in Poland was distributed more equally than in contemporary Holland. However, the extraction rate was much higher than in the North Sea area. Furthermore, income inequality in the countryside of the Voivodeship was higher than inequality in Cracow. This can be explained by the demesne economy based on serfdom that was prevalent in agriculture. Using trends in real wages and urbanisation, we also project Polish GDP forwards and backwards in time. Our results indicate that Polish per capita GDP was below that of Western Europe as early as the fifteenth century. This gap persisted despite moderate growth of the Polish economy in the sixteenth century. In the seventeenth century, Poland impoverished and became even poorer than Asian economies for which similar estimates are available. Poland recovered slightly in the eighteenth century but continued to lag behind Western Europe.","[Malinowski, Mikoaj; van Zanden, Jan Luiten] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Malinowski, M (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands.",mikolaj.malinowski@gmail.com,,,,,,,72,30,30,1,11,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,SEP,2017,11.0,3,,,,,375,404,,10.1007/s11698-016-0154-5,0.0,,,30,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,FF3AD,,"Green Accepted, Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000408767000005,0

Market conditions often offer opportunities or generate threats that can be handled by restructuring scenarios through consolidation, to create synergy, or through split, to create reverse synergy. A generalized restructuring refers to a move in a business market where a homogeneous set of firms, a set of pre-restructuring decision making units (DMUs), proceed with a restructuring to produce a new set of post-restructuring entities in the same market to realize efficiency targets. This paper aims to develop a novel inverse Data Envelopment Analysis based methodology, called GInvDEA (Generalized Inverse DEA), for modeling the generalized restructuring. Moreover, the paper suggests a linear programming model that allows determining the lowest performance levels, measured by efficiency that can be achieved through a given generalized restructuring. An application in banking operations illustrates the theory developed in the paper.","[Amin, Gholam R.] Univ New Brunswick, Fac Business, St John, NB E2L 4L5, Canada; [Emrouznejad, Ali] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Operat & Informat Management Grp, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Gattoufi, Said] Univ Tunis, Inst Super Gest, Lab SOIE, Tunis, Tunisia",University of New Brunswick; Aston University; Universite de Tunis,"Emrouznejad, A (通讯作者)，Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Operat & Informat Management Grp, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",a.emrouznejad@aston.ac.uk,"Amin, Gholam R./I-6447-2018; Emrouznejad, Ali/C-6707-2018","Emrouznejad, Ali/0000-0001-8094-4244; Gattoufi, Said/0000-0001-7914-6165",,,,,39,48,49,1,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

We argue that ENPOs favor GIS engagement only by family firms, which, due to their resource constraints, risk aversion and local embeddedness, are more sensitive to ENPOs normative pressure. We also suggest that the role of ENPOs is especially important for family firms' GIS in those sectors with less stringent regulations, where ENPOs may act as a substitute for the coercive pressure of regulation, and promote firms' self-regulatory behaviors. We test and find support for our arguments on a sample of about 2000 Italian manufacturing firms over the period 2001-2003.

This article explores the growth of the Athens Stock Exchange through new listings and initial public offerings (IPOs) in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. We examine changes in exchange governance and listing requirements. On a theme not addressed before, we find that simple listings were far more numerous than actual IPOs. IPOs in Greece remained unregulated throughout the period. Their under-pricing became pronounced in the later parts of the period, especially the 1920s. The study presents data on ` quasiIPOs' (that is, capital increases shortly after listing) and shows that they offer a more accurate assessment of the demand for the financing of listing firms in an emerging market. Robust evidence is presented to show that as the Exchange developed it also underwent a change in character, becoming more oriented to the domestic market and catering to smaller firms in domestic manufacturing in the post-First World War era that marked the end of early globalization.","[Thomadakis, Stavros; Nounis, Christos; Riginos, Michalis] Univ Athens, Athens, Greece; [Gounopoulos, Dimitrios] Newcastle Univ, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; Newcastle University - UK,"Thomadakis, S (通讯作者)，Univ Athens, Athens, Greece.",,,"Gounopoulos, Dimitrios/0000-0002-1443-1659",,,,,41,3,3,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Using a generalized ordered logit approach and drawing on a unique data set originating from two surveys conducted in 2012 and 2014, each among more than 6000 German households, we analyze the determinants of individual risk perception associated with three kinds of natural hazards: heat waves, storms, and floods. Our focus is on the role of objective risk measures and experience with these natural hazards, whose frequency is likely to be affected by climate change. In line with the received literature, the results suggest that personal experience with adverse events and personal damage therefrom are strong drivers of individual risk perception.

We posited a post-birth pulse, matrix model in which four age classes of tegus are recognized: hatchlings, 1 year-old, 2 year-olds, and 3 + year-olds. This matrix model was parameterized using a 3 point process to elicit estimates of tegu demographic rates in southern Florida from 10 herpetology experts. We fit statistical distributions for each parameter and for each expert, then drew and pooled a large number of replicate samples from these to form a distribution for each demographic parameter. Using these distributions, as well as the observed correlations among elicited values, we generated a large sample of matrix population models to infer how the tegu population would respond to control efforts. We used the concepts of Pareto efficiency and stochastic dominance to conclude that targeting older age classes at relatively high rates appears to have the best chance of minimizing tegu abundance and control costs. We conclude that expert opinion combined with an explicit consideration of uncertainty can be valuable in conducting an initial assessment of what control strategy, effort, and monetary resources are needed to reduce and eventually eliminate the invader. Scientists, in turn, can use the value of information to focus research in a way that not only increases the efficacy of control, but minimizes costs as well.

These public policies are implemented after the downturn of the households' welfare following from the increased pollution. Two kinds of policies are considered and rely either on an optimality criterion or on an intergenerational equity criterion.

We find that the firm's short-run profit may be higher when PT is allowed. Nonetheless, this is neither necessary nor sufficient for improving drug quality in the long run.

Given their relevance for achieving climate policy objectives, it is perhaps surprising that the climate regime established by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) does not address fossil fuel subsidies. This article discusses the possible role of the UNFCCC in tackling fossil fuel subsidies. It suggests that the UNFCCC could enhance the transparency around fossil fuel subsidies and put in place incentives for countries to undertake subsidy reform. However, the possibilites under the UNFCCC will be limited by political barriers to subsidy reform at the national level and will need to be carried out in coordination with other international institutions active in the field.","[van Asselt, Harro; Kulovesi, Kati] Univ Eastern Finland, Sch Law, Joensuu Campus,POB 111, Joensuu 80101, Finland; [van Asselt, Harro] Stockholm Environm Inst, 29 Grove St, Oxford OX2 7JT, England",University of Eastern Finland,"van Asselt, H (通讯作者)，Univ Eastern Finland, Sch Law, Joensuu Campus,POB 111, Joensuu 80101, Finland.;van Asselt, H (通讯作者)，Stockholm Environm Inst, 29 Grove St, Oxford OX2 7JT, England.",harro.vanasselt@sei-international.org,,"van Asselt, Harro/0000-0003-3028-0659",,,,,45,25,25,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Previous research has shown that effective water conservation policies exert strongly negative impacts on agricultural production and farmers' income, which make them politically unfeasible under Chinese conditions. To highlight ways out of this dilemma, the present study tests three alternative water policies complemented by supportive agricultural policies to reduce the trade-offs between water conservation and rural development policy goals. Using the case of the extremely arid Aksu-Tarim Region in northwest China, a regional supply model is developed which serves as the analysis framework. Applied as stand-alone water policies, irrigated area tax, water quota and water pricing differ clearly in effectiveness and efficiency. Combined with agricultural policies (subsidies) into multiple policy instruments, the price-based and quota-based instruments mitigate the negative impacts on rural development goals. Targeting a water conservation rate of 20%, the tested multiple policies perform alike on the level of the entire study region; cotton production decreases by 15%, cereals production remains stable, and regional income decreases by 13%. However, at the sub-regional level, the impacts on water conservation, production and income differ significantly between the alternative policy instruments and sub-regions, constituting a crucial challenge for practical water policy implementation.

The city of San Antonio is located within the basin and is the hub of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). San Antonio, together with other major metropolitan centers in Texas, has experienced rapid population and economic growth over the last thirty years, which accelerated after the implementation of NAFTA in 1994. To assess the environmental implications of this growth in the SARB, we first conducted a land-change analysis using Landsat images from 1984, 1995, and 2010. Then, we analyzed spatiotemporal changes in ecosystem services across the SARB and within three watersheds in Bexar County where the city of San Antonio is located. To estimate changes in ecosystem service values (ESV) during this period, we combined the results of the land-change analysis with a benefit transfer approach using two sets of widely cited ecosystem-service valuation coefficients published in 1997 and 2014 but we modified the urban coefficient from the 2014 publication for low-density and high-density urban areas. When 1997 coefficients were applied, the ESV in the SARB decreased, on average, by $1.2 million/year during 1984-1995 and by $1.8 million/year during 1995-2010. The ESV in Bexar County decreased, on average, by $0.5 million/year and $0.7 million/year during the first and second periods, respectively. When the 2014 coefficients and modified urban value coefficients were applied, the ESV in the SARB decreased, on average, by a 27% more during the first period than when the 1997 coefficients were applied, while, ESV increased during the second period by an average of $2.2 million/year. This temporally opposite trend in ESV change did not occur in Bexar County, however. Using the 2014 coefficients, ESV in Bexar County decreased 5 times more during the first period and decreased 2.5 times more during the second period than when 1997 coefficients were applied. The differences in ESV trends resulting from the two sets of coefficients can be explained primarily by the different coefficients assigned to urban spaces ($0/ha/year in the 1997 study and $7005/ha/year in the 2014 study). Our results suggest that the value placed on urban areas in the 2014 publication, taken from a single case study and intended primarily for large urban parks, substantially overestimates the ESV of urban space. In our study areas, applying this value, even only to urban green space, led to the improbable conclusion that urbanization had a positive overall effect on the delivery of ecosystem services. While open spaces in urban areas do provide valuable ecosystem services, it is highly unlikely that their value exceeds those provided by less modified ecosystems. The ability to confidently use value coefficients when applying benefit transfer methods to estimate ESVs demands rigorous assessments of their broad applicability. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

I use the Alliance of Small Island States and the Coalition for Rainforest Nations as case studies to inductively create a framework on coalition formation. This framework is tested against two coalitions, both advocating for mountain issues in the UN climate negotiations. These two coalitions differ in the type of coalition sought, the strategies deployed thus far, and the type of support they have received, including the role of non-state actors. The framework helps identify significant gaps in the efforts of the two coalitions, including capturing the most salient link between climate change and mountains, translating technical input into negotiating positions, and identifying the most appropriate form of the coalition and forum to pursue these interests. In doing so, this paper provides insights into the limits of linking issues to the climate change agenda (climate bandwagoning''), issue proliferation and its implications for coalition management for actors like the Group of 77 and China, and the nature of multi-scalar interactions in regime complexes.","[Bhandary, Rishikesh Ram] Fletcher Sch Law & Diplomacy, Ctr Int Environm & Resource Policy, 160 Packard Ave, Medford, MA 02155 USA",,"Bhandary, RR (通讯作者)，Fletcher Sch Law & Diplomacy, Ctr Int Environm & Resource Policy, 160 Packard Ave, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",rishikesh.bhandary@tufts.edu,,,"BP International Ltd.; Center for International Environment and Resource Policy, Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School; Fletcher School's PhD conference fund","BP International Ltd.; Center for International Environment and Resource Policy, Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School; Fletcher School's PhD conference fund","The author thanks Kelly Sims Gallagher, Bill Moomaw, and Eileen Babbitt for comments.

In this article, new long-run measurements of human capital accumulation in Ireland are devised in order to facilitate a better assessment of sources of this productivity growth, including the relative contribution of men and women. This is done by exploiting the frequency at which age data heap at round ages, widely interpreted as an indicator of a population's basic numeracy skills. Because Foldvari, van Leeuwen, and van Leeuwen-Li find that gender-specific trends in this measure derived from census returns are biased by who is reporting and recording the age information, any computed numeracy trends are corrected using data from prison and workhouse registers, sources in which women ostensibly self-reported their age. The findings show that rural Irish women born early in the nineteenth century had substantially lower levels of human capital than uncorrected census data would otherwise suggest. These results are large in magnitude and thus economically significant. The speed at which women converged is consistent with Geary and Stark's interpretation of Irish economic history; Ireland probably graduated to Europe's club of advanced economies thanks in part to rapid advances in female human capital.","[Blum, Matthias; Colvin, Christopher L.] Queens Univ Belfast, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [McAtackney, Laura] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus, Denmark; [McLaughlin, Eoin] Univ St Andrews, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland",Queens University Belfast; Aarhus University; University of St Andrews,"Blum, M (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland.",,"Colvin, Christopher L/Q-2058-2015; McLaughlin, Eoin/ABA-2401-2021","Colvin, Christopher L/0000-0002-8140-0115; Blum, Matthias/0000-0003-4129-9873; McLaughlin, Eoin/0000-0002-0307-3374",Erasmus Staff Mobility Programme; Economic History Association; University of Edinburgh Challenge Investment Fund,Erasmus Staff Mobility Programme; Economic History Association; University of Edinburgh Challenge Investment Fund,"We acknowledge funding from the Erasmus Staff Mobility Programme (Blum), the Economic History Association (Colvin), and the University of Edinburgh Challenge Investment Fund (McLaughlin).",,94,10,12,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

However, little is known about how and why this role in climate finance has evolved, and how MDBs are managing this change internally. This paper addresses these questions through an analysis of energy support provided by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The paper maps trends in the number and monetary value of ADB energy projects and technical assistance activities, presenting descriptive statistics on five categories of energy between 2000 and 2014. The results indicate that ADB while decreased its support for fossil fuel interventions, this sector continues to enjoy substantial funding support. At the same time, support for sustainable energy projects has also increased, reflecting the Bank's evolving priorities and providing a rough proxy for its entry into the climate finance system. These new insights enhance understanding of the changing dynamics of multilateral climate finance and its complex relationship with development finance institutions. Given their financial resources and policy influence, it is essential for MDBs to support the goals of the new global climate finance architecture. But to be considered a serious actor in the climate finance system, ADB has to revisit its policy architecture, strengthen its accounting procedures, and coordinate its efforts with those of other actors across this fragmented system.","[Delina, Laurence] Boston Univ, Frederick S Pardee Ctr Study Longer Range Future, 67 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University,"Delina, L (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Frederick S Pardee Ctr Study Longer Range Future, 67 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",ldelina@bu.edu,"Delina, Laurence/J-7331-2012","Delina, Laurence/0000-0001-8637-4609",,,,,30,10,13,5,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Design/methodology/approach - The study applies a critical review of the literature with a focus on the initial and subsequent training of front-line employees in the context of managed and entrepreneur-led pub-retailing operations. Findings - The delivery and impact of a well-designed initial training programme may not only enhance long-term employee engagement and loyalty, but also provide competitive advantage for pub-retail operations through a more consistent service delivery. The paper questions the suitability of the approach currently being adopted within the sector and suggests that change is needed in order to ensure the longer-term survival of pub-retail businesses. Practical implications - Can reliable and consistent customer experiences be delivered without a more progressive approach to the initial training and engagement of front-line employees? Originality/value - While the importance of initial and subsequent training is widely accepted, the potential for its poor delivery has an almost predictable impact on many customer experiences.

The other goal of the paper is to present the management systems that are most frequently integrated in Croatian business practice, also with the same focus on clusters. Qualitative research methodology was used in this paper while the data was collected combining the primary and secondary sources. Two working hypotheses were set up on literature-based analysis.

Type 1 wheat flour means higher protein and ash content. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the attributes usually referred to the characteristics of wheat flour known to consumers and at implementing a predictive model of purchasing that allows to make correct decisions without the necessary experience of a real human expert. Design/methodology/approach - In order to investigate the research aims of the paper, an online survey was carried out and conducted by means of the Google Forms in the detection time January-April 2016. The online survey collected responses from 467 Italian respondents asked to give feedback about their buying habits of various types of flour. The responses were analyzed through a data mining approach. This paper implements predictive analytics to create a statistical model of future behavior by means of a machine learning algorithms. Findings - In line with recent healthy and dynamic trends in the food industry, conscious consumer seems to be willing to pay a price for type 1 wheat flour that is four times higher than the price related to the basic types of wheat flour. Social implications - Consumer seems not to know well the type 1 wheat flour and its healthy characteristics; then, it should be crucial to implement promotional strategies and marketing hand in hand.

New entrants attempting to penetrate it via the commercialization of a new technological innovation could face high uncertainty and constraints. The capability to innovate through collaboration and to identify suitable strategies and innovative business models (BMs) can be particularly important for bringing a technological innovation to this market. However, although the potential for these capabilities has been advocated, we still lack a complete understanding of how new ventures could support the technology commercialization process via the development of BMs. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - To address this gap, this paper builds a conceptual framework that knits together the different bodies of extant literature (i.e. entrepreneurship, strategy and innovation) to analyze the BM innovation processes associated with the exploitation of emerging technologies; determines the suitability of the framework using data from the exploratory case study of IT IS 3D - a firm which has started to exploit 3D printing in the food industry; and improves the initial conceptual framework with the findings that emerged in the case study. Findings - From this analysis it emerged that: companies could use more than one BM at a time; hence, BM innovation processes could co-exist and be run in parallel; the facing of high uncertainty might lead firms to choose a closed and/or a familiar BM, while explorative strategies could be pursued with open BMs; significant changes in strategies during the technology commercialization process are not necessarily reflected in a radical change in the BM; and firms could deliberately adopt interim strategies and BMs as means to identify the more suitable ones to reach the market. Originality/value - This case study illustrates how firms could innovate the processes of their BMdevelopment to face the uncertainties linked with the entry into a mature and highly conservative industry (food).","[Flammini, Serena; Mortara, Letizia] Univ Cambridge, Inst Mfg, Ctr Technol Management, Cambridge, England; [Flammini, Serena; Lucchetti, Maria Claudia] Roma Tre Univ, Dept Business Studies, Rome, Italy; [Arcese, Gabriella] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Ionian Dept Law Econ & Environm, Bari, Italy",University of Cambridge; Roma Tre University; Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro,"Flammini, S (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Inst Mfg, Ctr Technol Management, Cambridge, England.;Flammini, S (通讯作者)，Roma Tre Univ, Dept Business Studies, Rome, Italy.",sf559@cam.ac.uk,"Pineda, Diana/K-6241-2012; Mortara, Letizia/I-5321-2012","Arcese, Gabriella/0000-0001-6949-9290; Mortara, Letizia/0000-0003-0461-5339",UK Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/K039598/1]; Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [EP/K039598/1]; Roma Tre Scholarship; EPSRC [EP/K039598/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K039598/1] Funding Source: researchfish,UK Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Roma Tre Scholarship; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"The authors are extremely thankful to IT IS 3D for the collaboration in the study.

Since it is necessary to the existence of incentives that are mostly focused on direct measures (stimulus funding) and indirect measures (tax incentives and protection of intellectual property rights). Most states through their tax systems approved tax incentives for research and development and they make up a significant part of the tax benefits that are granted under the income tax. The most common forms of tax incentives for research and development of the tax base of income tax for eligible costs of the project of scientific research and development, delayed payment of taxes, and the tax credit. Apart from the tax incentives, some governments grant subsidies for research and development activities. The Republic of Croatia, regardless of which approves tax incentives and state aid for research and development, has a significantly smaller the share of expenditure for research and development in GDP in comparison with other EU member states. Accordingly, the authors will explore, define and analyze the structure of tax incentives and state aid for research and development in Croatia, as well as the importance and impact of these incentives and support the economic performance Eastern Croatia. The aim of this paper is to point out the importance of encouraging research and development through tax incentives and state aid, with the aim of achieving greater economic growth both in the Republic of Croatia, as well as in Eastern Croatia.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze the preferences of Chinese consumers for specific FPP attributes. Design/methodology/approach - A choice experiment approach was used to explore consumer preferences. The authors conducted a means-end-chains evaluation to select the attributes for the choice experiment. The authors used a fractional factorial design and finally obtained 18 choice scenarios. The authors collected 166 effective consumer questionnaires in Beijing. Findings - The authors found that among the four attributes considered, certification and the diversity of the FPP had significant effects on the willingness to pay (WTP) among consumers. Residents had heterogeneous preferences for FPP diversity and certification, but certification was the major concern when considering fresh produce in the FPP. With regard to the WTP for attributes in the portfolio, the WTP values for green and organic attributes were high, but the WTP for the diversity of FPPs was low. Originality/value - This study is the first attempt to explore the preferences of Chinese consumers regarding the attributes of FPP in an e-commerce environment.","[Jin, Shaosheng] Zhejiang Univ, CARD, Sch Publ Affairs, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Li, Haoyang] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Li, Yao] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Management, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Michigan State University; Zhejiang University,"Jin, SS (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, CARD, Sch Publ Affairs, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",ssjin@zju.edu.cn,"Wang, Xin/JCE-2009-2023; Li, Haoyang/HSH-2215-2023","Wang, Xin/0000-0002-4457-7376; Li, Haoyang/0000-0001-9543-1767","National Natural Science Foundation of China [NNSFC-71273233, 71333011]; Major Program of the Key Research Institute of Chinese Ministry of Education [15JJD790032]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Major Program of the Key Research Institute of Chinese Ministry of Education,"The authors would like to thank Professor Richard Baines (The Royal Agricultural University, UK), Professor Maurizio Canavari (University of Bologna, Italy), Professor Chen Ji (Zhejiang University, China), and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments and suggestions.

Design/methodology/approach - A purposive sample of 34 food system professionals from different sub-sectors within the Australian food system was interviewed individually in late 2015 and early 2016. Interviews were analysed using the template analysis technique. Findings - Most participants appreciated the extensive coverage of food literacy aspects in this new curriculum. However, many suggested amendments to the curriculum including pay less emphasis on food history-related topics and pay more focus on primary food production, nutrition awareness and promotion, and food security, food sovereignty, social justice, and food politics. Practical implications - A well-structured, comprehensive secondary school food literacy curriculum could play a crucial role in providing food literacy education for adolescents. This will help them to establish healthy food patterns and become responsible food citizens. The findings of this study can be used to modify the new curriculum to make it a more comprehensive, logical, and feasible curriculum.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper applies a quantitative approach, relying on data from 157 Italian firms operating in the F&B industry to test the hypotheses through OLS regression models. Findings - Results suggest that the surveyed firms actively engage in open innovation with strong ties with market-based sources. Moreover, the authors found that market-based sources are associated with income from incremental innovation and time to market, while science-based sources are associated with income from radical innovation. Finally, the authors found that the R&D intensity enhances the benefits of the above external knowledge sourcing modes. Originality/value - Despite the large amount of studies assessing the effects of external knowledge sourcing on performance in the open innovation field, few studies focused on a specific industry, especially with regard to F&B.

According to this model, two attributes (parameters) define the aerodynamic properties of the screen: a characteristic resistance (drag) and a characteristic mixing-length. The former affects the horizontal force on the structure and the latter affects the vertical turbulent transfer across the roof. Similar parameters (drag and mixing-length) also define the aerodynamic properties of the crop. In our previous reports described the mixing-length model, we calculated velocity and shear profiles and estimated the screen aerodynamic parameters. Here, we also estimate the aerodynamic properties of the crop canopy. Data from two large screenhouses, one covered with a fine 'insect' screen and another with a coarse 'shading' screen, were used in the analysis. It turns out that in both cases the crop mixing-length does not limit the size of the turbulent eddies and, therefore, does not affect the turbulent transfer. Crop drag, however, has some effect. All things considered, estimating the aerodynamic properties of fine screens from wind and shear profiles does not require detailed and accurate crop information.","[Seginer, I.] Technion, Haifa, Israel; [Pirkner, M.; Achiman, O.; Mekhmandarov, Y.; Tanny, J.] ARO, Bet Dagan, Israel",Technion Israel Institute of Technology,"Seginer, I (通讯作者)，Technion, Haifa, Israel.",segineri@technion.ac.il,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62611-50-4,ACTA HORTIC,,,2017,1154.0,,,,,,105,110,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1154.14,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BK1IS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431840500014,0

The effect of fruit maturity at harvest on subsequent ripening behaviour and eating quality during storage is extremely important, but not fully understood. A recent technology, the index of absorbance difference (I-AD), provides a non-destructive index of fruit physiological maturity and enables accurate monitoring of fruit ripening behaviour before and after harvest. Prunus persica L. 'Summer Flare 34' and 'Summer Bright' nectarine and 'September Sun' peach were segregated at harvest into classes based on ethylene production rate and then monitored during storage. 'Summer Bright' and 'September Sun' were monitored with a DA-meter and the I-AD was measured twice weekly for up to 42 days during storage at both 0 and 7 degrees C, whilst the effect of ambient temperature on ripening was determined by monitoring 'Summer Flare 34' at 3-day intervals for up to 10 days at 18 degrees C. Changes in the I-AD ripening index were best described by a logistic sigmoidal curve. Storage temperature, cultivar and maturity class at harvest affected the magnitude of single curve parameters but not the type of relationship between ripening and storage time. A series of sigmoidal curves were identified and differences in the y-intercept (i.e., I-AD value at harvest) were mainly explained by cultivar and maturity stage at harvest, while differences in the slope and inflection point were mostly due to storage temperature. Adjusted correlation coefficients were cultivar dependent and decreased with storage temperature, with weaker correlations found for fruit at 0 degrees C, due to a lower rate of ripening during storage. In this study, a common postharvest ripening trend was identified among the peach and nectarine cultivars studied with a logistic sigmoidal curve best describing the change in I-AD during storage.","[Stefanelli, D.; Lopresti, J.; Hale, G.; Jaeger, J.; Frisina, C.; Jones, R.; Tomkins, B.] Dept Econ Dev Jobs Transport & Resources, Bundoora, Vic, Australia",,"Stefanelli, D (通讯作者)，Dept Econ Dev Jobs Transport & Resources, Bundoora, Vic, Australia.",Dario.Stefanelli@ecodev.vic.gov.au,,,Horticulture Innovation Australia (HIA); DEDJTR Victoria; Victoria summer fruit industry,Horticulture Innovation Australia (HIA)(Horticulture Australia Limited); DEDJTR Victoria; Victoria summer fruit industry,This research is sponsored by Horticulture Innovation Australia (HIA) and DEDJTR Victoria as part of the Profitable Stone fruit and Maximize Stone fruit Production Efficiency projects from the Food and Fiber and Fruit to Asia initiatives with full support of the Victoria summer fruit industry.,,15,5,5,0,2,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62611-50-4,ACTA HORTIC,,,2017,1154.0,,,,,,17,23,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1154.3,0.0,,,7,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BK1IS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431840500003,0

Findings - The study ascertained the existence of differences in the perception of the reliability of sources of information on foodstuffs and the declared frequency of using them. In the respondents' opinion, the most reliable information can be obtained from nutrition consultants, family members, physicians or pharmacists. Furthermore, the analysis of the frequency of use of individual sources of information by the respondents proved that most often they relied on the recommendations from their family members, the information contained in the label and advice offered by their acquaintances.

Therefore, social media has entered almost every aspect of people's daily lives by using enormous economic benefits of Internet and its most visible part i.e. World Wide Web that already made data, information and communication available to people in a matter of seconds. This is considerably emphasised when it comes to the power of social media in marketing, both the traditional one; where advertisements are inevitable and surrounding consumers on every step, and the modern one (often called digital marketing and/or online marketing) which strives to implement new ways of displaying advertisements. Thus, all social media have deeply changed the way marketing functions and because of them the completely new discipline of marketing was subsequently coined i.e. social media marketing, with communication strategies being one of its most significant parts. Based on the premise that, in order to deepen relationships with and to enhance exposure to, potentially interested people, social media marketing and its communication strategies utilise the principle of networking within social media, authors have decided to conduct the research in order to determine economic benefits that can be expected from their timely and effective implementation.

Biodiversity loss in turn affects agricultural production indirectly through a range of biodiversity-dependent ecosystem services. Land conversion thus results in a negative externality, mediated by changes in biodiversity. When the consequences of this externality are delayed in time, lack of internalization results in overshoot-and-collapse dynamics, which are undesirable from a sustainability perspective. Here, we emphasize the importance of forward-looking policies for the long-term sustainability of human-nature interactions. We show that the internalization of this externality through a land tax can result in several win-win effects in the long run. First, more biodiversity is preserved at equilibrium, which increases the carrying capacity and total well-being of the human population. Second, a taxation path that maximizes the discounted sum of human utilities prevents or greatly alleviates overshoot-and-collapse crises, thus increasing the sustainability of the system. In particular, this result holds in the case of imperfect information regarding the precise temporal dynamics of biodiversity loss, suggesting that the design of efficient land-use management policies is possible despite incomplete ecological data. This study highlights the need to internalize biodiversity-dependent externalities through economic incentives, especially under uncertainty regarding long-term ecological dynamics.","[Lafuite, A. -S.] CNRS, Theoret & Expt Ecol Stn, Ctr Biodivers Theory & Modelling, Moulis, France; Paul Sabatier Univ, Moulis, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier,"Lafuite, AS (通讯作者)，CNRS, Theoret & Expt Ecol Stn, Ctr Biodivers Theory & Modelling, Moulis, France.",lafuite.as@gmail.com,,,TULIP Laboratory of Excellence [ANR-10-LABX-41]; Midi-Pyrenees Region; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 - Research and Innovation Framework Programme [666971],TULIP Laboratory of Excellence; Midi-Pyrenees Region(Region Occitanie); European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 - Research and Innovation Framework Programme(European Research Council (ERC)),"This work was supported by the TULIP Laboratory of Excellence (ANR-10-LABX-41) and the Midi-Pyrenees Region.

Emphasis is placed on the impact of climate change damages on the price of financial assets and the financial position of firms and banks. The model is estimated and calibrated using global data and simulations are conducted for the period 2016-2120. Four key results arise. First, by destroying the capital of firms and reducing their profitability, climate change is likely to gradually deteriorate the liquidity of firms, leading to a higher rate of default that could harm both the financial and the non-financial corporate sector. Second, climate change damages can lead to a portfolio reallocation that can cause a gradual decline in the price of corporate bonds. Third, climate-induced financial instability might adversely affect credit expansion, exacerbating the negative impact of climate change on economic activity. Fourth, the implementation of a green corporate QE programme can reduce climate-induced financial instability and restrict global warming. The effectiveness of this programme depends positively on the responsiveness of green investment to changes in bond yields.","[Dafermos, Yannis] Univ West England, Dept Accounting Econ & Finance, Bristol, Avon, England; [Nikolaidi, Maria] Univ Greenwich, Dept Int Business & Econ, London, England; [Galanis, Giorgos] Goldsmiths Univ London, Inst Management Studies, London, England",University of West England; University of Greenwich; University of London; Goldsmiths University London,"Nikolaidi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Greenwich, Old Royal Naval Coll, Dept Int Business & Econ, Pk Row, London SE10 9LS, England.",M.Nikolaidi@greenwich.ac.uk,,"Dafermos, Yannis/0000-0002-8127-6249; Nikolaidi, Maria/0000-0002-8188-5482",Network for Social Change; University of the West of England,Network for Social Change; University of the West of England,"We are grateful to two anonymous referees for their constructive comments and suggestions.

Nonetheless, adaptive strategies and environmental sustainability may affect the ability to cope with these impacts. We analyze how agricultural technologies and the ecosystem diversity represented by the land cover have attenuated the impacts of extreme climate events on agricultural production in the Sao Paulo state, Brazil. Analyses are based on a panel with information for 568 municipalities between 1990 and 2014. We first use multivariate statistical analysis to define six groups of localities according to their levels of agricultural development and land cover. Secondly, based on fixed effect estimates, we analyze the relationship between the dynamics of extreme climate events and agricultural production in each group of localities. Results highlight that both technological and environmental factors could contribute to increases in agricultural production. More importantly, agriculture practiced with high levels of environmental preservation tends to be more resilient to extreme temperature and precipitation events.","[Maia, Alexandre Gori] Univ Estadual Campinas, Ctr Agr & Environm Econ, R Pitagoras,353,Cidade Univ, BR-13083857 Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Brito Miyamoto, Bruno Cesar] Fed Inst Rio Grande do Sul IFRS, R Princesa Isabel 60, BR-95770000 Feliz, RS, Brazil; [Garcia, Junior Ruiz] Fed Univ Parana UFPR, Dept Econ, Av Prefeito Lothario Meissner 632, BR-80210170 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil",Universidade Estadual de Campinas; Instituto Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (IFRS); Universidade Federal do Parana,"Garcia, R (通讯作者)，Fed Univ Parana UFPR, Dept Econ, Av Prefeito Lothario Meissner 632, BR-80210170 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.",gori@unicamp.br; jrgarcia@ufpr.br,"Garcia, Junior Ruiz/V-7542-2019; Maia, Alexandre Gori/Q-5222-2019","Garcia, Junior Ruiz/0000-0002-9625-3859; Maia, Alexandre Gori/0000-0003-0075-5094","Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (Coordenadoria de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior, Capes); Programa de Apoio a Pos-Graduacao e a Pesquisa Cientifica e Tecnologica em Desenvolvimento Socioeconomico no Brasil (PGPSE) [88887.123941/2016-00]; Project Abordagem simultanea e inter-relacionada das dimensoes de sustentabilidade para a melhoria da gestao de recursos hidricos: o caso da bacia do Rio Jundial","Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (Coordenadoria de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior, Capes); Programa de Apoio a Pos-Graduacao e a Pesquisa Cientifica e Tecnologica em Desenvolvimento Socioeconomico no Brasil (PGPSE); Project Abordagem simultanea e inter-relacionada das dimensoes de sustentabilidade para a melhoria da gestao de recursos hidricos: o caso da bacia do Rio Jundial","This work was supported by the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (Coordenadoria de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior, Capes), Programa de Apoio a Pos-Graduacao e a Pesquisa Cientifica e Tecnologica em Desenvolvimento Socioeconomico no Brasil (PGPSE), grant numbers 88887.123941/2016-00, Project Abordagem simultanea e inter-relacionada das dimensoes de sustentabilidade para a melhoria da gestao de recursos hidricos: o caso da bacia do Rio Jundial.",,52,31,31,9,93,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

In this regard, it is fundamental to design appropriate models to minimize the social costs of response operations to distribute essential supplies to populations in need. In addition to merely cover logistics cost, social costs include deprivations costs, which are an increasing function of deprivation time, derived from the human suffering caused by the lack of access to a good or a service. This research uses the theory of discrete choices to assess deprivation costs due to the time spent waiting for the delivery of a basket of basic supplies, defined as the changes in the welfare of people affected by disasters. To this end, we designed a stated choice survey, applied to people living in areas affected by floods and earthquakes in Colombia. The estimated models consider the influence of individual's socioeconomic characteristics and random effects on the deprivation cost functions. The functions have a nonlinear structure, strictly increasing, and convex on the deprivation time. The results are useful for estimating the social costs of humanitarian relief operations.

They hamper trade flows between areas sharing an international border (a demand effect), as well as causing firms' inefficiency because of the increase in production costs (supply side). In the theoretical and empirical discussions, no question has been raised on whether regional economies are able to set up compensation mechanisms, by replacing low endowments with high efficiency in the use of existing assets, or by compensating an inefficient use of internal assets with an efficient use of external ones. The reply to this question has normative implications. Empirical evidence on the universe of 1,398 European NUTS3 regions is presented and policy suggestions elaborated.","[Capello, Roberta; Caragliu, Andrea; Fratesi, Ugo] Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture Built Environm & Construct Engn, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Caragliu, A (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture Built Environm & Construct Engn, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",andrea.caragliu@polimi.it,"Caragliu, Andrea/AAI-2320-2020; Fratesi, Ugo/IAM-5881-2023","Fratesi, Ugo/0000-0002-0755-460X; Capello, Roberta/0000-0003-0438-6900; Caragliu, Andrea/0000-0003-0865-3404",,,,,48,12,13,3,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

As the ecosystem service concept increasingly becomes an operational tool there is a need to account for the complexity of the relations between production and appropriation of ecosystem services. To date there has been a considerable focus on the spatial patterns of ecosystem services provision and appropriation. We propose a new way of categorizing them according to their temporal dynamics. We differentiate between linear and non-linear dynamics in both the provision and appropriation of ecosystem services. Based on our classification we suggest how temporal dynamics can be better integrated into ecosystem services research in four steps. These include setting the appropriate temporal boundaries of the system, identifying key types of dynamics of the ecosystem, assessing the spatial scale on which the dynamics play out in the system and developing measures for assessing these dynamics. Considering temporal dynamics of ecosystem services by following these steps has the potential to enable better planning of ecosystem services management and therefore, to enhance human well-being.","[Rau, Anna-Lena; von Wehrden, Henrik; Abson, David J.] Leuphana Univ, Fac Sustainabil, Univ Allee 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany; [von Wehrden, Henrik] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA",Leuphana University Luneburg; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Rau, AL (通讯作者)，Leuphana Univ, Fac Sustainabil, Univ Allee 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany.",annrau@leuphana.de,"Abson, David/AAE-9027-2019","Abson, David/0000-0003-3755-785X; Rau, Anna-Lena/0000-0002-1068-9273",,,,,97,51,52,7,79,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

The circular economy is one of several different concepts that has been useful in the quest to understand how resources can be used most efficiently. It proposes that closing loops and repeatedly using resources has the potential to procure maximum eco-efficiency. To track society's progress towards a circular economy, indicators and measures are needed. The majority of these aim to capture the circularity of resource flows, yet fail to simultaneously consider the length of time for which a resource is in use. More recently, a longevity indicator has been proposed, but similarly, it fails to take into account how many times a resource is used. Both longevity and circularity are needed for sustainable resource use, but to date, no measure that combines both approaches is in use. Based on existing measures we develop and further develop indicators for both circularity and longevity that focus on the contribution that organisations and other resource users make to the sustainability of resource use. By combining both indicators we enhance their explanatory power.","[Figge, Frank; Thorpe, Andrea Stevenson; Givry, Philippe; Canning, Louise; Franklin-Johnson, Elizabeth] Kedge Business Sch, Domaine Luminy BP 921,Rue Antoine Bourdelle, F-13288 Marseille 9, France",Kedge Business School,"Figge, F (通讯作者)，Kedge Business Sch, Domaine Luminy BP 921,Rue Antoine Bourdelle, F-13288 Marseille 9, France.",figge@sustainablevalue.com; Andrea.thorpe@kedgebs.com; Philippe.givry@kedgebs.com; Louise.canning@kedgebs.com; Elizabeth.franklin-johnson@kedgebs.com,"; Figge, Frank/L-1408-2018","Thorpe, Andrea/0000-0002-9488-2336; Figge, Frank/0000-0002-8874-1385",,,,,71,108,111,4,57,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Research was conducted in the northeastern floodplain communities of Bangladesh, regarded as one of the most climate sensitive, resource poor, and highly understudied areas of the country. This wetland-dominated ecosystem is home to diverse resources user groups (e.g., farmer and fisher) who are subjected to regular seasonal flooding, excessive rainfall, drought, and flash floods. Working in 12 adjacent villages of two significant wetlands (Hakaluki haor and Tanguar haor), qualitative and quantitative data were collected through 15 focus groups (n = 15), 35 key informant interviews, and 356 household surveys to better understand how community members adapt in response to their livelihood sensitivity to the climatic stresses. Results indicate that community members organize and transform capital assets in diverse ways to escape climate-induced poverty traps. Findings also reveal that interventions from external agencies (e.g., government, non-governmental organizations and market institutions) are an important key to livelihood sustainability for many households.","[Rahman, H.

Particularly in the agro-food industry, fair and responsible consumption has been proposed as a feasible alternative to conventional product consumption. Fair trade products are usually produced in developing countries and then commercialised in the rest of the world. However, we may compare this concept to that of ethical-sustainable production in developed countries, depending on the level of environmental responsibility, the way the production processes are developed and other business practices, which are similar to those used in fair trade. The findings reveal that the origin (local/regional) and the type of production are two attributes that are highly valued by consumers, with the socially and environmentally responsible production system and fair trade products providing a positive utility compared to conventional products. Three consumer groups have been identified with differentiated preferences: the group we call Fair Trade Consumers, who allocate more value to the type of production; Local Consumers, who allocate more value to the origin of products; and Price Sensitive Consumers, who are less inclined to pay for products deriving from socially and environmentally responsible practices and fair trade products.","[Sama, Celia; Crespo-Cebada, Eva; Mesias, Francisco J.] Univ Extremadura, Dept Econ, Ctra Caceres S-N, Badajoz 06070, Spain; [Diaz-Caro, Carlos] Univ Extremadura, Dept Accountabil, Campus Caceres, Caceres 30100, Spain; [Escribano, Miguel] Univ Extremadura, Dept Anim Prod & Food Sci, Campus Caceres, Caceres 30100, Spain",Universidad de Extremadura; Universidad de Extremadura; Universidad de Extremadura,"Mesías, FJ (通讯作者)，Univ Extremadura, Dept Econ, Ctra Caceres S-N, Badajoz 06070, Spain.",fjmesias@unex.es,"Diaz-Caro, Carlos/AAC-9755-2019; Sama-Berrocal, Celia/IVV-2207-2023; Mesias, Francisco J./L-6307-2017; Sama Berrocal, Celia/ABD-2334-2021; Escribano, Miguel/AAC-9420-2020","Sama-Berrocal, Celia/0000-0001-9355-6419; Mesias, Francisco J./0000-0001-5334-9554; Sama Berrocal, Celia/0000-0001-9355-6419; Escribano, Miguel/0000-0003-1684-1931; Crespo-Cebada, Eva/0000-0002-0516-9345",Regional Council of Extremadura; FEDER Funds,Regional Council of Extremadura; FEDER Funds(European Union (EU)),The authors would like to thank the Regional Council of Extremadura and FEDER Funds for providing the funds to make the translation of this piece of research possible.,,49,40,41,7,62,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

A careful reading shows that the language of the protocol is clear and unambiguous; indeed, there has been no disagreement over the treaty's content. Furthermore, statistical analyses show no positive effect of political capacity on compliance. Finally, parties had adequate time to meet their obligations, and unexpected developments explain only a small part of the observed noncompliance. These findings pose a serious challenge to Chayes and Chayes' three explanations of noncompliance-at least as far as the Gothenburg Protocol is concerned.","[Tveit, Andreas Kokkvoll] Univ Oslo, Inst Statsvitenskap, Dept Polit Sci, Boks 1097 Blindern, N-0317 Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Tveit, AK (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Inst Statsvitenskap, Dept Polit Sci, Boks 1097 Blindern, N-0317 Oslo, Norway.",a.k.tveit@stv.uio.no,,"Kokkvoll Tveit, Andreas/0000-0002-9461-4980",,,,,48,3,3,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Yet the archive reveals how the PWLB came to play a major part in the financing of new schools, water supplies and sewers in the 1870s. Ten thousand loan applications have been analysed to highlight the changing patterns of the PWLB's lending, while the 60 volumes of minutes indicate why the pattern changed. The analysis shows that in the 1870s there was a large rise in local infrastructure investment caused by the switch from permissive to compulsory public health and education legislation. At the same time, the PWLB became predominantly a low-cost, rather than a market rate, lender. This change shows how MPs' views developed as they became more sensitive to the impact of the local costs of parliamentary legislation. Overall, the activities of the PWLB illustrate the legislative and institutional changes that contributed significantly to the growth in the role and spending of the state.","[Webster, Ian] Queens Univ Belfast, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland",Queens University Belfast,"Webster, I (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland.",ian.webster1954@gmail.com,,,,,,,57,9,9,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

As the expansion of tropical urban areas into biodiversity hotspots is predicted to more than double by 2030, knowing homebuyers utility from different vegetation types can contribute to global biodiversity conservation strategies. We used the hedonic pricing method to estimate the economic value of managed, spontaneous and high conservation value vegetation to Singapore public housing using a mixed effects model. On average vegetation had positive effects on property selling price, accounting for 3% of the average property's value, or a total of S$179 million for all public housing apartments sold over 13 months. These effects were almost entirely driven by managed vegetation, which had positive marginal effects on price for 98.1% of properties. The estimated marginal effects of high conservation value vegetation were mostly negative (90.5%% properties), but positive for properties without much managed vegetation nearby. The estimated marginal effects of spontaneous vegetation were mixed and mostly small. To reconcile the goals of protecting high conservation value vegetation and maximising homeowner utility, new public housing developments should contain more managed vegetation but be away from high conservation value vegetation.","[Belcher, Richard N.; Chisholm, Ryan A.] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, Singapore 117543, Singapore; [Belcher, Richard N.] Singapore ETH Ctr, Future Cities Lab, ETH Zurich, Singapore, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Belcher, RN (通讯作者)，Singapore ETH Ctr, Future Cities Lab, ETH Zurich, Singapore, Singapore.",richardneilbelcher@gmail.com,"Chisholm, Ryan/H-8033-2012; Belcher, Richard/M-7905-2013","Chisholm, Ryan/0000-0002-9847-1710; Belcher, Richard/0000-0002-8852-6183",Future Cities Laboratory at the Singapore-ETH Centre [FI 370074016],Future Cities Laboratory at the Singapore-ETH Centre,"We would like to thank Alex Thiam Koon Yee for providing the Singapore vegetation map and advice on ArcGIS.

We are specifically concerned with poverty alleviation because we consider this an urgent problem of justice. We review empirical literature on social trade-offs in ecosystem services governance in order to identify the prevalent conceptions of justice that inform scholarly assessments of current practice. We find that empirical studies do present specific notions of justice as desirable benchmarks for ecosystem services governance but that they rarely attempt to spell out the precise meaning of these notions or what makes them desirable. For those notions of justice that we identify in this literature - sufficientarianism, egalitarianism and participatory approaches - we draw on philosophical justice literature in order to better articulate the normative arguments that could support them and to be more precise about the kind of actions and expectations that they invoke.

To fill in this gap, we develop a methodology based on financial networks, which allows for analyzing the transmission throughout the economy of positive or negative shocks induced by the introduction of specific climate policies. We apply the methodology to empirical data of the Euro Area to identify the feedback loops between the financial sector and the real economy both through direct and indirect chains of financial exposures across multiple financial instruments. By focusing on climate policy-induced shocks that affect directly either the banking sector or non-financial firms, we analyze the reinforcing feedback loops that could amplify the effects of shocks on the financial sector and then cascade on the real economy. Our analysis helps to understand the conditions for virtuous or vicious cycles to arise in the climate-finance nexus and to provide a comprehensive assessment of the economic impact of climate policies.","[Stolbova, Veronika; Battiston, Stefano] Univ Zurich, Dept Banking & Finance, FINEXUS Ctr Financial Networks & Sustainabil, Zurich, Switzerland; [Stolbova, Veronika] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Potsdam, Germany; [Monasterolo, Irene] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria; [Monasterolo, Irene] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Battiston, Stefano] Swiss Finance Inst, Geneva, Switzerland",University of Zurich; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Vienna University of Economics & Business; Boston University; University of Geneva,"Stolbova, V (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Dept Banking & Finance, FINEXUS Ctr Financial Networks & Sustainabil, Zurich, Switzerland.",veronika.stolbova@uzh.ch,"battiston, stefano/M-1612-2017; Stolbova, Veronika/M-1604-2017; battiston, stefano/I-2624-2012","Stolbova, Veronika/0000-0002-5574-3827; battiston, stefano/0000-0002-0051-973X","EU [649186, 640772]; Swiss National Science Foundation Professorship [PP00P1-144689]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [PP00P1_144689] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)",EU(European Union (EU)); Swiss National Science Foundation Professorship(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"We are grateful to Mauro Napoletano (OFCE), Olga Briukhova (UZH) and Alan Roncoroni (UZH) for useful discussions on earlier versions of this paper, as well as to the participants of the EAEPE 2017 Conference for their comments.

A general equilibrium model is developed, and incorporates agricultural amenities as byproducts of agricultural production, water trade channels, and multiple water types. The premise is that until a decade ago, water policy in Israel was interlinked with agricultural land-use policy. Integrating a Monte-Carlo analysis, the model searches for a baseline minimum value of agricultural amenity that makes household, in the counterfactual scenario, indifferent between the administrative and market mechanisms. The minimum imputed value is around 109% agricultural output. The intuition is that the gains in economic welfare, from improved water use efficiency, are offset by the losses in social welfare due to a reduction in available agricultural amenities.","[Yerushalmi, Erez] Birmingham City Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",,"Yerushalmi, E (通讯作者)，Birmingham City Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",Erez.Yerushalmi@bcu.ac.uk,,"Yerushalmi, Erez/0000-0002-9421-9067",,,,,53,4,4,1,20,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Against this background, it is somewhat puzzling that many online retailers have recently begun referring their website visitors to their direct competitors. In this paper, using an analytical model, we examine this counterintuitive practice and posit that an entry deterrence motive can potentially explain this marketplace puzzle. Specifically, we develop a model where two incumbents compete for consumers' business while facing a potential entrant who is deciding whether to enter the market. In addition to setting the price, each incumbent firm could potentially display a referral link to its direct competitor. Our analysis reveals that when confronted with a potential entry, an incumbent may refer consumers to its competitor, intensifying the market competition that could result in shutting off the entrant. Furthermore, we show that when referral efficiency is exogenous, it is possible that in equilibrium only one incumbent refers its customers to competitor (i.e., one-way referral) or both incumbents refer their customers to each other (i.e, two-way referral). When referral efficiency is endogenous, the ex-ante symmetric incumbents may choose asymmetric referral efficiencies ex-post. We extend the model in a number of directions including making the entrant share endogenous and allowing incumbents to be asymmetric. Overall, our results indicate that firms may be motivated by entry deterrence to voluntarily refer consumers to their direct competitors even when they are paid nothing for the referral.","[Zhang, Jianqiang] Jiangsu Normal Univ, Dept Advertising, Xuzhou, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhuping] CUNY, Baruch Coll, Mkt, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Rao, Raghunath Singh] Univ Texas Austin, McCombs Sch Business, Mkt, Austin, TX 78712 USA",Jiangsu Normal University; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Baruch College (CUNY); University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Rao, RS (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, McCombs Sch Business, Mkt, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",jqzhang@jsnu.edu.cn; Zhuping.Liu@baruch.cuny.edu; Raghunath.Rao@mccombs.utexas.edu,,"Zhang, Jianqiang/0000-0002-8600-0014",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71602078]; Humanities and Social Sciences Fund of Ministry of Education [15YJC630169]; Qinglan Project of Jiangsu Province,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanities and Social Sciences Fund of Ministry of Education; Qinglan Project of Jiangsu Province,"The authors are grateful to Jiwoong Shin, Dmitri Kuksov and Andreas Kraft for detailed comments on earlier drafts of this paper.

Stronger land property rights could possibly enable farmers to increase input intensity and productivity on the already cultivated land, thus reducing incentives to expand their farms by deforesting additional land. This hypothesis is tested with data from a panel survey of farm households in Sumatra. The survey data are combined with satellite imageries to account for spatial patterns, such as historical forest locations. Results show that plots for which farmers hold formal land titles are cultivated more intensively and are more productive than untitled plots. However, due to land policy restrictions, farmers located at the historic forest margins often do not hold formal titles. Without land titles, these farmers are less able to intensify and more likely to expand into the surrounding forest land to increase agricultural output. Indeed, forest closeness and past deforestation activities by households are found to be positively associated with current farm size. In addition to improving farmer's access to land titles for non-forest land, better recognition of customary land rights and more effective protection of forest land without recognized claims could be useful policy responses.","[Kubitza, Christoph; Krishna, Vijesh V.; Qaim, Matin] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Goettinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Krishna, Vijesh V.] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr, Socioecon Program, Texcoco 56237, Mexico; [Urban, Kira] Univ Gottingen, Chair Forest Inventory & Remote Sensing, Busgenweg 2, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Alamsyah, Zulkifli] Univ Jambi, Dept Agr Econ, Jalan Raya Jambi,Muara Bulian Km 15, Mendalo Darat 36361, Jambi, Indonesia; [Qaim, Matin] Univ Gottingen, Ctr Biodivers & Sustainable Land Use, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen; CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); University of Gottingen; Universitas Jambi; University of Gottingen,"Kubitza, C (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Goettinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",ckubitz@gwdg.de,"Alamsyah, Zulkifli/AAQ-2384-2021; Qaim, Matin/P-4489-2016; Krishna, Vijesh/AAD-3431-2022","Alamsyah, Zulkifli/0000-0003-3927-2524; Qaim, Matin/0000-0003-4143-0763; Krishna, Vijesh/0000-0003-2191-4736",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [CRC 990],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This study was financed by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) in the framework of the collaborative German-Indonesian EFForTS research project (CRC 990).

Previous studies have analysed the effectiveness of market based instruments on single or multiple but independent species. On the example of tradable land-use permits we address an important issue for the first time: the conservation of interacting species (metacommunities). We consider two competing species where the superior competitor locally replaces the inferior competitor. Both species are structured as metapopulations, i.e. can go locally extinct while empty habitats can be recolonised by local populations on neighbouring habitats. Combining a spatially explicit and dynamic ecological-economic simulation model with cluster analysis we investigate how the coexistence of both species depends on the design of the tradable permit scheme, and how the effective scheme design (i.e. the scheme design that maximises coexistence) depends on the biological characteristics of the two species. We show that scheme designs that are effective for the conservation of single species may be ineffective for the conservation of two competing species and that the effectiveness of a scheme with regard to coexistence strongly depends on the relative performances of the two species with regard to their colonisation abilities and local extinction risks.","[Surun, Clement; Drechsler, Martin] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Ecol Modelling, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Surun, Clement] AgroParisTech, Campus Nancy,16 Rue Girardet, F-54000 Nancy, France",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); AgroParisTech,"Drechsler, M (通讯作者)，UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Ecol Modelling, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",martin.drechsler@ufz.de,,"Drechsler, Martin/0000-0002-6008-1856; Surun, Clement/0000-0003-1366-7886",,,,,30,4,4,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

I then use weighted least-squares regressions to explain country-level variation in estimated avoided deforestation as a function of a country's governance characteristics as well as other country level controls. Across 71 countries in this study period, protected areas were more effective in countries with higher levels of corruption control and protection of property rights, protected areas were more effective in more democratic countries, and there appears to be no relationship between political stability and avoided deforestation from protected areas.","[Abman, Ryan] San Diego State Univ, Dept Econ, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA",California State University System; San Diego State University,"Abman, R (通讯作者)，San Diego State Univ, Dept Econ, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",rabman@mail.sdsu.edu,,,,,,,48,41,45,9,41,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Is the increasing burden of cancer mainly the outcome of higher life expectancy and better life conditions brought about by economic development? To what extent do environmental degradation and changes in life-styles play a relevant role? To answer these questions, we empirically assessed the relationship between per capita income and new cancer cases (incidence) by using cross-sectional data from 122 countries. We found that the incidence rate of all-sites cancer increases linearly with per capita income, even after controlling for population ageing, improvement in cancer detection, and omitted spatially correlated variables. If higher incidence rates in developed countries were merely due to those factors, and not also to life-styles and environmental degradation, we would have found a flat or even an inverted-U pattern between per capita income and cancer incidence. The regression analysis was applied also to the eight most common site-specific cancers. This confirmed the existing evidence on the different patterns in rich and poor countries, explained the pattern of the estimated relationship for aggregate cancers, and gave some other interesting insights.","[Luzzati, T.; Parenti, A.; Rughi, T.] Univ Pisa, Dept Econ & Management, Via Ridolfi 10, I-56124 Pisa, Italy",University of Pisa,"Luzzati, T (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, Dept Econ & Management, Via Ridolfi 10, I-56124 Pisa, Italy.",tommaso.luzzati@unipi.it,,"Rughi, Tommaso/0009-0006-8774-1777; LUZZATI, TOMMASO/0000-0003-3835-7243",PRA grant of the University of Pisa,PRA grant of the University of Pisa,The present research was partially funded by a PRA 2015 and PRA 2017 grant of the University of Pisa.,,73,25,26,1,28,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

This paper assesses its ethical potential via the ethico-normative lens of the English School of international relations, eliciting the degree of pluralism and solidarism evident. It first presents pluralism and solidarism as ideal types against which research objects are assessed. Second, it analyses Aarhus' trinity of procedural rights, identifying solidarist potential whilst noting pluralist realities. Third, it casts Aarhus as exemplifying a nascent process cosmopolitanism, rendering sovereignty more responsible by enriching it with humanity, which here denotes a rudimentary sense of affinity between humans, irrespective of territorial identities, based on the rights shared by, and duties towards, one another. The paper concludes that Aarhus demonstrates the presence of, and contributes to, a solidarist international society, delineated by convention membership. If weaker cosmopolitanism accords equal concern to humans and stronger cosmopolitanism requires equal treatment, Aarhus demonstrates the feasibility of a stronger cosmopolitanism emerging in international environmental politics. Chiefly, Aarhus seeks to reduce imposed harm, suffered by humans who lack the knowledge and autonomy to influence decisions that affect them. Such headway is tentative, but this is welcomed as evolutionary reform coheres with the persistence of sovereign statehood. Aarhus' cosmopolitanism, yielding a moderating influence on sovereignty, will not emerge without a stable framework in which states institutionalise it. International politics remains, but can be enriched by procedural approaches to foregrounding human rights, which states must accommodate to be deemed legitimate.","[Weaver, Duncan] Keele Univ, Keele, Staffs, England",Keele University,"Weaver, D (通讯作者)，Keele Univ, Keele, Staffs, England.",dworldaffairs@gmail.com,,"Weaver, Duncan/0000-0003-3041-5373",,,,,76,11,11,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

This paper examines how international law concerning the Right to Promote (Sustainable) Development can contribute to determining what would be a just approach to achieving the 1.5 A degrees C objective. This entails building on both the Right to Development (RtD) and the Right to Promote Sustainable Development (RtPSD). The RtD is a central notion within international human rights law and the RtPSD has been adopted under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Based on a literature review and legal analysis, we argue that, although the two Rights are prima facie different, in the context of the unanimously adopted Agenda 2030, including the SDGs, they partly complement and partly merge with each other. Together they provide a framework for assessing how a just transition towards a low greenhouse gas development process could be achieved and what this means for phasing out fossil fuels especially in the context of prospective oil producing countries.","[Gupta, Joyeeta] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Social Sci Res, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Gupta, Joyeeta] IHE Inst Water Educ, Delft, Netherlands; [Arts, Karin] Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, The Hague, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; IHE Delft Institute for Water Education; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Gupta, J (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Social Sci Res, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Gupta, J (通讯作者)，IHE Inst Water Educ, Delft, Netherlands.",j.gupta@uva.nl; arts@iss.nl,"Gupta, Joyeeta/L-8672-2013; Arts, Karin/AAB-7825-2021","Arts, Karin/0000-0002-8511-1978; Gupta, Joyeeta/0000-0003-1424-2660",,,,,52,16,17,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

In this context, an optimized planning of decommissioning enables savings of energy costs. Due to the lack of sufficient empirical data about decommissioning of offshore wind farms, simulation techniques represent a suitable analysis tool to investigate such planning problems. The present contribution examines the effects of tactical decisions in the decommission phase of offshore wind farms by the use of a discrete-event, agent-based simulation study. The variation in the number of used vessels as tactical decision in connection with weather conditions is investigated. The results show that adapting the number of vessels can reduce about 6% of the decommissioning duration.","[Beinke, Thies; Alla, Abderrahim Ait; Freitag, Michael] Univ Bremen, BIBA Bremer Inst Prod & Logist GmbH, Bremen, Germany; [Freitag, Michael] Univ Bremen, Fac Prod Engn, Bremen, Germany",University of Bremen; BIBA - Bremer Institut fur Produktion & Logistik; University of Bremen,"Beinke, T (通讯作者)，Univ Bremen, BIBA Bremer Inst Prod & Logist GmbH, Bremen, Germany.",ben@biba.uni-bremen.de,"Freitag, Michael/E-6737-2017","Freitag, Michael/0000-0003-1767-9104",German Federal Ministry Economic Affairs [16KN021723ZIM-KF],German Federal Ministry Economic Affairs,The authors would like to thank the German Federal Ministry Economic Affairs for their supports within the projects IeK - Information system for near real-time coordination of offshore transport under consideration of specific resource characteristics and dynamic weather and swell conditions (funding code 16KN021723ZIM-KF).,,6,1,1,2,9,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2194-8917,,978-3-319-74225-0; 978-3-319-74224-3,LECT NOTES LOGISTICS,,,2018,,,,,,,216,222,,10.1007/978-3-319-74225-0_30,0.0,,,7,Business; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BL3JG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000449752500030,0

As such, they have attracted attention of many scholars and researchers who direct their efforts toward identifying factors or predictors of growth. Most of them have developed their studies at national and institutional level (searching for policy recommendations that will lead to an environment favorable for fast growing SMEs to achieve their full potential), and at enterprise level (looking at specific strategic actions and managerial decisions that can be derived from an analysis of predominantly financial data). This paper builds upon previous studies and introduces a new set of prospective predictor variables related to the entrepreneur's experience (in the context of industry, specific enterprise and entrepreneurial career in general), expertise (e.g. formal and informal education) and personality (e.g. risk tolerance, locus of control, goal orientation). The aim of the study is to explore the relationship and influence of entrepreneur-related variables on the growth potential of small and medium-sized enterprises. The sample consists of 199 SMEs and the prediction model is developed using logistic regression. The results demonstrate an importance of entrepreneur-related variables (experience, risk-taking propensity and locus of control), organizational practices and technology in achieving high-growth potential.","[Bilandzic, Ana] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Trg Ljudevita Gaja 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Bilandzic, A (通讯作者)，JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Trg Ljudevita Gaja 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",anag@efos.hr,,,Croatian Science Foundation [HRZZ-IP-2013-11-3933],Croatian Science Foundation,This research is funded by Croatian Science Foundation under grant No. HRZZ-IP-2013-11-3933 Development and application of growth potential prediction models for SMEs in Croatia.,,48,0,0,1,6,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,933,942,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900098,0

We build on an existing partial equilibrium model to take into consideration key determinants of excessive energy burden among vulnerable households. This analysis reveals that current public policies are not sufficient to reach the ambitious objectives for reducing energy consumption and GHG emissions in France. Moreover, the decreases that might occur mask significant social disparities across households. The joint implementation of multiple instruments leads to interactions that diminish overall policy outcomes. Overall, current public policies produce estimated free-riding rates of 75%. Energy efficiency measures are thus insufficient in themselves; the government should focus more on monetary poverty as a cause of low home improvement rates and consider subsidizing renovation costs as a potential solution.

Biochemical contents of seeds could influence germination ability of seeds. Many studies reported that environment of seed producing site such as altitude, precipitation and temperature could affect amount of biochemical contents of seeds. However, germination ability of seeds of arabica coffee growing in different altitude and different climate zones of Sumatera Utara was not yet investigated. This research tested the effect of genotypes and these factors. Seven genotypes from seven different climate zones in seven districts of Sumatera Utara were tested for germination ability using randomized complete block design. The result showed that genotypes were significantly (alpha = 0.05) and highly significantly different (alpha = 0.01) in number of days to reach 80 % germination, percentage of germination, height of cotyledon, and height of the first leaf. Number of days to reach 80 % germination showed a significant negative correlation (r = -0.930**) with percentage of germination but a significant positive correlation (r = 0.759*) with altitude of farms. It could be concluded that Arabica coffee genotypes affected seed germination ability. Seed germination ability was more affected by elevation of seed producing location rather than by precipitation and temperature.","[Malau, S.] Univ HKBP Nommensen, Fac Agr, Dept Agroecotechnol, Medan, Indonesia; [Siagian, A.] Univ Sumatera Utara, Fac Publ Hlth, Medan, Indonesia; [Sirait, B.] Univ Darma Agung, Fac Agr, Medan, Indonesia; [Ambarita, H.] Univ Sumatera Utara, Fac Engn, Medan, Indonesia",University of North Sumatra; University of North Sumatra,"Malau, S (通讯作者)，Univ HKBP Nommensen, Fac Agr, Dept Agroecotechnol, Medan, Indonesia.",sabam.malau@uhn.ac.id,"Sirait, Bilter/AAQ-6170-2020; Malau, Sabam/AAJ-6913-2020; Ambarita, Himsar/C-6738-2016","Malau, Sabam/0000-0001-5671-0966; Ambarita, Himsar/0000-0002-5692-9164","Ministry Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education [0100/E5.1/PE/2015]","Ministry Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education","The authors thank the Ministry Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education for funding this research with grant number 0100/E5.1/PE/2015 dated 19 January 2015.",,20,0,0,0,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1755-1307,,,IOP C SER EARTH ENV,IOP Conf.

In order to illustrate the case, the authors present Lithuania, compared to Romania, as a case study. Design/methodology/approach The authors tested the hypothesis that grape production and wine trade are increasingly decoupling. Based on the notion that transformation countries act as an avant-garde where new developments show first, the authors use Central and Eastern Europe as a case in point. The authors apply a mixed and a fixed effects model, where self-sufficiency in grapes explains wine exports to a reducing degree. Findings In the descriptive part the authors demonstrate how Lithuania, since EU accession, has become a major hub for wine trade, importing from the main export countries, and exporting mostly to Russia. In the multivariate section, it can then be shown that this decoupling between grape production and wine exports is a significant development in international terms. Practical implications The division of labour in wine trade has entered a new phase where wine production and wine marketing are decoupled. If extrapolated into the future, this may indicate that in the future world market, grape production and wine production may also decouple. Originality/value The paper has traced a new and un-described phenomenon on the global wine market. It shows that the division of labour is still advancing.","[Mann, Stefan] Agroscope, Dept Socioecon, Ettenhausen, Switzerland; [Beciu, Silviu] Univ Agron Sci & Vet Med Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania; [Karbauskas, Antanas] Minist Agr Republ Lithuania, Vilnius, Lithuania",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; University of Agronomic Science & Veterinary Medicine - Bucharest,"Beciu, S (通讯作者)，Univ Agron Sci & Vet Med Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania.",stefan.mann@agroscope.admin.ch; beciu.silviu@gmail.com; karbauskas.antanas@gmail.com,"Beciu, Silviu/HTR-2344-2023; Beciu, Silviu/ABE-2588-2021","Beciu, Silviu/0000-0002-1722-8664;",,,,,45,6,6,4,34,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

In this paper a model is developed to determine optimal temperature profiles for the future days during shipment. To assure the right quality in a dynamic environment, continuous monitoring inside reefers can be used to check the status of bananas. The optimization takes into consideration of disturbances of banana quality and estimated arrival time. Therefore, decisions are updated each day to cope with the possible disturbances. Simulation experiments compare the proposed approach and currently used approach.

Design/methodology/approach - Sweet potato flour was blended with wheat flour at 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 percent levels of substitution for bread production. Proximate, minerals and antinutritional factors of the breads were investigated using AOAC methods. Sensory evaluation was carried out by a panel of 50 consumers. Data were subjected to analysis of variance and means were separated by Tukey's comparison test at p < 0.05. Results were reported as mean +/- SD. Findings - The nutritional and sensory quality of bread made from wheat flour supplemented with sweet potato flour at 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 percent was investigated. Blending of sweet potato flour with wheat flour had significantly decreased the protein content (4.76-7.78 percent) while the ash (1.35-3.07 percent), crude fiber (0.24-1.03), carbohydrate contents (88.39-90.45 percent), iron, zinc, phosphorus and vitamin A contents were significantly increased (p < 0.05) with increasing sweet potato flour in the formulations. The tannin and phytate contents of the composite breads were low. Sensory evaluation of the breads revealed a mild reduction of the bread's general acceptability with increase in the substitution level by sweet potato flour. Originality/value - This study showed that the wheat flour used in making breads could be substituted with up to 15 percent sweet potato flour without compromising its nutritional quality, with only a mild reduction in sensory quality.","[Mitiku, Demelash Hailu] Wollega Univ, Dept Food Technol & Proc Engn, Shambu, Ethiopia; [Abera, Solomon; Bussa, Nugusse] Haramaya Univ, Inst Technol, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Sch Food Sci Postharvest Technol & Proc Engn, Haramaya, Ethiopia; [Abera, Tilahun] Jimma Univ, Dept Food Sci & Postharvest Technol, Jimma, Ethiopia",Haramaya University; Jimma University,"Abera, T (通讯作者)，Jimma Univ, Dept Food Sci & Postharvest Technol, Jimma, Ethiopia.",tilaeta@gmail.com,"Abera, Tilahun/U-7675-2019","Abera, Solomon/0000-0001-5190-2766",,,,,35,13,14,1,35,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Factors are listed that contribute to better engagement and communication, as well as strategies to increase involvement and improve communication in the process of education informatization. Case studies and research in the world theory and practice suggest that failure in introducing information process would lead to fatigue and distraction, thus increasing the probability of the incident.

Omega 3 and 6 are in position (stereospecific numbering) sn-1, 2 and 3 in fat molecules. Moreover, the position will affect the digestion and absorption of fatty acids in the body. In the fat metabolism of the body, fatty acids in the sn-2 position are not hydrolyzed so they can be absorbed properly. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the position of omega 3 and 6 fatty acids in fatty molecules so that the potential of fish oil as a source of omega 3 and 6 can be known. Goldfish oil from cages and ponds was extracted using the soxhletation method. Analysis of fatty acid composition by gas chromatography (GC) was previously esterified using BF3, while for the position determination of hydrolysis of fatty acids using lipase enzyme. The results showed that the composition of unsaturated fatty acids was more than saturated fatty acids. Omega 3 and 6 fatty acids in the fat molecule are found more in the sn-2 position than in the sn-1 + sn-3 position. Based on the composition and position of fatty acids, the goldfish oil from cages and ponds contains of fatty acids omega 3 and 6, at sn-2 position so that more is absorbed in fat metabolism in the body.

Criminal law challenge of the protection of commercial activities was increased particularly because of the existence of generalizations in criminal law, started with undefined concepts as are economy, relations in the economy and similar ones. Illegal activities although formally obtained in the same way as the legal ones are, do not belong to the domain of business/commercial business. Freedom and equality in business are the most important in criminal law protection of the economic activities, rather than the protection of economic activity per se. Economic and social transition, and European integration processes that have characterized the 21st century, bring new incriminations and other views on traditional values. Not only the protection of property, businesses, financial stability, but also the protection of the legal security and public order are part of the values that are associated with economic activities, whether in criminal or other law.

Therefore, it is important to make efforts to improve the position of persons who are particularly sensitive and vulnerable in the labour market, which is certainly the case for persons with disabilities. Their employment is influenced by a number of factors, such as the potential of a country's economy, aggravating factors such as prejudice, spatial and psychological barriers, etc. As compared to the rest of the population, there are differences with respect to persons with disabilities, not only in employment but also in personal income and other activities. Despite the stimulating measures, in the Republic of Croatia it is difficult to recruit persons with disabilities who often fall under the burden of family and social welfare. Such persons are last to get a job and first to lose it. For this reason, vocational training and employment of disabled persons is a basic measure of their protection. In this paper, an overview of the research results on the employment of persons with disabilities in the city of Split, conducted in August 2016, is presented. The research deals with the implementation of the Act on Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment of Persons with Disabilities. To this end, opinions and attitudes of persons with disabilities have been explored regarding their employment problems and shortcomings of the aforementioned Act. A survey was used as a research method. The research sample included an age group of 20 to 61, planned in accordance with the Report of the Croatian Institute of Public Health (2015). A sample of 49 respondents was realised in cooperation with NGOs dealing with persons with disabilities in the City of Split. According to the research results, most respondents believe that employers are not familiar with the difficulties that persons with disabilities face. The most common problems with their employment are the lack of employers' understanding, stereotypes about work efficiency, architectural barriers, few jobs available, and a lack of qualifications.","[Relja, Renata; Popovic, Toni; Rakic, Toni] Univ Split, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Split, Croatia",University of Split,"Relja, R (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Split, Croatia.",rrelja@ffst.hr; tpopovic1@ffst.hr; tonrak1@ffst.hr,"Dubisetty, Mallikarjuna Rao/JWO-4481-2024",,,,,,33,0,1,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,393,406,,,,,,14,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Law",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies; Government & Law,BP1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540727600045,0

Besides this, microbial contamination is also one of the major problems of chicken meat which leads to deterioration in quality during storage. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to investigate anti-microbial and anti-oxidant effects of various blends of essential oils (EOs) on the quality of emulsion-based (ready-to-eat) chicken sausages. Design/methodology/approach Sausages were incorporated with optimum level of four different blends of EOs containing six different EOs (Clove oil, Holybasil oil, Thyme oil, Cassia oil, Ajowan oil and Beetel oil), namely, Blend-1 (0.25 per cent), Blend-2 (0.25 per cent), Blend-3 (0.25 per cent) and Blend-4 (0.125 per cent); vacuum packaged and stored at -181 degrees C for 60 days. Duplicate samples were taken for each parameter, and three trials were conducted for each experiment, total being six observations (n=6) for consistency of the results. Findings Significant decrease (p<0.05) in pH of control products was observed at each interval of storage period; however, in case of treatment products, significant decrease (p<0.05) was noticed from day 30 onwards. Blend-2 was observed with significantly lower (p<0.05) thio-barbituric acid reacting substances followed by Blend-1. Significantly lower (p<0.05) total phenolics content was observed in Blend-4 products as compared to other treatments. Regarding DPPH activity, control products showed significant decrease (p<0.05); however, in case of treatment products, DPPH activity showed significant (p<0.05) decrease after day 15 of storage. Microbial count increased with progressive storage period; however, the counts were well below the permissible limit of frozen meat products. All the blend incorporated products received very good sensory scores in consistent manner. Practical implications The work under this study would be very useful for the meat processing industries dealing with the perishable meat products. Use of natural anti-oxidants will also restore faith towards the consumers who are becoming more health conscious day by day. Originality/value The research work is original.","[Sharma, Heena] Dairy Res Inst, Prague, Czech Republic; [Mendiratta, Sanjod K.; Agrawal, Ravi Kant; Talukder, Suman; Kumar, Sudheer] Indian Vet Res Inst, Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, India",Czech Dairy Research Institute; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Indian Veterinary Research Institute,"Sharma, H (通讯作者)，Dairy Res Inst, Prague, Czech Republic.",s.heenavet@gmail.com,"Sharma, Heena/M-7596-2019","Sharma, Heena/0000-0002-4739-185X",,,,,46,10,10,0,42,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

However, the history of the economics laboratory is not just a history of evolving technology. I argue in this article that it is mainly a history of learning how to build an experimental economics community. Only a functioning community was able to change a physical place to a laboratory space. The distinction between place and space originates in the work of Michael de Certeau and I use it to analyze the evolution of economics laboratories. To this end, I analyze the case of Austin Hoggatt's Management Science Laboratory at Berkeley in the 1960s as it illustrates the indispensability of creating a community centered on the laboratory. In contrast, the laboratories in Arizona and at Caltech since the 1980s, and in Amsterdam since the 1990s have become successful spaces, because, unlike Hoggatt, they focused equally on community building as on infrastructure and technology. This gave rise to social infrastructure and division of labor in the laboratory space.","[Svorencik, Andrej] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany",University of Mannheim,"Svorencik, A (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.",,,"Svorencik, Andrej/0000-0002-5716-946X","Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research, the NWO (VIDI) [276-53-004]","Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research, the NWO (VIDI)","This project was generously funded by The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research, the NWO (VIDI-grant #276-53-004).

Although increasingly popular in ecosystem service research, such studies have also been criticized. In particular, tensions between the assumptions of valuation methods and the real-life processes of valuing have been identified. This article argues that a process-based, pragmatist approach to valuing helps to evaluate the relevance of valuation studies results. Pragmatism proposes a focus on activities through which people come to value natural elements in their everyday life rather than on the outcomes of valuing processes. Using this approach we examine three empirical cases: 1) restoration of natural Springs in Finland; 2) protection of the bearded vulture in the French Alps; and 3) management of urban biodiversity in the City of Grenoble, France. Through these cases we demonstrate how nature's value to people emerges from commonplace ways of engaging with natural elements, such as domestication, inheriting and community building. We conclude by discussing the usefulness of acknowledging this kind of processes in nature conservation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Emission intensities such as the ratio of CO2 emissions to GDP have lately been widely used to characterize national emission performance. Meanwhile the impact of international trade has been found to be important in global emission accounting. It is therefore important to analyze changes in emission intensities by taking trade into consideration. In this study, we first propose two SDA models, one at the global level and the other at the country level, to quantify both the domestic and trade related effects on an intensity indicator. The models are then used to study changes in global and countries' CO2 emission intensities from 2000 to 2009, The results show that sectoral emission efficiency improvement was the main contributor to the slight decrease in global emission intensity during the period, while international trade marginally hampered improvement of global emission intensity. Comparisons of the performance between emerging economies and advanced economies reveal the importance of production structure and final demand structure in emission intensity reduction. The policy implications of the findings are presented. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Wang, H.; Ang, B.

Valuation is necessary to determine whether the bequest package that is passed on from one generation to the next is fair. Acknowledging the merits as well as the limitations of economic price theory, this paper differentiates between three classes of valuables: the essential, the useful and the unique. It is argued that a fair bequest package should contain items from each of the classes. Because the three classes are incommensurable, fairness of the bequest cannot be expressed by a single figure like a non-declining total value of the package. We then discuss which methods are appropriate for describing a bequest package with respect to its fairness. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Exploiting the fact that the Michigan Antitrust Reform Act (MARA) of 1985 inadvertently repealed Michigan' s prohibition on CNC enforcement, we show that technical professionals in Michigan became increasingly likely to switch industry relative to similar workers in other U.S. states after prohibition. Workers switching industries after the introduction of MARA also earned lower wages, implying that they shifted into technical fields where their skills from previous employment were less productive. Estimates further show that the technological dynamism of Michigan declined in tandem, as fewer workers shifted into new types of jobs associated with recent technological advances. These findings are consistent with the view that skilled professionals that are subject to CNCs are more likely to leave their field of work postemployment to avoid lawsuits.","[Berger, Thor] Lund Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Econ Hist, Box 7083, S-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Berger, Thor; Frey, Carl Benedikt] Univ Oxford, Oxford Martin Sch, 34 Broad St, Oxford OX1 3BD, England",Lund University; University of Oxford,"Berger, T (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Econ Hist, Box 7083, S-22007 Lund, Sweden.;Berger, T (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford Martin Sch, 34 Broad St, Oxford OX1 3BD, England.",thor.berger@ekh.lu.se; carl.frey@oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk,,"Berger, Thor/0000-0001-7712-4624",Swedish Research Council [2014-1491]; Crafoord Foundation [2013-0812]; Citi,Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Crafoord Foundation; Citi,We are grateful to the editor and two anonymous referees for comments and suggestions that substantially improved the paper.

Inequality in Portugal 1565-1770,CLIOMETRICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,Inequality; Early modern; Portugal; Kuznets curve; Factor-price ratios,INCOME INEQUALITY; REAL INEQUALITY; WEALTH; SPAIN; TRENDS; EUROPE,"This study offers an estimate of Portuguese income inequality over a period of more than 200 years. It is presented in three widely spaced benchmarks: 1565, 1700 and 1770. This entirely new index is based in large measure on a little-researched annual personal income tax (d,cima) instituted in 1641. It covered all social classes, including nobility and clergy and every form of household earnings, and permits therefore a singularly accurate measure. It allows us to conclude that, in contrast with early modern Europe in general, Portugal experienced a notable decline in economic inequality. Several freshly minted quantitative indicators enable us to conclude that the burden of the explanation for this apparently 'deviant' behaviour can be ascribed to changes in the functional distribution of income. Significant transformations in Portuguese agriculture-towards labour-intensive products like maize and wine-permanently shifted the wage-rental ratio in favour of labour. The skill premium fell but its contribution was relatively modest. It was a time of sustained economic growth, but this was not associated with pronounced urbanization or industrialization.","[Reis, Jaime] Univ Lisbon, Inst Cincias Sociais, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa,"Reis, J (通讯作者)，Univ Lisbon, Inst Cincias Sociais, Lisbon, Portugal.",jaime.reis@ics.ul.pt,,"Reis, Jaime/0000-0003-4990-2905",Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia,Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"The author wishes to thank Guido Alfani, Maria Antonia Pires de Almeida, Ines Amorim, Alda Azevedo, Raquel Berredo, Leonor Freire Costa, Rui Esperanca, Carlos Faisca, Joao Ferrao, Joao Fialho, Antonio Castro Henriques, Bruno Lopes, Filomena Melo, Conceicao Andrade Martins, Esteban Niccolini, Alvaro Santos Pereira, Susana Pereira, Amelia Polonia, Isabel dos Guimaraes Sa, Joao Paulo Salvado and Ana Margarida Silva, as well as the organisers and participants of the Economic History Society Conference, in Oxford, March 2012, the 3rd Einite Workshop on Economic Inequality in Southern Europe (Milan, Bocconi University, June 2015) and the Economic Inequality in Pre-industrial Eurasia session of the XVIIth World Economic History Congress (August 2016, Kyoto).

This is much more evident when an IS relies on existing contexts. Industrial networks and clusters have been proven to be one of the best models of local industrial development, and they can be considered also a favorable starting context for IS projects. The relations between traditional and symbiotic networks have been deeply investigated, but the complexity and the scientific and practical implications of the topic render the discussion still open. The present article contributes to this debate by clarifying the dynamics of the IS development in connection with the features of existing industrial clusters. The study proposed uses the results and the experiences gained by the authors in three case studies previously conducted, in order to develop an interpretative framework for assessing the potential and the limits for the development of IS-based scenarios. Empirical evidences show both the role of significant technical factors in designing the IS and the role played by non-technical factors in promoting and preventing its potential implementation.

An Argentinean Case Study,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Environmental valuation; Contingent choice; Periodical payments; Annuities; Inflation,WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; MODELS,"Stated preference valuation surveys often ask respondents for periodical payments, sometimes for the remaining life of the individuals. Questionnaires do not usually specify whether those payments would vary according to inflation. This may be less important in low-inflation economies, but results could differ significantly in high-inflation countries. A contingent choice exercise was conducted to explore the severity of this effect in Argentina. The empirical application focused on an anthropogenic-pressure mitigation program for the basins of the Mendoza region. A comparison of willingness-to-pay results from a scenario where annual payments were to be increased according to inflation with another of fixed annuities, found inflation to be significantly influential on respondents' stated values. Furthermore, a test on the robustness of the estimated values found results to be consistent with prior expectations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The article analyses whose interests prevailed in the negotiations and how, despite the resistance of some important actors, the Imperial diet of 1551 was able to unanimously agree on the currency bill. It also analyses why the common currency still failed: This was the case because of the desire of many princes to ease the repayment of their debts by establishing a bimetallic currency, and even more importantly because of Charles V's attempt to weaken the Elector of Saxony by undervaluing the taler. In this, Charles exploited the diet's implicit ex- ante agreement with him to set the rates at which old money was allowed to continue in circulation. His manipulations provoked resistance, raised the costs of implementing the common currency, and caused its failure.","[Volckart, Oliver] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Econ Hist Dept, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Volckart, O (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Econ Hist Dept, London, England.",,,,,,,,71,5,5,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

The comparability of results in a multicountry setting is supported through the use of a new internationally harmonised definition of cities based on economic linkages rather than administrative boundaries. The analysis finds that cities with fragmented governance structures tend to have lower levels of productivity. The estimated elasticity for an increase in the number of local jurisdiction is 0.06, which is halved by the existence of a metropolitan governance body. The productivity effect is sizeable and at least as important as the agglomeration benefit found due to city size.","[Ahrend, Rudiger; Lembcke, Alexander C.] OECD, Directorate Publ Governance & Terr Dev, Rue Andre Pascal, F-75775 Paris, France; [Farchy, Emily] OECD, Directorate Employment Labour & Social Affairs, F-75775 Paris, France; [Kaplanis, Ioannis] London Sch Econ, Spatial Econ Res Ctr, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Ahrend, R (通讯作者)，OECD, Directorate Publ Governance & Terr Dev, Rue Andre Pascal, F-75775 Paris, France.",rudiger.ahrend@oecd.org; emily.farchy@oecd.org; i.kaplanis@lse.ac.uk; alexander.lembcke@oecd.org,,,European Union,European Union(European Union (EU)),"The authors are indebted to Luis Diaz-Serrano, Andreas Georgiadis, Claudia Tello, and Dimitris Mavridis for collaboration on the country specific studies and useful discussions at various stages of the research.

Modern urban agglomerations tend to turn nowadays into advanced information hubs supporting a smart management of dynamic urban systems. The currently popular notion of 'smart cities' aims to provide a new perspective for sustainable and high-performance strategies of city stakeholders in our 'urban century'. In this context, digital information technology provides a new tool for efficient and effective management and planning of urban space, inter alia in the field of transportation, environment, public facilities or advanced service provision to citizens. This paper aims to offer, first, a concise overview of the emerging opportunities of information and communication technology (ICT) for smart urban policy; digital technology in particular, appears to provide novel pathways for modern planning strategies in smart cities. Against this background, the paper sketches out the complex force field of global urbanisation phenomena and highlights the data and information needs for strategic planning of cities (using inter alia as a framework the so-called 'urban piazza' strategy framework). Secondly, various new decision support tools that are currently emerging and that offer a new promising scope for handling complex urban management issues (for instance, on accessibility, congestion, safety or sustainability) are briefly presented. And finally, the potential of such digital data systems for urban management and policy is concisely illustrated by means of some recent applications in the area of smartphone data systems. The paper concludes with a discussion of the challenges ahead for urban policy, inter alia by paying attention to institutional and governance aspects of 'big digital data' management in urban systems.

This information includes not only the amount of money spent by the government but also can include various information about the accepted bids. This research uses induced-value experiments to evaluate the effect of past auction information on seller (landholder) rent seeking. Results suggest that sellers use this public information and learn how to secure higher rents. However, when sellers are given information only about the buyer's (government agency's) budget, they secure lower rents. Results also suggest that relative budget size affects rents and that budget stochastic variability in the presence of market information diminishes the effect Thus, in the presence of public information and equivalent total outlays, variable budgets are more likely than stationary budgets to achieve auction fiscal efficiency the measure of whether the auction achieves the greatest PES benefits given its limited budget Finally, this research finds that auctions with greater heterogeneity in seller opportunity costs are likely to be less fiscally efficient than when the distribution is more homogeneous.(C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.","[Messer, Kent D.; Duke, Joshua M.; Li, Tongzhe] Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Lynch, Lori] Univ Maryland, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Lynch, Lori] USDA, ERS, Washington, DC 20250 USA",University of Delaware; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Li, TZ (通讯作者)，Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",messer@udel.edu; tongzhe@udel.edu,"Duke, Joshua/ABB-9392-2021; Messer, Kent/AAK-8811-2020","Duke, Joshua/0000-0002-9895-1191;",,,,,51,19,24,0,25,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Design/methodology/approach - The study consisted of quantitative and qualitative phases. The quantitative data were collected through a written questionnaire distributed to a random sample of 370 students at a private university. The data were analyzed using Cronbach's a, principal component/exploratory factor analysis and standardized ordinal logistic regression. Qualitative in-depth interviews with ten students were undertaken to verify the quantitative results. Findings - Of the sample, 70 percent were females and 30 percent males. Of those interviewed, 70 percent drank coffee and 30 percent did not. In 64 percent of those who did not drink coffee, juice was the main substitute. The predictors of the coffee culture are: the country tradition, parents, general socialization with friends, home, workplace and restaurants. Tradition, parents and home were found to be the predictors of coffee culture for women; for men the predictors were the workplace and restaurants. Originality/value - Coffee culture amongst university students is experiencing a transition, and the changes identified seem to be affected by the gender of the student and the change in the economic base of the country. The information will be valuable in marketing coffee to young people.","[Aguirre, Juan] Univ Latina Costa Rica, San Jose, Costa Rica",,"Aguirre, J (通讯作者)，Univ Latina Costa Rica, San Jose, Costa Rica.",picoaguirre@gmail.com,,,,,,,35,5,5,3,13,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Sub-lethal and lethal temperature range of L. paracasei SNP2 was determined by enumeration of cell survival after incubation at 37-55 degrees C for 30 min. A certain temperature from sub-lethal range was selected for heat adaptation. Heat adaptation (H), pH adjustment (pH), and combination of pretreatments (pH-H) were applied prior to heat shock and spray drying. Findings - The selected condition for heat adaptation and heat shock is 44 degrees C, 30 min and 55 degrees C, 15 min, respectively, based on the sub-lethal and lethal temperature range. By heat shock, cells in the whey-sucrose medium showed cell death of 2.05 log cycles, lower than cell death in the MRS medium of 4.84 log cycles. The pretreatments showed slight increase of heat resistance in cell grown in whey sucrose. The effect of H, pH, and pH-H pretreatments highly increase heat resistance of cell grown in MRS indicated by cell death of 4.27, 3.79, and 2.43 log cycles, respectively, which is much lower than control. The pretreatments showed no significant effect to L. paracasei SNP2 survival to spray drying. Originality/value - This is the first study of L. paracasei SNP2 resistance to heat shock and spray drying.

By understanding this segment's background, perceptions, and behaviors, health and marketing professionals can tailor messages to reach clients and consumers. Design/methodology/approach - An online survey was completed in January 2014 with 1,335 older adult consumers (=55 years old). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and binomial logistic regression. Findings - More than half (n = 682, 51.2 percent) of respondents drank green tea. Most green tea consumers in this sample are college-educated and employed female home owners. The odds for green tea consumption are greater if a respondent is in good health, was informed about diet and health, or made a health-related dietary change in the past year. There are greater odds of consumption if the respondent is familiar with the relationship between drinking green tea and the reduced risk of cancer however, the importance of health statements on product labels are not predictive of consumption. Research limitations/implications - This study was conducted in the USA and with older adults. Future research should explore characteristics of younger consumers, i.e. 18-54 years old. Practical implications - Health educators, regulators, and marketing professionals may use this profile to tailor messages that speak to consumers and client's values and motivations. Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, this is the first profile of older adult green tea consumers in the USA.","[Berhaupt-Glickstein, Amanda] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Nutr Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Hallman, William] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Human Ecol, New Brunswick, NJ USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Berhaupt-Glickstein, A (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Dept Nutr Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",amanda.berhaupt@gmail.com,"Berhaupt-Glickstein, Amanda/R-6680-2016; Hallman, William/G-3591-2017","Berhaupt-Glickstein, Amanda/0000-0003-1650-8872; Hallman, William/0000-0002-4524-9876",,,,,45,2,2,3,21,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Grey literature from Scottish cooking skills courses were reviewed using realist principles. Intervention implementation variables were identified and iteratively coded to uncover intended intervention strategies and programme theories. The lack of robust evaluation processes and outcome data in the grey literature prevented the testing of intended programme theories against outcomes. Alternatively, implementation strategies were aligned against behavioural-theory constructs contained in national guidance. Prioritised theories were further clarified/refined using practitioner and participant focus group data. Learning was used to inform future practice/evaluation. Findings - Courses targeted and reached vulnerable individuals. Practitioners articulated multiple theories and assumptions about how strategies may work. Numerous strategies and behaviour constructs were used to target, tailor and reinforce cooking/food and wider social outcomes. Mechanisms were assumed to be triggered by different contexts and lead to varied outcomes. Strategies used were consistent with evidenced behaviour change constructs and guidelines. Interventions aimed to achieve non-cooking/social outcomes as well as cooking ones - including potential mediators of cooking behaviour, e.g. self-confidence. Contexts facilitated/limited the use of certain strategies. Limitations in course design, reporting and self-evaluation need to be addressed. Practical implications - Recommendations for improving intervention commissioning, design and evaluation using realist principles are provided. Originality/value - Learning addresses gaps in knowledge about the implementation of cooking skills interventions identified from systematic reviews and can improve course design and evaluation.","[Blamey, Avril] Avril Blamey & Associates, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Gordon, Jacki] Jacki Gordon & Associates, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Newstead, Kim; McDowell, Jacqueline] NHS Hlth Scotland, Dept Community Food & Hlth, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",,"Blamey, A (通讯作者)，Avril Blamey & Associates, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",avril.blamey@ntlworld.com,,,,,,,35,3,3,0,6,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Here, we incorporate sink inhibition of photosynthesis in a dynamic model of growth hour by hour, and assume that starch synthesis and breakdown provide sufficient NSC for growth and respiration during both day and night. It is not clear whether photosynthesis inhibition changes within the photoperiod or only from one day to the next. When this dynamic model was applied to tomato plants which had been pre-adapted under high or low light, respiration in darkness was first predicted to be constant, and then decreased with time, when NSC fell below the value needed for maximum growth. When predicting growth for tomato seedlings in a growth chamber at various temperatures between 9 and 36 degrees C, the correlation between predicted and actual minimum values of NSC was greater for the dynamic model (R-2= 0.83) than the steady-state model (R-2= 0.65). A large fraction of photosynthesis must be inhibited to predict NSC accurately under demand-limited conditions, in contrast with little inhibition under supply-limited conditions.

The major objective is the stretching of the harvest season, with a combined use of early cultivars and warming plastic cover types and the use late-sprouting cultivars together with cooling plastics. Secondary objectives are a good quality of spears and short-term control of asparagus yield. Meanwhile, several cover types are used, which consist of one to three layers of plastic. Depending on the current objectives of the grower, he has to choose one cover type. Currently, this decision is based largely on soil temperature, which is measured on farm or provided by central monitoring services over the internet. But cover management would be sounder if the grower knew future soil temperatures in advance below the most important covers. Therefore, we developed a physical model that is able to predict soil temperature below black and white plastics, and mini-tunnels covering black plastics. New solutions were derived for an approximated 2D soil heat transfer, the radiation exchange between the covers and convective heat exchange between the mini-tunnel and the lower plastic. A 5-year validation period showed even better performance than a previously developed more complex model, which was based on 2DSOIL. The proposed model only requires hourly weather data, optical properties of each plastic layer and basic soil properties such as contents of sand, clay and humus. The developed simulation model is currently operational for six sites located in three German Federal States, Brandenburg, Rhineland-Palatinate and Bavaria.","[Graefe, J.] Leibniz Inst Vegetables & Ornamental Crops, Grossbeeren, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Gemuse- und Zierpflanzenbau (IGZ),"Graefe, J (通讯作者)，Leibniz Inst Vegetables & Ornamental Crops, Grossbeeren, Germany.",Graefe@igzev.de,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,3,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62611-50-4,ACTA HORTIC,,,2017,1154.0,,,,,,121,128,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1154.16,0.0,,,8,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BK1IS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431840500016,0

This proposed analytic tool is based on a revised version of the 'ecosystem service cascade', which we propose to transform into an ecosystem service stairway model as a device to analyse political processes in ecosystem service construction and provision. We show that the key to understanding the politics of PES lies in the antagonistic processes between the different steps of the stairway. In particular, we show that the definition and mobilisation of the ecosystem service potential (ESP) is the stage where the most fundamental political decisions are made. Here, the role of intermediaries is particularly significant as they introduce their own conceptions of society-nature relations, which function as 'epistemic selectivities' in further defining and mobilising the ESP and in generating the resulting Ecosystem Services (ESS). We illustrate our main conceptual insights and evaluate the usefulness of our political ecosystem stairway model by applying it to two Latin American cases, one in Brazil and the other in Bolivia.

The idea of including information and communication technology in high schools has been converted into a European project named ICT science laboratory. The project's holder is private grammar school Gaudeamus in Osijek, while project partners are private grammar language school Pitagora in Split and Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences in Osijek. During the project, five educational trainings were held, which dealt with outcomes of learning, developing a curriculum and using multimedia content. Teachers from Gaudeamus and Pitagora participated in the aforementioned education. After the trainings, a study among teachers was conducted using a qualitative method - interview. Study was conducted in order to analyze attitudes of participants who took part in curriculum development based on learning outcomes including information and communication technology. Teachers from Split and Osijek, eight of them, took part in the study. Data was collected using a semi-structured interview in which the participants presented their attitudes and opinions concerning education, school systems in Croatia and application of sources and tools in their own teaching plans and programs.

Design/methodology/approach -To assess the sanitizing effects of microbial elimination by variety of vegetable, the samples were grouped into four different washing methods: control (no sanitizer), 100 ppm chlorine, 100 ppm electrolyzed water, and 200 ppm electrolyzed water after prewashing. Subsequently, quantitative microbiological experiments were conducted to assess aerobic mesophilic plate count (APC), coliform, E. coli, and Bacillus cereus, and sensory changes of the sanitized vegetables were tested. Thereafter, measurement of the sanitizing effects on bacterial reduction after inoculation with E. coli O157: H7 was conducted. Findings -The microbial levels of four types of vegetables ranged from 3.37 to 5.24 log CFU/g for APC, 2.41 to 5.57 log CFU/g for E. coli, 0.25 to 5.40 log CFU/g for coliform, and 0.83 to 5.44 log CFU/g for B. cereus. After three types of sanitizing treatments, microbial reduction effects showed 0.94-1.84 log CFU/g for APC, 0.56-1.00 log CFU/g for E. coli, 0.18-1.26 log CFU/g for coliform, and 0.56-1.23 log CFU/g for B. cereus (p < 0.05). In sensory evaluation, there were no significant differences in taste and flavor between with and without sanitizing treatments. Regarding bacterial reduction after inoculation with E. coli O157: H7, the microbial reduction on vegetables was shown to be in the range of 0.27-1.57 log CFU/g with 100 ppm sodium hypochlorite, 0.66-3.07 log CFU/g with 100 ppm electrolyzed water, and 0.79-2.55 log CFU/g with 200 ppm electrolyzed water. Chicory, cherry tomato, and spring onion showed significant reduction levels of E. coli O157: H7 after sanitation (p < 0.05). Originality/value -This study revealed that different sanitization methods are required for different types of vegetables. Electrolyzed water treatment (100 ppm) is a more effective and safe method of washing raw vegetables. Given that the main purpose of sanitizing fresh-cut produce is to maximally reduce microorganism levels, different methods of sanitizing fresh-cut produce with an adequate washing method should be used according to vegetable type.","[Ju, Se-Young] Dankook Univ, Yongin, South Korea; [Ko, Jin-Ju; Yoon, Hee-Sun; Seon, Su-Jin; Yoon, Yu-Ri; Lee, Da-In; Kim, So-Yeon; Chang, Hye-Ja] Dankook Univ, Cheonan, South Korea",Dankook University; Dankook University,"Chang, HJ (通讯作者)，Dankook Univ, Cheonan, South Korea.",hjc10@dankook.ac.kr,,,,,,,45,5,5,0,33,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The sensitivity level is evaluated by measuring the threshold of Acesulfame-K, while the fatigue effect is evaluated by measuring the accuracy level of evaluation through the time. The experiment was administered to six trained sensory panelists. Findings - The experiment result shows that each panelist has a different level of sensitivity and tendency in evaluating samples containing Acesulfame-K. Furthermore, by simulating the panelists' daily inspection, the fatigue effect is also found in one out of six panelists. The use of E-nose and E-tongue, may eliminate the subjectivity issue, supporting the development of human error-free quality system. Research limitations/implications - The research findings indicate the needs of human substitution-built into the quality system to avoid both of subjectivity and error judgment while defining the products quality. However, the small numbers of panelists as well as the unvalidated substitute instruments application in the target workcenter were the main limitation of this study. Human-independent quality system could be applied only when the instruments have been calibrated to human response in perceiving taste and odor. Originality/value - The research finding supports the theory of human panels' tradeoffs in a sensory analysis in terms of sensitivity level variance and fatigue.

Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from 220 senior consumers (50-70). A two-step clustering analysis was carried out on factor scores of perceived value and perceived risk. Discriminant analysis was then employed to verify the classification reliability, and analysis of variance was performed to profile the clusters on the basis of additional variables. Findings - Four distinctive profiles of FF senior consumers were identified. Significant differences were found to be attributed to personality traits. Interestingly, the Trustful enthusiasts and the Ambivalents consumers do not differ in their repurchase intention, despite a significant discrepancy in risk perception. Practical implications - The study is an opportunity to offer a segmentation of this attractive growing target of health-enhancing products. The typology can help the practitioners to find out a new valuable scope of messages to better communicate to elderly market. Originality/value - The research seeks to contribute to the existing knowledge on seniors' nutrition-related behavior, by proposing a segmentation still lacking in research works. Since FF perceived value appears to be multidimensional and not only utilitarian, the study provides a new insight into the experiential approach of health-enhancing eating. Also, it shows how the differences between FF consumers could be attributed to certain personal variables.","[Ravoniarison, Aina] Lumiere Lyon 2 Univ, COACTIS, Lyon, France",,"Ravoniarison, A (通讯作者)，Lumiere Lyon 2 Univ, COACTIS, Lyon, France.",a.ravoniarison@gmail.com,,,,,,,65,6,6,1,37,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

However, little is known of the buying behavior at the individual household level in terms of buying habits and consumption in these areas. The purpose of this paper is to determine to what extent other factors than access can account for the purchase of healthy food products, namely, fruits and vegetables. Design/methodology/approach - This paper proposes to partially fill this gap through a qualitative (n = 55) and quantitative (n = 512) study of those people who are in charge of their household purchases in two food deserts in the city of Montreal. Findings - Results show that geographical access to supermarkets is not the main factor fostering the purchase of healthy foods (fruits and vegetables). Indeed, food education (e.g. information, simple recipes, cooking classes), associated with a changing mediation process through product diversification (e.g. availability of local products in bulk) and supply (e.g. farmers) seems to be more significant. Research limitations/implications - Future studies could compare the results obtained through this study in different socio-demographic contexts. Longitudinal analyses could also increase the understanding of the social and commercial challenges. Originality/value - In contrast to previous studies, the results show that geographical access to supermarkets is not the main factor fostering the purchase of fruits and vegetables.

I solve two Bellman equations, for unburnt and for already burnt forest, to derive analytically tractable expressions for the total expected, spatially differentiated, asset value of the forest in each state assuming constant growth and forest loss rates over time. I derive the marginal expected discounted value loss when losing a small additional piece of forest, at any alternative site in the forest. Marginal forest value is found to increase when the risk of forest fire increases due to forest fragmentation when forest is lost locally; and also when forest dryness, affecting forest values negatively, increases upon forest fragmentation. Both forest fire risk and dryness serve as multipliers on the basic services return loss, both within and outside of the forest. Increased forest fire risk is found to reduce average rainforest value by reducing their future expected lifespans and current returns; but to increase marginal forest value by making primary forest loss avoidance more valuable. I calibrate the model including the impact of the forest fire risk component on forest value, with multipliers in a typical range 13-1.5.

Successful mentoring is a relationship between mentor and protege where both partners accomplish mutual correlational benefits. The conception of mentoring originated in ancient Greece, when Odysseus entrusted his friend Mentor to teach and protect his son Telemachus.(1) Since then mentoring models have evolved to have a significant impact on knowledge transfer and professional development. Throughout medieval times in some parts of the world continuation of knowledge transfer was constrained by established conservative doctrines and opposition of authorities to freedom of thought. 2 The evolution of economy from feudalism into industrialization changed ways of communication and accelerated knowledge transfer. The latest era of computerization has revolutionized sharing of knowledge through instant retrieval of information and evolution of mass media communication. Millennials embraced computers and it opened new opportunities for the technologically savvy younger generation to advance through hierarchal organizational structure. Reverse mentoring emerged as an open-minded mentoring model, where IT competent younger generation leaders contribute to relationship through reversed mentoring of older generation executives. The further advancement through natural development of mentoring relationship is a transition from a reverse model into a reciprocal one. New mentoring models and mentor/protege relationships are important part of changes in entrepreneurial climate and individual career development. Intergenerational knowledge transfer supports entrepreneurial strive to improve employee retention, excel in innovations and competitiveness, therefore increase enterprise's market share, and contribute to the accelerated economic growth. The purpose of the study is to analyze mentorship as part of entrepreneurial learning, especially in the context of multigenerational knowledge transfer. The additional aim of this paper is to compare different role of mentoring models in multigenerational relationships and how reciprocal model changes correlation benefits in a two-way mentoring relationship. Theoretical overview of two-way reciprocal mentoring relationship and correlation benefit findings in this paper confirm the hypotheses of positive overall effects to employees and to the overall prosperity of the company. Multigenerational knowledge transfer models have variations in different fields i.e. industry, government, academia and education; and is in need of further research.","[Tonkovic, Anka Masek; Cini, Vladimir] Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia; [Vlad, Walter Veckie] Unified Engn Corp CEO, Hamilton, ON, Canada",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Tonkovic, AM (通讯作者)，Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.",masek.tonkovic@gmail.com; veckie@gmail.com; cini@efos.hr,,,,,,,11,0,0,1,6,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,370,381,,,,,,12,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500035,0

Design/methodology/approach - The data were collected from 1,225 randomly selected consumers in Shandong Province, China using a choice experiment. The authors used the mixed logit model to determine consumer willingness to pay (WTP) for IMF profiles with different levels of five attributes: traceability information, brand, country of origin, place of sale and price. Findings - Results indicated that traceability information was more important than brand or country of origin for Chinese consumers. In terms of WTP for different levels of traceability information, grazing information was the most preferred by the respondents. The order of preference with regards to country of origin and brand attributes suggests that consumers prefer foreign milk powder to domestic products. The difference in consumer WTP between IMF sold in drugstores and in supermarkets is minimal. The higher the food safety risk perception, the higher the WTP for traceability information and the higher the WTP for foreign milk powder (brand or country of origin) compared with domestic products. In addition, the differences in the WTP of various risk perception groups between IMF sold in drugstores and in supermarkets are minimal. Originality/value - This study subdivides traceability information into three levels (i.e. cow grazing, IMF producing and IMF selling) based on supply chain processes. It then compares consumer preference for the traceability information attribute with those of other attributes, such as brand, country of origin and place of sale. This research is valuable to members of the academe, policy makers and food suppliers.","[Yin, Shijiu; Xu, Yingjun] Qufu Normal Univ, Sch Econ, Rizhao, Peoples R China; [Li, Ying; Chen, Mo] Qufu Normal Univ, Res Ctr Food Safety Cogovernance Shandong Prov, Rizhao, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yiqin] Qufu Normal Univ, Rizhao, Peoples R China",Qufu Normal University; Qufu Normal University; Qufu Normal University,"Yin, SJ (通讯作者)，Qufu Normal Univ, Sch Econ, Rizhao, Peoples R China.",ysjtougao@163.com,,,[71203122]; [21407090],;,The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of this study through the following: Project Nos 71203122 and 21407090.,,43,29,30,5,80,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Our empirical analysis produces two main insights of strong policy interest. First, commitment to a more stringent waste policy tends to increase illegal disposal of waste. Second, a nonlinear bell shaped relationship exists between the number of inspections and the quantity of illegal disposal.

Their conceptual frames avoid consideration of economic inequality and how it affects home ownership, energy efficiency investment, norms, practices, power relations and, consequently, energy use. This may have roots in a split between macroeconomics and sociology dating from the mid-20th century, while a focus on regular, everyday determinants of behavior was no doubt useful in the relatively egalitarian societies of the 1950s-1980s. But economic inequality has rapidly increased within high-income countries over the past 30-40 years, enabling high-wealth individuals' influence to grow. We argue this has decisive effects on the choices available to households in their energy behavior and discuss four ways it plays out: the negative effect of decreasing home-ownership on dwellings' thermal quality; fuel poverty; the influence of wealth distribution on carbon emissions; and gender-based wealth inequality. We argue that the macroeconomic issue of income inequality is a determinant of household energy consumption practices and, focusing on practice theory, we map out key dimensions in which it could be explicitly included in social science frameworks used to study household energy consumption.","[Galvin, Ray] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Sch Business & Econ, Inst Future Consumer Energy Needs & Behav, E ON Energy Res Ctr, Mathieustr 10, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Sunikka-Blank, Minna] Univ Cambridge, Dept Architecture, 1 Scroope Terrace, Cambridge, England",E-ON; RWTH Aachen University; University of Cambridge,"Galvin, R (通讯作者)，Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Sch Business & Econ, Inst Future Consumer Energy Needs & Behav, E ON Energy Res Ctr, Mathieustr 10, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.",rgalvin@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de; mms45@cam.ac.uk,"Galvin, Ray/AAC-3020-2022; Galvin, Ray/ABC-8642-2020","Galvin, Ray/0000-0001-9279-4263;",,,,,123,66,71,6,95,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

The stage structured model developed bundles the age classes found in age structured models into stage classes based on their level of maturity, but also the pattern according to which they are harvested. Two fleets, high sea and coastal vessels, harvest respectively the immature and mature stages. The maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is studied in light of both perfect and imperfect fishing selectivity. In addition, we analyse the biomass loss of a sharing rule where the high sea trawler fleet is granted a certain share of the harvested biomass.

Using a large sample of European SMEs, observed in the period 2001-2008, and adopting both parametric and non-parametric measures of efficiency, we find that the positive impact of longer lending relationships on efficiency decreases as indebtedness increases, suggesting that moral hazard problems may endanger firms' technical efficiency.","[Agostino, Mariarosaria; Ruberto, Sabrina; Trivieri, Francesco] Univ Calabria, Dept Econ Stat & Finance Giovanni Anania, Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy",University of Calabria,"Trivieri, F (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, Dept Econ Stat & Finance Giovanni Anania, Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy.",francesco.trivieri@unical.it,,"Ruberto, Sabrina/0000-0001-8110-5418",,,,,70,14,14,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

We apply this methodology to wind energy, which is one of the key technologies in climate change mitigation. Our results emphasize that, in particular, long-term relationships as measured by economic integration are key determinants of technological diffusion. Specific support measures are less relevant, at least to explain the extensive margin of diffusion. Our results also highlight that the scope of technological diffusion is much broader than what is suggested by the consideration of CDM projects alone, which are particularly focused on China and India. Finally, the network of technological diffusion inferred from our approach highlights the central role of European countries in the diffusion process and the absence of large hubs among developing countries.","[Halleck-Vega, Solmaria; Mandel, Antoine; Millock, Katrin] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Halleck-Vega, Solmaria; Mandel, Antoine] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Paris, France; [Millock, Katrin] CNRS, Paris, France",Paris School of Economics; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Mandel, A (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France.",antoine.mandel@univ-paris1.fr,"Millock, Katrin E/H-6194-2013","Millock, Katrin E/0000-0002-4213-9583; Halleck Vega, Solmaria/0000-0001-8354-0026",European Union [642018],European Union(European Union (EU)),The authors would like to thank the managing editor and two anonymous referees for their very helpful comments.

Central planning impeded the adaptation of agricultural practices to the local socialecological contexts and virtually eliminated self-accountability in agriculture. Focusing on contemporary Russia, the paper examines how the state currently influences farmers' land management and how this subtle mode of intervention aligns with the local context. Qualitative research in the Western Siberian Grain Belt reveals that the state-designed institutions guide land management in a politically desirable direction. They aim for virtually unlimited agricultural growth and largely misalign with the social-ecological conditions of grain farms.","[Griewald, Yuliana] Humboldt Univ, Div Resource Econ, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Griewald, Y (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Div Resource Econ, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",yullana.griewald@gmail.com,,,"German Government, Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01LL0906H]; Caroline von Humboldt programme by the Humboldt University of Berlin","German Government, Federal Ministry of Education and Research; Caroline von Humboldt programme by the Humboldt University of Berlin","This work was conducted as part of the research project SASCHA - Sustainable Land Management and Adaptation Strategies to Climate Change for the Western Siberian Grain Belt, funded by the German Government, Federal Ministry of Education and Research (funding reference 01LL0906H).

It has also garnered the attention of researchers and policymakers interested in its implications for firm and consumer behavior. However, few economic studies have explored the DTCA response to public policies, especially those mandating coverage of these products. We use detailed advertising expenditure data to assess if pharmaceutical firms increase their marketing efforts after the implementation of relevant state and federal health insurance laws. We focus on mental health parity statutes and related drug therapies-a potentially ripe setting for inducing stronger consumer demand. We find no clear indication that firms expect greater value from DTCA after these regulatory changes. DTCA appears driven by other considerations (e.g., product debut); however, it remains a possibility that firms respond to these laws through other, unobserved channels (e.g., provider detailing).","[Nathenson, Robert] Univ Penn, 3440 Market St Suite 560, Philadelphia, PA 19146 USA; [Richards, Michael R.] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Hlth Policy, 2525 West End,Suite 1275, Nashville, TN 37203 USA",University of Pennsylvania; Vanderbilt University,"Nathenson, R (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, 3440 Market St Suite 560, Philadelphia, PA 19146 USA.",robertna@upenn.edu; michael.r.richards@vanderbilt.edu,,"Nathenson, Robert/0000-0002-4419-6071",Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School,Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School,The authors thank Kantar Media for providing excellent data resources.

It concludes, first, that industrializing areas of the north emerged as a competitor for potential migrantscontributing relatively fewer migrants than predicted by the model. Rising wage rates in these areas appear to explain this phenomenon. Second, it argues that migration from urban centres in the west midlands and parts of the West Country, including Bristol, Birmingham, and Worcester, was substantially higher than predicted, and that this is largely explained by falling wage rates and the evolution of an increasingly efficient travel network. Third, for the counties within about 130 kilometres of the capital, this article suggests that migration followed the pattern described in the current literature, with London drawing large numbers of local women in particular. It also argues that these short-distance migrants came from a uniquely wide number of parishes, suggesting a direct rural-to-urban path.","[Crymble, Adam] Univ Hertfordshire, Hatfield, Herts, England; [Dennett, Adam] UCL, London, England; [Hitchcock, Tim] Univ Sussex, Brighton, E Sussex, England",University of Hertfordshire; University of London; University College London; University of Sussex,"Crymble, A (通讯作者)，Univ Hertfordshire, Hatfield, Herts, England.",adam.crymble@gmail.com,"Dennett, Adam/P-1681-2018","Dennett, Adam/0000-0001-8036-0185",British Academy/Leverhulme Trust [SG120758]; AHRC [AH/L006863/1] Funding Source: UKRI,British Academy/Leverhulme Trust; AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),"The authors would like to thank Louise Falcini, Hannah Fry, Ian Gazeley, Guy Abel, and Emma Dennett for support and advice on earlier drafts of this article, and to the audiences at the Long Eighteenth Century Seminar at the University of Oxford (2013), the European Social Science History Conference (2014), the GIS Research UK conference (2015), and the First International Conference on Geographies of Migration and Mobility (2016) for feedback.

Throttling the flow of merchandise through such places drove trade, and consequently economic growth, to those other places that enjoyed a convenient Legal Quay. In places without such quays, regulation and the farming of customs caused (and also facilitated) the suppression not only of international trade but also of domestic maritime trade. Though otherwise encouraged by Crown policy, entrepreneurial endeavour in Christchurch was stifled by customs regulation, in particular by the logistical burden introduced with remote record-keeping for coastal trade in the port books. The town seemed unable to break free of Southampton's controlling influence in order to realize its own apparent economic potential.","[Gadd, Stephen] Univ Winchester, Winchester, Hants, England",University of Winchester,"Gadd, S (通讯作者)，Univ Winchester, Winchester, Hants, England.",S.Gadd.12@unimail.winchester.ac.uk,"Gadd, Stephen/L-8515-2013","Gadd, Stephen/0000-0003-3060-0181",,,,,54,1,1,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

However, recent literature experiences in the field have challenged the inclusive character of the framework applications. In particular, the frameworks inability to incorporate the aggregated informal responses of people affected by changes in ecosystem service provisions has not been fully addressed. This limits the framework's validity in categorizing and disseminating information for addressing particular environmental challenges. Herein, we address this problem by analyzing a case study of deforestation and its impact on non-timber forest product collections by rural residents in Cambodia. We incorporate the concept of maladaptive coping strategies into the DPSIR framework and then further elaborate Ness et al.'s (2010) approach of merging the DPSIR framework with Hagerstrand's (2001) system of nested spatial domains. This conceptualizes the incorporation of the aggregated informal responses into the system, as exemplified in the case study.","[Ehara, Makoto] FFPRI, Ctr Int Partnerships & Res Climate Change, 1 Matsunosato, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058687, Japan; [Hyakumura, Kimihiko; Kurosawa, Kiyoshi] Kyushu Univ, Inst Trop Agr, Nishi Ku, 744 Motooka, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan; [Sato, Ren'ya] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Letters, Dept Human Geog, 1-5 Machikaneyama Cho, Toyonaka, Osaka 5608532, Japan; [Araya, Kunio] Kyushu Univ, Fac Social & Cultural Studies, Dept Environm Changes, Nishi Ku, 774 Motooka, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan; [Sokh, Heng] Forestry Adm, Inst Forest & Wildlife Res & Dev, 1019 Hanoi St, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Kohsaka, Ryo] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Aoba Ku, 468-1 Aramaki, Sendai, Miyagi 9800845, Japan; [Kohsaka, Ryo] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Seoul 151921, South Korea",Forestry & Forest Products Research Institute - Japan; Kyushu University; Osaka University; Kyushu University; Tohoku University; Seoul National University (SNU),"Ehara, M (通讯作者)，FFPRI, Ctr Int Partnerships & Res Climate Change, 1 Matsunosato, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058687, Japan.",makotoehara1@gmail.com; hyaku@agr.kyushu-u.ac.jp; rsato@let.osaka-u.ac.jp; kurosawa@agr.kyushu-u.ac.jp; araya@scs.kyushu-u.ac.jp; sokhhengpiny@yahoo.com; kohsaka@hotmail.com,"Kohsaka, Ryo/J-3022-2019; Ehara, Makoto/IUQ-5644-2023","Kohsaka, Ryo/0000-0001-6822-4340; Ehara, Makoto/0000-0003-0630-2758; Hyakumura, Kimihiko/0000-0001-9187-6435","JSPS KAKENHI Grant [JP16H07434, JP26-2255, JP16KK0053, JP17K02105]; Private Companies and Non-Governmental Organizations (Forestry Agency of Japan); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H05131, 17H01633, 16H01963, 16H07434, 15K03013] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI Grant(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Private Companies and Non-Governmental Organizations (Forestry Agency of Japan); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We are sincerely grateful to the villagers for their participation in this study.

Following this geographical consideration, knowledge diffusion seems to be homogeneous over the American territory, whereas research productivity is more heterogeneous: American research efficiency decreased of 7% points, due to some rural university localizations. Universities in urban areas favor educational quality through high student selection criteria, contrary to those located in more rural areas. Third, public universities present higher educational efficiency, in favoring educational quality over research productivity: the lesser research efficiency of public institutions comes from difficulties in the management of several campuses, by comparison with the private institutions which are all single-campus.

This study aimed to evaluate the socioeconomic value of the ecological restoration of a coastal wetland at a mass tourism destination on Costa Brava (Spain). To achieve this objective, 1) we developed a pooled model that combined travel costs and contingent behavior (TC + CB) to assess the influence of ecological restoration on the destination's recreational value, and 2) we performed a cluster analysis and post hoc comparisons after obtaining visitor profiles to understand how restoration influences tourists' contingent behavior. The results of the TC + CB model indicated that wetland recreational value is not significantly affected by restoration. The cluster analysis identified three visitor profiles (Indifference, Recreation and Preservation) with unique attitudes toward the wetland and its ecological restoration. These visitor profiles exhibit differences between actual and contingent visiting rates. Notably, the wetland's recreational value will be altered in opposite directions by ecological restoration. Visitors attracted by the natural setting will visit more often, whereas visitors who use the wetland for recreational purposes will tend to visit less often.","[Pueyo-Ros, Josep; Ribas, Anna; Fraguell, Rosa M.] Univ Girona UdG, Geog Dept, Girona, Spain; [Garcia, Xavier] UIC, Res Grp Regenerat Intermediate Landscapes, Barcelona, Spain",Universitat de Girona; Universitat Internacional de Catalunya (UIC),"Pueyo-Ros, J (通讯作者)，Pl Ferrater Mora 1, Girona 17071, Spain.",josep.pueyo@udg.edu,"Pueyo-Ros, Josep/AAH-4484-2019; Ribas Palom, Anna/G-9276-2015","Pueyo-Ros, Josep/0000-0002-1236-5651; Ribas Palom, Anna/0000-0001-5163-0561; Garcia, Xavier/0000-0002-1789-7403",EU LIFE Pletera; MINECO [CS02010-17488]; MECD funds [FPU13/00663],EU LIFE Pletera; MINECO(Spanish Government); MECD funds,"The authors are pleased to acknowledge their collaboration with Roser Pastor in the survey collection, which is funded by EU LIFE Pletera.

It has been largely ignored that individuals are driven by different motivational mechanisms to join boycotts and buycotts (punishment vs. reward of corporate behaviors), and thus, these mechanisms have disparate implications for the participating individual (e.g., high vs. low subjective costs because of a restriction in consumption habits). This paper fills this void and develops a framework suggesting that the extent to which consumers translate their concerns and obligations for society into a willingness to boycott and/or buycott is bounded by self-interest. Using a unique, representative sample of 1833 German consumers, this study reveals that the effects of environmental concerns and universalism on buycotting are amplified by hedonism, while the effects of social concern on buycotting and boycotting are attenuated by hedonism and simplicity, respectively. These results have far-reaching implications for organizations and policy planners who aim to change corporate behavior.","[Hoffmann, Stefan] Univ Kiel, Dept Mkt, Westring 425, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Balderjahn, Ingo; Peyer, Mathias] Univ Potsdam, Dept Mkt, August Bebel Str 89, D-14482 Potsdam, Germany; [Seegebarth, Barbara] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Mkt, Abt Terusalem Str 4, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany; [Mai, Robert] Grenoble Ecole Management, Dept Mkt, 12 Rue Pierre Semard, F-38000 Grenoble, France",University of Kiel; University of Potsdam; Braunschweig University of Technology; Grenoble Ecole Management,"Hoffmann, S (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Mkt, Westring 425, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",stefan.hoffmann@bwl.uni-kiel.de,"Hoffmann, Stefan/O-6170-2015; Seegebarth, Barbara/AAG-1485-2020; Seegebarth, Barbara/IST-6757-2023","Hoffmann, Stefan/0000-0001-5307-4060; Seegebarth, Barbara/0000-0002-0648-5788; Seegebarth, Barbara/0000-0002-0648-5788; Balderjahn, Ingo/0000-0003-3873-1223",,,,,64,34,38,7,74,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

In the conducted research, aimed to achieve business vision of this company, a four-phase decision making approach was defined. In the defined model, the situation SWOT analysis was used as the baseline in the analysis of the situation on the ground. Hence, four scenarios were generated by experts using the ANP method of multi-criteria decision making. The results obtained within the research identified the scenarios of the highest priority - sustainable development and environmental protection - which would enable the National Park Djerdap to achieve its vision.

Here, I apply a very simple model of global energy use to specify the dynamic characteristics of global-scale Energy Returns On Investment (EROIG). This suggests that the observed long-run relative growth rate of similar to 2.5% yr(-1) in global primary energy use is associated with an equilibrium return from infrastructure investments of 2:1, with returns accruing with a time constant of 40 years. The analysis also attempts to show how growth leads to reductions in the supply efficiency of energy, and how this decline is offset by increases in the efficiency with which industrial society can extract useful work from primary energy flows. This observed preservation of the overall energy efficiency of the global energy system implicates variations in the decay/decommissioning rate of infrastructure in observed 'long-wave' like variations in the relative growth rate of global primary energy use, and hence EROIG.","[Jarvis, Andrew] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster, England",Lancaster University,"Jarvis, A (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster, England.",a.jarvis@lancs.ac.uk,,"Jarvis, Andrew James/0000-0002-0700-0295",,,,,36,7,10,0,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

The insolvency of risk creators in case of such disasters may lead to insufficient compensation as well as to a dilution of preventive incentives. Insurance is a traditional instrument to address these problems, but is subject to limitations such as the lack of information by the insurers on the risk and limited insurance capacity. The risk-sharing agreement is an alternative which is widely used in high-risk sectors but it received relative little attention in academic literature. This paper analyses the potential of risk-sharing agreements in minimizing total social costs of environmental harmful activities, in comparison with insurance. The comparison shows the advantage of risk-sharing agreements in terms of less demanding information requirements, allowing for mutual monitoring and the potential to reduce administrative costs. However, the analysis also shows that a few conditions need to be met for such advantages to be materialized. This paper then discusses a typology of various risk-sharing agreements and illustrates the different categories with examples from the maritime and nuclear sectors. Based on these experiences, this paper explores the possibilities to expand risk-sharing agreements to other policy areas where environmental risks may emerge.","[Liu, Jing] Wuhan Univ, Res Inst Environm Law, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Faure, Michael] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Faure, Michael] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Wuhan University; Maastricht University; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Liu, J (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Res Inst Environm Law, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.",liujoyjing@163.com; michael.faure@maastrichtuniversity.nl,,"Faure, Michael/0000-0001-8756-7832",Humanities and Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China [14YJC820033]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities,"Humanities and Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","Funding was provide by the Humanities and Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China (Grant No. 14YJC820033), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities",,46,10,13,1,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Concern about impacts on wild land has resulted in legal challenges based on European Union (EU) law. This article analyses whether wild land can be protected from wind farms and the differences that the United Kingdom departure from the EU will make. It considers the concept of 'wild land' compared with 'wilderness', analyses the legal basis (if any) for wild land protection and examines potential impacts from wind farms. It highlights the significance of EU environmental law, particularly nature conservation and environmental assessment law, and analyses recent Scottish jurisprudence that has applied this. The role of the European Commission and Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) is emphasised as a key part of EU environmental law. The article asks whether relevant global and regional environmental agreements can effectively replace the content of the substantive law and context of the Commission and CJEU. Four environmental agreements and two related compliance procedures are briefly evaluated. The conclusion is that while EU law does not directly provide protection for wild land, it is considerably stronger than the international environmental agreements that may replace it.","[Marsden, Simon] Univ Stirling, Sch Law, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland",University of Stirling,"Marsden, S (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Sch Law, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",simon.marsden@stir.ac.uk,"Marsden, Simon/JXM-3168-2024",,,,,,90,4,4,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

The findings suggest that a more sophisticated form of choice set presentation, 3D film sequences, was outperformed by a more basic form of visualisation technique, the choice set information presented as 3D still-images. Also, we tested for the effect of the degree of 'expertise' of respondents and found that a more sophisticated form of choice set presentation (3D film sequences) led to a better comprehension of the choice set task only among 'expert respondents', i.e. respondents who in the past had made a housing investment decision or were presently making an actual house buying decision.","[Rid, Wolfgang] Univ Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany; [Rid, Wolfgang] Inst Urban Planning & Design, Res Grp City Mobil Energy, Keplerstr 11, D-70174 Stuttgart, Germany; [Rid, Wolfgang] Erfurt Univ Appl Sci, Erfurt, Germany; [Rid, Wolfgang] Fac Architecture & Urban Planning, Urban & Reg Econ, Schluterstr 1, D-99089 Erfurt, Germany; [Haider, Wolfgang] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Management, TASC I 8405,8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Ryffel, Andrea] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Planning Landscape & Urban Syst, HIL H 52-1, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Beardmore, Ben] Wisconsin Dept Nat Resources, Bur Environm Anal & Sustainabil, EA-7,POB 7921, Madison, WI USA",University of Stuttgart; Simon Fraser University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Rid, W (通讯作者)，Univ Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany.",wolfgang.rid@si.uni-stuttgart.de; ryffel@nsl.ethz.ch; alan.beardmore@wisconsin.gov,,"Beardmore, Ben/0000-0002-0276-427X",German Foundation for the Environment (DBU) [20001/225],German Foundation for the Environment (DBU),"The authors wish to thank the German Foundation for the Environment (DBU), who provided funding for this project (20001/225) and two anonymous reviewers for providing valuable comments on an earlier draft of this paper.",,87,25,28,5,28,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

However, avoiding investments in such companies might impose a cost on the investor in terms of foregone potentially profitable investments and reduced opportunities for portfolio diversification. We compare financial performance of investment portfolios with and without fossil fuel company stocks over the period 1927-2016. Contrary to theoretical expectations, we find that fossil fuel divestment does not seem to impair portfolio performance. These findings can be explained by the fact that, so far, fossil fuel company stocks do not outperform other stocks on a risk-adjusted basis and provide relatively limited diversification benefits. A more pronounced performance impact of divestment can be observed over short time frames and when applied to less diversified market indices.","[Trinks, Arjan; Scholtens, Bert; Mulder, Machiel; Dam, Lammertjan] Univ Groningen, Dept Econ Econometr & Finance, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Scholtens, Bert] Univ St Andrews, Sch Management, St Andrews KY16 9RJ, Fife, Scotland",University of Groningen; University of St Andrews,"Trinks, A (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Dept Econ Econometr & Finance, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",p.j.trinks@rug.nl,,"Mulder, Machiel/0000-0003-4175-6915; Trinks, Arjan/0000-0002-5542-1254; Scholtens, Bert/0000-0001-5774-5191",,,,,67,76,87,4,59,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

The policy implication of our result is that adequate health care service provision should be a key objective of governmental intervention in the SADC region.","[Kouassi, Eugene; Brou, J. M.

While previous works have suggested that road congestion can slow down regional development, the influence of air traffic delays on metro-level jobs has not been examined comprehensively. The present study uses a nine-year panel of quarterly data, which covers passenger airline traffic and delays at airports across urban areas in the United States. The panel also includes data on total and industry-specific employment at the metropolitan-area level. Our empirical estimates of the impact of air traffic on total employment are comparable to previously reported measures in the literature. However, we find that service-sector employment is less sensitive to air traffic than other studies suggested. We provide new evidence confirming that delays have a negative effect on employment, a finding that is robust to various specifications of our empirical model. Our results indicate that a 10 percent increase in the number of delayed flights leads to up to a 0.15 percent decrease in total and service-sector employment, a 0.47 percent decline in leisure and hospitality employment, and a 0.7 percent reduction in the employment level of goods-producing jobs.","[Lakew, Paulos Ashebir] Univ Calif Irvine, 4000 Anteater Instruct & Res Bldg, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Bilotkach, Volodymyr] Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England",University of California System; University of California Irvine; Newcastle University - UK,"Lakew, PA (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, 4000 Anteater Instruct & Res Bldg, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",plakew@uci.edu,,,,,,,35,6,6,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

The application of hydro-economic analysis to mining regions, however, is limited. This paper examines why this is the case and how to confront it. The paper focuses on identifying and describing features of large-scale mines and mine regions that are challenging to analyse such as: magnitude of capital involved, time-scale and remoteness of projects, inherent environmental risks, and strong negative perceptions about mining's impacts on water. These characteristics may limit the applicability of established hydro-economic concepts and methods, thus risk-based metrics are discussed as complementary tools. We also contend that further research and development in water-related ecosystem services should be a priority, in order to better quantify trade-offs between the economic benefits of water use by mining and competing users, including environmental flows. Case studies of mining regions in Chile, Madagascar and Sweden are summarised to illustrate some of the issues raised. While data limitations are an obstacle, new and extended case studies are required to explore how the challenges may be addressed.","[Ossa-Moreno, Juan; McIntyra, Neil; Keir, Greg] Univ Queensland, Ctr Water Minerals Ind, Sustainable Minerals Inst, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Ali, Saleem] Univ Delaware, Dept Geog, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Ali, Saleem] Univ Delaware, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Ali, Saleem] Univ Queensland, Sustainable Minerals Inst, Ctr Social Responsibil Min, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Smarts, James C.

The purpose of this paper is to characterize eight extended-spectrum-ss-lactamase (ESBL) and acquired AmpC ss-lactamase-producing E. coli isolates and virotypes associated, obtained from chicken and pork food samples in Puebla, Mexico. Design/methodology/approach Samples (36 from chicken and 10 from pork) were cultured on Levine agar plates supplemented with cefotaxime (2mg/L) for isolation of cefotaxime-resistant (CTXR) E. coli. CTXR-E. coli isolates were detected in 33 of 46 samples (72 percent), and one isolate/sample was characterized (28 from chicken and 5 from pork), for ESBL production, phylogenetic group, sequence typing, resistance and virulence genes by PCR and sequencing. Findings Results showed 16 ESBL-E. coli (35 percent) (12/16 belonging to phylogroup B1) and 8 CMY-2-E. coli (17 percent). ESBL detected were as follows (number of isolates): CTX-M-2 (8); CTX-M-1 (2); CTX-M-15 (1); SHV-2a (4) and TEM-52c (1). In total, 20 different sequence types (STs) were identified among the ESBL- or CMY-2-producing E. coli strains, which included four new ones. The CTX-M-15 -lactamase was detected in one E. coli ST617-ST10 Cplx-B1 strain that also carried ibeA gene. One CMY-2-positive strain of lineage ST224-B2 was detected and it carried the qnrA1 gene. Originality/value In this study, a ST131-based virotyping scheme for strains from food of animal origin was established since this kind of strains constitutes an important vehicle of virulent ESBL- and CMY-2-producing E. coli isolates, which could be transmitted to humans by direct contact or through the food chain.","[Barrios-Villa, Edwin; Cortes-Cortes, Gerardo; Lozano Zarain, Patricia; del Carmen Rocha-Gracia, Rosa] Benemerita Univ Autonoma Puebla, Ctr Invest Ciencias Microbiol, Posgrad Microbiol, Puebla, Mexico; [Romero-Romero, Sergio; Lara Flores, Norarizbeth] Benemerita Univ Autonoma Puebla, Fac Med, Biomed, Puebla, Mexico; [Estepa, Vanesa; Somalo, Sergio; Tones, Carmen] Univ La Rioja, Area Bioquim & Biol Mol, Logrono, Spain",Benemerita Universidad Autonoma de Puebla; Benemerita Universidad Autonoma de Puebla; Universidad de La Rioja,"Rocha-Gracia, RD (通讯作者)，Benemerita Univ Autonoma Puebla, Ctr Invest Ciencias Microbiol, Posgrad Microbiol, Puebla, Mexico.",rochagra@yahoo.com,"Romero, Sergio Romero/AAG-3508-2021; Cortés-Cortés, Gerardo/AGB-5050-2022; Romero, Sergio Romero/AAG-8116-2020; Torres, Carmen/C-9027-2013","Romero, Sergio Romero/0000-0003-2144-7912; Romero, Sergio Romero/0000-0003-2144-7912; Estepa, Vanesa/0000-0003-0023-3069; Barrios-Villa, Edwin/0000-0002-7864-1292; LOZANO-ZARAIN, PATRICIA/0000-0002-1550-4338; Torres, Carmen/0000-0003-3709-1690; Rocha Gracia, Rosa del Carmen/0000-0002-0456-8264","VIEP of the Benemerita Universidad Autonoma de Puebla [ROGR/NAT17-G]; CONACYT Mexico [178942]; CONACYT [411957, 233611]",VIEP of the Benemerita Universidad Autonoma de Puebla; CONACYT Mexico(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); CONACYT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)),"This work was supported by the VIEP of the Benemerita Universidad Autonoma de Puebla (ROGR/NAT17-G) and for CONACYT Mexico (reference 178942).

Design/methodology/approach - A sample of 221 wine consumers from two Slovenian wine regions with contrasting wine-related and social specificities responded to an online questionnaire. Besides the wine-related consumer behaviour variables, the questionnaire contained CR, regional identity and consumer perceived value measurements, based on adapted CETSCALE, regional identity and PERVAL scales. The scales were validated, and structural equation modelling was used to evaluate the relationships between the constructs. Findings - Perceived value of wine was found to consist of three dimensions: emotional-social, quality-price and terroir, which differ from those previously observed among wine consumers from the USA. Regional identity was found to be a direct antecedent of CR, and CR directly affects all three dimensions of perceived value of wine; these findings were evident in the original model and in both studied wine regions. Research limitations/implications - Future research should extend the model to include other possible antecedents of CR and study its effects on different consequences, especially purchasing intent. Future studies would benefit by adding more indicators into scales to measure CR and regional identity to improve the model fit. Originality/value - This study contributes to a better understanding of perceived value of wine and extends the current knowledge of how social and psychological phenomena interact when evaluating wine. The results herein should enable marketers to develop more sophisticated positioning strategies and support their decision making for an appropriate market approach.","[Bizjak, Sandra Pestar; Hristov, Hristo; Kuhar, Ales] Univ Ljubljani, Biotech Fac, Dept Anim Sci, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Kosmerl, Tatjana] Univ Ljubljani, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Biotech Fac, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana; University of Ljubljana,"Bizjak, SP (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljani, Biotech Fac, Dept Anim Sci, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",sandra@santei.si,"Hristov, Hristo/AAA-4044-2020","Hristov, Hristo/0000-0002-5088-9747",,,,,37,11,13,4,42,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

One of the most common measures in determining the level of business operations success is certainly achieving a satisfactory level of profit (profitability), since it represents one of fundamental managerial problems. Equally, the achieved profit still represents a dominant economic category used by external and internal users in the decision-making process, especially when it comes to SMEs. However, it is justified to expect that the level of achieved profit determined by using the model of accounting profit is different from its level determined by using the model of economic profit. While the model of accounting profit is ex-post oriented and does not include the cost of capital, the model of economic profit is ex-ante oriented and includes the cost of capital. Accordingly, the aim of this paper is to analyze the achieved profit of a small family company within the dairy industry in the Croatian Zagorje area by implementing both the model of accounting profit and the model of economic profit in order to define their specific differences and to perceive their value for external and internal users. For the purposes of this paper, scientific and professional references, financial statements and available additional information were analyzed. Based on the results obtained from the qualitative and quantitative analyses of available information conducted and by using methods of deduction and induction, analysis and synthesis and comparisons, it can be concluded that the model of economic profit is justifiably put in the superior position in relation to the model of accounting profit. Also, the research results showed that there was a need for caution in using such information since it can undoubtedly have an influence on determining future success potential of a company.","[Ermacora, Renata] Univ Appl Sci Baltazar Zapresic, Vladimira Novaka 23, Zapresic 10290, Croatia",,"Ermacora, R (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci Baltazar Zapresic, Vladimira Novaka 23, Zapresic 10290, Croatia.",remacora@bak.hr,,,,,,,7,1,1,0,1,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,996,1004,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900105,0

One of these alterations in food consumption patterns is an increase in desire for fast-food consumption, which has been associated with poor diet quality. In order to analyze consumers' food consumption behaviors, it is necessary to account for psychological factors (e.g. attitudes) that shape behaviors. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to explore influencing factors on the attitudes of consumers in Isfahan City toward fast-food consumption, so as to understand why consumers use fast-food despite widespread knowledge of the negative health consequences. Design/methodology/approach - The predominant paradigm of the present study was quantitative, in that it was a correlational survey. The population of this study consisted of consumers who lived in Isfahan city in June 2015. A total sample of 350 people was selected using convenience sampling. Data were collected through a face-to-face interview with the consumers using a researcher-made questionnaire. Analysis was conducted using SPSS (V20) and AMOS (V20) software and a set of correlation and differential tests. Findings - The results revealed that health consciousness and trust are the main effective factors on the attitudes of the respondents. The results also revealed that the elder and married respondents have more positive attitudes toward fast-food consumption. Originality/value - It is worth mentioning that fast-food has become an important part of the Iranian diet. These findings have both academic and policy implications. The results showed that the need for much more consumer education regarding fast-food and mass media could effectively be used. Further, the government should support and subsidize fast-food restaurants so that they may produce healthier food options.","[Ghoochani, Omid M.; Torabi, Razieh; Hojjati, Mohammad; Ghanian, Mansour] Ramin Agr & Nat Resources Univ Khuzestan, Ahvaz, Iran; [Kitterlin, Miranda] Florida Int Univ, Chaplin Sch Hospitality & Tourism Management, Miami, FL 33199 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida International University,"Hojjati, M (通讯作者)，Ramin Agr & Nat Resources Univ Khuzestan, Ahvaz, Iran.",Hojjati@ramin.ac.ir,"Kitterlin-Lynch, Miranda/ABB-5518-2021; Ghanian, Mansour/V-1072-2018; Hojjati, Mohammad/AAD-4751-2021","Ghanian, Mansour/0000-0002-8428-1107; M.

The research was dynamic and concerned the verification of the research hypothesis assuming that the level of housing conditions of the population in rural areas in Poland in the voivodship system is equalizing. In order to assess the level and changes of the studied complex phenomenon, one of the relative taxonomy methods was used, in dynamic terms, which is based on the construction of a medium-based synthetic meter. This method not only allows you to classify units in a given period but above all, it allows to observe changes in the value of a synthetic variable over time, wherein the construction of a synthetic feature is based on the relativistic values of diagnostic features. The research was based on data from the Local Data Bank of the Central Statistical Office in Poland. Only in the group of provinces where housing conditions in rural areas at the beginning of the research period (in 2004) were assessed as high compared to other provinces (relative class I) some convergence in the studied phenomenon in 2004-2016 was observed. Among 8 provinces, which in 2004 were characterized by a relatively low and average lower level of housing conditions in rural areas (relative classes II and III), we can talk about increasing the disproportions within the classes distinguished in 2004-2016. At the same time, however, the synthetic assessment of housing conditions in 5 provinces from classes II and III improved and approached the level of provinces from class I in the analyzed period and only only in 3 provinces this rating has deteriorated. The results of the research allowed only a partial confirmation of the research hypothesis.","[Glowicka-Woloszyn, Romana; Kozera, Agnieszka; Stanislawska, Joanna; Woloszyn, Andrzej] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Poznan, Poland; [Rosa, Anna] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Rural & Agr Dev, Warsaw, Poland",Poznan University of Life Sciences; Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Rural & Agricultural Development PAS,"Glowicka-Woloszyn, R (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Life Sci, Poznan, Poland.",roma@up.poznan.pl,"Kozera, Agnieszka/ABE-9677-2021","Glowicka-Woloszyn, Romana/0000-0002-1039-3261; Kozera, Agnieszka/0000-0002-6370-0026; ROSA, ANNA/0000-0002-0247-6593",,,,,13,0,0,0,1,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9984-48-294-1,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2018,49.0,,,,,,232,240,,10.22616/ESRD.2018.140,0.0,,,9,Development Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO1ZQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503493500028,0

Design/methodology/approach The authors empirically investigated what drives consumers to purchase organic food using structural equation modelling in AMOS. The research was based on an in-person survey carried out on a convenient sample of 411 primary household shoppers in Croatia. Findings The study was able to capture not only the influence of inherent factors in TPB and the extension variable (all proposed constructs were shown to have a significant positive influence on intention, and intention had a significant positive influence on actual behaviour), but also the indirect and mediation effects of the variables within the model, which explain 87 per cent of the variance in intention and 21 per cent of the variance in actual behaviour. Originality/value This study provides empirical evidence of the role that desired uniqueness plays in a situation involving the purchase of organic food and responds to the requests of many researchers to investigate beyond intention and to try to identify what influences actual behaviour. This study proposes a new way of measuring actual purchases by asking a respondent to consider their actual purchase in different product categories. Furthermore, this research proposes measuring intention as a latent variable that consists of the variable willingness to pay more as well as the commitment to the decision regardless of any perceived obstacles.","[Ham, Marija; Pap, Ana] Univ Osijek, Dept Mkt, Osijek, Croatia; [Stanic, Marina] Univ Osijek, Dept Management Org & Entrepreneurship, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek; University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Pap, A (通讯作者)，Univ Osijek, Dept Mkt, Osijek, Croatia.",mham@efos.hr; anapap@efos.hr; marina@efos.hr,"Stanić, Marina/ABG-1001-2021; Pap, Ana/AAA-6356-2020; Pap, Ana/X-4796-2019; Ham, Marija/AAC-3577-2022","Stanić, Marina/0000-0002-3835-6358; Pap, Ana/0000-0003-4927-5518; Ham, Marija/0000-0003-4390-2218",,,,,46,36,36,4,35,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Previous research reveals that a close relationship exists between socio-spatial stratification and migration patterns but, despite the widespread nature of suburbanization in the post-socialist countries, this relationship has been insufficiently studied. Aim of the present study was to examine the characteristics of the usual residents and suburban in-migrants in the Riga metropolitan area (RMA). The analysis was based on individual level data from the recently released 2011 census round. These statistics are the most reliable data source of population composition in the post-socialist countries. The characteristics of population subgroups of the inner and the outer suburban ring of the RMA, which are with and without migration experience, were analysed using binary logistic regression models. The study has found some evidence of differential mobility behaviour regarding individual socio-demographic characteristics and geographic features. Thus, the research contributes to a better understanding of post-socialist suburbanization by clarifying the population subgroups behind the shift to the suburbs.","[Krumins, Janis; Skadins, Toms] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Krumins, J (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,,"Krumins, Janis/0000-0002-9750-0313","National Research Program Project 5.2.4 Renewal of society through reducing the risk of depopulation, through development and strengthening links with the diaspora for the transformation of the Latvian economy","National Research Program Project 5.2.4 Renewal of society through reducing the risk of depopulation, through development and strengthening links with the diaspora for the transformation of the Latvian economy","The research was supported by National Research Program Project 5.2.4 Renewal of society through reducing the risk of depopulation, through development and strengthening links with the diaspora for the transformation of the Latvian economy.",,26,0,0,0,5,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9984-48-294-1,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2018,49.0,,,,,,324,331,,10.22616/ESRD.2018.150,0.0,,,8,Development Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO1ZQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503493500038,0

Despite favorable agro-ecological conditions for the production of most vegetable species, the current production of vegetables is insufficient and usually price uncompetitive compared to imported vegetables. On the other hand, export of domestic fresh and processed vegetables is small in quantity and value. Inadequate production is the result of fragmented areas, unregulated manufacturing infrastructure, lack of heating and irrigation systems and inadequate storage facilities. Vegetables in the Republic of Croatia is produced on about 40.116 ha, which is 4,7 % of utilized agricultural area. The process of restructuring the entire economy in the 1990s was parallel to the process of opening the market, which resulted in the growth of total demand and increased demand for vegetables and ultimately by the growth of imports. Tomato production in Croatia follows negative trends in vegetable production. The aim of the paper was to present the trends in production and foreign trade of tomato in the Republic of Croatia based on analyzed data on the production of vegetables and tomatoes and to provide suggestions for improving the situation in current terms of global market (joining EU, loss of former markets etc.). The Food and Agriculture Organization Statistical Database (FAOStat) is used in the paper on market indicators in the European Union and the Republic of Croatia. In last 10 years, production of tomatoes oscillates a lot and amounts 30.355 t on the 575 ha in average. In 2013 exports of tomatoes participate less than 5 % in imported amounts. Croatia has the potential to be competitive on European market, but it is necessary to increase the average production area, encourage application of irrigation and drainage systems, increase the share of tomato production in greenhouses and to invest more in additional training of producers.","[Loncaric, Ruzica; Sudaric, Tihana; Deze, Jadranka] Fac Agr, Dept Agroecon, Vladimira Preloga 1, Osijek 31000, Croatia",,"Loncaric, R (通讯作者)，Fac Agr, Dept Agroecon, Vladimira Preloga 1, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",rloncaric@pfos.hr; tsudaric@pfos.hr; jdeze@pfos.hr,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,8,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,575,581,,,,,,7,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900060,0

A number of stakeholder groups are important for the success of this form of education. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to examine young adults' and parents' opinions of secondary school food education. Design/methodology/approach An online survey was administered to 1,086 respondents drawn from a commercial research panel. Findings In total, 50-60 per cent of all respondents agreed that food education should be compulsory for years seven to ten and 31-32 per cent of respondents agreed that it should be compulsory for years 11 and 12. Almost 69 per cent suggested one to three hours per week for food education. More than 75 per cent of respondents agreed that there should be a non-compulsory food and nutrition subject for year 11 and 12 students and believed that this subject would help students to develop their food-related knowledge and skills. Practical implications There is a gap between parents' and young adults' views of school food education and what is actually practiced in Australian secondary schools. Obtaining their opinions in future food-related education and policy reforms could help design and deliver food education to better meet the expectations of its recipients: students and their families.

Design/methodology/approach Considering that the objective is to evaluate the export competitiveness of Italian roasting firms, the author chooses positive and ex-post indicators, combined in a multidimensional and a multivariable framework. The two dimensions of competitiveness implemented are competitive performance and competitive potential; the author used four indices to evaluate the first dimension (export market share, net export share, net export index, revealed comparative advantage) and three indices for the second dimension (unit export price, relative quality index, relative export growth). Findings The evolution of the international context, with the emergence of new competitors and the spread of coffee consumption worldwide, creates new opportunities but also new challenges for Italian companies. In fact, both competitive performance and competitive potential have been worsening since the second half of the early twenty-first century because of the lack of innovation. A mix of external and internal factors explain this lack. Practical implications In order to recover their international competitiveness, firms should leverage on the combination of traditional elements-such as Made in Italy effect and the rich technical know-how, depending on their long tradition in the espresso coffee market niche-with innovative elements, depending on new marketing skills and competences; these new elements could be developed internally or, most fruitfully, acquired externally, through collaboration with other firms. In this way, Italian businesses could improve the relative quality perceptions of their offering. Social implications Coffee roasting industry in Italy is a significant component of the Italian economic system and it contributes to the development of the Made in Italy abroad. Therefore, an improvement of its export competitiveness could be beneficial to the whole domestic market. Originality/value This paper constitutes the first attempt to study the evolution of the coffee industry in regards to the international competitive landscape. This is quite surprising, considering that coffee is one of the main segments of the food and beverage industry; it is the second most important commodity exchanged worldwide after oil and the third most popular beverage after water, tea and carbonated beverages. Then, the analysis of export competitiveness is developed combing two main research streams: the industrial organization literature and the strategic management literature.

Among the other constraints, lack of access to sufficient financing especially in developing countries, has been identified as a major bottleneck in realising the potential of this sector. Odisha is one of the top ten States in creation of job (20,839 person in 2006-07 and 107,011 in 2014-15) by MSMEsector although it is positioned at 11 in respect of number of MSME units set up as compared to other States. Credit flow to the MSME sector declined during recent period in the state (41%) as against an increasing trend in the country (48%) (RBI Report 2015). This brought to the forefront to study about the demand side issues for accessing institutional finance by MSME because of banks are reluctant to provide credit to this sector. The study is conducted in Bhubaneswar city (No 1 smart city in India) of Odisha and chosen two clusters through cluster sampling technique. The total of 60 enterprises has been drawn randomly for the demand side analysis. To collect the data Personal interview method is used by taking semi structured questionnaire schedule for sample entrepreneurs. Factor analysis with rotate varimax normalization method is used to find out the major constraints faced by the MSMEs and to rank their problem, is presented through an index. It identified six major factors among its interest rate is the number one constraint in the demand side which impedes the growth of MSMEs not only is the financial problem but also in addition to that competition from well-running firm and lack of Labour are the major problem faced by the sample entrepreneurs.

Empirical findings based on ARDL bound test approach confirms the existence of short run and long run association of core inflation with macroeconomic variables.

The demand for the workforce is enjoyed by employees whose wages grow faster thanks to that. What is the situation like regarding employee benefits? The aim of this paper is to analyse the development of the costs of social benefits. The presented study also presents the level of satisfaction with the offer of employee benefits in the Czech Republic. In order to determine the level of job satisfaction, the survey (2013, 2015 and 2017) has been carried out repeatedly - the Czech version of the Employment Satisfaction Questionnaire. The results confirm the fact that overall job satisfaction in the Czech Republic has been at a very low level for a long time. On average the employee benefits determinant has a small increase in satisfaction, although the cost of spending on them is decreasing slightly. In this area, we can see a place for businesses to fight for a skilled workforce.","[Sokolova, Marcela; Mohelska, Hana] Univ Hradec Kralove, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove,"Sokolová, M (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.",marcela.sokolova@uhk.cz; hana.mohelska@uhk.cz,"Sokolová, Marcela/B-3452-2012; Mohelska, Hana/F-9896-2019","Sokolová, Marcela/0000-0002-0641-7750; Mohelska, Hana/0000-0003-0441-0712","University of Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic [6/2017]","University of Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic","The paper was written with the support of the specific project 6/2017 grant Determinants affecting job satisfaction granted by the University of Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic and thanks to help of student Eliska Conkova.",,6,0,0,3,7,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-6059,2464-6067,978-80-7435-701-5,HRADEC ECON DAYS,,,2018,8.0,,2,,,,295,302,,,,,,8,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL3AA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000449443600029,0

The structure of the plant seeds that must be known is the seed as a reproduction tool, the spread, and the survival of a plant. In addition, for seed plants, seeds are the beginning of new plant life outside the parent.Results showed that mangosteen seeds had polyembryonic properties which had more than one embryo scattered around the embryo axis. The structure of the mangosteen seeds consists of testa, endosperm and embryo axis and after the seeds are planted for 7 days there appears a red line (Micropyle) from the shaft of the embryo to exit the seeds which will become buds. Mangosteen seed germination begins with the appearance of red colored buds that come out randomly around the surface of the mangosteen seeds sourced from the embryo axis, then after a few days red plumules appear and are followed by the appearance of radicles.","[Suhendra, Dede; Mustamu, Novilda Elizabeth] High Sch Agr Sci, Labuhan Batu Rantau Prap, Sumatera Utara, Indonesia",,"Suhendra, D (通讯作者)，High Sch Agr Sci, Labuhan Batu Rantau Prap, Sumatera Utara, Indonesia.",Dede_SuhendraSKB@yahoo.com,"Mustamu, Novilda Elizabeth/AAB-9001-2021; Suhendra, Dedy/J-2803-2012","Suhendra, Dede/0000-0003-0429-3106; Mustamu, Novilda Elizabeth/0000-0003-2800-8920",,,,,10,0,0,0,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1755-1307,,,IOP C SER EARTH ENV,IOP Conf.

It shows that economic spaces are shaped by notions of particular space-time held by historical actors and by imaginations of their past and future fictional spaces. The case study of colonial period South Asia examines how financial accounting and other measurements were co-opted to give form to future fictional expectations. South Asian economic spaces are shown to be the locus for control and dominance of future economic relationships, which were visualized in particular ways by the colonial rulers. A conclusion reached is that economic spaces are not just enclosed spaces within borders where economic activity occurs shaped by the dominant culture and economy of a state. The economic spaces in colonial India were sites of economic conflict and violence, where contesting notions of economic time collided, and where widely contrasting economic futures were imagined. Indian nationalists looked into the past to spur their imagination of a different future for India. In fact, the conflict or violence that was part of the recasting of India's national economic space was not entirely between racial groups (European colonists and native Indians) or strictly between economic classes (bourgeoisie upper castes and proletariat lower castes). Contrary expectations amongst the nationalists themselves are apparent. The process of imagination reveals the ensemble of cultural, social, and technical practices that actors used to give form to fictional expectations of the future and the spatialisation of economic spaces.","[Velkar, Aashish] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Velkar, A (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England.",,,"Velkar, Aashish/0000-0003-3885-8558",,,,,47,0,0,0,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",0743-4154,,978-1-78756-423-7; 978-1-78756-424-4,RES HIST ECON THOUGH,,,2018,36.0,,B,,,,109,128,,10.1108/S0743-41542018000036B008,0.0,,,20,Economics; History Of Social Sciences; Philosophy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Philosophy,BQ3WW,,"Green Accepted, Bronze",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000588194300008,0

Firstly, the paper suggests a retrospective analysis of accounting standards development in Russia. Secondly, the main problems of IFRS implementation in Russia are being discussed. The main aim of the paper is to show how the transition to IFRS process in Russia run and suggest methods to improve it. The paper contributes to the question if the convergence of Russian Accounting Standards (RAS) with IFRS affected the financial reporting quality of listed firms in Russia and what was the historical influence on the quality of reporting. Since the paper is devoted to the transition of the accounting system in Russia to IFRS, it looks at the history, approaches and teaching of IFRS in Russian Federation in order to provide a broader international perspective of this important arena that shapes the view of accounters. Besides, the paper illuminates the most of the problems, connected with the transition process in Russia. It is done by describing the overall context of accounting education and experience in implementing of IFRS within the contemporary Russian accounting system and the system of higher education. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the globalization causes the growing interdependence of the countries around the world and paper contributes to solving the existing problems caused by transition and suggesting ways to improve this process.","[Vysotskaya, Anna; Mikhalkina, Elena] Southern Fed Univ, Rostov Na Donu, Russia",Southern Federal University,"Vysotskaya, A (通讯作者)，Southern Fed Univ, Rostov Na Donu, Russia.",Vysotskaya.ab@gmail.com; e_mikhalkina@mail.ru,"Vysotskaya, Anna/F-9524-2018; Mikhalkina, Elena V/L-9961-2013","Vysotskaya, Anna/0000-0002-5526-5634;",,,,,40,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,567,579,,,,,,13,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Law",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies; Government & Law,BP1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540727600065,0

For this purpose, the Sortino, UPR and Omega coefficients calculated for companies operating on the market in the years 2007-2017 were used. Selected entities have over 90 % share in the WIG-food index. The choice of effectiveness measures was dictated by the definition of risk often identified by investors with a loss. However, the period of research covers periods of worse and better stock market conditions, which is why it was decided for the years 2007-2017. For comparison purposes, these measures were also calculated for the following indices: WIG-food and WIG. The second index was included in the research to present the surveyed industry against the background of the entire exchange market. The calculations were based on daily percentage price changes. Basic measures of descriptive statistics were determined. The obtained values indicate the lack of normality of the rates of return, which eliminates the classic measures of investment efficiency. The results show that the capitalization of companies is important from the point of view of stock exchange investors. It determines the rankings created on the basis of performance indicators. However, closer research on the statistical properties of the measurements used shows that capitalization is important, but there must be other determinants. On the basis of the obtained results, it can be additionally stated that the leaders of the food market have also turned out to be attractive to investors on the entire stock exchange.","[Zebrowska-Suchodolska, Dorota; Karpio, Andrzej] Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Zebrowska-Suchodolska, D (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Warsaw, Poland.",,"Żebrowska-Suchodolska, Dorota/N-8072-2019","Żebrowska-Suchodolska, Dorota/0000-0003-1230-6413; Karpio, Andrzej/0000-0002-8826-8567",,,,,6,0,0,0,0,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9984-48-294-1,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2018,49.0,,,,,,196,203,,10.22616/ESRD.2018.136,0.0,,,8,Development Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO1ZQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503493500024,0

Although not-for-profit agencies cannot directly control what a person eats, they can influence the supply side of the obesity epidemic by incentivizing food retailers to open stores in regions of the US where food deserts exist. An incentive contract design dependent upon performance and resulting health benefit is presented for food retailers to reduce food deserts in the US. A principal-agent framework is used to capture the competing interests and moral hazard from the contracting mechanism. Optimization models are developed to determine the most effective and equitable resource allocations from the initiative given a target reduction in obesity rate or a set budget, while determining the optimal subsidy these agencies should offer to food retailers to incentivize operation in certain counties. These subsidies are designed to create financially viable conditions for food retailers to offer high quality, healthy food alternatives. The impact of retailer location on obesity is based on estimates of marginal effect on obesity rate. Given an example initiative in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia and surrounding counties, the overall county-wide obesity rate would decrease by 1.17% with a fixed budget of $400M. Sensitivity analysis on the reduction in obesity is performed for varying total budget amounts. This incentive contract design strategy is a positive step toward ensuring that the underserved US population has better access to healthy foods while helping solve the obesity epidemic.

Given limited REDD+ funds and uncertain returns from alternative land uses, this paper estimates the minimum incentive payment Acre's government would have to pay forest landowners in each of its 22 municipalities to ensure forest conservation. Despite lower profits but with lower conversion costs and more stable returns over time relative to corn and coffee production, cattle pasture generates the highest returns in 19 municipalities. Municipalities are ranked according to their relative policy costs, a ranking which is compared to the distribution of forest carbon stocks across Acre. Finally, the relative cost per tonne of carbon is derived, which enables the identification of a group of 13 municipalities with the greatest potential for 'carbon bang' for a given 'buck'.

Although language has long garnered interest in the study of ethnicity and nationalism, how language becomes standardized has yet to be offered. In this article, I argue that the acquisition of the printing press is critical to explaining the occurrence and variation of standardization. Using the first publication of vernacular dictionaries as a proxy for standardization, I present a systematic investigation of the standardization process for 171 ethnic groups in Europe from 1400-2000 ce. Empirical tests come from an original data set that collects information on political, economic, and social dimensions. Findings from event history models show that (1) printing press adoption is positively and significantly correlated with vernacular dictionaries; and (2) early adopters are more likely to standardize vernaculars than latecomers.","[Sasaki, Yu] Univ Tokyo, Inst Adv Studies Asia, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Sasaki, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Inst Adv Studies Asia, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",ys253@uw.edu,"Sasaki, Yu/AAZ-4016-2020","Sasaki, Yu/0000-0002-4069-5105",,,,,114,4,5,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-0507,1471-6372,,J ECON HIST,J.

We conduct a meta-analysis including 23 studies on coffee and cocoa plantations over a 26 year period. Our results show that, contrary to common perceptions, profitability and cost-efficiency are higher for small-scale shaded systems. Despite the lower yields for shaded systems, the lower costs per area and higher price per kilogram of coffee or cocoa causes shaded systems to perform better financially. This finding shows that the traditional indicator 'yield' is an inaccurate measure of financial performance when studying diversified systems, and that the more detailed indicators as net revenue or benefit-cost ratio should be used instead. Few studies specifically reported on the relationship between biodiversity and financial performance, providing divergent results, yet various papers showed a promising optimum relationship for intermediate levels of shade. Because shaded systems are known to correlate positively with biodiversity; we postulate that they can offer competitive business opportunities for small-scale farmers, while also contributing to biodiversity conservation. Still, there is a pressing need for multidisciplinary studies to quantify financial and biodiversity performance simultaneously, and to identify opportunities for scaling up shaded systems.

This paper provides a mass-evacuation strategy using public transportation before the strike of a hurricane. The assumptions made are that the evacuation zones, shelter locations, and the time of strike of the hurricane are pre-determined. The evacuation operations commence when the warnings are issued and end when the hurricane strike is predicted to occur. We propose a multi-stage approach. At the first stage is the planning framework, where pickup locations are determined and assigned to shelters, and an initial set of routes is generated along these locations. This is done by weighing each location based on the accumulated demand, and favoring multiple routes to pass through a location with higher demand. In the next stage, each route is assigned a trip number such that 1) routes with higher demand require more trips, and 2) two successive trips to a route are spaced evenly. A simulation tool has been developed to model the dispatching of the given number of buses, stochastic arrival of evacuees, queueing effects at the pickup locations, and the transportation of evacuees to the safety regions. The results from the simulation presented in this paper serve as an evaluation tool for a route design, and a local search heuristic is proposed to effect positive changes in the route design.

For each personality trait, a mixed-mode latent-class cluster model was estimated, accounting for that fact that the indicators can have ordinal, cardinal or nominal meaning. Most LC models ignore these distinctions. Our model also allows the scores on questions to be correlated, even after conditioning on class (typically assumed away). Then, a latent-class choice model of trail attributes and companion's ability was estimated using the choice-pair data, with the estimated latent personality-traits as covariates. Three choice classes are identified and the odds of being in each varies by personality: estimated choice probabilities and WTP estimates vary significantly and substantially by class and personality type.

The survey's findings show that recognition of the EU as a leader dropped sharply in 2009 at the COP 15 summit in Copenhagen, but has climbed again in subsequent years. The results reveal a fragmented leadership landscape in which the EU must share or compete for leadership with other actors, such as the USA and China, who hold drastically different institutional design preferences and leadership visions than those promoted by the EU.

We hypothesise that timing should matter to poor land-users with limited options to save money in regions dominated by subsistence farming, seasonal fluctuations of food supply, and peaks in expenses during the year due to cultural events such as circumcisions and funeral ceremonies that occur in specific months. If land-users value payments differently at different time points throughout the year, the provision of ecosystem services can be increased for the given financial resources if payments are made at a point in time when land-users need those most. We conducted a choice experiment in the Mahafaly plateau in Southwestern Madagascar, an area which meets the aforementioned criteria, to test the importance of the time of receipt of payments. We found that respondents are willing to accept less money if they receive it in months of food shortage unlike if they receive it at the time of cultural events. We conclude that the cost-effectiveness of PES in regions with the above-mentioned characteristics can be increased by selecting the appropriate timing to pay ecosystem service providers.

We offer a contribution to this topic by providing a wider conceptualization of resilience and an innovative method of measuring it, borrowing from studies in other disciplines such as ecology, complexity science, and engineering. We focus on two important antecedents of ISN resilience, i.e., diversity at system and firm level and the ubiquity of wastes, on the basis of which we design a new method of measuring ISN resilience. This captures the extent to which the removal of a firm is critical for the ISN's survival. We test our resilience index on two real ISNs and compare it against other network-based measurement methods commonly adopted in the literature. Finally, we discuss the advantages of the new measurement procedure. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The study considers households located in different production systems which differ in geography, climate and soil types. These conditions affect technical efficiency and thus render analysis under the same production frontier as inadequate. For this reason, stochastic metafrontier techniques are preferred, allowing the estimation of technical efficiency within each production system and between production systems in relation to the sector as a whole. Results suggest that households in some production systems could be benefiting from better production conditions due to advantages in the availability of natural resources and climate as well as to more favorable socio-economic conditions. Additionally, we found that, in all systems, households with higher production have higher measures of technical efficiency. Thus, significant gains could be achieved in the sector through measures that contribute to improve the efficiency of households within their production systems and by policies that help reduce the technology gap in relation to the meta-frontier. These policies would bring positive impacts on the quality of life of small farmers and on the productivity of the sector.","[Alba Melo-Becerra, Ligia; Jose Orozco-Gallo, Antonio] Banco Republ, Bogota, Colombia",Banco de la Republica Colombia,"Melo-Becerra, LA (通讯作者)，Banco Republ, Bogota, Colombia.",Lmelobec@banrep.gov.co,"Melo-Becerra, Ligia Alba/C-7080-2017","Melo-Becerra, Ligia Alba/0000-0003-0895-9753",,,,,49,17,22,1,43,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

This study proposes five different scenarios to reduce the working hours of full-time employees by 20% with the aim of cutting greenhouse gas emissions: a three-day weekend, a free Wednesday, reduced daily hours, increased holiday entitlement and a scenario in which the time reduction is efficiently managed by companies to minimise their office space. We conceptually analyse the effects of each scenario on time use patterns through both business and worker activities, and how these might affect energy consumption in the economy. To assess which of the scenarios may be most effective in reducing carbon emissions, this analytical framework is applied as a case study for the United Kingdom. The results suggest that three of the five scenarios offer similar benefits, and are preferable to the other two, with a difference between the best and worst scenarios of 13.03 MTCO(2)e. The study concludes that there is a clear preference for switching to a four-day working week over other possible work-reduction policies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we examine divergence in stakeholders' preferences for forest attributes across the general public, private non-industrial forest owners and public and private forest officials in Sweden by conducting a discrete choice experiment. Our results indicate that citizens have a positive valuation of biodiversity protection. Moreover, their valuation is statistically significantly higher than those of forest owners. Interestingly, our results suggest that both forest owners and forest officials have a strong orientation towards production, with higher valuation than the general public of the common management practice of even aged stands and clear felling. Even though the Swedish Forestry Act regards production and environmental goals as equally important, we find that forest officials prefer management practices that promote production rather than biodiversity protection.

A spectral study of the moving window correlations gives significant information about the interactions between different financial indices. Eigenvalue spectra for each window is compared with the random matrix results on Wishart matrices. The upper side of the spectra outside the random matrix bound consists of the same number of eigenvalues for all windows where as significant differences can be seen in the lower side of the spectra. Analysis of the eigenvectors indicates that the second largest eigenvector clearly gives the sectors indicating the geographical location of each country i.e. the countries with geographical proximity giving similar contributions to the second largest eigenvector. The eigenvalues on the lower side of spectra outside the random matrix bounds changes before during and after the crisis.

(Europhys. Lett. 100 (2012) 66007). The number of extroverts, and introverts is N each. At each time step, we select an agent at random, and allow her to modify her state. If an extrovert is selected, she adds a link at random to an unconnected introvert. If an introvert is selected, she removes one of her links. The set of N-2 links evolves in time, and may be considered as a set of Ising spins on an N x N square-grid with single-spin-flip dynamics. This dynamics satisfies detailed balance condition, and the probability of different spin configurations in the steady state can be determined exactly. The effective hamiltonian has long-range multi-spin couplings that depend on the row and column sums of spins. If the relative bias of choosing an extrovert over anF introvert is varied, this system undergoes a phase transition from a state with very few links to one in which most links are occupied. We show that the behavior of the system can be determined exactly in the limit of large N. The behavior of large fluctuations in the total number of links near the phase transition is determined. We also discuss two variations, called egalitarian and elitist agents, when the agents preferentially add or delete links to their least/most-connected neighbor. These shows interesting cooperative behavior.","[Dhar, Deepak] Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Homi Bhabha Rd, Bombay, Maharashtra, India; [Bassler, Kevin E.] Univ Houston, Dept Phys, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Zia, R.

Fodder was considered as a biofuel for biological combustion in live work animals, i.e. draft horses, which convert the chemical energy of organic compounds of fodder into useful mechanical work for soil tillage. Consumption either of fodder or diesel fuel per unit of plowed land was multiplied with the purchase price of each fuel to project costs and compare cost effectiveness. The projections were calculated for two types of soil considering their easiness for tillage: medium light soil and heavy soil. In both projections (for the medium light soils and heavy soils), the fodder as a biofuel has shown a greater cost effectiveness due to consistently lower cost per unit of plowed land area. The fodder costs for plowing medium light soils were estimated between 34.78 HRK/ha and 90.61 HRK/ha, while the diesel fuel costs were estimated between 126.42 HRK/ha and 155.33 HRK/ha. Fodder costs for plowing heavy soils were estimated between 90.00 HRK/ha and 158.20 HRK/ha, while the diesel fuel costs were estimated between 287.63 HRK/ha and 363.09 HRK/ha. Projected variations of fodder costs per unit of plowed land area were due to expected variation of purchase price of fodders (meadow hay and oats), and variations in fodder consumption due to various horse breeds employed and nutrition management. Variations in diesel fuel costs per unit of plowed land area were due to different reported values of fuel consumption in the published researches. For the overall appraisal of economics of horse-powered work in agriculture, and for a more reliable comparison of the cost effectiveness between horse traction and diesel-engine powered traction, there should be considered horses' fixed costs too, like a fodder in idle days, depreciation, housing, shoeing, and veterinarian. Since the research results are based on literature published data for diesel fuel, and for fodder are based mainly on data collected by interviews, there appears a need to continue this research in field trials. This would provide exact measurements of work capacity and fodder consumption of working horses.","[Gantner, Ranko; Sumanovac, Luka; Zimmer, Domagoj; Ronta, Mario; Jaric, Danijel] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Agr, Vladimira Preloga 1, Osijek 31000, Croatia; [Glavas, Hrvoje] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Elect Engn Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Kneza Trpimira 2B, Osijek 31000, Croatia; [Ivanovic, Milan] PANON, Inst Strateg Studies NGO, Vijenac Ivana Mestrovica 19, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek; University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Gantner, R (通讯作者)，JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Agr, Vladimira Preloga 1, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",ranko.gantner@pfos.hr; luka.sumanovac@pfos.hr; domagoj.zimmer@pfos.hr; mario.ronta@pfos.hr; hrvoje.glavas@etfos.hr; panon.institut@gmail.com; jarokeksiricius@gmail.com,"Ronta, Mario/IST-1905-2023; Glavas, Hrvoje/ISV-0026-2023; Glavas, Hrvoje/B-9297-2017; Glavas, Hrvoje/AAC-1756-2020","Glavas, Hrvoje/0000-0002-3658-0364; Glavas, Hrvoje/0000-0002-3658-0364",,,,,13,0,0,0,3,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,618,625,,,,,,8,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500059,0

Design/methodology/approach - The study combines interview data to quantify volume and prices with produce sampling to quantify quality losses, and does this at four nodes of the tomato value chain in Nepal: farmers, collectors, wholesalers, and retailers to estimate volume and value of postharvest losses. Findings - Almost one-fourth of the total tomato harvest weight that enters the value chain is lost before it reaches consumers, and other one-fifth is traded by the value chain actors at reduced price due to quality damage. The total volume of postharvest loss (weight and quality loss) is not the same for all value chain actors and the average monetary loss ranges from 4 percent of gross revenues for farmers to 12 percent for wholesalers. Practical implications - A standard method to account for both physical weight losses and quality losses of horticultural produce is lacking in estimates of the monetary value of postharvest losses for horticultural crops. Knowing such losses is essential for postharvest technology generation, promotion, and adoption. This study provides a framework that can be adopted and improved in future loss assessment studies for estimating the volume and value of postharvest losses in a horticultural value chain. Originality/value - The uniqueness of the method used in this study is that it combines interview data to estimate price and volume with produce sampling to quantify quality losses, and does this at four nodes of the value chain: farmers, collectors, wholesalers, and retailers. This method could become a standard approach for assessment of postharvest weight and quality losses and to estimate the monetary value of total postharvest losses in the value chain for horticultural crops.","[Gautam, Shriniwas] World Vegetable Ctr, Bangkok, Thailand; [Acedo, Antonio L., Jr.] World Vegetable Ctr, Postharvest Value Chain Program Asia, Bangkok, Thailand; [Schreinemachers, Pepijn] World Vegetable Ctr, Impact Evaluat, Bangkok, Thailand; [Subedi, Bhishma P.] ANSAB, Kathmandu, Nepal",,"Gautam, S (通讯作者)，World Vegetable Ctr, Bangkok, Thailand.",s.gautam@cgiar.org,"Acedo, Antonio/AAX-4639-2021","Gautam, Shriniwas/0000-0002-4802-8032",,,,,23,5,5,0,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - With survey data obtained from university students (n = 267), structural equation modeling is used to assess relationships between four types of consumer concerns about the genetic modification of food, fear and anger, and two types of consumer responses to GM food products. Findings - Intentions to make complaints about GM foods are increased by anger, but reduced by fear. Readiness to use GMfoods is reduced by fear, but not by anger. Fear is strengthened by health-related concerns, while anger is strengthened by market-related concerns associated with the genetic modification of food. Research limitations/implications - The generalizability of the findings is limited by the student sample. The study confirms the applicability of cognitive appraisal theories of emotion in the context of GM food consumption. The findings help GM food marketers and societal opinion influencers to identify consumers' concerns that need to be addressed to manage consumers' antagonistic or avoiding emotion-driven responses to GM foods. Originality/value - This study is the first to show that discrete emotions of the same negative valence have distinct effects on consumer acceptance of GM foods, and to distinguish substantive concerns that in particular foster fear and anger in the GM food context.","[Immonen, Aino-Maria] Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ & Management, Helsinki, Finland; [Luomala, Harri Tuomas] Univ Vaasa, Dept Mkt, Seinajoki, Finland",University of Helsinki; University of Vaasa,"Immonen, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ & Management, Helsinki, Finland.",aino.m.immonen@gmail.com,,,,,,,43,1,1,2,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - A financial incentive and a deterrent pricing tactic was tested using an online quantitative approach with a sample of 400 Canadian parents, representative of the Canadian population based on geography, household income and education level. Findings - The financial incentive tactic demonstrated that a strong and clearly articulated monetary discount can shift the stated purchase intent of parents into an increased number choosing a healthier side dish for a child's fast food meal. A deterrent pricing approach was shown to also shift stated purchase intent, and had a higher consumer impact on a per dollar basis. Younger parents (< 35 years old) were more likely to select healthier side dishes for their child; however, parents of all ages could potentially be influenced through motivational pricing approaches.

Design/methodology/approach - A purposely developed questionnaire was administered to 300 randomly selected youths of age between 18 and 30 years. The first part of the questionnaire sought information on socio-demographic profile, whereas the second part of the questionnaire had questions related to consumers' perception of importance, their reading behavior, and their responses on the information content of food labels. Appropriate statistical tools were used to analyze the data. Findings - Results revealed that young Indian consumers attached considerable importance to the food labels and read it before making a final purchase decision. In addition to price, all the product attributes which had implications for the consumers' health were considered as extremely important by the young consumers. Information regarding different important product attributes can be broadly clubbed in two categories, namely, product specification and product quality. The final decision to purchase a product based on the food labels varied significantly based on the consumers' gender, age, food habit, and residential locality. Research limitations/implications - Nature of study does not allow drawing a conclusion regarding the causal relationship between food labels and consumers' purchase decisions. Originality/value - As labeling regulation is a comparatively recent phenomenon in India, study of the usage and influence of food labels on young consumers' purchase decision, a hitherto not much-studied subject, will contribute significantly to the literature on food labels.","[Kumar, Niraj] Xavier Inst Management, Rural Management, Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India; [Kapoor, Sanjeev] India Inst Management, Ctr Food & Agribusiness Management, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Lucknow,"Kumar, N (通讯作者)，Xavier Inst Management, Rural Management, Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India.",niraj@ximb.ac.in,,,,,,,46,52,58,2,53,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

(2001) estimate 3.5 million cases of foodborne illness in the USA annually are associated with inadequate cooking of animal foods or cross-contamination from these foods. Past research shows home food handling practices can be risk factors for foodborne illness. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the communication of food safety guidance, specifically safe endpoint temperatures and cross-contamination risk reduction practices, in popular cookbook recipes. Design/methodology/approach - Recipes containing raw animal ingredients in 29 popular cookbooks were evaluated through content analysis for messages related to safe endpoint temperature recommendations and reducing cross-contamination risks. Findings - Of 1,749 recipes meeting study criteria of cooking raw animal ingredients, 1,497 contained a raw animal that could effectively be measured with a digital thermometer. Only 123 (8.2 percent) of these recipes included an endpoint temperature, of which 89 (72.3 percent) gave a correct temperature. Neutral and positive food safety behavior messages were provided in just 7.2 percent (n = 126) and 5.1 percent (n = 90) of recipes, respectively. When endpoint temperatures were not included, authors often provided subjective and risky recommendations. Research limitations/implications - Further research is needed on the effect of these results on consumer behavior and to develop interventions for writing recipes with better food safety guidance. Practical implications - Including correct food safety guidance in cookbooks may increase the potential of reducing the risk of foodborne illness. Originality/value - Popular cookbooks are an underutilized avenue for communicating safe food handling practices and currently cookbook authors are risk amplifiers.","[Levine, Katrina; Chapman, Benjamin] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Human Sci, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Chaifetz, Ashley] Food & Nutr Serv, Off Policy Support, USDA, Alexandria, VA USA",North Carolina State University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Levine, K (通讯作者)，North Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Human Sci, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",kblevine@ncsu.edu,"Chapman, Benjamin/E-2807-2014","Chapman, Benjamin/0000-0002-1686-700X",Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2012-68003-30155],Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture,Chapman and Levine were supported by Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant No. 2012-68003-30155 from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

The power law exponent for Europe is close to that of the world and indicates a Zipf distribution. We also find that the theoretical share price and fundamentals estimated using a panel regression model hold to a power law at the regional level. A panel regression in which share price is the dependent variable and dividends per share, cash flow per share, and book value per share are explanatory variables identifies the two-way fixed effects model as the best model for all regions.

Research based models which objectively measures the brand strength are important, since brands are believed to be strong influencers of critical business outcomes, such as sales and market share. Furthermore, strong brands help in creating greater loyalty and less vulnerability to competitive marketing actions and decrease elastic responses to price. Examples of brand metrics i.e. brand pyramid, brand strength, brand equity etc. like many other constructs; have been defined and measured in numerous ways. It is sometimes identified with tangible financial assets of a firm. However, from a marketing research perspective, brand metrics are often viewed conceptually as a framework for understanding the power of the intellectual and emotional associations consumers have with particular named products and services. In contrast to the absolute financial valuation, marketing researchers seek to measure and understand brand strength for strategic positioning and planning. Especially so in FMCG industry, since production companies can be observed as one of the main drivers of regional performance and development. The aim of this paper is to provide a theoretical framework for understanding the key concepts related to the brand metrics segment and to help create a clearer picture of Eastern Croatia production brands strength. Except secondary data from the available literature and previous research, for the purpose of this analysis, backdate of 4 research waves through 2 years (2 waves per year 2015 and 2016) were used. All of those conducted on a representative, random sample of Croatian citizens older than 15 years, (n=2.000 per wave, in total 8.000 respondents), examining (as a part of a wider study) brand strength of FMCG producers in Croatia. Special focus will be on brand strength position of production brands in Eastern Croatia in comparison to other regions in Croatia. Understanding brand metrics in combination with attitudes of the respondents with regard to observed socio-demographic characteristics of the sample can be crucial for strategic planning of regional development.","[Mrcela, Dajana] Saponia Dd, Osijek 31000, Croatia; [Mikrut, Martina] Fac Law Osijek, Osijek 31000, Croatia; [Ham, Marija] Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek; University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Mrcela, D (通讯作者)，Saponia Dd, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",dajana.mrcela@saponia.hr; martina.mikrut@pravos.hr; mham@efos.hr,"Ham, Marija/AAC-3577-2022","Ham, Marija/0000-0003-4390-2218",,,,,8,0,0,1,6,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,909,917,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500088,0

The survey reveals that the vast majority of adults in Great Britain (82%) have regretted a purchase in the past. Post-purchase regret is shown to be particularly prevalent for clothing & footwear and takeaway food. The tendency to regret purchases appears to reduce with age and to be more common amongst white collar rather than blue collar workers. Combining survey results with average price estimates gives an estimated, aggregate, annual expenditure on regretted purchases of 5-25bn, equivalent to 2-10% of annual consumer spending on goods in Great Britain. These findings are interesting because they suggest that there is a degree of self-assessed over-consumption that, if reduced, could help to reduce pressures on the environment. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Only when obtaining that information, we can start a serious and responsible stock trade. We often hear how investment advisers and experts advocate collecting as many relevant information as possible, before coming to an investment decision, but ironically don't advise how to come to a decision from the collected information. From this it ca be) concluded that investing is actually more art than not science, and that the true value of a stock can be revealed through inspired intuition. The market price of a stock is not always its fair price, a great interest for a stock can rise its price too high only to drop it too low. This paper explains and suggests how to determine the real, i.e. normal value of a stock. To determine that value, this paper considers certain stock valuation methods and their interrelationship with thefirm valuation methods. Information on overvaluation and undervaluation of afirm's stock on the market can be provided by composite indicator[(C(hm)] whose structure and role are discussed in this paper. The value of the indicator refers the potential investor to an appropriate stock market move. It's important to mention that this paper approaches the stock evaluation as an ideal segment of a firm. The quality of firm's business and its potentials are often strong indicators of the stock value in long term. This paper also includes a relatively unknown firm valuation method, the Compounded Cash Flow method (CCF). Combined with the usual methods, it provides a more precise firm evaluation, i.e. more precise stock evaluation. The goal of this paper is to show the possibilities of a thorough and comprehensive stock value analysis with an endto choose a suitable moment to sell or to buy on the stock market.","[Speranda, Ivo] Univ Dubrovnik, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Lapadska Obala 7, Dubrovnik, Croatia; [Piplica, Damir] Univ Dept Profess Studies Split, Kopilica 5, Split, Croatia",University of Dubrovnik; University of Split,"Speranda, I (通讯作者)，Univ Dubrovnik, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Lapadska Obala 7, Dubrovnik, Croatia.",ivo.speranda@unidu.hr; damir.piplica@gmail.com,"Piplica, Damir/ABF-4587-2020",,,,,,9,0,0,0,2,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,1164,1173,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500114,0

Historical site Erdutska kula (The Tower of Erdut) is a monument once belonging to category zero, and now according to the new classification of monumental heritage it is a monument of A category. It is one of the major tourist attractions of the whole region. Domestic and foreign visitors come on a daily basis to visit the tower and admire the landscape which can be seen from its viewpoint. Besides the tower, there is an old castle in Erdut, the Manor of Counts Adamovich-Cseh, which together with Erdut wine cellars and winery from the 17th century also presents a significant part of the tourist offerings. Within the Erdut winery there are facilities for receiving tourists with overnight stays, a complete gastronomical offering, and facilities for recreation, a walking path and tennis courts. Besides these facilities which are partially in function, there are findings and archaeological sites still not sufficiently explored which would also significantly contribute to Erdut's tourist offerings. The findings which are registered and located in the settlement of Erdut are prehistoric site Mali Varod, Veliki Varod and Zarkovac, and prehistoric site Stari prkos and Kremenusa. Registered archaeological sites in the settlement of Erdut are medieval site Centar naselja and prehistoric site Orasje. There is also a protected area of nature, the significant landscape of Erdut, with an area of 160 hectares. Furthermore, there are elements of sacral monumental heritage, a Roman Catholic Church of All Saints and Orthodox Church of St. Archangel Gabriel. The Erdut Agreement on Peaceful Reintegration of the Occupied Part of the Croatian Danube Region was signed in Erdut on 12 November 1995. The goal of the paper is to present the potential of the village of Erdut, considering its valuable monumental heritage, ethnic values and unexplored archaeological sites, in order to include it in the program of rural and regional development with significant potential for development of cultural and sacral offers of continental tourism. However, the Conservation Department in Osijek and the Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments should urgently implement revitalization of the Tower of Erdut in order not to collapse. Since it is not protected, it deteriorates on a daily basis and this is also a threat for visitors because a brick or a piece of building material can suddenly fall off during a visit. Furthermore, it is necessary to conduct a revitalization of the castle, the Manor of Counts Adamovich-Cseh, and also to initiate the activities for exploration of archaeological sites and prehistoric finds. If the revitalization of the buildings was started and put into function, a complete tourist offer would be achieved, thus increasing the interest of visitors from home and abroad. This would increase employment and stop the departure of entire families from the village of Erdut.","[Tonkovic, Anka Masek; Krizanovic, Katica] Fac Econ, Trg Ljudevita Gaja 7, Osijek, Croatia; [Veckie, Vlad Walter] Unified Engn Corp CEO, Hamilton, ON, Canada",,"Tonkovic, AM (通讯作者)，Fac Econ, Trg Ljudevita Gaja 7, Osijek, Croatia.",masek.efos@gmail.com; katica.krizanovic@gmail.com; veckie@gmail.com,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,2,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,90,99,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500007,0

Although financial issues have been recognized as an important factor in deciding to migrate, psychological and social factors also significantly shape intention and motivation for emigration and should be explored in more detail. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between various indicators of human and social capital and subjective quality of life among young professionals from Osijek-Baranja County and their emigration intentions. Presented research is part of the Project: Role of the subjective quality of life in young people intention for regional or international emigration, funded by University J.J. Strossmayer in Osijek. This topic is particularly pertinent for this university, because as a leading education authority in eastern Croatia, it provides education for a large number of students, developing future experts that can potentially contribute to improvement of the regional and national economy. In this paper, various human and social capital indicators of Osijek-Baranja County are presented. Results indicate a significant connection between social capital and subjective well-being, although various social capital indicators correlate differently with subjective quality of life. Identifying aspects of quality of life and of social and human capital that are connected with emigration intention will contribute to understanding of this important issue.","[Vuletic, Gorka; Erdesi, Josipa] Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Lorenza Jagera 9, Osijek 31000, Croatia; [Misajon, RoseAnne] Cairnmillar Inst, 993 Burke Rd, Camberwell, Vic 3124, Australia",,"Vuletic, G (通讯作者)，Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Lorenza Jagera 9, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",gvuletic@ffos.hr; erdesi.josipa@gmail.com; roseanne.misajon@gmail.com,"Vuletic, Gorka/AAT-1414-2020","Vuletic, Gorka/0000-0002-6804-6860",,,,,27,1,1,0,3,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,442,452,,,,,,11,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500042,0
